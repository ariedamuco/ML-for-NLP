   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   First of all, in response to the Senator from Minnesota, I was a little bit amused at the use of the words ``blatant hypocrisy.'' I don't question his use of those words at all. But the fact is that this bill passed with 83 Senators voting for it. It passed the Senate and went to conference. Three-fourths of the members of his caucus voted for this legislation. If there is blatant hypocrisy, it is very bipartisan hypocrisy.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, second, the interest in this legislation and the reason this is such an important piece of legislation is that there is a lot of understanding at the grassroots of America that it is immoral and unethical for people with the ability and the means to repay some of their debt to go into bankruptcy court and be discharged of that debt. 
   It is particularly wrong when it hurts the very same low-income and middle-income people about whom the Senator from Minnesota talks. They have to pay $400 more per family per year for goods and services. They pay a higher fee or price because somebody else isn't paying their bills. That is not going to be absorbed by the business in most cases; it is going to be passed on to the consumer. 
   On the basis of ability to pay, particularly for the necessities of life of food and clothing and things of that nature, it is going to hurt the low-income people and middle-income people of America disproportionately because somebody else isn't paying their bills. There is an understanding at the grassroots of America that this just isn't right. That is why this legislation has such overwhelming support. 
   I refer to this chart because it has letters from my constituents. I bet the Senators from Minnesota and other States are getting letters from their constituents saying the same thing. 
   We have a letter from a constituent of mine in Des Moines who says:  
   It is insane that such practice has been allowed to continue causing higher prices to consumers. Debtors should be required to pay their debts.  
   A constituent from Keokuk, IA:  
   Bankruptcies are out of hand. It is time to make people responsible for their actions. Do we need to say this? 
   In other words, it is unconscionable to that constituent that we would have a situation with 1.4 million bankruptcies in America, with the number doubling in 5 or 6 years, at a time when we have the best economic growth in our Nation. 
   Another constituent:  
   We need to make more people responsible for their savings while at the same time protecting those who fall on hard times. I realize this is a delicate balance. But the way it is now, there is very little change going this route.  
   This bill is a very delicate balance. That is why it passed with 83 votes. It also preserves what this constituent said in the letter. She understands that there are some people who go into debt through no fault of their own. And for the 100-year history of the bankruptcy code of the United States, we have recognized that certain people may be in hard times through no fault of their own and they are entitled to a fresh start. This allows that fresh start. But, at the same time for those who have the ability to repay, it sends a clear signal to not go into bankruptcy court because you are not going to get off scot-free anymore. 
   Another constituent from Fontanelle, IA, says:  
   People need to be more responsible for their debts. As a small business owner, I have had to withstand several large bills people have left with me due to their poor management and bankruptcy.  
   That may be a small business person who, unlike a lot of corporations, cannot pass on this $400 per family in additional costs for goods and services because somebody else isn't paying their bills. This person may be so small that they have to absorb those costs unfairly and may be putting their own business in jeopardy. 
   Another constituent from Cedar Rapids:  
   Bankruptcy reform will force the American people to become more responsible for their actions. Bankruptcy does not seem to carry any degree of shame. It is almost regarded as a right or entitlement.  
   If it has become a right or entitlement, the statistics of the last 6 or 7 years show an increase of about 700,000 to 1.4 million. It is an example maybe of some additional people in America seeing it as a way to manage their finances. It becomes a financial management tool for some. 
   Another constituent from Waverly, IA:  
   Many don't think the business is who loses. We make it too easy now.  
   A constituent from Washington, IA:  
   The present bankruptcy laws are a joke. One local man has declared bankruptcy at least four times at the expense of suppliers to him. He just laughs at it.  
   There is a person who quite obviously figured out the ease of using bankruptcy as a financial planning tool.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. I am glad the Senator from Vermont pointed out the many compromises that were made to accommodate the President and to accommodate Democrats in the Senate. He did not say this, but there were also a lot of changes made to accommodate Republicans. But he pointed out that we have two issues on which we disagree. That is what the Senator from Vermont said. I do not think that Senators should vote against this bill over two issues which are not central to the concept of bankruptcy reform. 
   I was disappointed, however, in his comments on the process. He referred to a very unusual process. I confess that it was a very unusual process by  which this bill was conferenced and got to the Senate floor. But I think I heard him say something about Democrats not being consulted. There was a 3-3 ratio on this conference. Normally there would not be a 3-3 ratio; there would probably be one more Republican than Democrat. But because of Senator Coverdell's death, it ended up on this conference there were three Republicans and three Democrats. So the point is, we would not be here today if it were not for help from Democrats, even in conference. 
   I only say that because the Senator from Vermont is a friend of mine. He is very strongly opposed to this legislation. But I thought I ought to point out the fact that there are those small, insignificant modifications of his comments that I thought I ought to make. Whether he would consider those clarifications or not, that is his judgment. But I want them on the record for my point of view. 
   I also address an issue raised by Senator LEAHY. Some have stated that the bankruptcy conference report should be opposed on the grounds that it does not contain a provision that would prevent abortion protesters from using bankruptcy as a way to get out of paying debt arising as a result of violence or intimidation at abortion clinics. 
   On this issue, I draw my Senator's attention--in other words, the attention of the Senator from Vermont--to a memo prepared by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. 
   This memo--which I will provide to any Senator who wants to see it, and I will include it in the Record--concludes that not one single abortion protester has ever used bankruptcy in this way. I repeat, according to the Congressional Research Service, a truly nonpartisan resource, no one has ever used bankruptcy to skip out on debts arising from violence or intimidation at an abortion clinic. 
   This issue, of course, is a red herring. It has been put forth by people who flat out oppose needed bankruptcy reform as a way of defeating this legislation. There is absolutely no merit to their argument. 
   I hope people will see it for what it is--an empty political ploy. I hope Senators will see through this political ploy and support the bankruptcy conference report. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD the memo from the Congressional Research Office.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. No, I do not want to wrap up. I would like to have permission to interrupt the Senator, and for him not to lose the right to the floor. I would like to say something for 30 seconds on the bill, if I could. 
   There has been a report since early today about the White House, or personnel at the White House, calling Democrats who have always supported this bill to vote against it. I am not sure I know exactly why the White House is calling and saying that, but I presume it is because they would like to have fewer folks than the two-thirds we had on the cloture to override a veto, if the President would veto this bill. I don't know that the President would veto it. I know there are a lot of people at the White House who would like to have him veto it. 
   I say to those Democrats who have voted and supported this legislation so much over the last 3 years, particularly on that 83-14 vote by which it passed, I hope they will not respond to that kind of pressure from the White House. I hope they know Chuck Grassley well enough to know that if I had voted for a bill in the Reagan administration or the Bush administration, three or four times, and a President Reagan or his staff, or a President Bush or his staff, called me up and asked me to change my mind just to protect the President, if I would do it--I would not do it. I hope they would not do it. 
   I return the floor to the Senator from Alabama.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Certainly. The following is what H.R. 2415 does: 
   H.R. 2415 
   Background and Need for the Legislation 
   The bankruptcy system is currently in a state of crisis. In recent years, America has witnessed a dramatic explosion in the number of bankruptcy filings. According to statistics from the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, bankruptcies have exploded from 331,000 in 1980 to just under 1.4 million in 1999. It is a matter of serious concern to Congress that the explosion in bankruptcy comes at a time of unprecedented prosperity, with low unemployment and high wages. Unemployment is at an all-time low. Consumer confidence has been high and the Dow Jones Industrial Average at one point rose above the 10,000 mark. Thus, the high rate of bankruptcy filings cannot reasonably be attributed to a slow economy. 
   This state of crisis has a significant negative impact on the American economy. According to the Department of Justice, creditors lose 3.22 billion dollars annually as a result of Chapter 7 bankruptcies filed by individuals who could repay their debts. Obviously, the existence of multi-billion dollar losses attributable to high levels of bankruptcy filings is a clarion call for Congress to reform our bankruptcies laws to require bankrupts who could repay some portion of their debts to do so. 
   Given the strong performance of the economy, many feel that the recent explosion in personal bankruptcy filings is at least partly attributable to the decreased moral stigma associated with declaring bankruptcy. See Testimony of Professor Todd Zywicki, Joint Hearing of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts and the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law, March 11, 1999; Testimony of Tahira Hira, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts Hearing, ``S. 1301, The Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act: Seeking Fair and Practical Solutions to the Consumer Bankruptcy Crisis'' (March 11, 1998); Testimony of Kenneth R. Crone, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts Hearing, ``The Increase in Personal Bankruptcy and the Crisis in Consumer Credit,'' (April 11, 1997); Lee Flint, ``Bankruptcy Policy: Toward a Moral Justification for Financial Rehabilitation of Consumer Debt,'' 48 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 515 (1991); David Gross and Nicholas Souleses, ``Explaining the Increase in Bankruptcy and Delinquency: Stigma Versus Risk-Competition'' (Preliminary, 1998); F.H. Buckley and Margaret F. Brinig, ``The Bankruptcy Puzzle,'' 27 J. Legal Stud. (1998). 
   In the view of many in Congress, a decreased moral stigma associated with bankruptcy means that filing for bankruptcy is no longer viewed as a last resort reserved for financially troubled Americans who have no other option but to seek debt forgiveness. As Americans become accustomed to high levels of consumer bankruptcy, it is only natural that declaring bankruptcy has lost much of the shame previously associated with it. Individuals who would have struggled to meet  their financial obligations in the past are filing bankruptcy today in record numbers. See Judge Edith H. Jones and Todd J. Zywicki, ``It's Time for Means Testing,'' 1999 B.Y.U. L. Rev. 177. For example, recent studies suggest that almost half of filers learned about their option to file for bankruptcy from friends or family. See, e.g., Vern McKinley, ``Ballooning Bankruptcies: Issuing Blame for the Explosive Growth,'' Regulation, Fall 1997, at 38. At the same time, there have been strong expressions of concern from the Federal Trade Commission that attorney advertising is leading consumers to file bankruptcy without being fully informed. 
   It is the strong view of the Congress that the Bankruptcy Code's generous, no-questions-asked policy of providing complete debt forgiveness under Chapter 7 without serious consideration of a bankrupt's ability to repay is deeply flawed and encourages a lack of personal responsibility. 
   Both H.R. 833 and its Senate counterpart S. 625 proposed amendments to section 707(b) of the Bankruptcy Code to require bankruptcy judges to dismiss a Chapter 7 case, or convert a Chapter 7 case to another chapter if a bankrupt has a demonstrable capacity to repay his or her debts. HR 2415 maintains the section 707(b) structure. In general, the agreement embodied in HR 2415 used S. 625 as the base for the means test. Like S. 625, a presumption arises that a Chapter 7 bankrupt should be dismissed from bankruptcy or converted to another chapter if, after taking into account secured debts and priority debts as well as living expenses, the bankrupt can repay over 5 years the lesser of 25 percent or more of his or her general nonpriority unsecured debts (but at least $6,000), or $10,000. This test requires those with greater debts to pay proportionately more than those with smaller debts. For example, the cases of debtors whose unsecured, nonpriority debts are over $100,000 will be dismissed under the means test (absent ``special circumstances'' discussed later) if their projected ability to pay over 5 years is over $10,000, even though that is considerably less than 25% of their debt. Conversely, the cases of debtors whose debts in that category are less than $36,000 will only be dismissed under the means test if their projected ability to repay over 5 years is over $6,000, permitting debtors in this category to remain in chapter 7 even though they have the ability to repay a percentage of their unsecured, nonpriority debts considerably greater than 25%. The debtor can rebut this presumption only by demonstrating ``special circumstances'' that would clearly demonstrate that the bankrupt in fact does not have a meaningful ability to repay his or her debts. It is not intended that the ``special circumstances'' category will be interpreted broadly to allow bankrupts to avoid repayment of financial obligations for reasons unrelated to finances, income or expenses. Therefore, the presumption of abuse may only be rebutted, first on a demonstration that the increases in spending or decreases in income arise directly from ``special circumstances'' and are justified by those circumstances, second, that they are reasonable and necessary, and, third, that there is no reasonable alternative to the expense or income adjustment. For example, if a loss of income occurred because a debtor voluntarily elected to waive a bequest or otherwise reduce income, there would be a reasonable alternative to the reduction because the debtor could have not elected, even though there may have been good reasons to do so. Moreover, the kind of ``special circumstances'' Congress intended would not be present to justify the adjustment, nor would it be reasonable and necessary. Therefore, the additional adjustment to income would not be allowed. Proof that the debtor permitted the reduction in an attempt to avoid payment of creditors or other inappropriate intent is not necessary, and a significant burden is on the debtor to justify the adjustment. 
   On the other hand, if the debtor was a well paid medical doctor who prior to bankruptcy changed from a demanding private practice requiring 80 hours a week to a significantly less well-paid research staff position with regular nine to five hours in order to have more time to assist in the care of a seriously disabled child, there would clearly be ``special circumstances'' which justified the adjustment, the income reduction would be reasonable and necessary, and the special relationship of parent and child would clearly lead to the conclusion that there was no reasonable alternative to the adjustment. 
   General Overview of the Current Consumer Bankruptcy System 
   Under current law, individuals considering bankruptcy often proceed under Chapter 7, where the bankrupt will surrender all assets which do not qualify for an exemption to a bankruptcy trustee. The bankruptcy trustee then sells the bankrupt's property and distributes the proceeds to the creditors. Any deficiency which remains after the sale of these assets is simply erased (or ``discharged''), and the bankrupt cannot be required to repay debts which have been erased during bankruptcy. Chapter 7, often referred to as ``straight bankruptcy,'' is the oldest and most commonly used type of bankruptcy proceeding. 
   Individuals may also declare bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. Chapter 13 provides for the development of a repayment plan that allows a debtor to repay some portion of his or her debts. At the end of the repayment period, the unpaid portion of debt is erased, and a debtor cannot be required to repay the unpaid portion of the discharged debt. Unlike Chapter 7, the purpose of Chapter 13 is to rehabilitate financially-troubled consumers by using future earnings to repay debts in exchange for a discharge of the unpaid portions of those debts. Two other chapters are also available to individual debtors, but are only rarely used by consumers. Chapter 11, usually used by those with significant assets, permits a debtor to negotiate a plan of reorganization of the debtor's financial affairs with creditors, and in some instances force that plan or unwilling creditors. A discharge is available when the plan is confirmed. Chapter 12 is available for family farmers. 
   Earlier Reform Efforts To Reduce Consumer Bankruptcy Abuse 
   The idea of requiring bankrupts to repay their debts when they have the ability to do so is not new. This topic has been the subject of many proposed amendments, from the early 1930s to the current Congress. S. 625 is merely an extension of this longstanding effort to ensure that bankruptcy is reserved for those truly in need of debt forgiveness. See Oversight Hearing on Personal Bankruptcy, Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Monopolies and Commercial Law, 97th Cong. 2nd Sess., (1982). 
   The general structure of the present federal Bankruptcy Code is the result of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. 95-598. The 1978 Act was the first major overhaul and attempt to update comprehensively the bankruptcy law since passage of the Chandler Act in 1938. 52 Stat. 840 (1938). Prior to the Chandler Act, individuals in serious financial trouble usually had no choice but to file for ``straight bankruptcy'' under Chapter VII, a proceeding similar to present Chapter 7 under the Bankruptcy Code. However, the Chandler Act provided small debtors a new, alternative procedure, the Chapter XIII Wage Earner's Plan, which allowed an individual to retain nonexempt assets by proposing a plan to pay his or her existing debts from future income, after which the wage earner would receive a discharge of any unpaid balances of his debts. See generally, Dvoret, ``Federal Legislation, Bankruptcy Under the Chandler Act: Background,'' 27 Geo. L.J. 194 (1938). 
   The debate over Chapter XIII occurred years earlier in joint hearings before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees in 1932, during the Seventy-Second Congress. By the time it was enacted in 1938, Chapter XIII codified informal practices which had developed without explicit statutory authorization. In the mid 1930's in Birmingham, Alabama a former special referee in bankruptcy, Valentine Nesbitt, first developed a ``repayment option'' which was the model for Chapter XIII. See Weinstein, The Bankruptcy Law of 1938 (1938). 
   In 1932, Congress conducted hearings on S. 3866. Section 75 of this bill would have established a repayment plan for wage earners. Section 75 provided a method for an indebted wage earner to come into court without being labeled ``a bankrupt,'' and get the benefit of a court injunction to fend off creditors while the wage earner arranged to repay his pre-bankruptcy debts in installments. Section 75, with certain modifications, eventually became Chapter XIII, enacted in 1938 as part of the Chandler Act. 
   Since the 1938 amendments, there have been several proposals to limit bankruptcy relief to those who lack genuine repayment capacity. In the 1960s, Congress considered several such proposals. See H.R. 12784, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. (1964); H.R. 292, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965); S. 613, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965); H.R. 1057 & H.R. 5771, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967). Under these proposals, an individual debtor seeking relief under the liquidation provisions of the bankruptcy laws would be denied relief if the court concluded that he or she could pay substantial amounts of debt out of future earnings under a Chapter XIII plan. 
   Importantly, one of these proposals, S. 613, was introduced by Senator Albert Gore, Sr., the father of the current Vice President. When he introduced S. 613, Senator Gore indicated that Chapter 7 resembled a special interest tax loophole, which the wealthy could use to avoid paying their fair share. Senator Gore, Sr. also commented on the moral consequences of a lax bankruptcy system: 
   ``I realize that we cannot legislate morals, but we, as responsible legislators, must bear the responsibility of writing laws which discourage immorality and encourage morality; which encourage honesty and discourage deadbeating; which make the path of the social malingerer and shirker sufficiently unpleasant to persuade him at least to investigate the way of the honest man.''--Cong. Rec. 905, January 19, 1965. 
   Given the current bankruptcy crisis, Senator Gore's words from over 30 years ago seem prescient. 
   Following the 1978 amendments, in the early 1980s, Senator Dole introduced S. 2000 during in the 97th Congress. In the House of Representatives, Congressman Evans introduced H.R. 4786, which eventually garnered 269 co-sponsors. Congress did not pass either proposal in the 97th Congress, so these measure were reintroduced in the 98th Congress as H.R. 1169 and S. 445. As a result of these efforts, Congress created Section 707(b) of the Bankruptcy Code in 1984 to allow judges to dismiss Chapter 7 cases if granting relief would constitute a ``substantial abuse'' of the Bankruptcy Code. Pub. Law 105-165. The focus of the effort was to require bankrupts who had the ability to pay a significant percentage of their debts ``without difficulty''  to proceed under Chapter 13 instead of Chapter 7. However, the term ``substantial abuse'' was not defined and creditors and trustees were expressly forbidden from presenting evidence to a judge that granting relief in a particular case would result in a ``substantial abuse.'' 
   Despite Congress' intent that section 707(b) would control inappropriate use of chapter 7 by those with ability to pay, that section has not been effective. Although many factors are at work, much of the reason for this ineffectiveness has been the ingrained point of view that ``honest'' debtors have a ``right'' to a chapter 7 discharge even when they have ability to pay. To illustrate, the Fourth Circuit has taken a ``totality of the circumstances'' approach to determining whether there is substantial abuse. In re Green, 934 F.2d 568 (4th Cir. 1991)(a ``totality of circumstances'' test is appropriate when deciding section 707(b) cases in which ability to repay can be outweighed by other factors, like the debtor's good faith or honesty). Some bankruptcy judges have taken the totality of the circumstances approach suggested by In re Green as a justification for either ignoring ability to pay completely, or doing so in effect. See In re Adams, 209 B.R. 874 (Bankr. M.D. Tenn. 1997)(Paine, J.)(honest debtor with ability to repay cannot be dismissed from chapter 7); In re Braley, 103 B.R. 758 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1989)(Bonney, J.). Other Circuit Courts have disagreed and insisted that debtors with ability to pay must do so. In re Kelley, 841 F.2d 908 (9th Cir. 1988); In re Walton, 866 F. 2d 981 (8th Cir. 1989); United States Trustee v. Harris, 960 F.2d 74 (8th Cir. 1992); In re Koch, 109 F. 3d 1285 (8th Cir. 1997); In re Lamanna, 153 F. 3d 1 (1st Cir. 1998). A few bankruptcy courts have followed the direction of these Circuit Courts, In re Shelley, 231 B.R. 317 (Bankr. D. Neb. 1999)(Minahan, Jr. J.); In re Cox, 2000 Bankr. Lexis 571 (Bankr. N.D. Fla., May 16, 2000). 
   It was this evidence which led Congress to conclude that the complete overhaul of section 707(b) was necessary, with clear, non-discretionary requirements imposed on the bankruptcy court to reject the notion that debtors were entitled to a discharge as a matter of right without regard to their ability to pay and to assure that in practice those with ability to pay would not be entitled to chapter 7 relief. In the 105th Congress, the House passed HR 3150 and the Senate passed S. 1301, two bills which would have inserted means-testing in section 707(b). A Conference Committee reconciled the two bills and produced a Conference Report (H. Rep. 105-794) which passed the House at the end of the 105th Congress but was never voted on in the Senate. Senate Report 105-253 provides the legislative history of S. 1301. House Report 105-540 provides the legislative History of HR 3150. 
   The Current Legislation 
   HR 2415 is the culmination of these efforts and is intended to both remove unequivocally the bankruptcy court's discretion with regard to whether a debtor with ability to pay should be dismissed from chapter 7, and to restrict as much as possible reliance upon judicial discretion to determine the debtor's ability to pay. Limited judicial discretion remains to deal with the hardship case, but that discretion is not to be abused by lax enforcement of the standards in HR 2415. 
   Section 102 of HR 2415 provides that a Chapter 7 case will be presumed to be an ``abuse'' of Chapter 7 if the debtor has the ability to repay, in a 5-year repayment plan, 25% of the debtor's nonpriority unsecured claims (but not less than $6,000), or $10,000, whichever is less. For purposes of determining the debtor's repayment ability, section 102 provides that the debtor's monthly expenses shall be applicable monthly expenses under standards issued by the Internal Revenue Service (``IRS'') for the area in which the debtor resides. The IRS standards applicable under section 102 are the IRS ``National Standards,'' ``Local Standards,'' and certain categories of ``Other Necessary Expenses'' which are specifically listed in the Standards. These Internal Revenue Service standards are currently used to determine appropriate living expenses for taxpayers who are required to repay delinquent taxes. These standards have been developed by the Treasury Department to assist the Department in the collection of taxes and, of course, can be revised from time to time, as needed. These expense categories allow expenses for housing, food, transportation, and, for purposes of the means test, certain specified ``other necessary expenses.'' 
   In order to provide flexibility in appropriate cases of hardship, Section 102 also provides that in some cases where the presumption applies the debtor may be able to demonstrate ``special circumstances'' that ``justify'' additional expenses or an adjustment to the debtor's income for which there is no reasonable alternative. In addition, the debtor must demonstrate that the adjustments are reasonable and necessary and there is no reasonable alternative to the expense or income adjustment. If the debtor can make this showing, the presumption is rebutted. It is not intended that the ``special circumstances'' test will allow the presumption of abuse to be rebutted by relying on factors other than ability to pay. 
   The presumption of abuse arises due to a financial calculation assessing a Chapter 7 debtor's ability to pay. Thus, the presumption of abuse under Section 707(b) may only be rebutted if the debtor shows changes to expenses or changes to income not otherwise accounted for in the means test and that meet all of the requirements of the ``special circumstances'' test. Other factors are not relevant. 
   In applying the ``special circumstances'' test, it is important to note that a debtor who requests a ``special circumstances'' adjustment is requesting preferential treatment when compared to other consumers, and it is those other consumers who, by paying their debts, must assume the cost of the debts discharged by the debtors seeking the preferential treatment. It also is important to note that, because of the protections established for debtors whose income falls below the median income level, the preferential treatment provided under the ``special circumstances'' standard primarily benefits higher income individuals. 
   As indicated earlier, in order to ensure fairness with respect to the consumers who must pay the cost when others discharge debts in bankruptcy, it is essential that the ``special circumstances'' test establish a significant, meaningful threshold which a debtor must satisfy in order to receive the preferential treatment. The House/Senate agreement incorporated in HR 2415 is premised upon the belief that the relief sought by a debtor who files for bankruptcy is financial in nature and the debtor's right to obtain preferential relief under the ``special circumstances'' provision should be assessed based on financial considerations only. Thus, the agreement is not intended to allow debtors to continue expenses unless they clearly demonstrate that they meet the ``special circumstances'' test for such adjustments. 
   Under this bankruptcy reform package, the Office of United States Trustee or bankruptcy administrator is required to file a motion to dismiss or convert a Chapter 7 case if the bankrupt's current monthly income equals or exceeds the state median income and the presumption of abuse applies. If the Office of United States Trustee or bankruptcy administrator determines after investigation that such a motion is not warranted because the presumption of abuse can be rebutted, then it must file an explanatory statement with the bankruptcy court detailing why a motion to dismiss or convert is not appropriate. If private trustees or creditors disagree, they can commence a motion under 707(b). 
   Importantly, creditors are now explicitly given the power to bring 707(b) motions before the bankruptcy court, although creditors' and private trustees' motions are restricted to cases in which the debtor's current monthly income exceeds the applicable state median income. Moreover, HR 2415 gives Chapter 7 trustees important new financial incentives for ferreting out bankrupts who have repayment capacity and provides for appropriate penalties for bankruptcy attorneys who recklessly steer individuals with repayment capacity to Chapter 7 bankruptcy, or file schedules which misstate income, expenses or assets. HR 2415 also contains penalties for creditors who file inappropriate motions under section 707(b). Thus, contrary to the assertions of some, there are real and meaningful reasons why creditors will not improperly use their right to file 707(b) motions. 
   The new section 707(b) also provides that in addition to the means test, Chapter 7 debtors' cases may be dismissed if the filing is not in good faith or the ``totality of the circumstances'' indicate that granting relief under Chapter 7 would constitute abuse. No inference should be drawn, however that by referencing the ``totality of the circumstances'' Congress intended to approve the result in In re Green, 934 F.2d 568 (4th Cir. 1991) or similar cases. Such cases are rejected by the means test reforms and the change in the standard from ``substantial abuse'' to ``abuse'' in HR 2415. However, situations in which courts dismiss debtors from Chapter 7 today clearly continue to be grounds for dismissal under HR 2415, including such cases as In re Lamanna, 153 F. 3d 1 (1st Cir. 1998). In addition, since the standard for dismissal is revised to require ``abuse'' rather than ``substantial abuse'', the courts are clearly given additional discretion to control abusive use of chapter 7 when that is appropriate. 
   Congress thus intends that the new section 707(b) provide a tightly-focused mechanism for identifying bankrupts who have repayment capacity and sorting them out of Chapter 7, as well as dealing with other forms of abuse. At the same time, the new section 707(b) means test contains procedural safeguards which ensure that any special financial circumstances of a debtor will be appropriately considered before he or she is dismissed from bankruptcy or converted to another chapter. 
   Enhanced Consumer Protections and Credit Card Disclosures 
   Importantly, HR 2415 retains Title XIX of the Senate bill. This title amends the Truth in Lending Act (``TILA'') to require significant new minimum payment disclosures in connection with open-end credit plans. Among other things, HR 2415 requires credit card companies, on the front of each monthly statement, to provide: 
   --a statement that making only minimum payments will increase the interest costs and the time it takes to repay the account balance; 
   --an example showing the length of time it would take to repay a specified amount if making minimum payments only; and 
   --a toll-free telephone number which cardholders could call to receive additional repayment information.  
   HR 2415 requires the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate a table that would set forth information for use by credit card issuers in responding to cardholders who make inquiries through the toll-free telephone number. Finally, the Federal Reserve Board is authorized to study the types of information available to consumers regarding factors qualifying potential borrowers for credit, repayment requirements, and the consequences of default, including information related to minimum payments. The study would include consideration of the extent to which the availability of low minimum payment options is a cause of consumers experiencing financial difficulty. 
   HR 2415 also amends TILA to require certain applications or solicitations for credit cards that include an introductory rate of less than one year, and all promotional materials accompanying such an application or solicitation, to include the following relating to introductory rates: 
   --use the term ``introductory'' in immediate proximity to each listing of the introductory rate; and 
   --disclose when the introductory period will end and the annual percentage rate that will apply at the end of the introductory period. 
   In addition, HR 2415 requires a clear and conspicuous disclosure, in a prominent manner on or with an application or solicitation, of the rate, if any, that will apply if the introductory rate is revoked, and a general description of the circumstances or events that would result in such a rate. 
   HR 2415 also requires a credit card issuer to clearly and conspicuously provide disclosures regarding the key features of the credit plan, such as interest rate and basic fees, with Internet-based credit card applications and solicitations. These disclosures must be readily accessible to consumers in close proximity to the solicitations and these disclosures must be updated regularly to reflect the current policies, terms, and fee amounts applicable to the credit card account. HR 2415 also provides that, if a lender imposes a late fee for failing to make payment by the payment due date, the lender must state on each periodic statement the payment due date (or, if the card issuer contractually establishes a different date, the earliest date on which a late fee may be imposed). The lender also must state the amount of the fee that will be assessed if payment is received after that date. 
   Importantly, HR 2415 amends TILA to provide that an open-end creditor cannot terminate an account prior to its expiration date solely because the consumer has not incurred finance charges on the account. 
   New disclosures are now required in connection with consumer credit plans secured by the consumer's principal dwelling in which the extension of credit may exceed the fair market value of the dwelling. Under the amendment, a creditor must disclose at the time the creditor distributes an application to the consumer for such a plan that interest on the portion of the credit extension that is greater than the fair market value of the dwelling is not tax deductible for federal income tax purposes. 
   The Congress also directs that the Federal Reserve Board study the existing protections limiting consumer liability for unauthorized use of debit cards. In addition, the Board is directed to study the impact that extensions of credit to college students have on the rate of bankruptcy cases filed. 
   In addition to these new credit card disclosures, HR 2415 contains several important reforms which will protect individuals and help them better understand their rights and remedies. Reaffirmations occur when a debtor agrees to pay a debt which would otherwise be wiped away in bankruptcy. Section 524 of the Bankruptcy Code sets the conditions which must be met before such agreements will be considered legally binding. The bankruptcy reform package retains the Senate-passed amendments related to the reaffirmation agreements, with slight changes affecting only credit union debt. 
   HR 2415 also requires the Attorney General to designate prosecutors and investigators to enforce current criminal statutes designed to protect debtors in bankruptcy court from deceptive or coercive collection practices as well as enforcing those same statutes against debtors in appropriate cases. By committing substantial new resources to fighting abusive creditor and debtor practices and bankruptcy fraud, it is intended that the Department of Justice step up enforcement of these under-used statutes. 
   The bankruptcy reform package contains a provision which penalizes creditors who refuse to negotiate reasonable repayment schedules outside of bankruptcy. Under this provision, the amount that a creditor may collect in bankruptcy can be reduced if an approved credit counseling agency approved under the credit counseling provision of HR 2415 for the judicial district in which the debtor's case is pending makes a reasonable offer of repayment at least 60 days prior to declaring bankruptcy and the creditor unreasonably rejects this offer. During Senate consideration of S. 625, the Department of Justice indicated support for promoting alternative dispute resolution in this way but then suggested that the provision be ``clarified'' in such a way that it will not apply to governmental creditors. See Letter to The Honorable Orrin G. Hatch, Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, April 9, 1999. Thus, if the Congress were to accept the suggestions of the Department of Justice, non-governmental creditors would be subject to a tougher standard than currently contained in the bankruptcy reform package, but the Internal Revenue Service would be free to avoid alternative dispute resolution. Given its history in dealing with taxpayers, it was considered inappropriate to create such a special exemption for the Internal Revenue Service. 
   Reducing Abusive Uses of the Bankruptcy Code 
   As the National Bankruptcy Review Commission correctly noted, many of the worst abuses of the bankruptcy system involve individuals who repeatedly file for bankruptcy with the sole intention of using the automatic stay (i.e., a court injunction which arises whenever a bankruptcy case is filed). National Bankruptcy Rev. Comm. Rep., ``Bankruptcy the Next Twenty Years,'' October 20, 1997 vol. 1, at 262. Accordingly, HR 2415 contains restrictions on repeat filers and on multiple owners who serially file. It is expected that these changes will dramatically reduce the number of inappropriate bankruptcy filings. 
   HR 2415 also requires random audits of bankruptcy petitions to verify the accuracy of information contained in bankruptcy petitions, and makes debtor attorney's responsible to diligently inquire into the accuracy of the information provided on the schedules. Many Members of Congress are concerned that there is little incentive for individuals to list all of their assets or fully and accurately disclose their financial affairs, including their income and living expenses, when they file for bankruptcy. Of course, such laxity fosters an environment in which the overall financial condition of the bankrupt is likely to be inaccurate, with the result that creditors may receive less than they could when a bankrupt's financial affairs are accurately disclosed. Accordingly, the random audit procedures will restore some integrity to the system, since material misstatements are required to be reported to the appropriate authorities. 
   Enhanced Protections for Child Support 
   Balanced bankruptcy reform must protect the status of child support. According to some estimates, more than one-third of bankruptcies involve spousal and child support orders. And in about half of those cases, women were creditors trying to collect court-ordered support from their former husbands. These support orders are a lifeline for thousands of families struggling to maintain self-sufficiency. 
   HR 2415 contains all of the child support provisions of the Senate-passed version of bankruptcy reform (S. 625), including provisions closing various serious loopholes which allowed those who owed child support, alimony and in some instances other marital dissolution obligations to use the bankruptcy laws to delay and sometimes defeat payment of those obligations. HR 2415 also contains a new provision which requires bankruptcy trustees to notify child support creditors of their right to use state child support enforcement agencies to collect outstanding amounts due. In addition, HR 2415 permits general creditors to disclose the last known billing address of a debtor who owes child support or alimony to child support claimants. Taken together, these changes place child support and alimony claimants in a far better position under HR 2415 than under current law. 
   Business Provisions 
   HR 2415 contains the small business reform measures from the Senate passed version of HR 833. Although business bankruptcy filings are low at this time, several changes to Chapter 11 are warranted. HR 2415 contains provisions intended to speed up Chapter 11 for small business debtors, enact recommendations of the United Nations Commission on Internal Trade Law regarding transnational bankruptcy and clarify the treatment of tax claims in bankruptcy. 
   Importantly, HR 2415 provides new deadlines on tenants under non-residential leases to decide whether to reject or assume leases under section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. Under current law, once a tenant under a non-residential real property lease has filed for Chapter 11 relief, it has 60 days to decide whether to accept or reject its lease, with extensions for cause. Unfortunately, bankruptcy judges have allowed the exception for cause to swallow the rule. Today, bankruptcy judges routinely extend the time within which retail debtors must assume or reject the lease for years, including until confirmation of the plan. Moreover, while these tenant-debtors are supposed to pay their rent while the proceedings continue, they do not always do so and bankruptcy judges have not always compelled them to do so. 
   Thus, landlords are often left with significant uncertainty since they may have no clear indication as to whether a tenant will continue in a lease and the tenant may not be current on post-petition rents. It is hoped that the provisions contained in the current bankruptcy reform agreement will mitigate the unfairness confronting landlords of non-residential leases. The House bill provided that an unexpired lease of nonresidential property will be deemed rejected if the trustee has not assumed or rejected it by the earlier of the date of confirmation of a plan or a date that is no more than 120 days after the date of the order for relief, with an additional 120 days if granted by the court for cause. The court, under the House bill, could then grant an extension beyond 240 days after the date of the order for relief ``only  upon prior written consent of the lessor.'' The Senate bill provided that such a lease would be deemed rejected if the trustee has not acted by the earlier of the date of confirmation of a plan or the date which is 120 days after the date of the order for relief. No additional extension is permitted except ``upon motion of the lessor.'' Both bills, then, were quite similar, especially in denying bankruptcy judges discretion in extending the deadline for assuming or rejecting a lease after an absolute period following the order for relief--240 days in the former and 120 days in the latter. Both the Departments of Justice and the Interior favored a 120 day deadline, with no discretion in the bankruptcy judge. 
   HR 2415 provides that an unexpired non-residential real property lease is deemed rejected if the trustee has not acted by the earlier of the date of confirmation of a plan or the date which is 120 days after the date of the order for relief. The court may extend the 120 day period for an additional 90 days, prior to the expiration of the 120 day period, upon motion of either the trustee or the lessor for cause, for a total of 210 days after the date of the order for relief. If the court has granted such 90 day extension, the court may grant a subsequent extension only upon prior written consent of the lessor. This can be in the form of (1) a motion of the lessor or (2) a motion of the trustee, provided that the trustee has a prior written consent of the lessor. Importantly, HR 2415 clearly retains both bills' denial of bankruptcy judges' discretion in extending this date: in no circumstance may the time to assume or reject unexpired nonresidential real property leases extend beyond the earlier of (1) the time of confirmation or (2) 210 days from the time of entry of the order for relief, without the prior written consent of the lessor--either in the form of a lessor's motion, or in the form of a prior written consent to a trustee's motion, to extend the time. Moreover, a lessor's written consent to one extension beyond the 210 period does not constitute such consent for a subsequent extension: each such extension beyond 210 days requires the separate written consent of the lessor. 
   Finally, HR 2415 adds language to Section 365 (f)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code for the purpose of assuring that section 365(f) does not override any part of Section 365(b). HR 2415 provides that section 365(f) is not only subject to Section 365(c), but also to Section 365(b), which is to be given full effect. Contrary legal interpretations in case law are overturned.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I seek recognition to speak on the pending business, which is the bankruptcy bill. I had an opportunity to hear about one-fourth of the presentation of my good friend, the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. TORRICELLI. I heard him compliment my efforts as author of this legislation. In fact, this bill has been so successful in the Senate only because Senator TORRICELLI, as ranking Democrat on the Courts Subcommittee, has been so cooperative, recognizing there is a problem that should be addressed and working in a bipartisan way to make sure such a bill was put together and introduced by me and him, and then working through a long hearing process in the subcommittee and the full committee to develop a bill that would be reported out of the Judiciary Committee, a committee that tends to be very evenly divided on a lot of issues, by a very wide margin. Our bill came out with a fair sized majority. Then it passed overwhelmingly in the Senate with only 14 dissenting votes. 
   We had a very difficult time conferencing this bill, but there was finally an effort to go to conference. Senator TORRICELLI was very helpful in working out the details of the conference. 
   This afternoon, I saw, and the people of this country saw, through his remarks that continued cooperation, and that continued cooperation evidently goes way beyond what is going on in this Chamber on bankruptcy reform. It continues, through his own admission, through his recommendation to the President, when the President gets this bill, that the President should sign this bill. There will be people from the other side requesting the President not sign this bill. 
   I hope the President knows this bill has broad bipartisan support. We not only saw it in that vote of only 14 dissenting votes when it passed the Senate several months ago, but we also saw it yesterday in the vote on cloture where there were 67 Senators, 7 more than needed, to stop debate on this bill. 
   That brings me to the issue of how this bill has finally been conferenced and brought to the floor and has passed through the House of Representatives already, to be presented to the President hopefully after a successful vote tomorrow afternoon at 4 o'clock under the unanimous consent agreement. 
   We had an opportunity yesterday and today to hear the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. WELLSTONE, and we also heard others complain about the parliamentary process of getting this bankruptcy bill to the floor. It is an unbelievable thing for him and other Senators to condemn the way this bill finally got to conference. The Senate passed the bankruptcy bill after weeks of debate and after disposing of hundreds of amendments. On the issue of disposing of hundreds of amendments, I compliment Senator HARRY REID for his work in helping us work through those amendments. 
   The Senator from Minnesota still continues to object to the way in which this conference was handled saying it was not handled in the regular order of doing business in the Senate. The fact is, not only Senator TORRICELLI and the Senator from Iowa worked to get this bill to conference, but we also had many meetings between Senator DASCHLE, the Democratic leader, and Senator LOTT, the Republican leader, on how to get the bill before the Senate. 
   In every respect, on the motions it would take to accomplish that under the regular order, the Senator from Minnesota was in a position to object saying he was going to object and, consequently, then conferees could never be appointed in the way they are for most bills. 
   So it is misleading, it seems to me, for the Senator from Minnesota to pretend that he is not the reason this bill has not moved in the conventional way that bills ought to move, and then to blame others for finding a way of bringing a conference report. 
   It seems to me that if we did not find another way, it would be irresponsible on our part not doing our duty to the 83 Senators who voted for this bill the first time it passed the Senate. So we found a way to conference this bill with an unrelated piece of legislation. 
   By the way, very rarely are conference committees three Republicans and three Democrats, but this committee was made up that way. So for this bill to move to the floor of the Senate, there had to be members of Senator WELLSTONE's political party, the Democrat Party, who agreed that this is such an important piece of legislation, with 83 or 84 Senators voting for it in the first place, that it had to happen and it had to come to the floor. So we got this bill out of conference with the help of Senators on the other side of the aisle. I thank them for their cooperation. 
   Also earlier in this debate, Senator WELLSTONE referred to the fact that there seems to be no evidence at all that you can decrease the number of bankruptcies filed by the usual stigma against bankrupts that has been traditional throughout American society. I have to admit in recent years that has not been true. That is one of the very basic reasons we have had a dramatic increase in the number of bankruptcies since the last bankruptcy reform legislation that was passed in the late 1970s. 
   In the early 1980s, we had about 300,000 bankruptcies filed. It did not go up very dramatically until about the early 1990s, when it shot up very dramatically from maybe reaching 700,000  to almost doubling that amount, and continuing to rise until it got to a high of 1.4 million bankruptcies. 
   There is some evidence that it has come down just a little bit, but I am also going to be speaking shortly about evidence showing that the number of bankruptcies is going to shoot up again this year by 15 percent. But I think there is not the stigma in our society against people going into bankruptcy that there used to be. And that is one reason. But Senator WELLSTONE has spoken to the point that there is no evidence at all that the decrease in stigma associated with bankruptcy is related to this increase in bankruptcy filings. This is simply not true. 
   I have before me a study from 1998, from the University of Michigan, entitled ``The Bankruptcy Decision: Does Stigma Matter?'' by Scott Fay, Erik Hurst, and Michelle J. White, economists at the University of Michigan. They concluded--and I will read just one sentence from the abstract--  
   We show that the probability of debtors filing for bankruptcy rises when the level of bankruptcy stigma falls.  
   I am not going to spend the taxpayers' money to put this entire document in the RECORD, but the address is the Department of Economics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, if people want to refer to this and read from it. I advise them to do it because they will see, in a very statistical way, in a very in-depth way, that when there is stigma associated with bankruptcy--the societal disapproval of people filing for bankruptcy--we do not have as high a number of bankruptcy filings as we do now. 
   Mr. President, with that somewhat pointed reaction to some 
   of the statements the Senator from Minnesota legitimately brought to the floor--but I think he is wrong in his approach in what he is saying--I hopefully have put another side of the coin out there for people to consider. That is a strong basis for why this legislation should be before us, why it is before us, and why it needed to come here in a fairly unconventional way. 
   I am glad we are having a chance to debate the merits of the bankruptcy reform conference report today, and for a short time tomorrow, before we vote tomorrow on sending it to the President. 
   When the Senate last considered this bill, we heard a lot about the declining number of bankruptcies. Our opponents pointed to a temporary downward spike in the number of bankruptcies to say that this bill is not needed. They have said the economics have taken care of the situation. Not so. Even with a slight downturn, having 1.3 million bankruptcies, when we are in our 9th or 10th year of recovery, is an unconscionable index for bankruptcies. That is why the very liberal bankruptcy legislation that was passed in 1978 has to be changed somewhat, so that the legislation does not encourage bankruptcies, so that, in fact, it encourages those who have the ability to repay to know that they are never going to again get off scot-free. 
   I said just a few minutes ago that I was going to point to a study that would take away any weight to the arguments that we do not need this bill because there has been a downturn in the number of bankruptcies in the last year. This new study predicts that bankruptcies will rise by 15 percent next year. This was reported in the December 1st Wall Street Journal. The research was done by SMR Research Corporation, a consumer-debt research firm in Hackettstown, NJ. The SMR Research president, Stuart Feldstein, said this as a result of their study:  
   But now that we've caught our breath, they're [meaning bankruptcies] about to go way up again. We're on the verge of another flood.  
   The suggestion is that they will increase by 15 percent. 
   That is what we are facing: Another flood of bankruptcies. We have our critics, with their heads in the sand, acting as if there is nothing for us to worry about. The fact that we have a bankruptcy crisis on our hands--and have had for several years--and it looks as if things are going to get even worse, is an unconscionable situation when we can do something about it. 
   That is why we need to pass this bill, and we need to pass it right now. The bankruptcy reform bill will do a lot of good for the American people. More importantly, it is going to do a lot of good for our economy. 
   This bill will avert a disaster for our economy. There are signs that the economy is slowing down. There are signs that we are in the middle or at the beginning of a Clinton era recession. Remember, President Clinton is President of the United States. The manufacturing sector is already in a recession. Several other indices in the last couple months have shown downward trends. If they continue, obviously, we will be in a recession. That recession is probably apt to happen when we have a President Bush. 
   I want to make it clear right now: We are not going to let that be a Bush recession, if the downturn started in a Clinton administration. We are not going to let the Democrats get away with taking credit for a recovery in 1993 that started 8 months before the election of President Clinton in 1992. That is when the recession of 1990-1991 turned around. It was 1992. Yet from February through the middle of November 1992, somehow we were still in a Bush recession, not in a recovery that happened in February 1992. But just as soon as Clinton was elected, it was all over. 
   The media weren't doing their job or it would never have been reported that way or the hysteria Clinton provided the country in 1992 would have never taken root. But we are in a situation now where there will be some people, if there is a downturn next year, who are going to want to blame the new President for that. They won't be able to, if it started now. 
   I hope these indices will turn around. I think we have an opportunity, under a new President with the proper economic policies in place and fair tax cuts that the working men and women of America are entitled to, to do some things to make sure that such a situation doesn't happen. But right now, we have had 9 years of growth, starting at the tail end of the last Bush administration. Yet we have the highest number of bankruptcies over a long period of time, and it is presumably going to get worse. If we have a recession, they are going to get a lot worse. That is why we need this legislation. 
   We have also seen quite a fall in the stock market recently, and we know that Americans are anxious about their economic future. If we hit a recession without fixing the bankruptcy system, we could face a situation of bankruptcies spiraling out of control. The time to act is now before any recession is in full swing. 
   As I did earlier this year, when we voted on cloture on this bill, I will summarize a few of the things that are in the bill that my colleagues may not know are there as a result of the disinformation campaign waged by our liberal opponents. 
   Right now, farmers in my State and in Minnesota--maybe in every State but particularly in the upper Midwest where it is a grain growing region and we have a 25-year low in grain prices--have no chapter of the bankruptcy code that fits them and their own special needs. They did from 1933 to 1949. Then they didn't have it. They have had it as a result of my getting it passed in 1986, a chapter 12 for farmers. But it has lapsed now because the people on the other side of the aisle, who every day talk about helping the American farmer, are voting against this bill or stalling it. And chapter 12 has lapsed, so there is no chapter 12 to help farmers. Yet we have farmers facing 
   foreclosure and forced auctions just because chapter 12 of the bankruptcy code, which gives essential protections for the family farmers, expired in June of this year. It expired for the reasons I gave. 
   Shame on those who are blocking us from doing the right thing by reinstituting chapter 12 and going beyond how we have normally done it, just do it for a few years at a time. In this bill we say that farmers are entitled to the same permanency of their chapter in the bankruptcy code as the big corporations have in chapter 11, as small business and individuals have in chapter 13. We are not going to leave farmers then with this last ditch effort. 
   We went beyond that because we have also changed the tax laws so that farmers will be able to avoid capital gains taxes when they are forced to sell something by the referee of bankruptcy. This will free up resources then to be invested in a farming operation that would otherwise go down the black hole of the IRS.  
   We have a fundamental choice. The Senate could vote as the Senator from Minnesota wants us to vote, and the Senate would then kill this bill and leave farmers without this safety net, or we can stand up for the farmers. We can do our duty and make sure that the family farmers are not gobbled up by giant corporate farms when they are forced into foreclosure. We can give farmers in Iowa and Minnesota a fighting chance. 
   I hope the Senate will stand with the farmers of Iowa and Minnesota and other farmers around the United States on supporting this legislation. I hope the Senate doesn't give in to the liberal establishment which has decided to fight bankruptcy reform no matter who gets hurt or what the cost is to the farming operators. 
   There are a lot of other things in this conference report. The bill will give badly needed protection for patients in bankrupt hospitals and nursing homes. The Senate adopted this as an amendment. I offered it. It was accepted unanimously. Again, my colleagues may be unaware of the fact that there aren't any provisions in the bankruptcy code to protect people in nursing homes, if that nursing home goes into bankruptcy. By killing this bill, they are killing some of that protection. 
   I had hearings on the fate of patients in bankrupt nursing homes in my judiciary subcommittee. As my colleagues know, Congress is still trying to put more money into nursing homes through the Medicare Replenishment Act that is now before the Senate because of nursing homes being in bankruptcy. So the potential for real harm to nursing home residents is there. I would like to provide an example of that. 
   Without the patient protections contained in this conference report, we learned, through our hearing process, of a situation in California where the bankruptcy trustee just showed up at the nursing home on a Friday evening and evicted residents. The bankruptcy trustee didn't provide any notice that this was going to happen. There was no chance to relocate the residents of the nursing homes. The bankruptcy trustee literally put these frail elderly people out onto the street and changed the locks on the doors so they couldn't get back into the nursing home. But this bankruptcy bill will prevent that from ever happening again. 
   If we don't stand up and say that residents of nursing homes can't be thrown out onto the street, then Congress will fail in its duty to these people. 
   Again, we have no choice. We can vote this bill down and tell nursing home residents and their families that it just doesn't matter to anybody in the Senate. That is the end result of the position advanced by the Senator from Minnesota. I hope the Senate is much better at humanitarian responsibilities than that. I hope the Senate stands for nursing home residents and not for the inside Washington liberal special interest groups that don't care about some nursing home resident being out on the street on a Friday night. 
   There is more to this bill. The bankruptcy reform bill contains particular bankruptcy provisions advocated by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. I think both of these people--for the benefit of the Senator from Minnesota--are appointees of President Clinton. They have good things to say about the need for bankruptcy reform. These particular provisions I am talking about will strengthen our financial markets and lessen the possibility of domino-style collapses in the financial sector of our economy. 
   According to both Chairman Greenspan and Secretary Summers, these provisions will address significant threats to our prosperity. As I said earlier, we are seeing the early warning signs of a recession. We need to put these safeguards into place so that the financial markets, which are the key components of our economy, don't face the unnecessary risk of what might be the beginning of a Clinton recession. 
   Again, we have a very fundamental choice: We can strengthen our financial markets by passing this bill or we can side with the liberal establishment and fight reform no matter what the cost is to our society. So I think the American people do in fact want us to strengthen the economy, not turn a deaf ear to pleas for help from the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Secretary. I hope the Senate decides to vote to safeguard our prosperity and not put it at risk. 
   At this point, I will talk about the issue of how the bankruptcy bill will impact people with high medical expenses. I am going to refer to a nearby chart. Earlier this year, I had an opportunity to address this very issue. I want to assure my colleagues with any remaining questions about the full deductibility of health care costs to a person going into bankruptcy, whether or not those are factored into the ability to repay, and the answer is, yes, 100 percent. I know the Senator from Minnesota has heard my explanation on that. I haven't heard him contradict anything I have had to say that the General Accounting Office has said to back this up. Yet he will continually come to the floor of the Senate and make the same point that it could be possible for people with high medical expenses not to be able to go into bankruptcy and get those considered as part of the process of discharge or not. 
   The bankruptcy bill says people who can repay a certain amount of their debt can't file for chapter 7, the point being that they are then channeled into a repayment plan under chapter 13. At this time, the question of medical expenses comes into play when determining whether someone has the ability to repay their debt. According to the nonpartisan General Accounting Office, the conference report before the Senate allows for 100-percent full deductibility for medical expenses before examining repayment ability. 
   Right here you have it, from the IRS--other necessary expenses that are deducted. It says that no standard other than expense must be necessary and reasonable. But it says it includes such expenses as charitable contributions, child care, dependent care, health care. Right now I emphasize the words ``health care'' because that is what we are being told by the Senator from Minnesota--that that would not be deductible. It says payroll deductions such as union dues and life insurance. 
   So maybe all of those things together would tell people that there are assurances way beyond just the health care expense issue of the deductibility. But it also emphasizes in this General Accounting Office report that we take care of all 
   of the concerns anybody ought to have in that particular area. So, bottom line: If you have huge medical bills, you get to deduct them in full before even looking at whether you get channeled into a repayment plan. So I don't know what could be more fair and how it could be any clearer. 
   The Senator from Minnesota has told us he wants to learn more about this bankruptcy bill. It is quite obvious that he needs to know more about this bankruptcy bill. So I hope he does, and I hope he will let me talk to him, because once we look into this bill in its totality, I am confident that Members of the Senate will do the responsible thing and will vote for final passage tomorrow at 4 o'clock.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to take this time during the debate on the bankruptcy bill to give a little bit of history on bankruptcy reform. I want to say a few words about how we thought about the proper role of bankruptcy over the course of our Nation's history. 
   Congress' authority to create bankruptcy legislation derives from the body of the Constitution, article I, section 8, clause 4, authorizing Congress to establish ``uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States.'' 
   Until 1898, we did not have permanent bankruptcy laws in our country. The previous bankruptcy laws that were on the books throughout that early 100 years were temporary reactions to particular economic problems, and with each successive bankruptcy act and each major reform of our bankruptcy laws, we refined our conception of how bankruptcies should promote the important social goal of giving honest but very unfortunate Americans a fresh economic start, while at the same time after giving that fresh start guarding against the moral hazard of making bankruptcy too lax, easy, and in fact encouraging bankruptcy. 
   Right now, I think we have a situation where too many Americans see bankruptcy as an easy way out. A huge majority of Americans recently told pollsters that bankruptcy is too easy and more socially acceptable than a few years ago. 
   I refer to the chart from Penn and Schoen Associates. The question they ask: ``Is bankruptcy more socially acceptable than a few years ago?'' You get an overwhelming 84 percent who say, gee, it is more socially acceptable. As few as 10 percent say that it is not more socially acceptable, and 6 percent said they did not have an opinion. 
   A very dramatically high proportion of the American people know that the present policies of bankruptcy in this country are not right, and they tend to encourage people to file for bankruptcy. 
   The bill we are considering today and tomorrow and will hopefully pass at 4 o'clock tomorrow under the unanimous consent agreement proposes fundamental reforms which are a logical outgrowth and an extension of our prior bankruptcy reform efforts. 
   From 1898 until 1938--a 40-year period of time--consumers had only one way to declare bankruptcy. It was called in the terms of the profession ``straight bankruptcy.'' Today we refer to it as ``chapter 7'' bankruptcy. Under chapter 7, which is still in existence, bankrupts surrendered some of their assets to the bankruptcy court. The court then sold those assets--today, for that matter--and used the proceeds to pay creditors. Any deficiency then is automatically wiped out. 
   In 1932, the President recommended changes to the bankruptcy laws which would push wage earners into repayment plans. In the 1930s--in fact, specifically in 1938--Congress then created a chapter 13 in addition to a chapter 7. Chapter 13 permits but does not require a debtor to repay a portion of his or her debts in exchange for limited debt cancellation and protection for debt collectors' efforts. 
   Chapter 13 is still on the books to this day, although it has been modified several times. Most notably, modification to it came in the year 1978. 
   Under current law, the choice between chapter 7 and chapter 13 is entirely voluntary. 
   In the late 1960s, Senator Albert Gore, Sr.--the father of the Vice President of the United States--introduced legislation to push people into the repayment plans. This proposal was reported to the Senate as a part of a bankruptcy tax bill passed by the Finance Committee. But it ultimately died in the Senate. 
   Later, in the mid-1980s, Senator Dole on the part of the Senate and Congressman Mike Synar on the part of the House tried to steer higher income bankrupts--those who could pay some of their debt--into chapter 13. The efforts of Senator Dole and 
   Congressman Synar ultimately resulted in the creation of section 707(b) of the bankruptcy code. This section gives bankruptcy judges the power to dismiss the bankruptcy case of someone who has filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy if that case is, in the words of the law, ``substantial abuse'' of the bankruptcy code. 
   While this idea sounds good and well intended, it has not worked well in the real world of people who do not pay their bills--and the people who enforce the bankruptcy laws and the lawyers who work with them.  
   First, the problem is that no one knows what the term ``substantial abuse'' actually means. We have conflicting court decisions around the country, and people just aren't sure what the rules are. 
   Second, creditors and private trustees are actually forbidden from bringing evidence of abuse to the attention of a bankruptcy judge. 
   Look at that situation. 
   No. 2, if somebody knows about abuse, and it is very obvious--and even if it isn't so obvious--they can bring it to the attention of the bankruptcy judge and something can be done about it. The law doesn't allow that to be done. 
   As well intentioned as what Senator Dole and Congressman Mike Synar ended up doing--their original intentions were right but they had to compromise to get it done in 707--it just hasn't accomplished what that compromise was supposed to have accomplished. 
   The bill before the Senate now corrects these shortcomings. Under the bill, 707(b) now permits creditors and private trustees to file motions and bring evidence of chapter 7 abuses to the attention of the bankruptcy judge. 
   People who oppose this bill find fault with that. If somebody is using the courts of the United States to help them along, and if they don't deserve that help and there is abuse of power of government to the detriment of creditors and particularly to the consumers, and as a result of 1.4 million bankruptcies in America a family of four pays $400 more for goods and services than they would otherwise pay--and that is wrong--what is wrong with that information being presented through the transparency process to the judge? We do that here. It should be done. I don't know why anybody would find fault where there is outright abuse being presented. 
   The change is very important, since creditors have the most to lose from bankruptcy abuse, and private trustees are often in the very best position to know which cases are abusive in nature. In certain types of cases where the probability of abuse is very high, the Department of Justice is required to bring evidence of abuse to the attention of bankruptcy judges. And they should be required to bring this abuse to their attention. 
   Additionally, the bill requires judges to dismiss or convert chapter 7 cases where the debtor has a clear ability to repay his or her debts. 
   Taken together, these changes will bring the bankruptcy system back into balance, particularly in relationship to the evolution of the bankruptcy code from an ad hoc sort of passage by Congress for the first 100 years--the last 100 years being more permanent, and in the last 20 years it has been very liberalized--to make it a little more balanced. It is a perfectly legitimate thing to do. 
   Importantly, these changes preserve the element of flexibility so that each and every debtor can have his or her special circumstances considered. This means that each bankrupt will have his or her own unique circumstances taken into account at the time of judgment. 
   As we consider this bill, I hope my colleagues will keep in mind the remainder of the bill, and the fair nature of this legislation as well as its historical roots. 
   I see that the Senator from Alabama has come to the floor. I think he is waiting to speak. Soon I will yield the floor. 
   But I also take this opportunity to praise, as I have had the opportunity in times past, the efforts of the Senator from Alabama to help us bring this bill this far, and for his willingness to be flexible in some things where he would like to go further in making sure that debts are repaid that maybe otherwise would not be repaired but understanding the extremes on both sides helping us to get to a middle so that a moderate bill such as this can become law. 
   I thank, publicly, Senator SESSIONS of Alabama. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak yet again on the topic of bankruptcy reform. Yesterday, we invoked cloture on the Bankruptcy Reform Conference Report with 67 votes. That's a solid bipartisan level of support. We have a conference report where both the majority leader and the minority leader voted to cut off debate. At long last, Congress is on the verge of enacting fundamental bankruptcy reform. Earlier this year, the Senate passed bankruptcy reform by an overwhelming vote of 83-14. Almost all Republicans voted for the bill and about one-half of the Democrats voted for it as well. Despite this, a tiny minority of Senators used unfair tactics to prevent us from going to conference with the House of Representatives in the usual way. So, we put the bankruptcy bill into another conference report. The important thing about this conference committee--which I have said before but want to reiterate now--is that the committee was evenly divided between three Democrats and three Republicans. There was no Republican majority on the conference committee. We would not be here if not for support from Democrats on the conference committee. So all of these objections to the effect that Republicans used some procedural trick to avoid dealing with the minority is simply and flat out false. 
   As I am speaking, the House passed the bankruptcy conference report by a voice vote. We are almost there. And with the level of bipartisan support demonstrated in yesterday's vote, I am confident we'll send the best bill we can to the President. 
   As I have stated before on the Senate floor on numerous occasions, every bankruptcy filed in America creates upward pressure on interest rates and prices for goods and services. The more bankruptcies filed, the greater the upward pressure. I know that some of our more liberal colleagues are trying to stir up opposition to bankruptcy reform by denying this point and saying that tightening bankruptcy laws only helps lenders be more profitable. This just is not true. Even the liberal Clinton administration's own Treasury Secretary Larry Summers indicated that bankruptcies tend to drive up interest rates, Mr. 
   President, if you believe Secretary Summers, bankruptcies are everyone's problem. Regular hardworking Americans have to pay higher prices for goods and services as a result of bankruptcies. That's a compelling reason for us to enact bankruptcy reform during this Congress. 
   Of course, any bankruptcy reform bill must preserve a fresh start for people who have been overwhelmed by medical debts or sudden, unforeseen emergencies. That is why this conference agreement allows for the full, 100 percent deductibility of medical expenses. This is according to the nonpartisan, unbiased General Accounting Office. Bankruptcy reform must be fair, and the bicameral agreements on bankruptcy preserves fair access to bankruptcy for people truly in need. 
   These have been good times in our Nation. Thanks to the fiscal discipline initiated by Congress, and the hard work of the American people, we have a balanced budget and budget surplus. Unemployment is low and so is inflation. But in the midst of this incredible prosperity, about 1 1/2 million Americans declared bankruptcy in 1998 alone. And in 1999, there were just under 1.4 million bankruptcy filings. To put this in some historical context, since 1990, the rate of personal bankruptcy filings has increased almost 100 percent. 
   Now we see signs of slowing in the economy. We see consumer confidence declining. We see the stock market losing value. We need to fix our bankruptcy system before a recession comes  and we're overwhelmed with huge numbers of bankruptcies. According to a recent article in the New York Post, we as a nation are looking down the barrel of a new and larger epidemic of bankruptcies. This article quoted a recent study from a New Jersey research firm that predicts a 10-20 percent increase in bankruptcies next year. Another expert quoted in the article indicates that the increases may be much greater. We need to act now. 
   As I indicated earlier, we have been doing pretty well lately as a country. With large numbers of bankruptcies occurring at a time when Americans are earning more than ever, the only logical conclusion is that some people are using 
   bankruptcy as an easy out. The basic policy question we have to answer is this: Should people with means who declare bankruptcy be required to pay at least some of their debts or not? Right now, the current bankruptcy system is oblivious to the financial condition of someone asking to be excused from paying his debts. The richest captain of industry could walk into a bankruptcy court tomorrow and walk out with his debts erased. And, as I described earlier, the rest of America will pay higher prices for goods and services as a result. 
   I ask my liberal friends to think about that for a second. If we had no bankruptcy system at all, and we were starting from scratch, would we design a system that lets the rich walk away from their debts and shift the costs to society at large, including the poor and the middle class? That would not be fair, but that is exactly the system we have now. Fundamental bankruptcy reform is clearly in order. 
   I want my colleagues to know that the conference agreement preserves the Torricelli-Grassley amendment to require credit card companies to give consumers meaningful information about minimum payments on credit cards. Consumers will be warned against making only minimum payments, and there will be an example to drive this point home. As with the Senate-passed bill, the bicameral agreement will give consumers a toll-free phone number to call where they can get information about how long it will take to pay off their own credit card balances if they make only the minimum payments. This new information will truly educate consumers and improve the financial literacy of millions of American consumers. 
   Yesterday's vote shows that the mainstream of opinion in the Senate supports bankruptcy reform. But that has not stopped the tiny handful of liberals who oppose bankruptcy reform have waged a campaign to spread disinformation about the bankruptcy bill. The article in Time magazine that Senator WELLSTONE constantly refers to is a case in point. This article purports to prove that bankruptcy reform will harm low-income people or people with huge medical bills. This article is simply false. I spoke about this on the floor last summer but a little reminder might be helpful for 
   some of my colleagues who don't follow this bill as closely as I do. 
   What is most interesting about this Time article is what it fails to report. Time, for instance, fails to mention that the means test, which sorts people who can repay into repayment plans, doesn't apply to families below the median income for the State in which they live. The Time article then proceeds to give several examples of families who would allegedly be denied the right to liquidate if bankruptcy reform were to pass. Each of these families, however, would not even be subjected to the means test since they earn less than the median income. While this sounds technical, it's important--not even one of the examples in the Time article would be affected by the means test. 
   The Time article fails to mention the massive new consumer protections in our bankruptcy reform bill. The Time article fails to mention the new disclosure requirements on credit cards regarding interest rates and minimum payments. In short, the Time article fails to tell the whole truth. I think that the American peopled deserve the whole truth. 
   The truth is that these bankruptcies represent a clear and present danger to America's small businesses. Growth among small businesses is one of the primary engines of our economic success. With the predictions of a new tidal wave of bankruptcies next year, we have to be concerned about a domino effect. As more and more consumers use bankruptcy to escape paying their debts, more and more small businesses will face unsustainable losses. And if we don't act to protect small businesses, then one of the main sources or our prosperity will be in serious jeopardy. As responsible legislators, we cannot let that happen. 
   The truth is that bankruptcies hurt real people. Sometimes that is inevitable, but it is not fair to permit people who can repay to skip out on their debts. I think most people, including most of us in Congress, have a basic sense of fairness that tells us bankruptcy reform is needed to restore balance. 
   I will share with you what some of my constituents are telling me about bankruptcy reform. I will not go through all of these quotes. But a constituent from Des Moines, IA, said:  
   It is insane that such a practice has been allowed to continue, only causing higher prices to consumers..... . Debtors should be required to pay their debt.  
   A lady from Keokuk, IA:  
   Bankruptcies are out of hand. It's time to make people responsible for their actions--do we need to say this?  
   I could go on and on. But I have given you two examples of many I have gotten from my State. Considering the fact that there were 83 people who voted for this bill when it passed the Senate the first time, this message must be getting through loud and clear in almost all of the 50 States in America or we would not have had that overwhelming vote. 
   We are merely saying, if you have the ability to repay your debt and you go into bankruptcy court, you are not going to get off scot-free. 
   The time has come to get this bill on the President's desk. That is what I hope we do tomorrow afternoon at 3:45. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are about to vote on cloture on the bankruptcy bill. I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture. 
   The conference committee that produced this Bankruptcy Conference Report had an even 3-3 ratio. Obviously with this ratio, Democrats on the conference held an absolute veto over the bankruptcy bill. But here we are voting on a conference report that has the support of conferees on both sides of the aisle. 
   What's at stake with this vote? 
   If you vote ``no'' on cloture you are voting against bankruptcy protections for family farmers. 
   If you vote ``no'' on cloture you are voting against targeted capital gains tax relief for family farmers in bankruptcy. 
   If you vote ``no'' on cloture you are voting against a ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' for residents of bankrupt nursing homes. 
   If you vote ``no'' on cloture you are voting against provisions that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Larry Summers say are crucial for protecting our financial markets. 
   There's a lot at stake with this vote. Let's vote for farmers. Let's vote for a ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' for residents of bankrupt nursing homes. Let's vote to protect our financial markets. Let's vote to protect our prosperity. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the tax relief bill we are about to pass contains many very popular tax cut measures that will be good for Americans and good for the country. One of the provisions included in the package is The Farm, Fisherman, and Ranch Risk Management Act--FFARRM. 
   This is a proactive measure that would give farmers a five-year window to manage their money. It would allow them to contribute up to 20% of the annual income to tax-deferred accounts, known as FFARRM accounts. The funds would be taxed as regular income upon withdrawal. 
   If the funds are not withdrawn five years after they were invested, they are taxed as income and subject to an additional 10% penalty. So, farmers will be able to put away savings in good years so they will have a little bit of a cushion in bad years. 
   Agriculture remains one of the most perilous ways to make a living. The income of a farm family depends, in large part, on factors outside their control. Weather can completely wipe out a farm family. At best, it can cause their income to fluctuate wildly. The uncertainty of International markets also threatens a farm family's income. 
   If European countries impose trade barriers on farm commodities, or if Asian countries devalue their currency, agricultural exports and the income of farmers will fall. 
   Today, farmers face one of their most severe crises with record low prices for grain and livestock. The only help for these farmers has been a reactionary policy of government intervention. While this aid is necessary to help farmers pull through the current crisis, it's merely a partial short-term solution. 
   Farmer Savings Accounts will help the farmer help himself. It's not a new government subsidy for agriculture and it will not create a new bureaucracy purporting to help farmers. It will simply provide farmers with a fighting chance to survive the down times and an opportunity to succeed when prices eventually increase. 
   Another important provision in this bill deals with farmers who want to income average but aren't able to because of the alternative minimum tax. A few years ago, Congress reinstated income averaging for farmers because we recognized that farmers' income fluctuated from year to year.  
   Unfortunately, many farmers are not able to make use of this benefit because they're subject to the alternative minimum tax. Our tax relief bill will fix this problem for tens of thousands of farmers. 
   There are many other farmer-friendly measures that I and others advocated in the Senate bill. Unfortunately, some of our House counterparts didn't agree with us. I believe that will change next year and I will certainly be working hard to pass these in the next Congress. 
   In the meantime, we have some very good and necessary pro-farmer proposals before us that can be passed this year. 
   I only hope the Clinton-Gore administration doesn't veto the family farmer by vetoing this bill. 
   Thank you Mr. President.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss some of the health care provisions in the tax bill. It's not a perfect bill, but it contains a lot of items that will improve health care in this country. 
   Let me touch on the issue of Medicare equity. We in Iowa have been frustrated by the inequitable payment formulas that hurt cost-efficient states like ours. These disparities exist in both traditional Medicare and in the Medicare+Choice program. Well, this bill takes a major step toward correcting this injustice. I'd like to walk through some of the reasons why this bill is good for health care in Iowa. 
   This bill corrects the Medicare Disproportionate Share program, known as ``DISH,'' as proposed in a bill I sponsored with Senator ROBERTS and others. This program helps hospitals that treat large numbers of uninsured patients. It's obvious that many rural Americans are uninsured, and that rural hospitals meet their duty to treat these people. But from its inception, this program has discriminated against rural hospitals. They have had to meet a much higher threshold than large urban hospitals have. Well, this bill finally equalizes the thresholds for all hospitals. There's still more work to do on this program, but this is a major step forward for equity in Medicare. 
   The bill also reforms the Medicare Dependent Hospital program, as proposed in legislation I co-sponsored with Senator CONRAD and many others. Many rural areas have aged populations, and this is especially true in Iowa. So this designation benefits small rural facilities that have more than 60% Medicare patients. But incredibly, hospitals only receive this benefit if they met that level way back in 1988! Unfortunately, the Medicare program is full of this kind of outdated, unreasonable rules. That's why we need Medicare reform. But in the meantime, I'm glad to report that this bill would correct this particular problem: if a rural hospital has been over that 60% level in recent years, it qualifies. That's great news for rural hospitals. 
   Other key provisions of the bill strengthen our Sole Community Hospitals, knock down obstacles to the success of the Critical Access Hospital program for rural areas, and enhance rural patients' access to emergency and ambulance services. 
   The bill also helps hospitals--including all Iowa hospitals, both urban and rural--by providing a full Medicare payment increase to offset inflation in 2001. 
   Low payment rates for Iowa and other efficient states have prevented the Medicare+Choice program from taking root in Iowa and offering seniors the full range of health care options available elsewhere. I am pleased that the bill provides a major boost to entice plans to enter such regions, raising the minimum monthly payments for plans in rural areas from $415 to $475 per month, and for urban areas from $415 to $525 per month. These increases were proposed in a bill I co-sponsored with Senator DOMENICI and others, and I am hopeful that they will soon provide Iowans with the same range of choices available to seniors in other areas. 
   The bill gives rural seniors access to the best medical care through telemedicine, as I have worked with Senator JEFFORDS and many others to do. In rural areas, medical specialists are not readily available. For many seniors, traveling long distances is simply not feasible. But technology now makes it possible for patients to go to their local hospital or clinic and be seen by a specialist hundreds of miles away. We in Iowa have tremendous capacity to take advantage of this. Yet for too long, the Medicare bureaucracy has put up every barrier it could think of to telemedicine. But this bill changes that, greatly expanding the availability of Medicare payment for services provided by telemedicine, Medicare patients will now have access to the world's best doctors and medical care regardless of where they live. 
   The bill protects funding for home health services by delaying a scheduled 15% cut in payments, as well as providing a full medical inflation update. It's not secret that I, like many of my colleagues, would have preferred to see that 15% cut canceled permanently rather than simply delayed for another year. I hope that we will accomplish that next year. 
   The bill also protects the access of our neediest beneficiaries to home health services when they use adult day care services. Patients can only receive home care under Medicare if they are ``homebound,'' and the bureaucracy has said that patients who leave their home for health care at an adult day care facility--such as many Alzheimer's patients--are no longer homebound. This has forced patients who are capable of living in their homes to move into institutions, just to get health care. I am very pleased that this bill includes the common-sense legislation I co-sponsored 
   with Senator JEFFORDS to correct this Catch-22. 
   I am also very pleased that the bill addresses the Medicare hospice benefit, providing for a higher payment increase for inflation. The bill also deals with the ``six-month rule'' for hospice eligibility, clarifying that it is only a guideline, not an inflexible requirement. These provisions respond to concerns aired at my Aging Committee hearing on hospice in September, and I look forward to continued work in the 107th Congress to strengthen hospice care. 
   The legislation extends the moratorium on therapy caps and provides Medicare beneficiaries in nursing homes with access to critical services. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included a $1,500 cap on occupational, physical and speech-language pathology therapy services received outside a hospital setting. Thirty-one days after the law was implemented, an estimated one in four beneficiaries had exhausted half of their yearly benefit. Furthermore, it was those beneficiaries in need of the most rehabilitative care that were penalized by being forced to pay the entire cost for these services outside of a hospital setting. I fought successfully during last year's Balanced Budget Refinement Act for a two-year moratorium on the therapy caps while the Health Care Financing Administration studies the issue; I am pleased to see this effort recognized and the moratorium extended for an additional year. 
   The bill protects the right of patients in Medicare+Choice plans to return to their Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility of origin if they have to leave that facility for a brief hospitalization. Without this right, there have been instances in which patients in religiously affiliated nursing facilities have not been permitted to return to those facilities after hospitalization. I am gratified that the bill includes the legislation I co-sponsored with Senator MACK on this issue. 
   The bill discontinues a policy to phase out Medicaid cost-based reimbursement to our nation's 3,000 Rural Health Clinics and 900 Community Health Centers. In its place, it provides a reimbursement solution to ensure that these essential primary care providers can continue to serve millions of uninsured and under-insured Americans. The bill establishes a prospective payment system in Medicaid for federally certified Rural Health Centers and Community Health Centers. This provision creates an equitable payment system for these providers and ensures that the health care safety net remains strong and secure. 
   As one example, the legislation also provides Medicare beneficiaries with greater access to the most thorough type of colon cancer screening--colonoscopy. As Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I held  a hearing earlier this year to raise awareness about the far-reaching and devastating effects of colon cancer. This year 129,400 Americans will be diagnosed with this type of cancer and 56,000 Americans will die from it. However, if detected and treated early, colorectal cancer is curable in up to 90 percent of diagnosed cases. I fully support an expanded colon cancer screening benefit for Medicare beneficiaries and urge all older Americans to put the benefit to use. 
   For the first time, medical nutrition therapy may be reimbursed by Medicare for patients with diabetes or renal disease. As part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress instructed the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to conduct a study of the benefits of nutrition therapy. IOM reported that nutrition therapy would improve the quality of care and would be an efficient use of Medicare resources. I cosponsored legislation to expand Medicare coverage to include nutrition therapy; offering coverage for beneficiaries with diabetes or renal disease is a step in the right direction. 
   In another first, this bill eliminates the arbitrary time limitation on Medicare coverage of immunosuppressive drugs following an organ transplant. Medicare covers expensive transplant operations but fails to follow through with coverage of the drugs necessary to preserve the transplanted organ; reimbursement is currently limited to the first three years following the procedure. While last year's BBRA extended coverage in some cases for an additional eight months, this legislation drops any time limitation for coverage of drugs critical to the health of transplant patients. This is common sense policy I am glad to support. 
   I plan to come to the floor on other occasions to discuss other provisions of this bill. While I'm not completely satisfied, I think there is a lot that will help Americans get the health care they need and deserve. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for the majority leader, I wish to announce today's program. 
   The Senate will be in a period of morning business until 6 p.m. with Senators LOTT, REID, and WELLSTONE in control of the time. Today the Senate will agree by unanimous consent to the continuing resolution that funds the Government until tomorrow. 
   As a reminder, cloture was filed on the bankruptcy bill yesterday, and that vote will occur tomorrow morning possibly around 9:30 a.m. A vote on a continuing resolution will also take place during Wednesday's session. The President has vetoed the important legislative branch and Treasury-Postal appropriations bills. However, negotiations will continue to try to come to a consensus to fund all Government programs throughout the year. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we had an opportunity to listen to 2 hours of debate and speeches from some on the other side of the aisle earlier this afternoon trashing a piece of legislation and the process connected with that legislation that originally passed the Senate 83-14 earlier this year. 
   I have heard the Senator from Minnesota and others complain about the process of getting the bankruptcy bill to the floor. It seemed to me, as I listened to what he said that it is almost an unbelievable thing for him to say that. The Senate passed the bankruptcy bill after weeks of debate and after disposing of literally hundreds of amendments. The Senator from Minnesota objected to going to the conference committee in the regular order. We tried to do things in the regular way, but he was one of those Senators who blocked our efforts to get to conference. 
   I think the speeches we have heard this afternoon, particularly from the Senator from Minnesota, are misleading. It is very misleading for Senator WELLSTONE to pretend he is not the reason for this bill not moving in the regular way and then to find fault with the unconventional way in which we finally did it. 
   Also, looking at that process, there are few conference committees around here that have an equal number of Democrats and Republicans. This conference committee had three Democrats and three Republicans. So obviously Democrats had to sign the conference report, or we would not even have it before us. But that is the way this process has been--not only this year but last year and the year before and the year before. 
   We have been trying to bring about badly needed bankruptcy reform. It has been done in a bipartisan way. The best evidence of that bipartisanship, both from the standpoint of substance and the standpoint of the process, is the 83-14 vote by which the original bill passed the Senate and Democrats signing the conference report that is now before us. So I am glad we finally have a chance to get to debate on the merits of the bankruptcy reform conference report. 
   Today is Halloween. That is an appropriate day to take the bill up because of our liberal friends who have tried to dress the bankruptcy bill in a scary costume in a tired effort to frighten the American people for crass political purposes. The fact is, the bankruptcy reform bill we are going to vote on tomorrow will do a lot of good for the American people and for the economy. 
   Remember, we are talking about 1.4 million bankruptcies. Remember, we are talking about a very dramatic explosion of bankruptcies just in the last 6 or 7 years. Remember, the last time we had bankruptcy reform, there were about 300 thousand bankruptcies filed per year. 
   That is up to 1.4 million. It is a cost to the economy for every working family in America of paying $400 per year more for goods and services because somebody else is not paying their debt. 
   I want to summarize a few things that this bill will do that my colleagues may not know about as a result of the disinformation campaign waged by our liberal opponents. 
   Right now, for instance, farmers in my State of Iowa, and for that matter in Minnesota and all across the country, have no protections against foreclosures and forced auctions. That is because chapter 12 of the bankruptcy code, which gives essential protections for family farmers, expired in June of this year. 
   Why did chapter 12 expire leaving farmers without a last-ditch safety net? The answer is that chapter 12 ceased to exist because the Senator from Minnesota blocked us from proceeding on this bankruptcy bill we have before us. 
   The bankruptcy bill will restore chapter 12 on a permanent basis. Never again will Iowa farmers or even Minnesota farmers be left with no defense against foreclosures and forced auctions. Congress will fail in its basic responsibilities to the American farmer if we fail to restore chapter 12 as a permanent part of the bankruptcy code. 
   The bankruptcy bill does more for farmers than just make protections for farmers permanent. The bankruptcy bill enhances these protections and makes more Iowa farmers, more American farmers, and even more Minnesota farmers eligible for chapter 12. The bankruptcy bill lets farmers in bankruptcy avoid capital gains taxes. This will free up resources that would have otherwise been forced to go to the Federal Treasury, that would otherwise go down the black hole of the IRS, to be invested in farming operations. 
   We have a real choice. The Senate can vote as the Senator from Minnesota wants us to vote and the Senate can kill this bill, or we can stand up for American farmers and Minnesota farmers. We can do our duty and make sure that family farms are not gobbled up by giant corporate farms. We can give our farmers a fighting chance. I hope the Senate will stand up for our farmers. I hope the Senate does not give in to the bankruptcy establishment that has decided to fight bankruptcy reform no matter who gets hurt, including the Iowa farmer, the Minnesota farmer--the American farmer. 
   What else is in this conference report? The bankruptcy bill will give badly needed protection for patients in bankrupt hospitals and nursing homes. About 10 percent of the nursing homes in America are in bankruptcy, so this is a real problem for senior citizens of America. The Senate protected these people by unanimously adopting an amendment which I offered. Again, my colleagues may be unaware of the importance of this provision because the opponents of bankruptcy reform do not want us to realize what killing the bankruptcy reform bill will really do for those people who are in bankrupt nursing homes. 
   I had hearings on patients in bankrupt nursing homes. As my colleagues know, Congress is trying to put more money into nursing homes through the Medicare replenishment bill. Because we have so many nursing homes that are in bankruptcy, the potential for harm is very real. 
   Through the hearing process in committee, I learned of a situation in California where a bankruptcy trustee simply showed up at a nursing home on a Friday evening and evicted the residents. The bankruptcy trustee did not provide any notice that this was going  to happen. He literally put these frail, elderly people out into the street and changed the locks so they could not get back into the nursing home. The bankruptcy bill that we will vote on tomorrow will prevent this from ever happening again. If we do not stand up and say that the residents of nursing homes cannot just be thrown out into the street, then Congress will have failed in its duty to the senior citizens of America. 
   Again, we have a choice: We can vote this bill down and tell nursing home residents and their families that they can just go fly a kite. I hope the Senate is better than that. I hope the Senate stands for nursing home residents and not for inside-Washington liberal special interest groups that are trying to make a case against this bill but just cannot make a case against the bill. We have not heard them talking about helping farmers through chapter 12. We have not heard them talk about helping nursing home residents through the provisions that are in the Patients' Bill of Rights for nursing home residents. 
   There is more to this bill. The bankruptcy reform bill contains particular provisions advocated by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and by Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. I hope the Senator from Minnesota takes note of those two people being appointed by the President of the United States, Larry Summers being a member of this administration as Secretary of the Treasury, to whom some from the other side of the aisle ought to listen. 
   These provisions will strengthen our financial markets and lessen the possibility of domino-style collapses in the financial sector of our economy. According to both Chairman Greenspan and Secretary Summers, these provisions will address significant threats to our prosperity, the very prosperity that their candidate for President is out talking about every day saying it ought to be protected. 
   Yet again, we have a choice: We can strengthen our financial markets by passing this bill, or we can side with the liberal establishment and fight reform, no matter what the cost is to our society, our economy, the farmers, or the people in nursing homes. 
   The American people want us to strengthen the economy, not turn a deaf ear to the pleas for help from the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and from the Treasury Secretary. I hope the Senate decides to vote to safeguard our prosperity, not put it at risk. 
   The Senator from Minnesota said he wanted us to learn more about the bankruptcy bill. I do, too. Once we look at this bill in its totality I am confident that the Members of this body will see this is a responsible approach, that we will then do the responsible thing: We will vote for cloture, and then we will also do final passage. 
   There is an issue about how the bankruptcy bill will impact people with high medical expenses. Earlier this year, I addressed this very issue, but I want to reassure my colleagues who have remaining questions about this that we have taken care of the problems they have legitimately raised. I do not find fault with their raising them; I only find fault with the fact that we have taken care of them and they have not found it out yet. Before the vote tomorrow morning, I want them to find it out. I want the Senator from Minnesota and I want my friend and colleague from the State of Iowa who raised this issue to be aware of it as well. 
   My friend from Iowa was quoted in the Des Moines Register Sunday as saying about this bill: I am not for it. I think it's a bad bill. He talked with bankruptcy lawyers who said that it will hit hardest those who rack up big bills due to medical problems. 
   As to the Time magazine article that was referred to earlier by the Senator from Minnesota which alleged that medical expenses drove some of the families profiled into bankruptcy, I would just say that this is flat out wrong. 
   To the extent any person in bankruptcy has medical expenses, the bankruptcy bill deals with this issue in two ways. 
   The General Accounting Office to look at the provisions of this bill from the point of view of medical expenses. You can see from this report that came from the General Accounting Office that all medical expenses that are deducted in determining whether you have the ability to go to chapter 7 or chapter 13. The bill is very clear health care expenses are covered because of ``other necessary expenses'' include such expenses as charitable contributions, child care, dependent care, health care, payroll deductions, life insurance, et cetera. All of these are used in determining your ability to repay your debts. 
   So anybody who comes to the floor of the Senate and says that we do not take medical costs into consideration in determining this--those colleagues have not read the bill. 
   There is one additional thing. Somebody can make a case that this does not take care of all of the instances. I do not know how much clearer it can be. But we still have application to the bankruptcy judge, under special circumstances, to argue any case you want to of something that should be taken into consideration in your ability to repay debt. Medical expenses, obviously, fall into that category if this provision is not adequate. But I do not know how much clearer it can be than when you say medical expenses are things that are deductible in making your determination of ability to pay. 
   Several Senators have also, today, made reference to the issue of whether we need to modify the bankruptcy laws to prevent violent abortion protesters from discharging their debts in bankruptcy court. Now the fact is, our current law already prevents this from happening. 
   I am releasing today a memo to me from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that says, without a doubt, no abortion protester has ever, ever gotten away with using bankruptcy as a shield. So I hope my colleagues listen to this nonpartisan source and not the partisan political statements that were made yesterday on the Senate floor in regard to this.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. In other words, once again, just to make it very clear the Congressional Research Service has searched every known case, and I have here, as my colleagues can read, the only case that is available, in which the result is that an abortion protester wasn't able to discharge his debts. The court was very clear that they were not able to get a discharge for that purpose. 
   Mr. President, I see my friend from New Jersey, who is on the other side of the aisle but very supportive of our legislation, who needs time because he supports this legislation from our side of the aisle. So I am going to quit at this point. I ask if I can have the floor back after he has finished.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I hope we had a lot of people who were able to listen all afternoon on this debate. I doubt if very many people listened for 4 hours, but they heard a lot of charges against the bill that were partisan early on this afternoon. Then I said how this bill passed 83-14 originally. That would never have happened--that wide of a margin and bipartisan cooperation--except for the early support and continuing support, and you have seen that demonstrated in the recent speech by Senator TORRICELLI. I thank him for that. 
   I also thank Senator BIDEN of Delaware for also helping us get this bill out of committee and to the floor, and also Senator REID of Nevada, who helped us get through the hundreds of amendments we had filed with this legislation. So this is evidence of just three people on the other side of the aisle who have worked very hard to make this a bipartisan approach, and this legislation, as controversial as it is, would not have gotten as far as it had without that cooperation. I thank Senator TORRICELLI.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. We have had a good discussion on the bankruptcy bill. We will have further discussion postcloture. I think we have a good product. This conference report is basically the Senate-passed bankruptcy bill with certain minimal changes made to accommodate the House of Representatives. The means test retains the essential flexibility that we passed in the Senate. The new consumer protections sponsored by Senator REED of Rhode Island relating to reaffirmation is in our conference report before the Senate. The credit card disclosure sponsored by Senator TORRICELLI is also in this final conference report. We also maintain Senator LEAHY's special protections for victims of domestic violence and Senator FEINGOLD's special protections for expenses associated with caring for nondependent family members. 
   I think it is pretty clear that on the consumer bankruptcy side, we maintain the Senate's position. Anybody who says otherwise has not read the conference report. 
   It is also important to realize how much of an improvement this legislation is for child support claims. The organizations that specialize in tracking down deadbeat fathers think this bill will be a tremendous help in collecting child support.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, listen to the people who actually know how it is in the trenches collecting child support. Don't listen to inside-Washington special interests. Don't listen to academics who have no real world knowledge on this subject. 
   I would add a word about cracking down on the very wealthy individuals who abuse the bankruptcy system. If you listened to the Senator from Minnesota last night, you might have had the impression that the Homestead exemption is a giant loophole that this bill does not deal with. We have had the General Accounting Office look at the question of how frequently the Homestead exemption is abused by wealthy people in bankruptcy. The General Accounting Office found that less than 1 percent of bankruptcy filings in States where there are unlimited Homestead exemptions involving homesteads of over $100,000. That means 99 percent of bankruptcy filings were not abusive. So this is not a loophole. We might say it is a little tiny pinhole. 
   But there is a real problem with very wealthy people filing for bankruptcy under chapter 11, which is the chapter of the bankruptcy code normally left for corporations. Because chapter 11 is not designed for individuals, there are numerous loopholes that allow the wealthy to live high on the hog while paying nothing to their creditors. This bill before the Senate fixes this very major problem so these wealthy people will know they are no longer going to get off scot-free. 
   This bill combats abuse wherever we find it. The Homestead exemption is capped at $500,000 for homes purchased within 2 years prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The chapter 11 loophole is closed. This is what real reform is all about. 
   In sum, in this conference report we preserve the proconsumer amendment adopted in the Senate. We crack down hard on abuses by the wealthy. We help child support claimants in a very major way. This bill is good for the American consumer. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last week, we started to debate a tax bill and it had to be brought down because there wasn't consent to move ahead on it. Before we adjourn and go home, hopefully, we will pass a tax bill. But there are a lot of provisions in that bill that are very good; common sense dictates them; and a lot of these are very bipartisan. So the President has threatened to veto the tax bill. I want to bring up some of these issues and ask the President why he would veto something as good as these provisions, where there is bipartisan consensus that we ought to pass them. 
   Obviously, this bill doesn't contain everything I would like to see in it as a Member of the Senate. As a member of the Finance Committee, we have a chance to be on the ground floor of the drafting of the legislation coming out of that committee. On the other hand, no one person, even a member of the committee, can get everything he wants in the bill. There are even some things in this bill that I don't like, but on balance it will do a lot of good for a lot of people. Therefore, I think it should be enacted. 
   To begin with, the bill contains a number of provisions I authored or coauthored with some colleagues and these are the bipartisan provisions that I am thinking about. For instance, on the issue of pensions, I worked very closely with Senator GRAHAM of Florida--several critical pension provisions. As we anticipate the upcoming retirement of the baby boomers, we are always astonished at how much it is going to cost during their retirement. Retirement is expensive, not only due to rising life expectancy but also because inflation and taxes must be factored into the cost of retirement. 
   We keep insisting that baby boomers--now 10 years away from their retirement--must do more to prepare for that retirement. How can they do that if we don't give them the tools they need? This bill has a lot to do with that because it would make small but significant steps to improve the ability of baby boomers and subsequent generations to prepare for retirement. This bill will increase retirement savings and the national savings rates by allowing workers to save more in their pension plan or in their individual retirement account. 
   How can the President find disagreement on that point--the necessity of having better pension systems, the necessity for updating the individual retirement accounts so more can be saved in those accounts and so more people can be encouraged to save in those accounts? 
   Our bill would restore section 415 limits for pension contributions closer to--not all the way, I am sorry to say--where they were before the 1993 tax increase bill was passed. 
   You remember that 1993 tax increase bill? As Senator MOYNIHAN said on the floor of the Senate, it was the largest tax increase in the history of the world after Bob Dole said it was the largest increase in the history of the country. 
   That was a pretty significant tax increase in 1993. You remember that it passed on the tie-breaking vote of Vice President GORE as he sat right there in the chair. He cast the tie-breaking vote to pass a tax bill that most all Republicans thought was bad for the country. Even some Democrats thought it was bad for the country. When Republicans were in the minority, it would have still died on a 49-to-49 vote--except for the tie-breaking vote of the Vice President. 
   This bill will restore some of the bad aspects that the 1993 tax bill had on pensions contributions with these 415 limits. This bill increases existing IRA contribution limits because under this bill Americans would be able to contribute $5,000 annually. That is an increase up from the current $2,000 maximum contribution. This IRA limit has not been increased in the 18 years since the last time it was effective. 
   For workers without a pension, a pretax individual retirement account is one of the best ways they can save for retirement. This limit is being increased for traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs.  
   Why would the President want to veto that for people who don't have anything other than individual retirement accounts with the present $2,000 limit? You can see what has happened to that $2,000 limit because of inflation. After 18 years, it is not anywhere near the incentive for savings that it was in 1982. 
   Increasing it to $5,000 would be a tremendous incentive for people who don't have pensions to save on their own for retirement, in addition to a baby boom generation that is not going to get out of Social Security as much as my generation will get out of Social Security when they retire. 
   Consequently, that helps make up for some of the shortcomings of the Social Security surplus for the baby boom generation. 
   Further, the bill encourages more people to save through an IRA by accelerating the scheduled increases in IRA income eligibility requirements. Individuals making up to $50,000 and couples making up to $80,000 could participate in an IRA. And the bill allows catch-up contributions for IRAs of an additional $1,500 for those age 50 or over. 
   That will give people an opportunity who have been hit by the inflation-lessening value of the $2,000 individual retirement account now that they are 50 and over to put aside an additional $1,500 to make up for some of the shortcomings of Congress not keeping the $2,000 limit adjusted for inflation. 
   Why would the President want to veto a bill that gives people who are saving an opportunity to make up for some of the shortcomings of Congress over the last 18 years, or even the negative impact of the 1993 tax bill on some of these pension provisions? 
   This bill also encourages small businesses to start and maintain pension plans. 
   One of the problems with the pension law is that there is tremendous discouragement for companies with under 100 employees to go to the expense of setting up a pension plan. For employers with over 100 employees and with the overhead that companies such as that have, it is not such a problem. You find larger corporations have pension plans--not small businesses. 
   The provisions encouraging expansion of coverage are vital and overdue improvements in pension law. 
   I will give you an example. The bill modifies the top-heavy rules which only apply to small businesses. The top-heavy rules have been rightly criticized because they place burdens on small business pension plans. Those same requirements are not applicable to big business. The top-heavy rules make sponsoring a pension plan expensive, complicated, and out of reach for many small employers. In fact, the ERISA Advisory Council in this administration even supported the outright repeal of these top-heavy rules. 
   This bill does not repeal the top-heavy rules, as much as we should, according to the Advisory Council's recommendation. It simply modifies the most onerous aspects of the rules to make having a plan more attractive for small firms. 
   The bill also reduces plan costs and PBGC premiums for small businesses and eases administrative burdens by streamlining onerous pension regulations. These changes help to make the experience of maintaining a plan less difficult for small companies. Further, the bill simplifies annual reporting requirements, eliminates IRS user fees for new plans. These provisions encourage small businesses to provide pension coverage. When small businesses start up new plans, American workers win! 
   The bill contains many provisions which will help rank and file workers specifically. 
   For example, this bill enables workers aged 50 and over to make so-called catch up contributions to their retirement plan. 
   That may sound like something that is new and we shouldn't do. But we allow State and local government workers to make these catchup contributions under current law if they are within 3 years of retirement. 
   I know of no reason why we should not make the benefit of catchup contributions available to all workers--not just for those of State and local governments. We would do so in this bill for workers in for-profit businesses and also not-for-profit businesses. 
   Unfortunately, this bill will not allow workers who make $80,000 or more to make these ``catchup'' contributions despite the fact there is not such an $80,000 limit on the current law for State and local employees. 
   This is a further inequitable situation--something we give State and local government employees but we don't give employees in the private sector. We make up some of that in this legislation but not 100 percent, I am sorry to say. I regret that the bill made this restriction necessary because of negotiations that were going on between the House and Senate. 
   The bill reduces the vesting period for receipt of the employer's matching contribution and defined contribution plans--such as a 401(k)--from 5 years to 3. Make no mistake about it; this is a huge help to many workers. This will particularly help women, maybe because of taking care of an elderly relation, or maybe to start a family or women who are in and out of the workforce or maybe even in some cases men who are in and out of the workforce, but they are more apt to be women. 
   This will give them an opportunity to enhance their match so they can make up for lost time because of not being in the workforce. 
   This bill makes another important change to law that will help low- and modest-income workers. The bill repeals the 25 percent of compensation limit on savings and defined contribution plans. 
   That is a savings barrier that frustrates those of modest income. Most workers in this Nation will be saving through section 401(k) plans or section 403(b) plans or section 457 deferred compensation plans. In a 401(k) plan, for example, the limit for saving is 25 percent of compensation or a maximum of $10,500. Our bill repeals the 25 percent of compensation for the benefit of low and modestly paid workers who could be very thrifty people but are prohibited from saving more. They may want to sacrifice during their work years to have a better quality of life in retirement, but the present limit of 25 percent will keep them from doing that. We ought to make it possible for people who want to look ahead to do more for enhancing their retirement and have more savings for that retirement to be able to do it. This legislation does that. 
   I don't know why the President wants to veto such good provisions for low- and modest-pay workers. In Iowa and much of the Midwest, people are not only thrifty but they are very frugal. Let them save their money if they want to; that money belongs to them, not to the government. 
   The bill also greatly enhances pension portability. Because of these provisions, workers will be able to take their pension money with them when they leave one job to go to another job. Their retirement plan contributions will not be stuck in the plan of their previous employer. When more of those matching contributions are vested as I just mentioned a minute ago, a larger account can be rolled over to an IRA and to the retirement savings plan of a subsequent employer, regardless of whether the employer is for profit, not for profit, or a government employer. 
   Under current law, you can't make those rollovers. The pension portability provisions of this bill are a great way to reduce pension plan leakage. The issue of leakage is real, and I hope we get to examine it in more detail next year and even improve it more than this present legislation does. 
   The business also improves pension funding so benefits will be more secure over the long term. Good pension funding is one of the very foundations of the ERISA law. Most plans are well funded but some are not funded properly at all. We need to be taking a closer look at the underfunded plans and shine the spotlight on them. 
   I want to look at the reasons why some plans have not been better funded, and I hope to look at the status of the underfunded plans in greater detail next year. 
   Finally, I take note for my colleagues and cosponsors that this bill does not include everything I would have liked, and I hope we will be able to do more for pensions according to what Senator GRAHAM of Florida and I suggested in our legislation, which had many cosponsors. 
   When all is said and done, there are a lot of good provisions in this bill, particularly those that deal with women who are in and out of the workplace so  they can make up lost time on their pensions if they want to pay more into it. It does an awful lot for low- and medium-paid employees so that they can make up for the fact, if they want to save more for retirement, that the present 25-percent limit doesn't allow them to do that. 
   The bottom line is, why would any President want to veto such a good bill? 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss a critical issue: adoption of children with special needs. I appreciate the work of my Senate colleagues who cochair the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, Senators CRAIG and LANDRIEU. I thank them for their dedication in furthering adoption. Both have demonstrated their commitment to adoption through word and deed. I respect their efforts and look forward to working with them in the coming years to increase adoptions and to improve the lives of vulnerable children. 
   The adoption tax credit which passed in 1996 was a step in the right direction. It provided a 5-year credit for adoptions of nonspecial needs children. It provided a permanent credit for adoptions of children with special needs. I commend Senator CRAIG for his efforts to extend the provision relating to nonspecial needs adoptions. As Senator CRAIG mentioned on the floor earlier today, while extending the credit is another step in the right direction, we must not rest on our laurels. There is more to be done especially as it relates to adoption of special needs children. The cost of adoption varies widely. Private or international adoptions can cost as much as $30,000 per child. In contrast, adoptions from foster care are often subsidized by the government. 
   Parents who choose to adopt a child from foster care or through a public  agency incur little, if any, expenses related directly to the adoption process. However, they incur a great deal of ``incidental'' expense related to adoption. The adoption tax credit is available only for ``adoption related expenses'' which include necessary adoption fees, court costs, and attorneys' fees. This limitation works directly to the disadvantage of families adopting children with special needs, because the credit does not recognize the overwhelming indirect expenses associated with adopting such a child. These expenses might include fitting the home with a ramp for a wheelchair bound child, to cite one example. 
   When Congress passed the tax credit in 1996, it also directed the U.S. Department of the Treasury to issue a report on the effect of the credit. According to the Treasury report released this month, for tax year 1998, 77,000 adoptions were eligible for a tax credit--31,000 for special needs and 46,000 for non-special needs adoptions. However, of the 31,000 eligible special needs adoptions, only 4,700 received benefits from the tax credit. Compare that with 45,700 of the eligible 46,000 adoptions of non-special needs children that received benefits from the tax credit. 
   Let me put it another way. The Treasury Department reports 15 percent of eligible special needs adoptions received tax benefits compared with 99 percent of eligible non-special needs adoptions which received tax benefits for 1998. For those wondering why so few special needs adoptions benefited from the tax credit in 1998, here is one reason. Average expenses--allowed by current law--were reported for tax year 1998 as $3,540 per special needs adoption and $5,890 per nonspecial needs adoption. When you look at these expenses, it is clear that increasing the amount of the tax credit for special needs adoptions will have little to no impact on families seeking to adopt special needs children. 
   I view this as one of the flaws in current law that must be fixed. Let me be clear: I support the extension of the tax credit for non-special needs adoption. I also support taking a hard look at how the current tax credit impacts special needs adoptions. I urge my colleagues to consider the impact of the tax credit on families adapting special needs children. Again, I commend Senators CRAIG and LANDRIEU for their efforts on behalf of vulnerable children. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 782, the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2000. I join my colleagues in commending Chairmen JEFFORDS and DEWINE and other members of the committee for their hard work and endless energy in bringing this important measure to the floor. 
   In its 35th year, the Older Americans Act continues to meet its mission of helping seniors stay independent and part of their community. The wide array of services available under the act serve as the life-line to millions of seniors across the Nation. 
   Seniors in both rural and urban areas rely heavily on one or more of these services: nutrition services such as home-delivered meals; meals served in congregate settings; transportation services to medical appointments; legal assistance; protection from abuse through the ombudsman program; pension counseling services; in-home services; and volunteer and employment opportunities for older persons. 
   As chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I am particularly pleased that this bill contains the National Family Caregiver Support Program. Over the past 3 years, Senator BREAUX and I have convened a number of hearings to examine the important role that family caregivers play. More than 20 million Americans are caring for an aging or ailing family member. To put this number in perspective, there are fewer than 2 million seniors living in nursing homes. So simply by looking at the numbers, we can conclude that the bulk of caring for our Nation's elderly is carried out by family and friends in the form of informal caregiving. 
   The story of Barbara Boyd, a state legislator from Ohio who testified before the Special Committee on Aging last year, provides a good example of what a caregivers job entails. Ms. Boyd cared at home for her mother who had Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer. Her mother had $20,000 in savings and a monthly Social Security check. That went quickly. Her prescription drugs alone ran $400 a month. Antibiotics, ointments to prevent skin breakdown, incontinence supplies, and other expenses cost hundreds of dollars a month. 
   Ms. Boyd exhausted her own savings to care for her mother, and exhausted herself. She isn't complaining. Family caregivers don't complain. 
   The contribution of family caregivers is enormous. Economically, family caregiving is worth billions of dollars. Emotionally and physically, caregiving is often an overwhelming task. Caregivers know what it entails to juggle personal and professional demands with the responsibilities that accompany caregiving. 
   This is why the Family Caregiving Support Program, now a part of the Older Americans Act bill before us, is critically important to families caring for loved ones who are ill or who have disabilities. The program uses existing resources to meet a pressing need. In this case, the already successful network of aging centers will administer the program. 
   It will serve millions of caregivers throughout hundreds of communities nationwide by providing: respite care; information and assistance; caregiving counseling and training and supplemental services to caregivers and their families. 
   Our country is aging, and that demographic shift creates new needs, and this legislation helps us meet those needs. The Older Americans Act not only serves as a critical safety net, but it embraces important principles that we should uphold in policies that serve our nation's elderly. 
   The act calls attention to the need to prepare our nation's aging population for its own longevity by enhancing health promotion opportunities, improving flexibility for states and area agencies on aging, by modernizing programs and services, and in calling for a White House Conference on Aging in 2005. 
   Finally, the act provides authorization for the thirteen area agencies on aging in my home state of Iowa. In 1999, these funds enabled the agencies to serve nearly 293,000 elderly Iowans. The services the act funds are critical to older Americans in my state and throughout the country.

This conference report is basically the Senate-passed bankruptcy bill with certain minimal changes made to accommodate the House of Representatives. The means-test retains the essential flexibility that we passed in the Senate. The new consumer protections sponsored by Senator REED of Rhode Island relating to reaffirmations is in this report. The credit card disclosures sponsored by Senator TORRICELLI are also in this final conference report. We also maintained Senator LEAHY's special protections for victims of domestic violence and Senator FEINGOLD's special protections for expenses associated with caring for non-dependent family members. 
   So, Mr. President, on the consumer bankruptcy side, we maintained the Senate's position. 
   On the business side of things, we kept Senator KENNEDY's changes to the small business provisions. We have kept the international trade section intact. The financial netting provisions were updated to reflect technical changes suggested by the House. The new netting provisions, however, have universal support. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I want to make one point crystal clear. Because of objections from the other side of the aisle, we have been delayed in getting this conference report up. Because of this delay and these kind of underhanded tactics, Congress has allowed chapter 12 to just expire. Chapter 12 gives family farmers a real chance to reorganize their affairs. But that's gone now. This bill restores chapter 12. This conference report also expands the eligibility for chapter 12 so more farmers will have access to these special protections. Also, Mr. President, this conference report gives farmers in chapter 12 much-needed capital gains tax relief. 
   We hear a lot about helping farmers around here. This bill gives us a chance to do a lot of good. We should get on with passing this bill right away and stop playing political games with our farmers.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Congress has wisely passed and will send to the President for signature H.R. 4733, the energy and water development appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001. I strongly urge the President to sign this vital legislation. 
   Proper management of our Nation's rivers is a concern for many Americans. Our rivers provide us drinking water, transportation, and recreation. They also provide habitat for aquatic life, wildlife, and birds. Good management techniques provide that all of these purposes are taken into account and managed appropriately and fairly. I firmly believe that H.R. 4733 provides for good river management. Specifically, section 103 prohibits the use of funds to revise the Missouri River Master Water Control Manual if the revision provides for increases in springtime water releases during spring

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the support of Senator BREAUX in introducing The Nursing Home Staff Improvement Act of 2000. This is an important piece of legislation for the 1.6 million frail elderly Americans who reside in nursing homes across the nation. 
   A recently released and long overdue report from the Health Care Financing  Administration was the immediate impetus for our bill. This report was first mandated by Congress in 1990. It took the Department of Health and Human Services 10 years to complete Part I of the report. It will take almost another year to finish it. The first part of the study documented, to just about everyone's satisfaction, severe staffing shortages, severe staffing shortages in our nation's nursing homes. While we are waiting for the agency to complete the second and final part of the report, Senate BREAUX and I want to begin to address the staffing crisis in long-term care. Therefore, we are introducing this legislation today. 
   We have a long way to go in meeting the staffing needs of elderly nursing home residents. The bill we are introducing today is not the answer to the problem. It is only a first step. Yet, it is an extremely important step that Congress should take. 
   Before describing the bill Senator BREAUX and I are introducing today, I'd like to take a couple of minutes to go over the history of our committee's work on nursing home quality of care and HCFA oversight of the Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987. It's important for me to emphasize the scope and depth of the problem in order to give my fellow Senators an appreciation of the context out of which this legislation developed. 
   In the fall of 1997, serious allegations were brought to my attention about the quality of care provided in California nursing homes. These allegations claimed that thousands of California nursing home residents had suffered and met with untimely and unnecessary deaths due to malnutrition, dehydration, decubitus ulcers, and urinary tract infections. 
   In an effort to respond to these allegations, I asked the General Accounting Office [GAO] to conduct a thorough review of them and, more generally, of the quality of care in California nursing homes. 
   This review culminated in a 2-day hearing held on July 27-28, 1998, entitled ``Betrayal: The Quality of Care in California Nursing Homes.'' At this hearing, the GAO released its report titled ``California Nursing Homes: Care Problems Persist Despite Federal and State Oversight.'' The findings of this report were explosive and disturbing, illustrating that residents in far too many California nursing homes were threatened by seriously substandard care. 
   One week prior to this hearing, the Clinton administration announced a broad set of new nursing home initiatives to improve enforcement of the Nursing Home Reform Act and, hence, the quality of care in nursing facilities. The administration was acting in response to the impending release of the GAO's study before the scheduled Aging Committee hearing. It acted also in response to a congressionally mandated report by the Department of Health and Human Services on nursing 
   home oversight that was completed just before the hearing. The Department's report uncovered weaknesses on the part of the federal government in its oversight of nursing home quality of care. As the Federal agency with regulatory oversight responsibility over our Nation's nursing homes, the Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA] is responsible for monitoring the compliance of nursing home facilities in meeting the requirements of the Nursing Home Reform Act. For facilities found to be noncompliant, HCFA is responsible for seeing that remedies or sanctions are imposed until the situation is corrected. The administration's report found shortcomings in HCFA's enforcement of the Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987. The agency's report was really a kind of self-indictment. Up to that point, the agency had failed in its responsibility to protect nursing home residents. 
   As part of its multistep initiative, the administration called for improvements in nursing home inspections, better and more timely enforcement against nursing homes that repeatedly violate safety rules, and more attention to quality of care for nursing home residents through prevention of bed sores, malnutrition and dehydration. HCFA was given the responsibility for carrying out this initiative. Under my chairmanship, the Senate Special Committee on Aging has taken an active role in overseeing the implementation of the President's nursing home initiative led by the Administrator of HCFA. At regular hearings and forums, 10 to be specific, I have heard from family members, health care professionals and other long-term care experts about the progress and obstacles in achieving improved nursing home quality of care. 
   Anecdotally, we have heard from the very beginning of our work on nursing home quality of care that understaffing is a root cause of many of the problems facing nursing home residents. Because we desperately needed a more systematic, research-based analysis of this understaffing problem, I had persistently urged HCFA to finish the long delayed staffing report I mentioned earlier. 
   On July 27, 2000, Part I of the report, entitled ``Appropriateness of Minimum Staffing Ratios in Nursing Homes'' was done, and our committee held a hearing to take testimony on it. The report and the hearing presented groundbreaking new information on nursing facility staffing. It was the first time that understaffing, and the consequences of understaffing, were described by a scientifically sound government report. Although a Part II of the report will be required to completely validate the findings of Part I and to analyze a number of other questions raised by Part I, the report showed for the first time what family members and resident advocates had been saying for years: that the majority of nursing homes in our country are dramatically understaffed. Specifically, the report concluded that more than half of nursing facilities around the country employ too few nurses and nurse aides to provide adequate care to residents. 
   As a result of these report findings, I began working on legislation to address the serious problems of understaffing. I started by seeking input from interested parties, including the Administration, nursing home providers, health care professionals, and resident advocates. I finalized my proposal right around the same time the President announced the administration's initiative in this area. The two proposals are similar in their goal to start addressing the problems of understaffing in nursing facilities. 
   As I said earlier, the impetus for my bill was the Report to Congress on the ``Appropriateness of Minimum Nurse Staffing Ratios in Nursing Homes''. The major conclusions of the report are outlined in the Findings section of our bill. The report found that 2.0 nurse aide hours per resident day is a threshold below which residents' lives are at risk, not a standard for the provision of appropriate care. The findings also showed that 2.9 nurse aide hours per resident day are necessary for a nurse aide to complete core resident care tasks, although, because of the very conservative estimates used in this part of the study, 2.9 hours probably significantly understates the staffing levels necessary for a nurse aide to complete these core tasks. Part I of the report also indicated that Part II will analyze and report on minimum staffing levels according to a facility's resident acuity level. I urge Congress and the Administration to be careful in accepting either the 2.0 or 2.9 nurse aide hours per resident day as a minimum goal for nursing facilities until these results are validated and case-mix is included in the equation. It is reasonable to expect that staffing requirements will be substantially higher for facilities that have residents with higher acuity. 
   Our bill calls for the completion of phase two of the study. It requires the Secretary to complete the report not later than July 1, 2001. It adds to the original authority a requirement that the study undertake several tasks that Part I of the report stated would be done in the second phase. Among other things, these tasks include a requirement that the case mix analysis of Part I of the report be further refined and related to appropriate minimum staffing levels. It also adds to the original authority a requirement that the report analyze ``optimal minimum'' caregiver to resident levels and ``optimal minimum'' supervisor to caregiver levels of skilled nursing facilities participating in the Medicare program and nursing facilities participating in the Medicaid program. We modified the original authority in this manner because we believed the public should know not just appropriate minimum  staffing levels, but also what more optimal staffing levels should be in nursing facilities. 
   My bill requires that minimum staffing levels be developed and enforced within one year of the completion of the Report. It requires the Secretary to make recommendations regarding appropriate minimum caregiver to resident levels and minimum supervisor to caregiver levels for skilled nursing facilities participating in the Medicare program and nursing facilities participating in the Medicaid program. The Secretary further shall require through the administrative rulemaking process compliance with appropriate minimum staffing levels as a condition for such facilities to receive payment under those programs. The Secretary would be required to promulgate a final rule not later than one year after completion of the report. 
   The bill requires that the Secretary establish appropriate minimum staffing levels because we believed that a regulatory requirement should establish those staffing levels that will assure that residents receive the quality of care they have a right to receive under the terms of the Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987. We assume that the resident case mix of a facility will have an effect on the appropriate minimum staffing levels of the facility. 
   In order to help States prepare for the minimum staffing levels that the Secretary will promulgate by July 1, 2002, my bill establishes a competitive state grant program. The purpose of the grant program will be to improve staffing levels in nursing facilities in order to improve the quality of care to residents of such facilities. A state that secures such a grant may provide technical or financial support to nursing facilities, labor organizations, nonprofit organizations, community colleges, or other organizations approved by the Secretary. Such support from the state shall be used 
   for projects which will help to increase or improve recruitment and retention of direct care nursing staff. Projects supported by a state must be consistent with the requirements of sections 1818 and 1919 of the Social Security Act. No funds may be made available to county or state-owned nursing facilities. Funds used under a grant to a state may only be used to supplement, not supplant, other funds that the state extends to carry out the activities that may be supported by this grant program. The Secretary shall evaluate this grant program and report to the Congress on her findings not later than six months after completion of the grant program. Authorized to be appropriated are $500,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2001 and 2002. 
   My bill includes a requirement for reporting of accurate information on staffing. Skilled nursing facilities participating in the Medicare program and nursing facilities participating in the Medicaid program would be required to submit staffing information to the Secretary in a form and manner determined by the Secretary. Such information must be attested to as accurate by the reporting facility. The Secretary shall periodically post and update such information on the Nursing Home Compare web site. Skilled nursing facilities participating in the Medicare program and nursing facilities participating in the Medicaid program shall submit to the Secretary a classification of all residents of the facility according to the resident classification system required under current law. My understanding is that nursing facilities should have data on hand and in a form that would be required by the Secretary for reporting to the Department, and, thus, the administrative burden of this requirement should be minimal. 
   My bill includes a requirement for posting of facility staffing information. Facilities participating in the Medicare and Medicaid program would be required to post daily for each nursing unit and each work shift the current number of licensed and unlicensed nursing staff directly responsible for resident care together with the number of residents per unit and shift. 
   Throughout my work and oversight activity of nursing facility quality of care, I have made it a point to stress that there are many good nursing facilities. When a family is in need of a facility for a loved one, it is critically important that individuals shop around and gather information in order to find the best nursing home to meet the needs of their loved ones. The provision in my bill calling for additional reporting of staffing and facility posting of staffing data will help families which need to find a good facility for a loved one's placement. It should also eventually have an effect on the overall quality of care in nursing facilities as families search out and choose better facilities. 
   The information collected by HCFA will help it improve and maintain its Nursing Home Compare web site. This is a database which contains information on every Medicare and Medicaid certified nursing home in the country. You can locate nursing homes in your area and find information about compliance with Medicare and Medicaid regulations based on the facility's most recent survey by state inspectors. Additionally, the web site contains useful phone numbers for survey agencies and long term care ombudsmen on the web site's ``Phone Directory'' page. 
   In closing, I plan to continue my work to improve quality of care and quality of life for nursing home residents. In my position as Chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, I will continue to monitor the quality of care provided to our nation's nursing home residents. With the assistance of the GAO, I will continually assess and monitor the Health Care Financing Administration's progress and commitment to improving the quality of care in nursing homes.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am often critical of this Administration's happy-go-lucky ways when it comes to drug policy. The administration is like the grasshopper in the old fable. It's out there fiddling around when it ought to be working. That said, I do not mean this criticism to detract from the fine work done by the many men and women in our law enforcement agencies. These fine people risk their lives every day to do important and difficult work on behalf of the public. 
   I want to take a moment to highlight some of the achievements and invaluable service provided to this nation by the men and women of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the U.S. Customs Service, and the U.S. Coast Guard. As chairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, I would like to express my  thanks and make known the tremendous pride that I think we should all have in the good people in these agencies. 
   The men and women of the DEA, Customs, and the Coast Guard are dedicated to the protection of the United States and to ensuring the safety of our children and our lives from the devastating effects of the drug trade. They are called on daily to place their lives in harm's way in an effort to keep our nation secure. When they are boarding smugglers' vessels on the seas. When they stop terrorists at the border. When they investigate narcotics trafficking organizations around the globe. When they dismantle clandestine methamphetamine labs, engage in undercover operations, safeguard our ports of entry, or shut down ecstasy peddling night clubs, these fine people risk their lives and well being for all of us. 
   DEA efforts this year include Operation Mountain Express, which arrested 140 individuals in 8 cities, seized $8 million and 10 metric tons of pseudoephedrine tablets, which could have produced approximately 18,000 pounds of methamphetamine. In addition, DEA's Operation Tar Pit, in cooperation with the FBI, resulted in nearly 200 arrests in 12 cities and the seizure of 41 pounds of heroin. The heroin ring they busted was peddling dope to kids, many of whom died. DEA, in conjunction with State and local law enforcement, has also aggressively dismantled hundreds of clandestine methamphetamine labs that poison our urban streets and rural communities. 
   The United States Customs Service has seized over 9,000,000 Ecstasy tablets in the last 10 months. Ecstasy is an emerging problem that affects not only our large cities but many rural areas, including my home State of Iowa. In addition, their Miami River operations have resulted in the seizure of 18 vessels, mostly arriving from Haiti, and over 7,000 pounds of cocaine--a small portion of the over 122,000 pounds of cocaine seized this fiscal year. Finally, the Customs Service has seized over 1 million pounds of marijuana and over 2,000 pounds of heroin as well, often in very risky situations. 
   Coast Guard successes this year include a record-breaking seizure total of over 123,000 pounds of cocaine, including many major cases in the Eastern Pacific. This effort went forward even while still interdicting over 4,000 illegal alien migrants bound for U.S. shores. In addition, the deployment of two specially equipped interdiction helicopters in Operation New Frontier had an unprecedented success rate of six seized go-fast vessels in six attempts. 
   Finally, as announced last month, a joint DEA and Customs investigation--supported by the Coast Guard and Department of Defense--concluded a 2 year multinational case against a Colombian drug transportation organization. The result was the arrest of 43 suspects and the seizure of nearly 25 tons of cocaine, with a retail street value of $1 billion. Operation Journey targeted an organization that used large commercial vessels to haul multi-ton loads of cocaine. This organization may have shipped a total of 68 tons of cocaine to 12 countries in Europe and North America. 
   I believe we should all be proud of the jobs these folks do on our behalf.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the administration is at it again. Late last month, it issued its findings from the latest Household Survey on drug use in America. You would have to look fast to find anything about it. As usual, the administration chose to release the information when no one was looking. And as usual, they did this hoping no one would notice. Given that the majority of the press did not bother to do more than rephrase the press release from the Department of Health and Human Services, it would be hard to figure out just what the 300-odd page report actually said anyway. But neither the press release nor the news accounts do justice to what is not happening. What is not happening is the fact that the drug use picture is not getting any better. 
   When it comes to drugs, the administration just can't say it straight. 
   It continues the trend of its incumbency of labeling bad news or good news and counting on the press to not look beyond the hype. In releasing the latest data, Secretary Shalala says that the report shows the continuing downward trend in drug use. She remarked at the press conference that, ``We've not only turned the corner--we're heading for home plate,''--suggesting that the report shows that the administration has hit a home run. 
   I'm not sure at which game Secretary Shalala is playing, but the most generous interpretation is that she clearly is not reading her own reports or her staff is not telling her what's in them. She needs new glasses or new staff. Despite this happy talk, even HHS's own press release notes that, ``Illicit drug use among the overall population 12 and older remained flat.'' That may be a home run down at HHS but in plain English that means ``no change.'' In my book, ``flat'' does not mean continuing a downward trend. 
   I suppose in an election year ``no change'' in how many people are using drugs is a sign of success. Least ways, that's how this administration sees it. Or, wants you and me to see it. But when you actually get down into the numbers, this ``success'' is not all it appears to be. It shares something with the Cheshire cat--it disappears when you look at it. In true Alice in Wonderland logic, down is not always not up. To follow Shalala's analogy with baseball, what we have here is not a home run but the runner rounding the bases on a foul ball. 
   Before I get to actual numbers, let me say something on background about this year's report. The thing to note is that the administration has changed the methodology for how it collects data for the report. Why is that important? Here's what the report says: ``Because of the differences in methodology and impact of the new survey design on data collection, only limited comparisons can be made between data from the 1999 survey and data from surveys prior to 1999.'' 
   Now, in those years since 1993, that data show dramatic increases in drug use on this administration's watch. During each of those years, however, the administration tried to put a ``spin'' on the information, calling bad news good news. Instead of doing that any more, they have decided to play hide and seek with the information. Don't like the results? Well ..... Change the way you figure them and declare success. As with the Cheshire cat, pretty soon all you're left with is the smile. Even this little bit of sleight of hand, however, does not wholly work. 
   It's really very simple. There has been no significant change for the better in the rate of past month drug use on this administration's watch. More seniors graduating from high school today report using drugs than in any year since 1975. Almost 55 percent of high school seniors now report using an illegal drug before graduation. 
   Use of heroin among young people is on the rise. We are in the midst of a methamphetamine epidemic. If reports are accurate, we are awash in Ecstasy and its use among the young is accelerating. The rate of illicit drug use has increased in six out of the last seven years. 
   The administration tries to hide this fact by reporting on a decline of use among 12-17-year-olds in hopes no one will notice an increase among 18-25-year-olds. But this is a statistical game. Although there is an unfortunate trend in the onset of drug use at earlier ages, onset begins most typically among 15-18-year-olds. By including the earlier years in the count, you disguise the true rate of increase. 
   Even allowing for the moment that the administration spin is true, however, does not change the fact that youthful use of drugs continues spiraling upwards. 
   Today's use levels are 70 percent higher than when this administration took office. The numbers are not getting better. Yet, we have another report and another press release touting victory. This is shameful and to call it anything else is a sham. 
   And just as bad, fewer kids are reporting that using illicit drugs is dangerous--a sure sign of future problems. Especially at a time when we have a well-monied, aggressive legalization campaign that this administration has done little to counter. And this despite a $200 million-a-year ad campaign aimed at exactly these age groups that  this administration touts as a success. The most optimistic thing a recent GAO report had to say about this much-troubled effort is the hope that it might do better. 
   The administration also continues the game of trying to hide its record by lumping the increasing use figures on its watch with the decreasing use figures in earlier administrations. I have complained repeatedly about this gimmick. This is just plain deception. 
   Mr. President, I am often critical of this administration's happy-go-lucky ways when it comes to drug policy. The administration is like the grasshopper in the old fable. It's out there fiddling around when it ought to be working. That said, I do not mean this criticism to detract from the fine work done by the many men and women in our law enforcement agencies.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I indicate to my colleagues I will take a few minutes to speak about the administration's energy policy; however, as I think about it, it is better to entitle it the administration's ``no energy'' policy. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to express my frustration and anger with the Clinton/Gore administration's lack of an energy policy. 
   Each weekend I travel back to my home state of Iowa. In recent weeks I have spent many hours explaining to my constituents why fuel prices are so high, and unfortunately, explaining why prices will likely rise past current levels. I've continually had the displeasure of looking truckers and farmers in the eye and telling them there is no relief in sight. 
   In my home state we are experiencing price levels not seen in a decade, but all I can tell my farmers and truckers is that it is likely going to get worse. 
   In recent weeks, the price of crude oil reached more than $37 a barrel, the highest price in 10 years. Natural gas is $5.10 per million Btu's, double over a year ago. Heating oil in Iowa is around $1.25 a gallon, up 40 cents from this time last year. And propane, a critical fuel which farmers use to dry grain, is up 55 percent since last year. 
   These increases are simply unacceptable. Iowans and the rest of the nation should not have been subjected to these price spikes. 
   Unfortunately, it is the Clinton/Gore administration's lack of an energy policy over the past 7 1/2 years that have directly led to the situation we are facing today. Mr. President, two weeks ago, Vice President GORE stated, and I quote: ``I will work toward the day when we are free forever from the dominance of big oil and foreign oil.'' 
   Yet, since 1992, U.S. oil production is down 18 percent--the lowest level since 1954. At the same time, U.S. oil consumption has risen 14 percent. 
   The result: U.S. dependence on foreign oil under the Clinton/Gore administration has increased 34 percent. We now depend on foreign oil cartels for 58 percent of our crude oil, compared to just 36 percent during the Arab oil embargo of 1973. 
   Some may be wondering how we got here. The answer is clear. This administration is opposed to the use of coal. Opposed to nuclear energy production. Opposed to hydroelectric dams. Opposed to new oil refineries; 36 have been closed, but none has been built in the past eight years. And, this administration is opposed to domestic oil and gas exploration and production.  
   This administration opposes nearly every form of domestic energy production. 
   They do, however, support the use of clean, efficient, and domestically produced natural gas. Currently, 50 percent of American homes are heated with natural gas. In addition, 15 percent of our nation's electric power is generated by natural gas. And while demand for natural gas is expected to increase by 30 percent over the next decade, the administration has not provided the land access necessary to increase supply. 
   As this map demonstrates, federal lands in the Rocky Mountains and the Gulf of Mexico, along with offshore areas in the Atlantic and the Pacific, contain over 200 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Access to this land could provide the resources necessary to meet current demand for nearly ten years. 
   Unfortunately, this land and millions of acres of forest are either closed to exploration or effectively off limits. Simply put, our nation's producers can't meet demand without greater access to the resources God gave us. 
   I am a strong supporter of alternative and renewable energy. I have been a leader in the Senate in promoting alternative energy sources as a way of protecting our environment and increasing our energy independence. 
   My support for expanding the production of ethanol, wind and biomass energy has directly led to the increased use of these abundant renewable energy resources. But right now, these are only part of the solution, and President Clinton and Vice President GORE know that. 
   The administration does not have a plan to deal with our current energy needs. I believe the solution is clear. 
   It is time to support and encourage responsible resource development--using our best technology to protect our environment--to increase domestic energy production. It is time to make use of the vast resources this great country has to offer. Only then will we be free from so much dependence on foreign sources of energy. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today is the celebration for Angels in Adoption and as a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I am proud to participate in such an important event. 
   I commend Diane, and Jim Lewis, from Marion, IA. I nominated this amazing couple as Angels in Adoption. 
   Diane and Jim Lewis are the proud parents of ten beautiful children, eight of whom are adopted. Five of their adopted children have special health care needs, some with physical needs, other with mental health needs. Two of their adopted children are biologic siblings and their adoption has allowed them to stay together. Their family now consists of children from several different ethnic and racial backgrounds. The Lewis' also are frequently foster parents to other children in need, usually those with special health care needs. 
   As special education teachers, the Lewis' have seen the need over many years for foster and adoptive parents for children who have special needs. The Lewis' are truly devoted to making the world a better place for children. By committing their lives to raising children who might not have otherwise had a chance, they have improved the lives of children and given us all something to aspire to. They are Angels in Adoption.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I'm introducing a bill to implement recommendations by the General Accounting Office contained in a report--issued just today--which assesses the efforts of the Department of Agriculture's Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) in implementing the Packers and Stockyards Act. Done correctly, GIPSA is supposed to use the Packers and Stockyards Act as a tool to prevent farmers from being subject to unfair and anti-competitive practices. 
   In August 1999, I asked the GAO to investigate whether GIPSA was taking full advantage of its authority to investigate competition concerns in the cattle and hog industries. In a nutshell, GIPSA has failed in its mission to protect family farmers. GIPSA has failed to ensure fairness and competitiveness in the livestock industry. The report recommends that significant changes need to be made to GIPSA's investigation and case management, operations, and development processes, as well as its staff resources and capabilities, in order for it to effectively perform its Packers and Stockyards duties. 
   The news of this administration's failure of duty couldn't come at a worse time. Family farmers and independent producers are experiencing some of the lowest prices for their commodities in years. In the meantime, agribusiness has become so concentrated that family farmers are concerned they can't get a fair price for their products. They are seeing fewer options for marketing their commodities and they are having to sustain increased input costs. The extent of concentration in agribusiness has raised serious concerns about the ability of companies to engage in unfair practices. Most of these complaints involve the livestock industry. 
   The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are responsible for protecting the marketplace from mergers, acquisitions and practices that adversely affect competition. But GIPSA, under the Packers and Stockyards Act, has substantial, explicit authority to halt anti-competitive activity in the livestock industry by taking investigative, enforcement and regulatory action. But GIPSA has done none of this. All we hear are calls for more legislation or more money. It's clear that this is just another example of this administration passing the buck to Congress by calling for new legislative authority, when they are the ones that have failed to exercise the broad authority they already have. If USDA won't use their existing powers, what makes us in Congress think they'd use new powers? 
   As I've stated, I asked for this GAO investigation because I suspected that USDA had not been doing enough to ensure that small and mid-sized producers were not being harmed by possible anti-competitive activity in the livestock industry. So, to tell you the truth, I wasn't surprised when GIPSA got a failing grade. But I can tell you that I am outraged by USDA and this administration's lack of priorities in doing their job and their failure to enforce the laws on the books. Let me make this clear, this USDA is not a friend to the family farmer. And the Clinton-Gore administration is one to talk about us here in Congress doing nothing about concerns in agriculture. Maybe I need to define what ``nothing'' means. I think that this GAO Report defines ``nothing'' quite well. 
   Let me summarize the findings of the GAO report. The report confirms that GIPSA's authority to halt anti-competitive practices and protect buyers and sellers of livestock is quite broad and, in fact, go further than the Sherman Act in addressing anti-competitive practices. 
   The report also found that two major factors have impacted GIPSA's capability to perform their competition duties. Investigation and case methods, practices and processes are inadequate or non-existent at GIPSA. 
   For example, the GAO found that GIPSA's investigations are planned and conducted primarily by economists and technical specialists without the formal involvement of USDA's Office of General Counsel attorneys from the beginning of an investigation. Attorneys only get involved when a case report is completed. On the other hand, DOJ and FTC have teams of attorneys and economists that perform investigations of anti-competitive practices, with the attorneys taking the lead from the outset to ensure that a legal theory is focused on the potential violation of law. The GAO also found that GIPSA does not have investigative methods designed for competition cases, nor does it have investigation guidance for anti-competitive practice methods and processes. In contrast, DOJ and FTC have detailed processes and practices specifically designed for these kinds of cases. 
   GIPSA is also inadequately staffed. The GAO indicated that although the agency has hired additional economists, they are relatively inexperienced. More importantly, even though I understand there are around 300 lawyers in the General Counsel's Office, the report found that the number of attorneys working on GIPSA matters has actually decreased from 8 to 5 since GIPSA reorganized in 1998. To add insult to injury, they are not all assigned full-time to GIPSA's financial, trade practice, and competition cases; some have other USDA responsibilities as  well. Consequently, very little attorney time is actually dedicated to competition cases, thanks to the low priority this administration has placed on the problem. 
   The GAO Report's recommendations are straightforward. It recommends that GIPSA come up with investigation and case methods, practices and processes for competition-related allegations, in consultation with the DOJ and FTC. 
   It recommends that GIPSA integrate the attorney and economist working relationship, with attorneys at the lead from the beginning of the investigation. It also suggests that USDA might want to report to Congress on the state of the cattle and hog market, as well as on potential violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act. In effect, the GAO provides a blueprint for how GIPSA should be run, and the policies and procedures it should have in place to protect family farmers. 
   So, the GAO is telling us that USDA and GIPSA just haven't gotten their act together to function like a competent agency. And they are recommending that USDA and GIPSA do something that makes common sense--develop a successful plan, train your people, get guidance from the experts, write effective processes and procedures designed for competition cases, hire antitrust lawyers. 
   Let me give you some more information. Way back in October 1991, the GAO issued another report which determined that, despite increased concentration in the livestock industry, GIPSA's monitoring and analysis were not up to speed to identify anti-competitive practices. Instead, GIPSA still placed its primary emphasis on ensuring prompt and accurate payment to livestock sellers. In 1997, USDA's own Office of Inspector General found that GIPSA needed to make extensive improvements to its Packers and Stockyards Program to live up to its competition responsibilities. The 1997 OIG report found that GIPSA did not have the capability to perform effective anti-competitive practice investigations because it was not properly organized, operated or staffed. It recommended that GIPSA make extensive organizational and resource improvements within the department, as well as employ an approach similar to that used by DOJ and FTC, by integrating attorneys and economists from the beginning of the investigative process. Sound familiar? 
   Because of the large number of complaints about competition in the livestock industry, one would have thought that USDA and the administration would have put addressing competition concerns in every way possible and ensuring the effective functioning of GIPSA at the top of their list. USDA and the administration had clear warnings in the 1991 GAO Report and the 1997 OIG Report that there were significant problems, yet they've been ineffective in addressing them. In fact, USDA agreed with the reports and acknowledged that they needed to reevaluate guidelines and regulations, as well as make appropriate organizational, procedure and resource changes. So why wasn't this done? Why weren't these concerns addressed in an effective manner? Why still all this mismanagement? Why still no guidance, policies or proceures? 
   And now this GAO report raises even more troubling questions. What are USDA's real priorities? Are ag concentration and anti-competitive activity of any concern to the Clinton/Gore administration? How many violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act have slipped through the cracks because of GIPSA's failure to execute its statutory responsibility? My hearing on September 25, next week in my Judiciary Subcommittee, will explore these and other questions. 
   I can already see the finger-pointing to come from USDA. They are going to say they need more time. Well, they've known since 1991 that they had problems, isn't that time enough to fix them? They are going to say that we haven't given them enough money. But the fact is that Congress has increased GIPSA and USDA OGC funding almost every year since 1991. If USDA saw that they needed more antitrust lawyers for their Packers and Stockyards competition cases, they should have dedicated more of their funds to hiring them. The problem is this administration's priorities. The problem is this administration's inability to take responsibility. 
   In any event, it's clear that we can't count on this administration's Agriculture Department to reorganize and fix the problems identified in this GAO report. USDA promised to respond to similar problems identified in the 1991 GAO Report and 1997 OIG report, yet did nothing of any real effect to change the situation. Promises made to farmers and promises broken. It's clear to me that recent movements on the part of USDA to address some of these issues are just another way to deflect criticisms of their failure to act. And my concerns continue to grow. Legislation is necessary to force USDA and GIPSA to do their job. It's obvious that if we leave it to this administration, it will be the same old, same old. And the family farmer will continue to wait for something to happen. USDA has broken too many promises already. 
   No more. My bill, the Packers and Stockyards Enforcement Improvements Act, will require USDA to implement GAO's commonsense recommendations, GAO's blueprint for success. Specifically, my bill will require that, within one year, USDA implement the recommendations of the GAO report, in consultation with DOJ and FTC. My bill will require that, during this one year implementation period, USDA will work with DOJ and FTC to identify anti-competitive violations and take enforcement action under the Packers and Stockyards Act. My bill will require USDA to set up a training program for competition investigations within one year. In addition, my bill will require USDA to provide Congress with a yearly report on the state of the cattle and hog industries and identify activities that represent potential violations under the Packers and Stockyards Act. 
   Finally, my bill will require USDA to report back to Congress within a year on what actions it has taken to comply with this act. 
   This is a good government bill. It doesn't change the authority of USDA to address anti-competitive activity in the livestock industry under the Packers and Stockyards Act. Obviously, there's no need to do that--USDA already has all the authority they need. Instead, my bill does something a lot more fundamental--it makes USDA and GIPSA reorganize, regroup and revamp their Packers and Stockyards program so they can do their job. Hopefully this will help change USDA's failure to take its current statutory responsibilities seriously. It seems to me that this is a recurring theme, the administration not enforcing the laws on the books and then blaming others for their inadequacies. But the report is clear. They are the problem. This GAO report is important because it has identified what the real problem is: USDA and the administration are asleep at the switch.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am here on the floor at this particular time to ask the President of the United States who ``they'' are, and I hope the word ``they'' includes the President of the United States. I hope the President of the United States is the chief ``they.'' I hope we don't get into a position of debating what the definition of the word ``they'' is. The Constitution is pretty clear--the President of the United States has all the executive power that exists in our Government. 
   That is the background for my visiting with you about the Wen Ho Lee case, the President's comments last week in regard to the release of Wen Ho Lee, and how the executive branch treated this Chinese American. 
   This is the latest instance of President Clinton failing to take responsibility and refusing to hold himself accountable for the actions of his administration.  
   The background of Wen Ho Lee--for those who may not have been following this over the last year--is that the Government has recently agreed to let this former nuclear scientist at Los Alamos Laboratories plead guilty to a relatively minor charge and go home with a slap on the wrist. 
   I think we all agree that his release is the justifiable thing to do. But it was only a short time ago that the executive branch was claiming that Wen Ho Lee was such a serious threat to American national security that he belonged in solitary confinement and in shackles with practically no ability for Mr. Lee to even contact his family. Now, after this long period of time in confinement, he gets a slap on the wrist and his freedom. 
   Obviously, the executive branch of Government couldn't back up its allegations with proof or this case would not have settled as it did. Despite the dire pronouncements made to the public about Wen Ho Lee, the fact is the Government didn't even have a case. It had only suspicions. Mr. Lee has, of course, paid a very high price for the suspicions of some in the executive branch. 
   Maybe because Lee is Asian American, there is not the outcry over the loss of civil liberties that there would be had Lee been a member of some other minority group. The same people who speak up against some minorities being mistreated because of civil liberties evidently don't seem inclined to speak up in the case of an Asian American. 
   Mr. Lee's treatment has caused widespread public outcry. How can this happen in America where we treasure freedom and where the rule of law has been the basis for our country's law going back to the setting up of the colonies? How could the government damage the reputation of a citizen by labeling him as a spy for the Communist Chinese, lock him away for 9 months of solitary confinement, and then just simply drop the case? Our Government has damaged its reputation by the way it handled the Lee case. 
   The American people are outraged. Pundits and political observers have raised legitimate questions about the abusive way in which Mr. Lee was treated by the executive branch of Government. 
   In the midst of this justifiable criticism, President Clinton decided that it was time for him, as President of the United States, to chime in. President Clinton happens to be the Chief Executive Officer of the country. He thinks, like the rest of us, that the executive branch of Government may have abused its power in the way it went after Mr. Lee and kept him confined for such a long period of time. 
   What troubles me about President Clinton's comments is that he acts as if he, as President of the United States, is just some sideline observer who doesn't have anything to do with the way the laws in this country are enforced. 
   As every high school student learned in their civics classes, the executive power of the Government is vested in the President of the United States, article II, section I:  
   The executive power shall be vested in the President of the United States of America.  
   This is pretty simple language and pretty definitive. These words means the President is in charge of law enforcement. The President is in charge of protecting our national security. 
   So, even if the President delegated some of his power to the Attorney General, the President is responsible for what happened to Mr. Lee. 
   I hope the President can just once before he leaves office, and as part of his legacy, say he is responsible for what happened under his watch. I would like to have him say: I and the people I appointed are responsible for what happened to Mr. Lee. 
   But, no. He said in his news conference ``they'' did this--``they'' held him; ``they'' had these charges. It was always ``they,'' ``they,'' ``they.'' 
   I happen to think President Clinton is the chief ``they.'' He is above all the rest of the ``theys.'' 
   It happens that President Clinton seems to think the Justice Department is some agency of government outside of his control. Surely the President knows better than this. The Washington Post certainly does. This past Saturday, the Post editorial page commented on the Wen Ho Lee case:  
   President Clinton asks us to see him as one more commentator troubled by the case, rather than as the head of the government that brought it.  
   In other words, I think the Washington Post is saying the President is, in fact, the chief ``they;'' or he is in charge of all the rest of the ``theys.'' Of course, as far as I am concerned, the Washington Post is right on this point. 
   The nation is waiting for real leadership, not another evasion or more misdirection. President Clinton may be an ``artful dodger,'' but this is one dodge that just won't work. The American people elected President Clinton to be in that office so he could lead, not blame subordinates. 
   The Constitution is crystal clear that the President has the ultimate responsibility of leadership and the ultimate power of our executive branch. It is high time for President Clinton to follow the Constitution and take responsibility for the sorry actions that took place in regard to Mr. Wen Ho Lee during this administration. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Commerce Committee had an oversight hearing on violence marketed to children by the entertainment industry. This oversight is long overdue. I congratulate Senator MCCAIN for holding such a hearing. 
   The purpose of the hearing was to look at the FTC study that just came out that charged the entertainment industry with marketing of violent films and videos to children. 
   The bottom line is that as we have heard President Clinton and Vice President Gore respond to the FTC rulings, there is an inconsistency in their responses and how they have generally interacted with Hollywood over the last 8 years. 
   I establish as a basis for my remarks some quotes from the various newspapers of the recent month and a half. For instance, on September 12, the Washington Post, commenting on this, said:  
   In separate time zones, but with one message, President Clinton and Vice President Gore delivered a joint threat to the entertainment industry today that harsh regulation could come if the makers of explicit and violent movies, recordings and video games do not stop advertisement at children.  
   I continue to read from the same story in the Washington Post. Later on it says:  
   But Gore has not always appeared consistent on this issue. In 1987, as he was gearing up for his first presidential campaign, Gore and his wife held a meeting with rock music executives in which Gore apologized for his role in a 1985 Senate Commerce Committee hearing on rock music lyrics. A tape of the meeting was obtained by Daily Variety. Tipper Gore, who had testified at the hearing on behalf of the Parents Music Resource Center, called the hearing ``a mistake.....that sent the wrong message.'' 
   Last year, the Los Angeles Times reported that Gore met privately with potential donors in the entertainment industry in July 1999 and told them the idea for the FTC study--  
   Which I just referred to--  
   was Clinton's and not his, and that he was not consulted.  
   Then on August 18, the Chicago Tribune shows an inconsistency in how they react and work with Hollywood at different times. It says:  
   In southern California, records show, Gore and the Democratic National Committee so far have raised $10.3 million--a 13 percent increase--at a time when the DNC's nationwide fundraising pace is lagging behind 1996, when Clinton ran for re-election.  
   Quoting further in the article:  
   Gore generated $443,050 in hard money from the entertainment industry, 86 percent more than Clinton in 1996. He also took in $340,375 from lawyers and lobbyists, a 66 percent increase, and $124,350 from real estate interests, an 82 percent jump.  
   Now I will quote from the August 18 Los Angeles Times. The reference in the headline reads: ``.....The Vice President is building upon that legacy'' to follow Clinton's close relationship with Hollywood. ``He has already raised more than 
   the President did in '96.'' 
   Later on in that article, referring to a person whom I do not know--his name is Reiner:  
   But Reiner.......has expressed greater support for Gore than he had for Clinton. He has  hosted fund-raisers for Gore at his home, stumped for him on television and even flew to Ohio to join him at a campaign event last week.  
   A reference to the fact there were Hollywood types campaigning strongly for the Vice President because there was some chagrin in Hollywood, at least for a short period of time, about whether he is a legitimate crusader against Hollywood violence, which Senator LIEBERMAN is, that he was being selected as Vice President. 
   The Los Angeles Times reports on August 17, 2000--and this was Vice President GORE doing this.  
   The effort to blunt any dissent over Lieberman's selection started as word leaked out of his ascension to the ticket. Gore, according to an associate, made a round of soothing calls to Hollywood figures, including moguls Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen.  
   I have already congratulated Senator MCCAIN for holding this hearing. We need to do what we can to stop violence being peddled by Hollywood so our young people do not think it is right to kill anybody. I do think it is wrong for the very people who are carrying on this crusade--the Vice President and the President--schmoozing at the same time they are carrying on this campaign with Hollywood. 
   I want to comment on Vice President GORE's curious interest in criticizing the entertainment industry for producing violent movies, television shows, and video games that promote immorality and attack traditional family values. 
   I do not doubt for 1 minute, as I have already indicated, that Senator LIEBERMAN is very sincere in his views on this matter, but the fact is that the Vice President is at the top of the Democratic ticket, and everyone knows that he will set the real tone should he be elected in November. 
   The fact is that the Vice President has taken a record amount of money from the entertainment industry. I refer, again, to the Chicago Tribune. The Vice President and the Democratic National Committee have raised $10.3 million from southern California as of August this year, a 13 percent increase over 1996, and the Vice President has gotten $443,050 in hard money from the entertainment industry, 86 percent more than President Clinton received in 1996. 
   The Clinton-GORE administration has been a real friend to the Hollywood liberals over the years. I guess all of those campaign contributions have had some effect. I think that when Hollywood producers hear one of their best friends in Washington criticize the entertainment industry, they just look to their ``cozy relationship'' with Clinton-Gore. The Hollywood moguls know GORE does not really mean what he says; at least that is a clear signal. Hollywood knows GORE does not really want to ``rock the boat.'' 
   For instance, how many times at these fundraisers that they had was the opportunity taken to protest the violence coming from Hollywood through their films and their videos? 
   According to the L.A. Times, the Vice President privately told a group of Hollywood donors that he had nothing to do with President Clinton's effort to study whether Hollywood markets violence to children and that he was not consulted on the issue. That was in 1999. 
   But now that the study is out--this study came out this week--Vice President GORE is talking it up and taking credit. The Vice President is acting as if he has not made private promises to his big campaign donors and to Hollywood notables that they should not worry about a crackdown on Hollywood excesses. But we have heard all of this before. 
   In 1988, then-Senator GORE made similar promises after holding hearings into offensive music lyrics. It appears the Vice President will say what he wants to say, what he needs to say, to anybody he needs to say it to, just to get elected. I think the American people will not be fooled by these kinds of bait-and-switch tactics. They know a phony act when they see one. 
   In fact, Hollywood liberals are actively campaigning for the Vice President. For example, according to press reports, stars and movie producers have hosted GORE fundraisers, and some have even stumped for GORE around the country. So much then for standing up to Hollywood as opposed to schmoozing with them. 
   The American people need their leaders to take a genuine interest in building a civil society of which we can all be proud. We need leaders who will make sure children are protected from violence and immorality peddled under the guise of entertainment. 
   What we do not need is the Vice President telling the American people one thing while--with a wink and nod towards Hollywood, towards the big shots of the movie industry--assuring the Hollywood elite he does not mean what he says as he pockets their cold cash. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as a co-sponsor of Senator THOMPSON's legislation on weapons proliferation, I  want to tell my colleagues why I will not support this, or any other effort, to amend H.R. 4444, the legislation to authorize the permanent extension of nondiscriminatory trade treatment to the People's Republic of China. 
   First, I want to say that I fully agree with Senator THOMPSON's goals. He wants to reduce the threat posed to the United States by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
   So do I. 
   He wants to curb the transfer of technologies to rogue nations that might destabilize regional security, threaten our allies, or endanger United States forces. 
   And so do I. 
   In my view, this Administration has not done nearly enough to safeguard the United States from the growing threat of nuclear proliferation. 
   You don't have to take my word for it. 
   For anyone who thinks that the weapons anti-proliferation efforts of this administration have been adequate, and that the world is a safer place under the Clinton-Gore team, just take a look at the Cox Commission Report. 
   Or the report of the Rumsfeld Commission. 
   Both of these reports are compelling, and highly disturbing. 
   But, this is neither the time nor the place to deal with these issues. 
   The real issue today is whether we will approve this measure to extend permanent normal trade relations with China, and thereby allow the United States to take advantage of a market-opening trade agreement we helped negotiate. 
   An agreement that will mean new sales, more jobs, and increased prosperity for America's farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers, our service providers, and our manufacturing sector. 
   I want to make this very clear: 
   A vote to amend PNTR, at this late stage, is a vote against PNTR. 
   If we change so much as one word of this PNTR legislation, it will not be consistent with the legislation passed by the House of Representatives, and will be sent back to that chamber. 
   With less than 20 legislative days to go in this session of Congress, that would kill the PNTR bill for this year. 
   And if PNTR is defeated, China will not suffer. 
   China will still enter the WTO, whether we normalize our trade relations with them or not. 
   If China enters the WTO, and we have not approved permanent normal trade relations status, our farmers, our service providers, our manufacturers will be forced to sit on the sidelines. Our competitors from Europe, Asia, and Canada will have China's market all to themselves. They will win a competitive advantage over us. Perhaps a permanent one. 
   The only ones who would suffer would be our farmers, and our workers. 
   Putting ourselves at this sort of disadvantage will hurt our economy. 
   And it will not help our national security one bit. 
   The problem I have with linking trade with national security, or with human rights, or with any other worthy cause, is that this sort of linkage assumes that we can only do one thing, but not the other. 
   We can either have human rights in China, or we can have free trade. 
   We can either protect our national security, or we can trade with China and jeopardize our security. 
   I believe these assumptions are false. 
   Our relationship with China is complex. It has more than one dimension. 
   And I believe the United States is big enough, smart enough, tough enough, and sophisticated enough to have more than a one-dimensional China policy. 
   We can have an effective human rights policy with China. 
   We can have a tough and effective national security policy. 
   And we can have a trade policy that serves our vital national interests. 
   We can do all of this at the same time, and do it well. 
   But not if we amend this bill and send it back to the House. 
   One last thing. 
   I read this morning that thousands of anti-globalization protesters rioted today at the meeting of the World Economic Forum in Melbourne, Australia. Scores of people were hurt. Almost one quarter of the delegates were locked out of the summit by the rioters. 
   One Australian official was trapped for almost an hour in his vandalized car. 
   Leaders of the riot claimed they were successful in blockading the conference. 
   ``I think we can claim victory tonight'', one of the protest leaders said. 
   The Melbourne riots come right on the heels of similar anti-globalization riots in Davos, Switzerland, Washington, DC, and last December in Seattle. 
   These riots are profoundly disturbing. They appear to be growing in intensity and frequency around the world. And they are terribly misguided. 
   Since the United States helped create the global trading system in 1947, free trade has lifted millions of people out of poverty. 
   As poor nations have gained new prosperity, they have improved the health and education of their citizens. 
   They have invested in new technologies to clean up the environment. 
   And all the nations of the world's trade community have helped keep the peace, even during the bleak days of the Cold War. 
   Today, China is on the verge of rejoining the world trade community it abandoned in 1950. 
   A vote for normalizing China's trade relations with the United States on a permanent basis will reaffirm our support for a member-driven, rules-based trading system. 
   It will highlight the importance of trade as a way to achieve prosperity for all, including the world's poorest nations. 
   And it will repudiate those who would tear down the most successful multilateral trade forum the world has ever known. 
   I urge my colleagues to support a clean PNTR bill, with no amendments.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk again about the mess at the Department of Justice. As we all know, this Justice Department has been subjected to criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike for mishandling cases. Yesterday, the Justice Department's own Inspector General completed a lengthy report which points to ``egregious misconduct'' by senior officials in the Justice Department. That phrase ``egregious misconduct'' is not my phrase. That's the conclusion of the IG. 
   This is a sordid story which began in 1997, when I wrote to Attorney General Reno asking her not to fire a whistle blower who had alleged misconduct in two components of DOJ's Criminal Division--The International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program, also known as ``ICITAP'', and the Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training, also known as ``OPDAT''. These offices train prosecutors and police in other countries to enforce laws in a way that respects the rule of law and human rights. As such, these offices are heavy consumers of intelligence from various intelligence gathering agencies that monitor human rights abuses. The IG concluded that some Senior DOJ Officials in these offices intentionally refused to follow Government Regulations regarding the handling of classified information and recommended discipline for three DOJ officials. 
   The allegations I received in 1997 related to serious security breaches as well as the misuse of Government authority for the personal and financial benefit of top DOJ Officials. I was shocked to hear allegations that Bob Bratt, the Executive Officer of the Criminal Division, who had supervisory control over these offices, and Joe Lake who was an assistant to Mr. Bratt, used their Government positions to get visas for Russian women that Brat met through a ``match making service.'' I was shocked to hear allegations that a Senior Justice Official was allowed to retire early with an early retirement bonus, and then be re-hired at DOJ as an outside contractor just a few months later in clear violation of Federal law. 
   But, these all proved to be accurate. To quote the Inspector General's report ``We concluded that Bratt and Lake committed egregious misconduct'' in obtaining visas for Russian women to enter the country under false pretenses. These women had been denied visas in the past and were only given visas when Bratt assured Embassy Officials in Moscow that these women would be working for DOJ in the future. The IG concluded that this was a false statement. The IG concluded that Bratt and Lake offered explanations for their conduct and denials regarding the visas for the Russian women which were ``not credible.'' The IG also concluded that Bratt's ``intimate involvement'' with these Russian women left him vulnerable to blackmail and presented a security concern. The IG report indicates that Bratt may have pressured other DOJ employees to mislead the IG inspectors. And the IG found that Bratt had DOJ computers sent to a school in Virginia where a girlfriend works. 
   Clearly, this is the kind of misconduct which should be exposed and corrected. This is why I work so hard to support whistle blowers when they ask for my help. 
   But it doesn't end there. The IG also concluded that Joe Lake violated Federal Law when he took an early retirement bonus of $ 25,000. One provision of the early retirement program prohibited lake from working for DOJ for 5 years after his retirement. Yet, two months after he retired, Lake was hired as a consultant at DOJ reporting to his old friend Bob Bratt. This was patently illegal, and the IG recommends that DOJ seek the return of lake's $ 25,000 retirement bonus. 
   The IG also noted many of the hiring practices at issue were--to use the IG's own words--``questionable.'' For instance, the IG report described the hiring of a bartender at a local restaurant frequented by the Associate Director of ICITAP. The bartender was originally hired to work at DOJ on a temporary basis. After this bartender-turned-Government lawyer began a personal relationship with Bratt, Bratt hired her on a permanent basis at DOJ. Another example cited by the IG involved an ICITAP official hiring the father of an ex-spouse's step-children even though he had very little experience. Again, the American people deserve better from their Government. 
   The IG report also indicates that Senior Justice officials improperly used frequent flier miles. The IG recommends that security clearances be  granted to ICITAP officials only after evaluating their poor record of complying with security regulations. 
   I wrote to the Attorney General on this matter in 1997. It's taken until September of 2000 for DOJ to finish its report. Just last month, Mr. Bratt was allowed to retire from Government service. The IG report indicates that the IG would have recommended that Bratt be fired from the Justice Department if he were still working for DOJ. It seems to me that Senior Justice officials may need to be held accountable for letting Bratt retire rather than face the music for his misdeeds. As Chairman of the Administrative Oversight Subcommittee on the Judiciary Committee, I intend to keep a close eye on the Criminal Division, in light of this sorry Record.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. In the first place, I ask unanimous consent, to the amendment I have had filed at the desk that was just accepted, that the additional cosponsors be added of Senators DEWINE, LUGAR, and KERREY. I thank Senator DOMENICI and Senator REID for accepting the amendment. 
   Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to introduce a critically important amendment to the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, and I would like to thank Senators GRAMS, VOINOVICH, DEWINE, LUGAR, KERREY of Nebraska, and SNOWE for joining me in this effort. 
   This amendment would require the administration to provide Congress their plan to address the increasing costs in home heating fuels by September 30. Quite frankly, this plan is long overdue. 
   Mr. President, on July 3 of this year, I wrote President Clinton and Energy Secretary Richardson to bring their attention to the ever-increasing price of natural gas. I also shared my concern regarding the inadequacy of natural gas supplies to meet demand through the summer and into this winter. I requested that the President inform me of the actions he planned to take to address the higher-than-normal heating bills my constituents will surely face this winter. 
   Jack Lew, Director of the Office of Management and Budget responded to my letter on July 31. Regrettably, Mr. Lew thanked me for expressing my concerns regarding the increase in fuel costs this past winter. 
   Let me repeat that. In response to my letter about the inadequacy of home heating fuel for the upcoming winter to the President, I received a letter thanking me for my concerns about the increase in fuel costs last winter. Mr. President, it is this type of irresponsible behavior that has led this country into the next energy crisis. 
   Today, natural gas is at a record high near $5.00 per million BTU's, while supplies hover below the five-year average. This 50 percent increase will certainly impact the more than 80 percent of Iowa households which use natural gas to heat their homes. 
   Furthermore, home heating oil is near a 10-year high, at 98 cents per gallon, already 41 percent above the average price last fall and winter. And crude oil remains near a 10-year high. 
   While testifying before the Senate Agriculture Committee on July 20, Secretary Richardson stated that the administration had developed a plan and was in the process of finalizing a plan to address potential home heating oil and natural gas shortages. Mr. Secretary, I have not seen your plan. I want to see the plan. 
   I won't allow the Department of Energy to sit idly by as home heating fuels double. For this reason, I am offering this amendment to require the Department of Energy to provide a report to Congress by September 30, 2000, detailing their plan to address the high cost of home heating oil and natural gas. 
   I believe this amendment will force the administration to take a much more active role in remedying the home heating fuel crisis.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I don't know whether other colleagues of mine have spoken today on this issue, but I would be surprised if some have not. I have not had an opportunity to hear what anybody else has said. It is with some dismay that we are, once again, faced this year with very high energy costs. The headline that I have in front of me from the Washington Post for today says, ``Oil Prices Hit a Ten-Year High; As Americans Face Costly Winter, U.S. Pressures OPEC on Output.'' 
   In that headline, several things are considered: First of all, we have the highest worldwide energy prices since the gulf war, and the war was responsible for the high oil prices at that particular time--not OPEC cutting back oil, not bad U.S. domestic energy policy. The other thing that hits us is that the consumer is going to end up paying for this. Both points highlight that this administration has been promising us an energy plan to deal with this crisis situation. Let me be clear on that--an energy plan not for the future but to deal with the immediate crisis. 
   I had an opportunity to write a letter to the administration earlier this summer asking them to put forth a plan to meet potential shortages of fuel oil, propane gas, and natural gas--all used in home heating--so the health of our seniors is not threatened when we get cold weather. I have not had a response to that letter. Nothing of substance has come from my request. 
   I had a chance during the month of July, when Senator LUGAR had a hearing before the Agriculture Committee with Secretary of Energy Richardson, to ask questions of Secretary Richardson, and put forth the necessity of his coming forward with just such a plan. Yet nothing has been forthcoming. I should say nothing but what the story in the Post reminds us of--that this Administration's energy policy seems to consist of either the President of the United States or the Energy Secretary getting down on hands and knees to OPEC countries--and they tend to emphasize dealing with the Arab nations on this issue--to please pump more oil, produce more oil, send more oil to the industrialized parts of the world, particularly the United States. That is all we are seeing at this point. That is all we saw last spring from this administration to get the price of energy down--begging the OPEC nations, and particularly the Arab oil-producing nations, to send more oil. That is their response to the crisis. 
   This prompts me to tell my colleagues what I hope I will be able to do tonight as we discuss the energy and water bill. Since I have not had a response to my request to the Energy Secretary when he was before the Senate Agriculture Committee, and since I have not had a response to my letter to the President, as well as a letter to the Energy Secretary, I will be offering an amendment that will ask the administration to get this plan that we have  been promised on the table. We need this plan so we can assure the consumers of America, particularly our more vulnerable consumers, the senior citizens, and particularly the most vulnerable senior citizens, those who are living alone, that we have a supply of energy for purchase at any cost. Hopefully the administration will come up with a plan that has a supply of energy that they can afford to pay for, and particularly a plan that doesn't require our senior citizens to choose between energy and food. 
   Also, I think it begs discussion of a bigger issue; that is, where has this administration been for the last 7 years on developing energy? For the most part, we have had a badly damaged oil exploration industry, and we have had workers who work in that industry finding jobs elsewhere. So even if that industry were to perk up and find places to drill and an incentive to drill, there are not enough workers to man the rigs because this administration has had a policy of deemphasizing domestic production. 
   So much of the land in the United States and our continental shelf, has been taken out of bounds for drilling, and in the case of natural gas, where two-thirds of the known supplies are available, there is no drilling where we know it is available under public lands. 
   I know of the concern for the environment. It seems to me we can have a balance between environmental policy and the domestic production of energy. We can have that because it is possible. We can have that because it is a necessity. It is a necessity because we cannot be held hostage by OPEC nations, and we can't be held hostage by Arab oil-producing nations and their leaders who want to put political pressure on the United States when it comes to a peace agreement involving Palestine and Israel, and all those issues that are acquainted with it. 
   We do not have to have military action in the Middle East now as we did at the time of the Persian Gulf war. But if we need to protect our oil, the flow of oil from the Middle East to the United States, we would not be able to put together that armada that we had 9 years ago to stop Saddam Hussein, what he was doing there, and what that caused in the energy situations in this country. That was the last time the energy prices went so high. 
   So we need from this administration a plan of what they are going to do to make sure there are not shortages in this country, what we can do to get the price down. We need that very soon. That is what my amendment will call for that I will offer this evening. We also need a policy of this administration to encourage the domestic production of oil and natural gas that we have available here so we aren't dependent upon OPEC for our sources of oil and natural gas. 
   I hope some of these issues will be discussed in the coming political campaign. I think on our side of the aisle, the Republican Party has a candidate who is well aware of the shortcomings of this administration on energy policy and will take steps, including fossil fuel availability, as well as renewable fuel availability to accomplish those goals. 
   While Governor Bush was campaigning in my State of Iowa during the first-in-the-nation caucuses that we had, I had the opportunity to travel throughout Iowa over the course of 4 or 5 days that I was helping him with his campaign. I had an opportunity to discuss some of these very tough issues and the direction that a new administration could take on renewable fuels such as ethanol, for example, renewable fuel incentives such as wind energy and biomass and tax incentives that are necessary for them to get rapidly started and a balance between renewable fuels and nonrenewable fuels. 
   I am satisfied that not only does the Governor of Texas come from a State where there is an understanding of the importance of fossil fuels--petroleum, natural gas, et cetera--but there is also an understanding that renewable sources of energy are very much an important part of the equation to make sure that the United States is not held hostage to OPEC nations as we see the President of the United States and the Energy Secretary begging OPEC to pump more oil. 
   I think with a new voice for energy independence in the White House, we will not have this very embarrassing situation that we find ourselves in, not just for the first time, but we found ourselves in this position in March, we found ourselves in this position in June when the leaders of this administration were hat in hand dealing with an OPEC organization controlling prices and controlling production, but if they were CEOs of oil companies in this country, doing the same sort of price fixing, they would be in prison. 
   What a spectacle of the President of the United States and the Energy Secretary dealing with these OPEC nations. That is an embarrassing situation. More important than just being embarrassing, it signals a national defense weakness of our country which must be based upon having certain access to energy. If we are going to be strong militarily, we won't have this embarrassment when a new face gets in the White House, if that new face is a person that is committed to the domestic production of energy and committed to renewable sources of energy, and committed to making a point with OPEC that we don't intend to be dependent upon these nations holding us up, particularly after the American taxpayer gave $415 million of foreign aid to OPEC nations for them to use to buy the rope to strangle the American consumer economically and hurt our whole economy in the process. That is exactly what OPEC is doing when the price of our energy, the price of our fuel oil, goes up 30 percent. 
   I hope we have a new day. I want to have a new day. I hope for a new day. A lot of that is what the people decide in the coming election. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to support section 103 of the energy and water appropriations bill. This section would prohibit changes to management of the Missouri River which would unquestionably increase flood risk on the lower Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. If this section is dropped from the bill, landowners in Iowa along the Missouri River will face the threat of increased flooding. Farmers and other river barge users would face increased transportation costs in getting their grain and other goods to market. Both of these outcomes are unacceptable to a majority of Iowans. 
   There is nothing new in this bill language. It has been placed in four previous appropriations bill by my distinguished colleague from Missouri, Senator BOND. Each of these bills has been signed into law by this President. The measure would prohibit the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from implementing a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plan to increase releases of water from Missouri River dams in the spring. The Daschle amendment could result in significant flooding downstream given the heavy rains that are usually experienced in my, and other downstream states during that time. 
   We must keep in mind that it takes 8 days for water to travel from Gavins Point to the mouth of the Missouri. 
   Unanticipated downstream storms can make a ``controlled release'' a deadly flood inflicting a widespread physical and human cataclysm. There are many small communities along the Missouri River in Iowa. Why should they face an increased potential risk for flooding and its devastation? They shouldn't. 
   Equally unacceptable is the low-flow summer release schedule proposed by the Clinton-Gore administration's Fish and Wildlife Service. A so-called split navigation season would be catastrophic to the transportation of Iowa grain to the marketplace. In effect, the Missouri River would be shut-down to barge traffic during a good portion of the summer. It would also have a disastrous effect on the transportation of steel to Iowa steel mills located along the Missouri, construction materials and farm inputs such as fertilizer. 
   Opponents of section 103 will advance an argument that a spring flood is necessary for species protection under the Endangered Species Act, and that grain and other goods can be transported to market by railroad. I do not accept that argument. I believe that there is significant difference of opinion whether or not a spring flood will benefit pallid sturgeon, the interior least tern or the piping plover. In fact, the Corps has demonstrated that it can successfully create nesting habitat for the birds  through mechanical means. Further, it is in dispute among biologists whether or not a 
   flood can create the necessary habitat for the sturgeon. 
   I would further point out that the Fish and Wildlife Service has yet to designate ``critical habitat'' for the pallid sturgeon as required by the Endangered Species Act. 
   Loss of barge traffic would deliver the western part of America's great grain belt into the monopolistic hands of the railroads. Without question, grain transportation prices would drastically increase with disastrous results on farm income. 
   Every farmer in Iowa knows that the balance in grain transportation is competition between barges and railroads. This competition keeps both means of transportation honest. This competition keeps transportation prices down and helps to give the Iowa farmer a better financial return on the sale of his grain. This competition helps to make the grain transportation system in America the most efficient and cost effective in the world. It is crucial in keeping American grain competitively priced in the world market. The Corps itself estimates that barge competition reduces rail rates along the Missouri by $75-200 million annually. 
   Further, if a drought hits during the split navigation season, there would be even less water flowing along the Missouri. This would greatly inhibit navigation along the Mississippi River. We cannot let this happen. 
   Less water flowing in the late summer would also affect hydroelectric rates. The decreased flows would mean less power generation and higher electric rates for Iowans who depend upon this power source. 
   I agree with the National Corn Growers and their statement that, ``an intentional spring rise is an unwarranted, unscientific assault on farmers and citizens throughout the Missouri River Basin.'' I urge my colleagues to support section 103. Vote against the Daschle amendment.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am today introducing a bill which would exclude the value of real property of a veteran, or a veteran's spouse or dependent, in determining how a veteran's eligibility for health care from the Department of Veterans Affair (VA) is classified. The bill would also simplify eligibility determinations by eliminating the annual self-reporting burden for veterans, and instead enable the Department to obtain income information directly from the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration. 
   The problem asset-rich, cash-poor veterans experience in gaining eligibility for veterans pension and health care benefits was brought to my attention late last year by one of my constituents, Larry Sundall. Larry is one of Iowa's county veterans service officers. He serves veterans in Emmet County, in northwest Iowa. In the course of his work, he was finding that many of his farmer-veteran constituents where in desperate straits with no, or little, income, but still could not qualify for VA pension programs without selling their land. Because of the value of their land, these veterans would also be classified in Category 7 for purposes of health service eligibility in the event they sought health care from the VA. Category 7 veterans can receive health care services as long as the VA has sufficient funds. However, they are required to pay co-payments for any health care they receive through the VA because of the value of their land, even if they have no income and are in debt to boot. If the administration and Congress don't appropriate enough money, these Category 7 veterans will not be eligible for health care services from the VA. 
   At Larry's urging, I decided to convene a meeting of interested parties in Des Moines last April to talk over this issue. Because many of his county veterans officials in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota were encountering constituents with similar problems, we invited the associations of county veterans service officers from those states to send a representative to participate. We invited the State Veterans Affairs Officers from those states. VA staff from headquarters, regional offices, and VISNs also participated. The meeting was very useful and informative from my perspective, and I am grateful to all who participated. As it happens, the VA's Health Services Administration had already recognized the asset test as a problem for veterans and had formed a task force to look into the feasibility of eliminating the asset test. The Veterans Benefits Administration had also begun to discuss the issue. In any case, VA participants at the meeting agreed to convey the essentials of our discussion to principal officials at VA headquarters. 
   The problem follows from a provision of Title 38 which holds that the Secretary may deny benefits to a veteran ``..... when the corpus of the estate of the veteran ..... is such that under all the circumstances ..... it is reasonable that some part of the corpus of such estates be consumed for the veteran's maintenance''. In other words, if the income and estate of a veteran 
   are large enough, they should be used before the veteran receives benefits from the VA. The law also states, however, that liquidations of assets should be required only when it can be done at ``no substantial sacrifice'' to the veteran. Regulations implementing this provision of law contain essentially the same language. The complications begin with a VA manual, 21-1, which lays out criteria to be used by VA staff in adjudicating eligibility for pension and health benefits. Under the criteria set out in M21-1, the net worth of a veteran must be adjudicated when the veteran's income and net worth is greater than $50,000. Ownership of $50,000 of farm land or other real property does not automatically and inevitably mean that adjudicators will declare a farmer veteran ineligible for these VA programs. In principle, the $50,000 is just a threshold which is to trigger adjudication of a veteran's claim for benefits, not to automatically disqualify a veteran for benefits. 
   But there are two problems with the treatment of assets in the schema. First is the $50,000 level. It's obviously much too low, even as a trigger for adjudication. In Iowa currently, the average value of an acre of farm land is $1,781. So a farm holding valued at $50,000 would average about 28 acres, clearly two small to be viable. A 40 acre farm, at the current average value per acre, would be worth $71,240. A more viable 80 acre farm would be valued at $142,480. It seems to me, therefore, that the threshold triggering review of a farmer veteran's income and assets should be raised to $150,000. But, second, and more fundamentally, the law stipulates, as I noted earlier, that divestiture of an estate should not involve ``substantial sacrifice''. It is difficult for me to see that selling off the family farm, in many, if not most, cases, the sole source of livelihood for a farm family, would not involve substantial sacrifice. It thus seems inherently unrealistic to require a veteran to liquidate land holdings in order to become eligible for VA pension benefits or in order to pay co-payments for VA health care services. 
   What the bill I am introducing today would do is eliminate completely the asset test as a factor is establishing eligibility for health care services. A veteran's income, however, would still be considered in eligibility determinations. The bill would also permit the Secretary to determine the attributable income of the veteran using income date from the year preceding the prior year in the event that the Secretary is unable to use prior year data. Finally, the bill would permit the Secretary to use information obtained from the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Treasury for the purpose of determining the attributable income of a veteran. 
   The VA estimates that this proposal should save the VA money, Mr. President. They estimate that more than $11 million would be saved in fiscal year 2001, growing to more than $13 million in fiscal year 2005.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we started earlier today the initial discussion of what I call the China trade bill, the Senate by law ratifying the agreement that has been worked out by this administration and the Government of China to level the playing field for trade between the United States and China. 
   In a simple form, the bill before us will give access for U.S. exporters--meaning manufacturing, services and agriculture--to China on the same basis that China has had access to our markets for the last 15 to 20 years. 
   When you have an opportunity for our people to export to China, to sell to China, on the same basis that China has been able to do with the United States, it is a win-win situation. My Midwestern common sense tells me this is a good situation for America. So that debate has started today. 
   We are on the question of the motion to proceed. I support this motion. I hope we get to a final vote on the bill, because I think it will pass by an overwhelming margin, not the very narrow margin that it passed in the House of Representatives. This will give us an enhanced opportunity to do business with 20 percent of the world's population. 
   There are many reasons I support this bill, which is probably one of the most important matters to come before the Senate this session. But today, I would like to address just two reasons. The first is the issue of jobs, a very positive aspect to this legislation. The second is human rights, which some people view as a reason for being against this legislation. I suggest to you that even though the human rights situation in China is not good, trade gives us an opportunity to improve that human rights situation. 
   In each case, I want to address concerns of real people in a commonsense way. Too often, when we talk about major policy changes, we do so in lofty terms, not connected to the people's concerns and their interests, and what is important to everyday working Americans.  
   Today, I would like to talk about how real people will be affected by making it possible for the United States to take advantage of China's pending accession to the World Trade Organization. 
   Lowering protectionist tariffs and tearing down trade barriers that discriminate against American products will create many thousands of new American jobs. A new era of free trade with China, under the WTO World Trade Organization disciplines, will help us continue to build the tremendous prosperity that we enjoy as a direct result--a very direct result--of the success of our postwar trading system; going back to 1947, as we have used the gradual freeing up of trade around the world to expand the world economic pie. Because of free trade, with a population that is now about double what it was back then, we now have more prosperity for more people. If we had not expanded the world economic pie, we would, in fact, have less for our increased world population. So think in terms of the economic enhancement of individuals and the political stability that comes from it. 
   In my State of Iowa, we know our economic interdependence with the rest of the world is not a policy choice; it is a fact. Trade means jobs anywhere, but particularly in my State. In just 5 years, Iowa's merchandise export to China has soared 35 percent. 
   In the Waterloo-Cedar Falls area--that is close to where I was born, and where I have lived my entire life--recent merchandise sales to China have surged 806 percent. Iowa's trade-related jobs mean that a young couple can afford their first home. They can afford tuition for school. They can afford to buy a car. They can afford to care for their families, the way working people want to care for their families. 
   But unless we seize this moment, this opportunity will pass us by. When China enters the World Trade Organization, which it will do regardless of the outcome of this vote on the Senate floor--and if we do not remove all of our current conditions on trade with China, which this bill does--other countries will reap the rewards of a trade deal that we helped negotiate. American companies then would be forced to sit on the sidelines as companies from the European Union or Asia or Africa or elsewhere take our business and ultimately take our jobs because we have not assumed this opportunity of freer trade with China. 
   If we pass up this opportunity, America will be at the end of the line of the 137 other WTO countries, that will be standing in front of us, trading with China. 
   I want to give my colleagues two real-life examples from my State of Iowa. 
   Tucker Manufacturing Company is a family-owned business in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, that has developed a unique window-washing system which it makes and sells around the world. Tucker has made a few small sample sales to China and has found a distributor that would like to make a large order. Tucker knows that in the past state-owned distribution companies in China have dictated commercial terms that have often harmed exporting companies like Tucker. They would like to see China become a World Trade Organization member so that distribution rights are no longer strictly controlled by the state, meaning the country and Government of China, and so that any new transactions in China then are protected by the rule of law, which is what the World Trade Organization regime is all about--the rule of law, predictability in international trade, the resolving of disputes in international trade. 
   A second example from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, is the Diamond V Mills Company, which I visited just last week. I had the opportunity to present it with the Commerce Department's E-Star Award for excellence in exports. They had already received the E award, now they have the E-Star award that indicates they have been highly successful in international trade on an ongoing basis. 
   Diamond V Mills has exported its yeast culture feed ingredients to China since 1996, but they did it by operating through a local distributor. The company wants to sell directly to its end user but has not been able to do so--until this agreement goes through--due to China's current restrictions on a foreign company's rights to distribute its products in China. 
   Under the WTO accession agreement, China has committed to opening its markets to the private distribution networks that Diamond V Mills of Cedar Rapids needs. If Diamond V Mills can get access to new distribution networks in China, it will generate more sales, earn more revenue, provide more jobs in Iowa, create more opportunity and more prosperity for everybody. 
   These are only two examples of how Iowa's manufacturing sector will benefit through expanded trade with China. There are many more. We have Iowa's farmers and agricultural producers seeing tremendous benefits from this proposal as well because China's World Trade Organization accession agreement will dramatically lower agricultural tariffs and eliminate many nontariff trade barriers. As a result, our farmers will sell more soybeans and more soy oil to China than ever before. 
   After the United States, China is the second largest consumer of corn and corn products in the world. As the distinguished Presiding Officer knows, my State is No. 1 in the production of corn in the United States, as his State is No. 1 in the production of wheat. 
   China's WTO commitments will create a great export opportunity for Iowa's corn growers and for corn growers across the United States. 
   Iowa State University professor Dermot Hayes recently told my international trade subcommittee that if China fully implements its WTO accession commitments we could see hog prices rise by as much as $5 per head. That is a larger benefit than any of the Government support programs we have heard about lately. 
   Unlike some of the proposals I have heard, we would not have to impair our obligations under the WTO's subsidies agreement, or the WTO agriculture agreement, to do it. 
   Second, I want to discuss the issue of human rights and political freedoms in China because this is a legitimate issue, even though I disagree with the argument that killing this bill is going to help human rights in China. I wish to make it clear I don't find fault with those who bring it up as part of this debate because I think wherever we can try to say to China that they are going down the wrong road on human rights, they are hurting their country, not us. 
   Like all Americans, Iowans care deeply about the struggle for liberty. Many have family members who have given their lives in freedom's cause, or they know someone who has. It hurts us to hear horrible accounts of repression. We are rightly repelled. We don't understand why it happens, and we want it to change because we think freedom is an innate right for the Chinese as well as for Americans. But the fact is, we can never turn China into a model of constitutional democracy if we isolate them economically. However, we can help bring about fundamental reform in China's economy and political structure through enforceable WTO rules that do not discriminate and are consistent and are not arbitrary. 
   In addition, I have a firm conviction that regardless of how necessary a political and rule of law environment is for trade to take place and political leaders such as the President of the United States and other people negotiating with the Chinese, none of those efforts, as important as they are, can compare to the opportunities for advancing political freedom and human rights that will come when millions of American businesspeople interact with millions of Chinese businesspeople on a day-to-day basis. That is going to do more to improve human rights than anything else. 
   When it comes to making decisions, the WTO applies the democratic principle of consensus rule. All of these principles--democratic decisionmaking, nondiscrimination, nonarbitrary regulation--are also the obvious, essential ingredients of political freedom. The process of economic reform, guided by China's WTO commitments, will mean that China will become more open. They will eventually become more free. We know, perhaps better than any nation on Earth, that economic and political freedoms share deep roots. 
   That economic and political rights go hand in hand is at the heart of America's constitutional heritage. Many in  China know that economic and political reform are closely linked as well. That is why many of China's military hardliners oppose China's entry into the World Trade Organization. 
   Perhaps it is this inevitable linking between economic reform and political freedom that has inspired the Dalai Lama, no stranger to China's religious repression, to say:  
   I have always stressed that China should not be isolated. China must be brought into the mainstream of the world community.......  
   To those who doubt that economic reform has occurred in China, or that it is significant, I ask them to consider how much has changed in the last half century. You will remember that in 1952, China's Communist government mounted a wide-ranging crusade to undermine private entrepreneurs, businesspeople were commonly condemned as ``counterrevolutionaries,'' and many were assessed large fines and forced out of business. 
   In fact, by 1956, China required all private firms to be jointly owned and, in fact, run by the government. In practice, this meant that we had state control of all private enterprise in 
   China. It wasn't until the early 1980s that private enterprise began to reemerge in China. More significantly, it wasn't until 1988 that the private economy even had a defined legal status in China. 
   Today, 12 years later, China is a different country. Today, young Chinese engineers who studied and worked in California's Silicon Valley are going back to China, lured by entrepreneurial opportunities that didn't even exist a few years ago. 
   The number of individuals employed by the private sector in China has soared by over 31 percent in the last 3 years. That is bad news for China's state-owned enterprises. That happens to also be bad news for China's People's Liberation Army, which depends on many state-run businesses for revenue and have opposed these reforms that are going on within China, including this agreement before the Senate. 
   But this development is good news for the cause of freedom. As the number of individuals employed in the private sector rises, the state will have less and less direct control over how people think and how people react to political change. 
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Edward Steinfeld is one of our country's keenest scholars on what goes on in China. This is what he had to say about the meaning of China's World Trade Organization concessions on China's direction as a country:  
   The concessions of 1999 represented a thorough reversal of course. Instead of reform serving to sustain the core, the core itself would be destroyed to save reform, along with the growth, prosperity, and stability reform has brought to China. 
   In the new view, instead of using market forces to save state socialism, state socialism itself would have to be sacrificed to preserve the market economy.  
   I agree with Professor Steinfeld. China's membership in the World Trade Organization will require it to reform a very large portion of its economy, and not only to comply with WTO rules, but to be able to compete internationally. 
   With a ``yes'' vote on the motion to proceed and a ``yes'' vote on approving permanent normal trading status for China, we can help change the world. China constitutes one-fifth of the world's population. We can be on the right side of history. We ought to be on the right side of history. I urge a vote for this motion to proceed and a vote of yes on final passage. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to note the introduction of the Medicare Geographic Fair Payment Act of 2000. I'm very pleased to join Senators DOMENICI, WYDEN, and KERREY in this effort. While we share the problem of low payment rates, Iowa and Nebraska are in a different situation than New Mexico and Oregon. Those two states are concerned about Medicare + Choice plans leaving, but for the most part we in Iowa are still waiting for plans to arrive. There are a number of things that have to fall into place for Medicare + Choice to become a reality in Iowa, but one of them is increasing payment rates. I want to make sure that if Congress provides any relief in Medicare + Choice this year, that low-cost areas are not forgotten. We need to make Medicare + Choice a truly national program. 
   There are two simple Medicare + Choice payment provisions in the bill. It would raise the minimum payment floor for all counties from the current $415 to $475 in 2001. This would primarily benefit rural and small urban areas, including the vast majority of Iowa. Secondly, it would establish a new minimum payment floor of $525 for all counties in Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) with populations exceeding 250,000. In Iowa, this would mean a substantial incentive for plans to enter the Des Moines and Quad Cities areas. 
   As I've said so often throughout the five-plus years that I've been working on this issue, people in low-cost states like Iowa pay the same payroll taxes as those in high-cost areas. So it's a matter of simple fairness and equity that all seniors have access to the choices in Medicare, wherever they live. The problem with Medicare + Choice has been that payment rates are based on fee-for-service payment rates in the same county; thus, cost-effective regions like ours are punished. This makes no sense. We took our first step toward breaking that unfortunate link in 1997, and I have high hopes that we will take another big step with this bill in 2000. 
   We in low-cost regions have to keep the fight for equity going on two fronts: Medicare + Choice payment, and traditional Medicare payment. The latter is harder for Congress to change, because we have to identify inequities in the various Medicare payment policies and fix them one by one. I thank my colleagues for including in this bill my earlier bill on the hospital wage index, which is one of those flaws in fee-for-service Medicare that cries out to be fixed. 
   I look forward to the Finance Committee's Medicare discussions this fall; this is the kind of legislation that merits serious consideration there.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President I rise today to introduce an extremely timely piece of legislation in light of the current energy crisis facing our nation. This legislation, entitled ``The Resource Efficient Appliance Incentive Act,'' will provide a valuable incentive to accelerate and expand the production and market penetration of ultra energy-efficient appliances. Senator ROCKEFELLER is joining me in this bipartisan effort, along with Senators JEFFORDS and LINCOLN. 
   Earlier this year, the appliance industry, the Department of Energy, and the nation's leading energy-efficiency and environmental organizations came together and agreed upon significantly higher energy efficiency standards for clothes washers to accompany the new energy efficiency standards for refrigerators that go into effect in July 2001, as well as the new criteria for achieving the voluntary ``Energy Star'' designation. This agreement is significant considering the fact that clothes washers and dryers, together with refrigerators, account for approximately 15 percent of all household energy consumed in the United States. 
   This legislation will provide a tax credit to assist in the development of super energy-efficient washing machines and refrigerators, and creates the incentives necessary to increase the production and sale of these appliances in the short term. Manufacturers would be eligible to claim a credit of either $50 or $100, depending on efficiency level, for each super energy-efficient washing machine produced between 2001 and 2006. Likewise, manufacturers would be eligible to claim a credit of $50 or $100, depending on efficiency level, for each super energy-efficient refrigerator produced between 2001 and 2006. It is estimated that this tax credit will increase the production and purchase of super energy-efficient washers by almost 200 percent, and the purchase of super energy-efficient refrigerators by over 285 percent. 
   Equally important is the long-term environmental benefits of the expanded use of these appliances. Over the life of the appliances, over 200 trillion Btus of energy will be saved. This is the equivalent of taking 2.3 million cars off the road or closing 6 coal-fired power plants for a year. In addition, the clothes washers will reduce the amount of water necessary to wash clothes by 870 billion gallons, an amount equal to the needs of every household in the city the size of Phoenix, Arizona for two years. Most importantly, the benefits to consumers over the life of the washers and refrigerators from operational savings is estimated at nearly $1 billion. 
   In my home state of Iowa, this legislation would result in the production of  1.5 million supper energy-efficient washers and refrigerators over the next six years, requiring over 100 new production jobs. I also expect Iowans to save $11 million in operational costs over the life span of the appliances, and 9 billion gallons of water--enough to supply drinking water for the entire state for 30 years. 
   Lastly, I believe the total revenue loss of this credit compares extremely favorably to the estimated benefits of almost $1 billion to consumers over the life of the super energy-efficient clothes washers and refrigerators from operational savings.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today entitled the ``Federal Courts Improvement Act of 2000.'' Every few years, the Judicial Conference, the governing body of the federal courts, contacts Congress regarding changes to the law the Judicial Conference believes are necessary to improve the functions of the courts. As chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee with jurisdiction over the courts, I have the responsibility to review the operation of the federal court process and procedures. In the past, I have also been in the forefront of advocating that the federal judicial system be administered in the most efficient and cost-effective manner possible while maintaining a high level of quality in the administration of justice. The bill I am introducing, along with Senator TORRICELLI, the Ranking Member of my subcommittee, is a consensus bill that includes many of the recommendations made by the Judicial Conference. 
   The Judicial Conference has noted a problem that continues to plague the Federal judicial system is the lack of up-to-date technologies that would reduce costs while at the same time improve the efficiency of its administration along with a wide range of judicial branch programs. The ``Federal Courts Improvement Act of 2000'' attempts to addresses this problem. In accordance with federal policy to defray the cost of providing services by assessing a fee for their use, sections of this bill provide the judiciary with the authority to set, collect, and retain fees to be used to acquire information technologies, such as electronic filing, video conferencing, and electronic evidence presentation devices. This section requires that the fees collected are to be deposited into the Judiciary Information Technology Fund and used for reinvestment in information technology. I feel that granting the judiciary the authority to collect and retain these fees will go a long way toward improving the efficiency of the judicial system while providing substantial savings for litigants and attorneys. 
   This bill addresses two areas in which I have taken a personal interest, over the years: reducing unnecessary expenses and improving the efficiency of the judicial system. This bill would help achieve both. Traditionally, the safeguards applicable to criminal defendants charged with more serious crimes have not been applicable to petty offense cases because the burdens were deemed undesirable and impractical in dealing with such minor offenses. Currently, U.S. Magistrate Judges may preside over petty offense cases charging a motor vehicle offense and infractions, without the consent of the defendant. This bill removes the consent requirement in all other petty cases--a position repeatedly supported by the Judicial Conference of the United States. Additionally, this bill authorizes magistrate judges to try misdemeanor cases involving juveniles currently tried in district court. Removing the consent requirement from these petty offense cases and authorizing magistrate judges to preside over all juvenile misdemeanors would free-up valuable district court resources that could be used to deal with more serious crimes and offenders while reducing the time and expense necessary in dealing with these offenses. 
   Another section of the bill also contains provisions that would free up district court resources and allow federal judges more time to deal with their civil and criminal dockets. These provisions raise the maximum compensation level paid to federal or community defenders representing defendants appearing before United States magistrates or the district courts before they must seek a waiver for payment in excess of the prescribed maximum. Payment in excess 
   of the maximum currently requires the approval of both the judge who presided over the case and the chief judge of the circuit. This procedure in turn increases the amount of time judges must devote to non-judicial matters. The last increase was instituted fourteen years ago. During this time, the effects of inflation have significantly eroded the compensation paid to federal and community defenders. 
   The Judicial Conference has expressed to me their concern over a growing trend of ``Criminal Justice Act'' (CJA) panel attorneys being subject to unfounded suits by the defendants they previously represented and the financial damage these attorneys have to deal with when they must pay to defend themselves in these actions. These unfair costs have the potential of having a chilling effect on the willingness of attorneys to participate as panel attorneys and will only make it more difficult to obtain adequate representation for defendants. Currently, the CJA authorizes the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to provide representation and indemnify federal and community defender organizations for malpractice claims that arise as a result of furnishing representational services. Panel attorneys are the only component of the appointed counsel program who are not permitted to receive CJA-funded coverage for any costs associated with defending against a malpractice claim by a CJA client. Our bill rectifies this oversight in the CJA, and provides CJA panel attorneys the same protection as other federal defenders.  Provisions in our bill authorize the judge who presides over a case, at his discretion, to reimburse panel attorneys for out-of-pocket expenses for civil claims arising for their CJA services. The judge would exercise his discretion limiting the amount of reimbursement available for a panel attorney as he views appropriate under the circumstances, as has been the practice with respect to malpractice claims against other federal defenders. 
   In addition, the ``Federal Courts Improvement Act of 2000'' also contains provisions designed to assist handicapped employees working for the federal judiciary. These provisions bring the federal judicial system in-line with the Executive Branch and other governmental bodies. 
   The bill also contains a number of other provisions that we believe are necessary to improve the Federal Courts' administration, judicial process and matters relating to public defenders, as well as other items that enhance the operation of the Federal judiciary. I urge my colleagues to join us and support these improvements to our Federal Court system.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to note that there are some things happening around here of late that make me wonder if we are in an episode of the X-Files. I am troubled with the mysterious appearance and disappearance of funds within the conference report for Military Construction. In the effort to develop an emergency spending package, the House included money for meth lab clean-up. It voted on money. The Senate-passed bill had money for meth lab clean-up. Both Houses of Congress recognized that there was a real emergency. Both bodies recognized the need to provide emergency money to DEA to help pay for the costs of cleaning up the toxic waste dumps caused by illegal meth production. 
   I and other members of this body have been concerned for some time about this problem. We have written the President, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, the Attorney General, and the Majority Leader and members of the Committee on Appropriations. The Majority Whip of the Senate had an emergency meth spending item accepted as part of the bill passed by the Senate. But it seems we've had a case of alien abduction. All--all the meth money disappeared in conference and no one seems to know how or why. The House included money. The Senate included money. The conference to reconcile the differences, however, included no money. What this means is strange math in which one plus one equals zero. 
   Mr. President, I have participated in various conferences with the other body, and I know they can be complicated affairs. Strong disagreements can exist over how to phrase a section,  or how much funding this particular project should receive. But there have always been some guidelines governing a conference. First, you are working toward a compromise. This means, by definition, you are not going to get everything you want. However, it also means you will get something that will work. Second, in a conference, you aren't starting from scratch. Each body has reviewed, debated, and passed a version of legislation--a starting point, if you will, for compromise. 
   These compromises, often difficult to arrive at, are worked out behind closed doors. Out of the watchful eye of the public. Legislating can be an ugly process, and often negotiations continue in a much more open and frank manner in private than under the media microscope. But compromise should not be the occasion for legislating afresh, for ignoring the expressed intent of majorities in both Houses. 
   Looking through the Military Construction Appropriations bill this last week, I was distressed at some of the items I found that seem to have magically appeared. 6 C-130Js and a new Gulf Stream 5 for the Coast Guard, for example. So far as I know, the Coast Guard did not ask for a Gulf Stream, and we did not vote for one. But there it is. 
   At the same time, it seems that needed funds to support the DEA's continued assistance to State and local law enforcement agencies to clean up methamphetamine labs have disappeared--and no one seems to know where it went. 
   Heading into the conference, it was clear what the situation was. The House had provided $15 million in emergency funds for needed methamphetamine lab-cleanup. The Senate provided a total of $50 million for meth-related activities by the DEA--$10 million was added in Committee, and an additional $40 million was adopted on the floor for ``initiatives to combat methamphetamine production and trafficking.'' So you would think--I certainly thought--that the conferees would return with some funding--most likely between $15 and $50 million--for meth lab clean-up. 
   But something happened in the conference. Someone waved a magic wand, and ``Poof!'' The money is gone. Where did it go? The conferees don't know. Why is it gone? The sponsors of the funds don't know. I don't know. Inquiries have left me feeling like Jimmy Stewart commenting on the evidence in his case in the 1959 movie classic, ``Anatomy of a Murder,'' where he notes evidence appears and disappears in a ghostly fashion. But what I do know is that I have to explain this to my constituents--to the law enforcement agencies in Iowa who are dependent upon these funds to support their clean up efforts of these mini environmental catastrophes. I am not alone. 
   All of this funding hocus pocus I find to be very troubling. I hope we can solve the mystery and avoid its like in the future.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for a provision included in the House-passed Department of Defense (DOD) Authorization bill which provides a permanent chiropractic benefit to all active military personnel. Iowans have a long history of support for the chiropractic profession. In fact, the nation's oldest institution of higher chiropractic learning--Palmer College--is located in Davenport, Iowa. 
   I am pleased that both the House and Senate have included provisions in their respective DOD authorization bills which expand access to chiropractic services for members of the military. These provisions follow on the heels of a multi-year pilot program enacted in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995. The pilot program demonstrated that military personnel who received chiropractic care had higher levels of satisfaction with the care they received as compared to personnel who only received traditional medical care. Furthermore, the pilot project demonstrated that chiropractic care would reduce hospitalization, return injured patients to work more quickly, and would result in a net savings to the Department of Defense in excess of $25 million annually. 
   The Defense Authorization Act passed by the House of Representatives begins the process of fully integrating chiropractic care into the military health care system on a direct access basis. The Senate-passed bill, however, limits chiropractic care through a medical gatekeeper. Direct access to chiropractic care would expedite the delivery of chiropractic care to those patients most in need of services and would free up existing health care providers to concentrate their time and efforts in other areas requiring attention. Therefore, I join the chiropractic profession in asking the conferees of the DOD Authorization legislation to accept the House-passed provision and provide direct access to chiropractic services to all active military personnel.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to share in the memory of one of this body's most esteemed colleagues, Senator Paul Coverdell. His untimely death Tuesday was a shock to us all. My prayers and condolences go out to his family at their time of mourning. 
   It so happens that Senator Coverdell was born in my home state of Iowa--in Des Moines. That made him an honorary constituent of mine. For that reason, he was always a special colleague to me. 
   We in this body knew of his background in the Peace Corps just before he was elected to the Senate. He very quickly began to show his outstanding leadership skills. He built a respect among his colleagues because of his hard work and his dedication to those issues most dear to him--especially education and the war on drugs. 
   Senator Coverdell did almost all of his work behind-the-scenes, work that the public never knew about. But we knew, because we worked with him. His interest was not the limelight. You rarely saw his name in the papers. Instead, it was rolling up his sleeves and working one-on-one with his colleagues in an effective way. No one among us had such energy, enthusiasm for public service, and organizing ability. 
   I worked closest with him on international narcotics issues, as chairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control. He was chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps, Narcotics and Terrorism. We worked very closely together on narcotics matters. We would hold joint hearings on fighting drug cartels in Colombia and other countries. No one felt stronger about stopping the scourge of drugs in this country than he did. He cared deeply about the debilitating effect drugs have had on the future of our country and our youth. 
   It was a real privilege to work with Paul Coverdell in the United States Senate. He was a statesman, a public servant in the true sense of the word. And he was a good friend, I join my colleagues in expressing how much we will miss his energy, enthusiasm and friendship. His presence will be greatly missed in the Senate. I wish all the best to his family, knowing of their profound grief at their loss.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act of 2000. I am being joined by Senator ROBB in this effort. Civil rights legislation has been in force throughout this country for nearly thirty years; its purpose being to provide real remedies to victims of discrimination. 
   The Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act restores certain remedies for victims of discrimination by eliminating taxes on emotional distress awards. This tax was incorporated into the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, making the taxation of awards received in discrimination cases involving back wages or non-physical injuries ( including emotional distress) taxable. The result of the 1996 legislation was to discriminate against people involved in civil rights cases. People who received damage awards because of a bar-room brawl or slip-and-fall incident, often caused by simple negligence, get tax free awards. While, for similar types of psychological injuries caused by intentional discrimination the damages are taxed. The result of this taxation is that the attorneys and government make out better than the victims who had their rights violated. 
   A second part of The Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act changes the current law, which requires people who receive back pay awards in discrimination cases to be bumped up into a higher tax bracket. When back pay awards are received by a person in a case the IRS considers it taxable income to be taxed in the year it is received, even though the award received covers many years of lost wages. Currently no averaging of back pay awards is allowed, but The Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act attempts to address this problem. The act provides for income averaging of back pay awards, making it possible for the award to be taxed over the number of years it was meant to compensate. 
   The third area that The Civil Rights Fairness Act attempts to combat is the double taxation of attorneys' fees that takes place under current law. Presently individuals who receive awards end up having to include in that award their attorneys' fee. This fee can end up being larger than the actual award received by the plaintiff. The current tax implications in the law require the plaintiff to pay taxes on their award and on the attorneys fees received by their lawyer. 
   One real life example recently brought to my attention involves an Iowa citizen named Don Lyons. Mr. Lyons, a man attempting to do the honorable thing by helping out a co-worker with filing a sex discrimination complaint against their employer, was unjustly retaliated against. After prevailing in court and receiving a $15,000 remitted judgment, Mr. Lyons then had to deal with the present tax laws, which not only devoured his judgment, but required him to actually pay thousands of more dollars to the government in taxes. 
   First, Mr. Lyons had to pay taxes on the $15,000 he received as punitive damages from his employer. After he pays his taxes he is left with $9,533. However, when Mr. Lyons takes into account the taxes that he has to pay on the combination of his settlement and attorneys' fees, he ends up owing $67,791 in taxes. When you subtract the $9,533 Mr. Lyons had left from the initial judgment he ends up still owing the government $58,236 in taxes. Mr. Lyons attorney, Ms. Victoria L. Herring, also has to pay taxes on the fee she received for taking Mr. Lyons case. Mr. Lyons ends up paying taxes on money that he never even received, making him a good example of why it is important to pass The Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act and end double taxation. Everyone should agree that this is a extreme example of unfair taxation. 
   Mr. Lyons helped out a co-worker, was attacked by his employer, and received damages in a court of law. People count on the legal system to protect them and when their civil rights are violated the system needs to function properly. It is disheartening to learn that, in actuality, Mr. Lyons is going to be taken to the cleaners by the government tax system, and as a result, he ends up owing $58,236 to the government for the ``privilege'' of having won his retaliation case. 
   It seems to me that there is something fundamentally wrong with the law when it hurts the people it is supposed to protect. This being said, it is time to change the mistakes made in the past by passing the Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act 2000. This bill will go a long way toward helping out victims of discrimination by eliminating taxes on emotional distress awards, ending lump-sum taxation, and ending double taxation. The changing of the law will have positive effects on citizens like Mr. Lyons, allowing similar victims to keep more of their awards. At the same time, it will be beneficial for business, since they will be able to settle discrimination claims for lower settlements.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments about the reconciliation bill before us containing marriage penalty tax relief. 
   This is an issue about fairness, Mr. President for around thirty years our Tax Code has been penalizing people just becuase they happen to be married. This is a perfect example of how broken our Tax Code is. Just like the earnings limitation that discriminated against older Americans, this unfiar Tax needs to be dumped. It took a Republican-led Congress to repeal the Social Security earnings limit. 
   And now, it's the same Republican-led Congress that's talking the lead in repealing the marriage penalty tax. We tried it a couple of months ago, but we were blocked by the Democratic side from passing the bill. Now, we're back under reconciliation instructions that prevent the other side from gridlocking the Senate. 
   Of course, the minority side wants you to believe they're all for getting rid of the marriage penalty tax. Of course, they had control of the Congress for decades and never once tried to repeal it. 
   What's worse, now they're using the old bait-and-switch routine. They say they're for this tax relief, but not until Social Security and Medicare are fixed. 
   We all know neither the administration nor the Democratic side have comprehensive proposals to fix Social Security and Medicare, so this is just a delyaing tactic to kill the bill so, they say they're for marriage penalty relief--but only sometime in the unknown future. That's Washington D.C. double-talk. 
   Delaying this tax relief really means no tax relief at all. 
   Mr. President, we've heard other misleading arguments that under the majority bill, married couples would get a tax cut, but single mothers with kids would not get one. However, an important part of our bill repeals the alternative minimum tax for over then million people. Many of those helped will be single mothers. But, guess what's even more interesting? The Democrat alternative bill is the bill that doesn't help single mothers at all. 
   In addition, it's important to note that the Democrat alternative discriminates against stay-at-home moms. That's right, the Democrat proposal only helps two earner couples. So, it not only doesn't helpt those single mothers the other side was crying crocodile tears over--it hurts those families where one partent decides to stay at home with the children. 
   I hope all of you stay-at-home parents out there listening understand what the Democratic alternative will do to them. 
   Mr. President, we're going to pass this tax relief measure anad send it to President Clinton. 
   This begs the question--where is the Clinton-Gore administration on providing this tax reljief to working Americans? Well, a few weeks ago, the administration offered to accept mariiage penalty tax relief for a Medicare prescription drug benefit. This is the same tax relief bill the Clinton-Gore administration and Democrats have been attacking and deriding for months. Now, they're saying, forget all those bad things we said, we're ready to deal. 
   This just shows the Clinton-Gore administration either doesn't have any principles, or they're willing to trade them to the highest bidder. 
   Of course, for years this administration has been saying they would work with Congress to save social security and medicare. But, here we are near the end of this administration, and it has no comprehensive plan to save either program. They're reduced to trying to salvage a legacy by creating a hugely expensive entitlement program that could end up draining the hard-earned surplus. This is a surplus earned bythe American people, not the Government, who wants to spend it all. Interestingly, a recent polly said that 60 percent of Americans credit American workers and businesse for our successful economy. Only 39 percent credit the administration, who would like you to believe they did it all. 
   I think the American people are finally figuring out the Clinton-Gore charade. 
   We're going to see more and more of these con-games as sthe Year winds down, and this tired, worn-out administration desperately tries to reshape its disappointing place in history. 
   Mr. President, the time for delay is over. The time for gridlock is over. Now is the time to pass this important tax relief measure, and I urge the members of this body to come together and do what's right, by passing this legislation.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 6 minutes. I want to reserve 4 minutes for other people who want to speak on my amendment. 
   Mr. President, the amendment I'm offering on behalf of myself and others will assist millions of farmers across the Nation. In the midst of one of the worst farming crises we've seen, in addition to the estate tax repeal, it seems to me we ought to be doing everything we can to help farmers survive. 
   The package of measures included in this tax relief amendment include the following: 
   FARRM accounts. These farmer savings accounts would allow farmers to contribute up to 20 percent of their income in an account, and deduct it in the same year. FARRM accounts would be a very important ``risk management'' tool that will help farmers put away money when there's actual income, so that, in the really bad times, there will be a safety net. 
   This measure has strong bipartisan support and was actually sent to the President last year as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act that the President vetoed. 
   Reversing the unfair IRS decisions on self-employment tax for farmers. Farmers who participate in the Conservation Reserve Program are unnecessarily struggling during tax season because of a recent case pushed by the IRS. The latest 6th Circuit Court's ruling treats CRP as farm income subject to the additional self employment tax rate of 15 percent. Senator BROWNBACK has taken the lead on fixing this problem. This unfair tax not only ignores the intent of Congress in creating the CRP, it discourages farmers from using environmentally pro-active measures. At a time when farmers are struggling to regain their footing economically and do the right thing environmentally, it's important that Congress support them by upholding its promise on CRP. 
   In addition, this amendment includes an effort I've been leading to reverse an IRS attempt to apply the self-employment tax on farmer's cash rental income. 
   A tax deduction for farmers to donate to food banks. Senator LUGAR has led the effort to expand the current program where companies can donate to food banks, so that farmers can donate surplus food directly to needy food banks. This will be a win for the farmers and a big win for people who depend on food bank assistance. 
   Income averaging for farmers who are caught in the alternative minimum tax. This was also part of last year's vetoed bill. When we passed income averaging for farmers a few years ago, we neglected to take into account the problem of running into the alternative minimum tax, which many farmers are facing now. Our amendment will fix this growing problem. 
   Expansion of first-time farmer loans, or Aggie bonds. Our amendment expands opportunities for beginning farmers who are in need of low interest rate loans for capital purchases of farmland and equipment. Current law permits state authorities to issue tax  exempt bonds and to loan the proceeds from the sale of the bonds to beginning farmers and ranchers to finance the cost of acquring land, buildings and equipment used in a farm or ranch operation. 
   Unfortunately, Aggie bonds are subjected to a volume cap and must compete with big industrial projects for bond allocation. Aggie bonds share few similarities to industrial revenue bonds and should not be subjected to the volume cap established for IRBs. Insufficient allocation of funding due to the volume cap limits the effectiveness of this program. We can't stand by and allow the next generation of farmers to lose an opportunity to participate in farming because of competition with industry for reduced interest loan rates. 
   Repeal of the installment method for certain small businesses. Our amendment would repeal a law that was passed at the end of last year that's had a very negative effect on the small business community. Repeal of this draconian installment sales method is one of small business's biggest priorities. 
   Farmer co-op initiatives. Recently the IRS determined that some cooperatives should be exposed to a regular corporate tax due to the fact that they are using organic value-added practices rather than manufactured value-added practices. This is unfair, and needs to be fixed. 
   In addition, we want to allow small cooperative producers of ethanol to be able to receive the same tax benefits as large companies. Our amendment addresses these problems. 
   So, Mr. President, our amendment would do more for the American farmer regarding taxes than any measure in recent memory. I know others want to speak, so I would urge Members to strongly support this measure. It is an amendment that should have unanimous support. 
   I yield to the Senator from Minnesota 1 1/5 minutes.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, No. 2, I remind people the farmer savings accounts give the farmers an opportunity to level out years of high income versus years of low income. Very seldom, because of nature, can the farmers control their productivity to any great extent, so they have these peaks and valleys. This gives the family farmer an opportunity to manage his income to a greater extent. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, with this amendment we are making very certain that farmers are a high priority with this bill and with this body. 
   This amendment is a major package of tax benefits for farmers: No. 1, the farmers savings account; No. 2, fixing a number of misguided IRS decisions that are very detrimental to farming and not within the intent of Congress; No. 3, repealing the draconian installment sales provision which is a No. 1 provision that small business seeks; No. 4, to increase bonding for beginning farmers. 
   I thank Senators ROTH, ROBERTS, BROWNBACK, LUGAR, and GRAMS for their contributions. I urge its adoption.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments regarding the need to repeal the estate tax. The United States has had an estate or death tax of some form since 1916. The current version of the death tax came into existence after the Tax Reform act of 1976. This change combined the estate and gift tax structures in one gift and estate tax system, which is essentially a wealth transfer tax. Of course, that's what many on the other side stand for--they want to transfer your money to the federal government so they can decide how your money will be spent. 
   The Public Interest Institute at Iowa Wesleyan College has recently released a Policy Study entitled, ``A Declaration of Independence from Death Taxation: A Bipartisan Appeal.'' The director of the Institute is Dr. Don Racheter, who I know and respect very much. I'd like to thank Dr. Don Racheter for his help with providing this information. The study was written by Edward McCaffery of the University of Southern California Law School and Richard Wagner of George Mason University. I'd like to just mention three points made by the study. These three points show from both a liberal and conservative perspective that the death tax should be repealed. 
   First, we've heard the other side argue that this repeal really only affects the wealthiest of taxpayers. So, once again, the other side has rolled out the old, tired class warfare argument. The fact is the death tax affects nearly everyone, not just the wealthy. In fact, a 1999 poll showed that 84 percent of the people surveyed believe the estate tax affects other groups of Americans besides the wealthy. Anyone who owns a family business knows that the estate tax creates major hurdles for small and large family-owned enterprises, which in turn negatively affects local communities. While only about 2 percent of inherited estates are large enough to actually fall under the death tax, millions of more people have to spend substantial amounts of time and money planning their way around it. 
   All of society loses opportunities by these avoidance procedures. Such tactics are costly, inefficient, and they monopolize many professionals who could be spending their time on more productive endeavors. 
   The study also shows the death tax damages the patterns of work, savings, and capital information by encouraging taxpayers to slow their work and savings, give money away whenever possible, and spend the rest so they can die broke. By encouraging people to avoid this tax, we are damaging the entire system. 
   A second point the study makes is that the death tax does not provide the government with extra funds for social purposes, which our friends on the other side have been advocating. It only generates .01 to .0125% of the federal budget. More importantly, the amount of revenue collected from death tax filings has a negative impact on other forms of tax revenue and cash flow. This includes restricted savings and capital formation, hindered creation and growth of private family enterprises, lower amount of jobs, and a lower personal income. These effects lead to the loss of revenue from income taxes which is equal to or greater than that collected from the death tax. 
   So, when you add up the cost of collecting for the death tax, we do not gain much, if anything for our efforts. 
   I've heard these Treasury numbers of a $750 billion cost over 20 years or so from the other side. The Minority Leader mentioned the $750 billion number. Then, the senator from Minnesota, Senator WELLSTONE, upped it to $850 billion. Then, we heard Senator BOXER come up with a trillion dollar number. Among the three of them, they've already lost $250 billion! 
   And, of course, this close to the election, the Treasury Department is acting like an arm of the Democratic Party throwing numbers out of thin air to justify their cause. These estimates are about as believable as a Treasury three dollar bill. It's important to remember that many estates will lose their stepped-up basis under this repeal bill. Then, once the assets are sold, there will be a sizable capital gains tax on the entire appreciated value of the estate. 
   So, the government will still get a substantial amount of money from these estates over the long run, despite what the Treasury Department and the other side would have you believe.  
   Third, finally, we hear the argument that if the estate tax didn't exist, taxpayers would give less to charity since they wouldn't have to avoid the tax. I hope no one took seriously the so-called estimates that the senator from California alluded to, citing some ambiguous Finance Committee estimates that charities would lose $250 billion if the estate tax is repealed. I assume these estimates were created by the other side. So, once again, we have the Democrats conjuring up their own facts to make their arguments. 
   Beyond the cynicism of this charitable giving argument, the study argues that the tax exemption for charitable giving does not necessarily benefit private philanthropy. If encouraging charitable giving is going to be the goal of a tax, more specific income tax laws need to be made. 
   The study makes the point that this charitable giving claim is based on the assumption that the tax works as a subsidy to charitable bequests. In reality, the cost of one dollar of giving, no matter the tax rate, is one dollar. The death tax is neutral towards charitable bequests as long as these bequests are exempt from tax. 
   Keeping a complicated death tax to encourage charitable giving is not worth the economic and social costs to the government and the taxpayers. 
   Mr. President, the estate tax does not accomplish any of the goals it's supposed to. It doesn't raise money overall, or promote well-being. It stands in the way of human progress and encourages wasteful and time-consuming financial planning. I hope we repeal this complicated and inefficient tax and I urge everyone to support this effort.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code. My bill will facilitate phased retirement programs. In April I held a hearing in the Special Committee on Aging. The subject of the hearing was employment of older workers. Several experts told us what could be done to encourage older individuals to remain in the labor market. In today's tight labor markets, older workers are in great demand. Employers have numerous strategies to attract and retain them--one of those is phased retirement. 
   At our hearing, several witnesses testified that statutory changes to permit phased retirement programs would be helpful. One of those witnesses was Ms. September Dau from the Iowa Lakes Rural Electric Cooperative in Estherville, Iowa. Ms. Dau noted that the average age of the workforce at her Rural Electric Cooperative is high. Skilled workers are hard to come by and Iowa Lakes has implemented a phased retirement program in order to retain older workers. But they would like the comfort of knowing that their program is sanctioned. 
   Phased retirement allows a worker to wind down his or her career, by working part-time and retiring part-time. It helps many people maintain their income level rather than quitting work all at once. Financially, it can allow an individual to postpone the time when he or she has to draw down retirement savings. A study performed by Watson Wyatt Worldwide concluded that 16 percent of larger companies already offer phased retirement in some form and another 28 percent show a moderate to high level of interest in offering it in the next two years. But plan sponsors have worries about running afoul of the ``in-service distribution'' rules. Tax rules bar employees from receiving pension distributions before they reach a pension's normal retirement age, which is usually pegged to Social Security. That rule makes it difficult for those who wish to retire gradually and use reduced pension payments to augment reduced pay. It also helps circumvent the ``do-it-yourself'' phased retirement that some workers are forced into where they retire one day from their long-term employer and go to work the next day for someone else. This bill is designed to overcome those problems. At the same time, this provision is completely voluntary and so will not burden plan sponsors. 
   As I said, we heard from witnesses who supported phased retirement programs. I mentioned September Dau from the Iowa Lakes Rural Electric Cooperative. But another one was our friend and colleague, Congressman EARL POMEROY of North Dakota. Congressman POMEROY told the Committee that phased retirement programs should be allowed as a way of increasing the attractiveness of defined benefit pension plans. Phased retirement programs could also make defined benefit plans more adaptable to the human resource needs of plan sponsors. This is important to Congressman POMEROY because he is introducing a phased retirement bill that is identical to mine. 
   Defined benefit plans provide a stream of payments to retirees. They can go a long way to supplementing Social Security. But defined benefit plans are on the decline, especially among small businesses, whose employees are the least likely group to be covered by any form of retirement plan. We know that life expectancy is increasing. We also know that Americans are not saving enough to maintain their standard of living in retirement. By making defined benefit plans more attractive to employers and workers--such as by facilitating phased retirement--we are helping to improve the lives of everyday American people. 
   I hope that this bill is one step in that direction.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. I've long been committed to the effective and efficient management of the Medicare program, specifically the detection of fraud and abuse. I supported the creation of the MIP program, established under HIPAA, to provide a stable and increasing funding source for fraud and abuse detection efforts. Prior to MIP, Medicare contractor funding for anti-fraud and abuse activities was often reduced because of other spending priorities in the annual appropriations process. MIP was created to prevent that from happening again. The House Appropriations Committee recommendation is in clear disregard of congressional intent. 
   Additionally, I am concerned about the Senate Appropriations Committee recommendation to flatline the Medicare contractor budget. HCFA requested a $57 million increase to the Medicare contractor budget, in part to ensure implementation of certain balanced budget amendment provisions. Without this money, I am told by HCFA, that the final provisions of BBA will not be implemented. It doesn't make much sense to pass laws, if we don't provide the funding to ensure their implementation.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, at this time, I am seeking recognition in order to call to my colleagues' attention something that will happen today. At midnight today, bankruptcy protections for family farmers will disappear. Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code will expire. And America's family farming operation will be exposed to foreclosure and possible forced auctions. I think this will be a clear failure on the part of the Congress and the President to do their duty. How did we get here? After all, the Senate and House have passed bankruptcy reform bills which made chapter 12 permanent. But a small minority of Senators who oppose bankruptcy reform have apparently decided that they would rather see America's family farmers with no last-ditch safety net than let the House and Senate even convene a conference committee in order to get the two bills reconciled. 
   But even with these stall tactics, the House and Senate have met informally to resolve the bankruptcy bills. The informal agreement, of course, will make chapter 12 permanent. If we were allowed to pass this bill, America's family farmers would never again face the prospect of having no bankruptcy protections. 
   That's right Mr. President, we have the power right now to give family farmers last-ditch protection against foreclosures and forced sales. But, some of our more liberal friends won't let that happen. Some members of this body have just decided to play political chess games with bankruptcy reform, and they're willing to use family farmers as pawns to be expended in pursuit of some larger goal. 
   Mr. President, with the sluggishness we have in the farm sector, I think it's just plain wrong to play games with family farmers. Senator LOTT and the Republican leadership have tried to move the bankruptcy bill repeatedly and have been stymied every step of the way. We need to help our family farmers, not play games with their futures. The opponents of bankruptcy reform have resorted to tactics which are morally bankrupt. 
   Mr. President, back in the mid-1980's when Iowa was in the midst of another devastating farm crisis, I wrote chapter 12 to make sure that family farmers would receive a fair shake when dealing with the banks and the Federal Government. At that time, I didn't know if chapter 12 was going to work or not, so it was only enacted on a temporary basis. 
   Chapter 12 has been an unmitigated success. As a result of chapter 12, many farmers who once faced total financial ruin are still farming and contributing to America's economy. As was the case in the dark days of the mid-1980s, some are again predicting that farming operations should be consolidated and we should turn to corporate farming to supply our food and agricultural products. As with the 1980s, some people seem to think that family farms are inefficient relics which should be allowed to go out of business. This would mean the end of an important part of 
   our Nation's heritage. And it would put many hard working American families--those who farm and those whose jobs depend on a healthy agricultural sector--out of work. 
   But the family farm didn't disappear in the 1980s, and I believe that chapter 12 is a major reason for the survival of many financially troubled family farms. An Iowa State University study prepared by professor Neil Harl found that 85 percent of the Iowa farmers who used chapter 12 were able to continue farming. That's real jobs for all sorts of Iowans in agriculture and in industries which depend on agriculture. According to the same study, 63 percent of the farmers who used chapter 12 found it helpful in getting them back on their feet. In short, I think it's fair to say that chapter 12 worked in the mid 1980s, and it should be made permanent so that family farmers in trouble today can get breathing room and a fresh start if that's what they need to make it. It's shameful that some Senators who know better are continuing to play politics and deny a fresh start to family farmers. 
   But the bankruptcy reform bill doesn't just make chapter 12 permanent. Instead, the bill makes improvements to chapter 12 so it will be more accessible and helpful for farmers. First, the definition of family farmers is widened so that more farmers can qualify for chapter 12 bankruptcy protections. Second, and perhaps most importantly, the House and Senate agreed to reduce the priority of capital gains tax liabilities for farm assets sold as a part of a chapter 12 reorganization plan. This will have the beneficial effect of allowing cash-strapped farmers to sell livestock, grain and other farm assets to generate cash flow when liquidity is essential to maintaining a farming operation. Together, these reforms will make chapter 12 even more effective in protecting America's family farms during this difficult period. 
   Mr. President, it's imperative that we keep chapter 12 alive. Before we had chapter 12, banks held a veto over reorganization plans. They wouldn't negotiate with farmers, and the farmer would be forced to auction off the farm, even if the farm had been in the family for generations. Now, because of chapter 12, the banks are willing to come to terms. We must pass the bankruptcy reform bill to make sure that America's family farms have a fighting chance to reorganize their financial affairs.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today to tell my colleagues why I oppose the nomination of Mr. Donald Mancuso. 
   I would like my colleagues to understand why I have placed a hold on Mr. Mancuso's nomination. 
   Mr. Mancuso has been nominated to be the Inspector General (IG) at the Department of Defense (DOD). 
   Mr. President, over the years, I have made a habit out of watching the watchdogs. I have tried hard to make sure the IG's do their job. I want the IG's to be a bunch of junk yard dogs when it comes to overseeing their respective departments. 
   In doing this oversight work, I have learned one important lesson: the IG's must be beyond reproach. 
   Now that Mr. Mancuso's nomination has been submitted to the Senate for confirmation, this is the question we--in this body--must wrestle with: 
   Does Mr. Mancuso meet that standard? 
   Is Mr. Mancuso beyond reproach? 
   That's the question now before the Senate. 
   I have to ask myself that question because of something that happened a year ago. 
   In June 1999, a former agent from the Defense Criminal Investigative Service or DCIS walked into my office. He made a number of very serious allegations of misconduct about senior DCIS officials, including Mr. Mancuso. 
   And he had a huge bag full of documents to back them up. 
   Mr. Mancuso was the Director of DCIS from 1988 until 1997 when he became the Deputy DOD IG. 
   Mr. Mancuso was the Pentagon's top cop. He was in charge of the DOD IG's criminal investigative bureau. He was a senior federal law enforcement officer. 
   The allegations were very serious. 
   Many concerned Mr. Mancuso's internal affairs unit. 
   It was alleged that an agent assigned to the internal affairs unit had a history of falsifying reports to damage the reputation of fellow agents. 
   It was further alleged that Mr. Mancuso was aware of this problem yet failed to take appropriate corrective action. 
   It was alleged that Mr. Mancuso personally approved a series actions to protect a senior deputy who was under investigation for passport fraud. 
   It was alleged that Mr. Mancuso and the senior deputy were close personal friends. 
   The senior deputy happened to be in charge of the internal affairs unit. While head of that unit, this person is suspected of committing about 12 overt acts of fraud. He was eventually convicted and sent to jail. 
   Mr. Mancuso allegedly took extraordinary measures to shield this individual from the full weight of the law and departmental regulations. 
   It was also alleged that Mr. Mancuso engaged in retaliation and other prohibited personnel practices. 
   The Majority Staff on my Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts conducted a very careful examination of the allegations. 
   The results of this investigation were presented in a Majority Staff Report issued in October 1999. 
   Mr. President, I came to the floor on November 2, 1999 to discuss the contents of the report. 
   All supporting documentation--and there was a mountain of material--was simultaneously placed on the Judiciary Committee's web site. 
   The Majority Staff Report substantiated some of the allegations involving DCIS officials, including Mr. Mancuso. 
   I also sent a copy of the report and supporting documentation to Secretary of Defense Cohen. 
   Mr. President, I also wanted to be certain that my friend, Senator WARNER, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and my friend Senator THOMPSON, Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, were up to speed on this issue. 
   I have continued sending them material as the case has developed. 
   I want them to be informed about what I am doing and where I am headed with Mr. Mancuso's nomination. 
   Mr. President, after the staff report was issued, my office was inundated with phone calls from current and former DCIS agents with new allegations of misconduct by Mr. Mancuso and others. 
   The Majority Staff has investigated some of the new allegations, as well. Some have been substantiated and some have not. 
   The new findings have been summarized in letter reports. 
   Those have been shared with Secretary Cohen. 
   And I met with the new Deputy Secretary, Mr. Rudy de Leon, on May 24th to express my concerns about the allegations involving Mr. Mancuso. 
   Mr. President, I am not alone in raising questions about Mr. Mancuso's conduct. 
   At least six other government entities believe that the allegations are serious enough to warrant further investigation. These include:  
   Chief of the Criminal Division, Eastern District of Virginia 
   Integrity Committee of the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency 
   Public Integrity Section at the Justice Department 
   Inspector General, Department of the Treasury  
   U.S. Office of Special Counsel 
   Inspector General, General Services Administration  
   Most of these investigations are ongoing. However, at least one has been completed. 
   The Inspector General at the Treasury Department has corroborated some of the facts and conclusions in the Majority Staff Report. 
   I also know that the U.S. Attorney, who prosecuted Mr. Mancuso's senior deputy for passport fraud, is very unhappy with Mr. Mancuso's conduct in that case.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am joining Senator FEINGOLD of Wisconsin in introducing the Medicare Home Health Refinement Act of 2000. I want to thank my colleague for inviting me to join him in this effort to preserve our nation's home health providers. 
   In my work as Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, of which Senator FEINGOLD is a member, I have been monitoring our nation's critical home health care system closely. In 1997, we investigated distressing examples of fraud and abuse among a few home health agencies (HHAs). In 1998, I chaired a hearing on the devastating effects of the Interim Payment System (IPS) for home health. Unfortunately, my legislative efforts to improve the payment system that year were blocked. Last year, the Aging Committee held a hearing on the new OASIS information collection instrument, and on the burden it imposed on home care providers. 
   At this point in 2000, the main challenge facing our system of home care is the new Prospective Payment System (PPS), which will take effect on October 1 of this year. We've been working  toward this for many years, and I am gratified that it will finally happen. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) published the final PPS rule on June 28, and I was pleased to hear that many home health providers consider it an improvement over the proposed rule. After the trauma of the Interim Payment System, I have high hopes that the PPS will be great news for our Medicare beneficiaries who need home care. 
   Even so, the new PPS will pose major transitional challenges for home health agencies, and this bill seeks to ease that transition so that the PPS will succeed. The bill does the following: 
   1. Emergency cash flow assistance. The bill provides one-time advance payments to home health agencies during transition from IPS to PPS. Eligible agencies either have low cash reserves, have negative cash flow under PPS as defined by the Secretary of HHS, or were eligible to receive funds from the Periodic Interim Payment (PIP) system on September 30, 2000. Payments equal the average total Medicare costs incurred by the agency in a three-month period as reported on the agency's most recently settled cost report. Payments would be available for six months and repaid within twelve months. 
   Agencies would also receive 80 percent of the 60-day episode payment rate after notifying HCFA of admission, with the remaining 20 percent coming after submission of final episode claim, instead of 60/40 under the rule published on June 28, 2000. HCFA would also be prohibited from imposing conditions on a claim based on the status of an earlier claim for the same beneficiary. 
   The rationale for this is that PIP, which largely serves nonprofit, community-based agencies with minimal cash reserve, will be discontinued as of October 1. If PPS delays a substantial portion of payment until after termination of patient episode, providers will have significant cash flow problems. Many agencies are unable to secure lines of credit or other loans because of the effect of IPS on cash reserves. 
   2. Reimbursement for unfunded PPS-related costs. The bill reimburses agencies for technology costs required for PPS compliance, up to $10 per beneficiary. Payments would be authorized for Fiscal Years 2001 through 2003. 
   The rationale for this item: agencies have had to purchase new hardware, software, and other technology to comply with new rules. These costs are not reimbursed by Medicare. 
   3. Reimbursement for OASIS labor costs. It reimburses agencies for labor costs associated with OASIS assessments, up to $30 per beneficiary annually. Payments are authorized for FY 2001-2003. 
   This is needed because the final rule provides for only a modest payment per episode, despite an estimated hour of time needed for a skilled clinician to collect information at admission, plus time for data quality review and follow-up. 
   4. Creation of a fee schedule for non-routine medical supplies. The bill develops a separate fee schedule for medical supplies under prospective payment. 
   This is essential because PPS rates include the average medical supply cost, but some agencies' patient populations have greater or lesser medical supply needs. The original rates would underpay agencies that treat these vulnerable populations and overpay agencies that treat patients with low medical supply needs. This provision has no budget impact. 
   Mr. President, I recognize that there are other issues that pose a major threat to our home care system, including the 15 percent cut scheduled for October 2001. This bill does not address that issue, though it is obvious that Congress will have to do so. But this bill will help make the new PPS a success, so home care providers can use their resources to see patients, which is what they do best. I will seek the inclusion of this bill in any Finance Committee Medicare provider package we put together this year.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor the Plan Colombia Trade Act along with my colleague, Senator BOB GRAHAM. This important bill will supplement Plan Colombia by expanding trade benefits to the countries of Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru. 
   Plan Colombia is an important package that provides about a billion dollars to the government of Colombia, and other countries in that region. These funds will go to fight drugs, eradicate the crops which create them, and provide for alternative development. Unfortunately, Plan Colombia does not provide for an important measure that we can do to help these countries, that is to stimulate their economy. We can achieve this by passing the Plan Colombia Trade Act, which will provide assistance to develop their textile and apparel industries. 
   Developing the apparel industry of these countries will encourage global trade, and offer the good people of that region a future filled with prosperity. Additionally, the trade benefits outlined in this bill will enhance peace, stability, and prosperity in that region, which will ultimately yield a better quality of life for all involved. This bill will not only benefit the struggling economies of Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru, but will advance the economy of the United States as well. 
   As important as the assistance package to Colombia is, most of the money we provide will not reach ordinary Colombians. They also are engaged in the effort to combat illegal drugs. We need to ensure that they are not penalized for doing so. The current bill helps us help Colombians not with cash but with opportunity. It preserves legitimate jobs in a country sorely beset with problems. 
   Most garments that are produced in Colombia are subject to a 20-30% duty rate upon importation into the U.S. As an example, swimsuits are subject to a duty rate of 33%. By granting duty-free and quota-free benefits to apparel assembled in these countries from U.S. made yarn, and U.S. made fabric, these countries will now be able to compete with other developing countries that currently enjoy duty-free and quota-free benefits. It will also afford them the opportunity to participate in the global economy. This will encourage additional export of U.S. made cotton and yarn, stimulate U.S. investment in the region and create needed jobs as well. 
   This bill is an opportunity to help rebuild a region which has been plagued by the drug trade. We can assist these countries, not by giving them more money, but by providing these enhanced trade opportunities. By helping our neighbors in the south to maintain political and economic stability, we will in effect be securing the National Security of the United States. This legislation will provide these countries with the opportunity build their industry and their struggling economies and will improve the quality of their everyday lives. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important bill which will have a positive effect on the prosperity of our neighbors in Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am glad to join my colleagues in support of restoring funds to cuts made in the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill to the Social Services Block Grant program. This block grant program serves millions of older Americans, children and people with disabilities across the nation. The funding helps states provide services that no one else will provide. The money keeps people independent. It keeps them out of nursing homes. It keeps them employed. These are not frivolous services. They are critical to the well-being of thousands of people. 
   In my state of Iowa, more than 100,000 Iowans receive services under this block grant Polk County, including the city of Des Moines, gets this funding to transport developmentally disabled residents to doctor visits, physical therapy, employment, and day treatment. The county provides 56,000 of these trips each year. Under a funding cut, these rides could stop. Polk County's developmentally disabled residents would be on their own for transportation. 
   Polk County also funds residential treatment for developmentally disabled and mentally ill residents. The treatment costs $75 a day. That helps people avoid nursing home stays. It makes sense, because no one wants to go to a nursing home, and the expense is large. Under a funding cut, the county could eliminate residential treatment for 34 residents. 
   Clay County is already having trouble providing placements for clients with mental health problems and developmental disabilities. The county has a waiting list for placements. Providers' fees have been frozen for over three years. 
   I hope to spare any Iowans from more worry about this funding. It's a relief to hear assurances of complete funding of social services.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation to make  technical corrections to the Bipartisan Social Security Reform bill my colleagues and I introduced last summer. The purpose of this legislation is simple: to conform our previous legislative language to changes that have been made in the Social Security program--such as eliminating the earnings limit--since last July; to correct some inadvertent errors we discovered; and to update our assumptions to reflect the new reality of the Trust Funds as reported in the 2000 Social Security and Medicare Trustees Report which came out earlier this year. 
   Since July 16, 1999 when Senators GREGG, KERREY, BREAUX, THOMPSON, THOMAS, and ROBB and I introduced our legislation to save Social Security, the issue has taken on new life, due to Governor Bush's willingness to make Social Security reform a primary issue in his presidential campaign. He should be commended for his leadership and for grabbing the third rail of American politics fearlessly in order to create a truly secure Social Security system so that future generations will be able to rely on Social Security like their parents and grandparents. 
   I want to urge my colleagues to take a serious look at our proposal to save Social Security. It was designed in a bipartisan, bicameral manner: four Republicans and three Democrats cosponsored the Bipartisan Social Security Reform Bill, and Congressmen KOLBE and STENHOLM sponsored similar legislation in the House of Representatives. 
   The bipartisan plan would maintain a basic floor of protection through a traditional Social Security benefit, but two percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax would be redirected to individual accounts. Individuals could invest their personal accounts in any combination of the funds offered through the Social Security system. An individual who invested his or her personal account in a bond fund would receive a guaranteed interest rate. However, individuals who wish to pursue a higher rate of return through investment in a fund including equities could do so. 
   Our proposal would eliminate the need for future payroll tax increases by advance funding a portion of future benefits through personal accounts. With individual accounts, we provide Americans with the tools necessary to build financial independence in retirement--especially to those who previously had limited opportunities to create wealth. The legislation provides incentives for low and middle income working Americans to save additional funds for retirement by matching their voluntary contributions to their individual accounts. Under our plan, they will be able to save for retirement and benefit from economic growth. 
   As all the cosponsors have said a hundred times, our proposal offers no ``free lunch''. In order to save Social Security for future generations it must be modernized. We have crafted a responsible plan to save Social Security for generations to come. By making incremental, steady changes to the Social Security system, we will be able to ensure the long-term solvency of the program. 
   With this technical corrections bill we have improved upon our original legislation and I urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan proposal to save Social Security.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to bring my colleagues attention to the importance of what we are trying to do with emergency aid to Colombia. Why is this aid important? And why is now an emergency? 
   Illegal drugs pose a direct, immediate threat to the health and safety of the citizens of the United States. Today, a majority of the cocaine and heroin consumed in the United States, is grown, processed, and smuggled from Colombia. 
   The Senate, today, has the opportunity to act. We have the opportunity to provide a needed boost to the Government of Colombia and their efforts to halt illegal drug production in their country. They have a plan, and they have asked the U.S. for support. We should provide it.  
   That said, I don't want to mislead anyone into thinking this is either the perfect or final assistance package that will come before the Senate for Colombia. However, it is a good start. It will strengthen the Colombian military while emphasizing the importance of human rights. It will provide additional resources for the Colombian National Police, and strengthen U.S. Colombian, and other nations in regional interdiction capabilities in and around Colombia. Personally, I would like to see more money for intelligence collection, and more emphasis on coordination of activities between the Military and National Police, and more assistance to Colombia to strengthen the rule of law. However, these are all things that can be addressed in future appropriations. We also need to address economic and trade issues to help the legal economies in the region. This package provides important assistance needed now to a government with the will and ability to act. 
   The drug problem is not going to be solved overnight. To confront this threat, we must work locally, as well as internationally. We must provide assistance so those who have been seduced by drug use can get help, but we also--and I would say this has to be our first focus--we also must keep people from becoming addicts in the first place. This means education and prevention. It means using the law to punish those who break it, providing the resources to help those who become addicted, and it also means focused programs to stop drugs at the source. That means that it is in both the moral and strategic interest of the United States to support the Government of Colombia in its efforts to rid the country of drug production. We should not squander this opportunity.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak on the topic of bankruptcy reform. As many of my colleagues may know, Congress is on the verge of enacting fundamental bankruptcy reform. Earlier this year, the Senate passed bankruptcy reform by an overwhelming vote of 83-14. Almost all Republicans voted for the bill and about one-half of the Democrats voted for it as well. Despite this, a tiny minority of Senators are using undemocratic tactics to prevent us from going to conference with the House of Representatives. 
   As I'm speaking now, the House and Senate have informally agreed on 99 percent of all the issues and have drafted an agreement which has bicameral and bipartisan support. The remaining three issues are sort of side shows, and I'm confident we'll be able to move from the one yard line to the end zone. My remarks this morning relate the agreement we've reached on the core bankruptcy issues and the continuing need for bankruptcy reform. 
   As I've stated before on the Senate floor, every bankruptcy filed in America creates upward pressure on interest rates and prices for goods and services. The more bankruptcies filed, the greater the upward pressure. I know that some of our more liberal colleagues are trying to stir up opposition to bankruptcy reform by denying this point and saying that tightening bankruptcy laws only helps lenders be more profitable. This just isn't true. Even the Clinton administration's own Treasury  Secretary Larry Summers indicated that bankruptcies tend to drive up interest rates. Mr. President, if you believe Secretary Summers, bankruptcies are everyone's problem. Regular hardworking Americans have to pay higher prices for goods and services as a result of bankruptcies. That's a compelling reason for us to enact bankruptcy reform during this Congress. 
   Of course, any bankruptcy reform bill must preserve a fresh start for people who have been overwhelmed by medical debts or sudden, unforeseen emergencies. That's why the bill that passed the Senate--as well as the final bicameral agreement--allows for the full, 100 percent deductibility of medical expenses. This is according to the nonpartisan, unbiased General Accounting Office. Bankruptcy reform must be fair, and the bicameral agreement on bankruptcy preserves fair access to bankruptcy for people truly in need. 
   These are good times in our Nation. Thanks to the fiscal discipline initiated by Congress, and the hard work of the American people, we have a balanced budget and budget surplus. Unemployment is low, we have a burgeoning stock market and most Americans are optimistic about the future. 
   But in the midst of this incredible prosperity, about 1 1/2 million Americans declared bankruptcy in 1998 alone. And in 1999, there were just under 1.4 million bankruptcy filings. To put this in some historical context, since 1990, the rate of personal bankruptcy 
   filings has increased almost 100 percent. 
   With large numbers of bankruptcies occurring at a time when Americans are earning more than ever, the only logical conclusion is that some people are using bankruptcy as an easy out. The basic policy question we have to answer is this: Should people with means who declare bankruptcy be required to pay at least some of their debts or non? Right now, the current bankruptcy system is oblivious to the financial condition of someone asking to be excused from paying his debts. The richest captain of industry could walk into a bankruptcy court tomorrow and walk out with his debts erased. And, as I described earlier, the rest of America will pay higher prices for goods and services as a result. 
   I would ask my liberal friends to think about that for a second. If we had no bankruptcy system at all, and we were starting from scratch, would we design a system that lets the rich walk away from their debts and shift the costs to society at large, including the poor and the middle class? That wouldn't be fair. But that's exactly the system we have now. Fundamental bankruptcy reform is clearly in order. 
   Mr. President, I want my colleagues to know that the bicameral agreement preserves the Torricelli-Grassley amendment to require credit card companies to give consumers meaningful information about minimum payments on credit cards. Consumers will be warned against making only minimum payments, and there will be an example to drive this point home. As with the Senate-passed bill, the bicameral agreement will give consumers a toll-free phone number to call where they can get information about how long it will take to pay off their own credit card balances if they make only the minimum payments. This new information will truly educate consumers and improve the financial literacy of millions of American consumers. 
   The bicameral agreement also makes chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code permanent. This means that America's family farms are guaranteed the ability to reorganize as our farm economy continues to be weak. As we all know from our recent debate on emergency farm aid, while prices have rebounded somewhat, farmers in my home State of Iowa and across the Nation are getting some of the lowest prices every for pork, corn, and soybeans. And fuel prices have shot up through the roof. The bicameral agreement broadens the definition of ``family farmer'' and permits farmers in chapter 12 to avoid crushing capital gains taxes when selling farm assets to generate cash flow. It would be highly irresponsible of my liberal friends to continue blocking bankruptcy protections for our family farmers in this time of need. 
   The bicameral agreement is solidly bi-partisan and will pass by a huge margin when it comes up for a vote. The bill is fair and contains some of the broadest consumer protections of any legislation passed in the last decade. So, how can any person possibly argue against a bill which strengthens consumer protections 
   while cracking down on abuses by the well-to-do? 
   The tiny handful of fringe radicals who oppose bankruptcy reform have waged a disinformation campaign worthy of a Soviet Commissar. A recent article in Time Magazine is a case in point. This article purports to prove that bankruptcy reform will harm low-income people or people with huge medical bills. This article is simply false. 
   What's most interesting about this Time article is what it fails to report. Time, for instance, fails to mention that the means test, which sorts people who can repay into repayment plans, doesn't apply to families below the median income for the State in which they live. The Time article then proceeds to give several examples of families who would allegedly be denied the right to liquidate if bankruptcy reform were to pass. Each of these families, however, would not even be subjected to the means test since they earn less than the median income. While this sounds technical, it's important--not even one of the examples in the Time article would be affected by the means test. For the convenience of my colleagues, I have collected the actual bankruptcy petitions of the families referred to in the Time article, and I will provide them to any Senator. 
   Time fails to mention the massive new consumer protections in our bankruptcy reform bill. Time fails to mention the new disclosure requirements on credit cards regarding interest rates and minimum payments. In short, the Time article fails to tell the whole truth. I think that the American people deserve the whole truth. 
   The truth is that these bankruptcies represent a clear and present danger to America's small businesses. Growth among small businesses is one of the primary engines of our economic success. 
   The truth is bankruptcies hurt real people. Sometimes that will be inevitable. But it's not fair to permit people who can repay to skip out on their debts. I think most people, including most of us in Congress, have a basic sense of fairness that tells us bankruptcy reform is needed to restore balance. Let me share what my constituents are telling me.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, bankruptcy reform will happen. Our cause is right and just, and average Americans are strongly supportive of restoring fairness to the bankruptcy system. 
   I am going to yield the floor now. Before I do, I thank Senator BIDEN, who is next to speak on this subject. If it had not been for Senator BIDEN working with us in a bipartisan way to get bankruptcy reform, it would never have passed by the wide margin of 84-13. He is a sincere person working on this. He has contributed immensely to it.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak as a member of the Judiciary Committee, but I will back up the Senator from Arkansas on one very key point that I hope can happen in this Congress. I urge, as she has done, that a bill to reauthorize the Older Americans Act come to the floor of the Senate because it has been so long since that law has been reauthorized on a permanent basis. I understand it has been reauthorized on a year-to-year basis, but not on a permanent basis as it ought to be, or at least for a multiyear basis. So I urge that action to be taken at this particular time.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak on the subject of technology. The message on technology is very simple. Technology is moving fast, but somehow Congress does not pass laws that keep up with the technology. I wish to state the proposition that, from the standpoint of the right to privacy, our laws cannot be left behind. Every day, more and more Americans are waking up to what technology can do to improve their lives. Thanks to the hard work of the American people in the technology sector, we live in an amazing time. Congress didn't bring about this revolution, and Congress should not do anything to impede the rapid changes taking place in technology. 
   However, one of the main threats to the growth of electronic commerce is the risk of a massive erosion of privacy. While the Internet offers tremendous benefits, it also comes with the potential for harm. If we lack confidence that our privacy will be protected online, we won't take full advantage of what the Internet has to offer. The Judiciary Committee is now considering a bill to protect the privacy of Internet users. I want to focus on one particular issue, and that is maintaining privacy of personal health information obtained by web sites. 
   I happen to believe, as a matter of basic principle, that information about my health is very personal, and nobody else should know that without my permission. So I am pleased to join my colleague from New Jersey, Senator TORRICELLI, in cosponsoring an amendment on this issue before the Judiciary Committee. I think it will be up this week, on Thursday. 
   The amendment Senator TORRICELLI and I plan to sponsor will give citizens a chance to control any health information that they might provide while surfing the web. None of that will be passed on to others without their explicit permission. Our amendment simply provides that a commercial web site operator must obtain permission from a person before sending health information to another entity. In addition, it would require that individuals be told to whom their medical information will be released if permission is given. 
   I know to people watching this sounds like a pretty simple, commonsense thing, that there would be no dispute and it ought to be part of the laws of our country under our Constitution that personal information not be sold or used by anybody else without the personal permission of the person who that medical information is about. It sounds pretty simple that it ought to be part of our law. It appears to be such common sense that maybe we should not even have to deal with that; it is just common sense that nobody else should profit from your personal information without telling you about it and without your permission. 
   It is only fair--it seems to myself and to Senator TORRICELLI--to put that burden on the web site operator and not on the consumer. Medical information can be highly personal, and consumers face serious risk if it becomes a public commodity that can be bought and sold without the individual's consent. If that is allowed, then we are all at risk. 
   As far as your own personal information being a public commodity that can be sold--outside the fact that it shouldn't be done without your permission, not only to protect your privacy but you ought to know about the information being disseminated and to whom it is going, it is also the fact that personal health information, if it is a commodity, is under your personal, private property rights, and they ought to be protected just as personal property rights are protected under our Constitution.  
   The Department of Health and Human Services is working on regulations to finalize medical privacy rules this summer. I understand that for the most part those rules would set up a mechanism so individuals would have to opt into the procedure of giving permission for their medical information to be disseminated--opting in meaning that you have to actually say, I give permission for my medical information to be used in such and such a way, as opposed to kind of an opt-out situation where your personal medical information will be disseminated unless you say it can't be disseminated. From that standpoint, the Department of Health and Human Services rules, which they say will actually come out this way, will be in agreement with the goals of our amendment. I see the need to allow the process in the Department of Health and Human Services to finish. 
   The current draft of our amendment explicitly will not interfere with those rules and the rulemaking process now going on, and it also does not apply to entities subject to those proposed rules, such as health plans and providers. 
   Our amendment gets at those commercial health web sites to which the protections of Health and Human Services rules will not apply. But having said that, our amendment is pending. 
   Having made clear that our amendment does not interfere with the Department of Health and Human Services rulemaking now going on, I want to put President Clinton on notice, if it turns out that the final Health and Human Services rules are inadequate from the standpoint of protecting the personal privacy of health information of individuals, having this amendment in the bill as a placeholder will provide those of us in Congress who are concerned about this issue of privacy of medical health information a vehicle to strengthen the HHS rules legislatively in the future if necessary. There should be ample time for that because realistically we all know that more work will have to be done on Internet privacy before final enactment. 
   Senator TORRICELLI and I are open to ideas on how to improve the amendment. But let me make clear that I am adamant on the point that people should have a basic right to control their medical information, and to control it from the standpoint of making a separate individual decision as to whether that information can be disseminated--not from the opposite point of view that if they fail to say it can't be used it can be legally disseminated. I believe that very strongly. 
   We all know there are special interests out there that do not agree with us. I happen to think they are wrong. I look forward to having this issue aired fully in the committee. We should protect citizens' most confidential information from those who misuse it. I suppose there is a lot of confidential information other than just medical information about an individual that we ought to be concerned about. But I can't think of anything more personal or that could be more destructive to the individual than medical information. 
   We should also arm our citizens to make a thoughtful and informed decision on how their health information will be used--even educating them about the possibility that because they use the Internet certain health information about them can be disseminated. I am not so sure that we don't take the use of the Internet and technology so much for granted today that we often don't think about what we are doing and what we are putting into it about ourselves, and who might be making use of that. It is important for us to be informed about the possibilities. Once we have done that, I think the American people can be assured that they can go online without having surrendered their privacy rights. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, recently Congress passed the Agricultural Risk Protection Act. This legislation provides reform for the Federal Crop Insurance Program, economic assistance to farmers, and the establishment of new, innovative programs to assist the agricultural community. One of the innovative programs established in the bill is what I have termed the Agriculture Marketing Equity Capital Fund. 
   The Agriculture Marketing Equity Capital Fund will assist independent grain and livestock producers nationwide develop new value-added agricultural opportunities. Independent producers will use these funds to develop business plans, feasibility studies, and business ventures with packers and processors. 
   While I was able to garner the support of many of the nation's largest commodity organizations, I met fierce opposition from the American Meat Institute's Washington lobbyists. My floor statement during the debate over the crop insurance conference report was highly critical of their efforts. It is not my intent to attack the individual members of AMI, but I believe it is important that they understand my position. 
   AMI's Washington lobbyists misrepresented the provision. A story written within ``Inside AMI'' recently explained:  
   Senator Chuck Grassley pushed conferees to provide for a $35 million Agriculture Marketing Equity Capital Fund. The proposal was yet another attempt to fund an NPPC proposal that seeks to secure government funding to establish a national pork cooperative and use government funds to buy, build or purchase equity in a pork slaughter and processing facility.  
   This a blatant misrepresentation of the facts. My provision never had anything to do with publicly financing the construction of a pork plant. 
   My staff did contact AMI's Washington lobbyists who explained the opposition was based on the possibility of government-funded competition and specifically that funds would be used to develop a plant. In good faith, my staff offered AMI's Washington lobbyists an opportunity to offer their input on the legislation. 
   I cannot guarantee that AMI's input would have been acceptable to me, but we will never know if a mutually beneficial position could have been established because my office never received a response. I have been a friend of the agriculture community for a very long time. I am disappointed and dismayed by the way this was handled by AMI's Washington representatives. 
   As I promised in my crop insurance floor statement, I am today asking unanimous consent to place a list of AMI's member companies in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. Once again, I'm not saying that every processor or packer on this list knew what AMI's Washington lobbyists were doing, but I hope to inform every member what happened and why independent producers won't have the funds to reach out to processors in joint ventures and receive working capital to help everyone survive and thrive. I am also enclosing the text of a letter I recently sent to AMI's members. 
   It is my hope that members of AMI see the value of my efforts and work with me in the future to improve the plight of the independent producer. Providing stability to family farmers through joint ventures with AMI's membership would only serve to benefit both parties in the long-run.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am submitting, along with Senators BIDEN, THURMOND, BRYAN, JEFFORDS, MOYNIHAN, HELMS, LEVIN, DEWINE, KENNEDY, SESSIONS, MURRAY, SCHUMER, and INOUYE, a bi-partisan resolution designating Monday, June 19, 2000 as ``Eat Dinner with your Children Day.'' We also join with our House colleagues Congressmen RANGEL and MCCOLLUM as they take the lead on this bipartisan issue in the House of Representatives. This resolution recognizes the benefits of eating dinner as a family, especially as a way to keep children from using illegal drugs, tobacco, and alcohol. 
   Last October I came to the floor seeking to increase awareness of the important roles parents play in their children's lives. A recent study by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, or CASA reinforced our understanding of the importance of this role. CASA is a national resource that monitors and reports on drug abuse trends, risks, and solutions affecting all Americans. Last September they released their annual back to school survey on the attitudes of teens and parents regarding substance abuse. The survey stressed how essential it is for parents to get involved in their children's lives. The survey indicates that kids actually do listen to their parents. In fact, 42 percent of the teenagers who have never used marijuana credit their parents with the decision. Unfortunately, too many parents--45 percent--believe their teenagers' use of drugs is inevitable. In addition, 25 percent of the parents said they have little influence over their teen's substance abuse. 
   But the kids have got it right. Parents are critical. So are families. That is why the sponsors of this bill are happy to work with Joe Califano, the head of CASA, to help remind all of us of this simple fact. 
   The family unit is the backbone of this country. Solutions to our drug problems involve all of us working together. Parents and communities must be engaged and I am committed to help making that happen. Parents need to provide a strong moral context to help our young people know how to make the right choices. They need to know how to say ``no,'' that saying no is okay, that saying no to drugs is the right thing to do--not just the safe or healthier thing, but the right thing. I urge our colleagues to join us.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might consume, obviously up to the limit, but I will not use all of it. 
   I will make a few brief remarks about the pending amendment which I laid down last night and spoke shortly on that particular time. My amendment requires the Department of Defense to match disbursements with obligations before making payments.  
   I know this sounds like commonsense stuff--it is really basic accounting 101--but it goes to a very major problem we have within the Department of Defense. They don't always make payments based on invoices. They don't always match the check being mailed out for certain goods or services received. 
   I am sure my colleagues must be wondering why the Senator from Iowa has to offer an amendment such as this. They must be asking themselves this question: Isn't DOD already doing it? 
   Unfortunately, the fact remains that the Pentagon bureaucrats are not doing it. 
   Businesses do it on a routine basis. And most citizens do it, too. You just don't write out a check and pay a bill until you are absolutely certain that you owe the money. You must first verify that you have a legitimate obligation to pay the bill. And you have enough money in the bank to cover it. 
   This amendment and device that has been used now for several years to try to straighten things out in the Pentagon is a handy device also for deterring fraud. And it helps to prevent mismanagement and other abuses in the Pentagon's vast financial accounts. 
   This policy has been incorporated in the last six appropriations acts. 
   Each year we have ratcheted down the threshold or dollar level where the matching must be done. 
   In 1995, we started out with payments of $5 million. 
   Each year since then, we have gradually lowered the threshold but always keeping the pressure on for reform. 
   Last year the Senate voted to lower the threshold to $500,000. 
   This year--in the amendment--I am recommending that the threshold be maintained at $500,000. 
   I think we should keep it at the current level for another year. I am not sure DOD is ready to move to a lower level--not meaning that it wouldn't be right to move to a lower level. But if they don't have the mechanical capability of moving to a lower level, we want to make sure that we make progress in this area. However, we don't want to hold up the normal way of doing business or the process of doing business in the Defense Department. 
   The General Accounting Office will look at this issue again and determine when and how the threshold should be lowered in the future, and in future years I would follow their recommendations. 
   I also take this opportunity to thank my good friend from Alaska, the chairman of the committee, Senator STEVENS, and my good friend from Hawaii, the ranking minority member, Senator INOUYE, for their support of this amendment. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this measure. 
   I yield the floor. 
   If it is the desire that other Members yield back the remainder of their time, I will yield my time.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on behalf of the Chairman of the Budget Committee, who is necessarily absent, I submit his budget statement and scoring table on S. 2593, the Department of Defense appropriations bill. 
   I support S. 2593, the Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001. As scored by the Congressional Budget Office without any further adjustments, the pending bill provides $287.6 billion in total budget authority and $178.9 billion in new outlays for the Department of Defense and related activities. When adjusted for outlays from prior years, the bill totals $277.2 billion in outlays. 
   The bill, as reported, is consistent with the level of budget authority made available by the 2001 congressional budget resolution. It is also within the allocation of budget authority and outlays made available pursuant to section 302(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I oppose Senator KENNEDY's amendment. Introducing this amendment at this time is a clear statement that Democratic leaders want an election issue, not a Patients' Bill of Rights. It is a cynical ploy, made in bad faith, and they ought to be ashamed of themselves. 
   The Senate voted on this bill last year, after full debate, and rejected it in favor of a better product. Since that time, the conferees have been working on a compromise. In the past week, Republican negotiators made an offer with major new concessions. Was this greeted with a Democrat counteroffer that moved toward the middle? No, it's answered with this attempt to blow up those negotiations. If my colleagues don't want to legislate, if they just want to create election issues, they don't deserve to be here. 
   Let me be specific. Republican negotiators have made an offer to their Democrat counterparts that would allow lawsuits to be brought if a health plan has rejected the decision of an independent reviewer and the enrollee has fully utilized the plan's appeal mechanism. Full economic damages could be sought, and punitive damages would be available, subject to limits. Employers, however, would be expressly protected from lawsuits, addressing a key concern of those who provide coverage to workers. These are major, major concessions. That's obvious. 
   In my view, this offer reasonably balances the need for fairness to consumers who are wronged with the need to keep health insurance costs low so that employers continue to offer coverage. But it was dismissed without even a serious response by the other side. If no agreement is reached this year, let everyone understand who will be to blame. It is the Democrats who have decided that they're better off with no bill than with a bill. 
   After this stunt fails, I hope that the President and Congressional Democrats will change their obstructionist strategy so that the Patients' Bill of Rights can become a reality, this year. In the meantime, I am voting against Senator KENNEDY's attempt to short-circuit our legislative process.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this amendment pertains to Department of Defense (DOD) disbursements. 
   It requires DOD to match certain disbursements with obligations prior to payment. 
   This policy has been incorporated in the last six appropriations acts: Fiscal years 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000. 
   Each year we have ratcheted down the threshold. 
   The threshold is the dollar amount of the disbursement that must be matched with its corresponding obligation. 
   We started at the $5 million level. 
   Under current law, the threshold is now set at 500,000.00 dollars. 
   In 1999, the Senate voted to lower the threshold from $1 million to the current level. 
   Both the DOD Inspector General and the General Accounting Office have repeatedly stated that policy is a good idea. 
   It is helping the department to control the flow of money. 
   First, it is an important internal control procedure. It is a first-line of defense against fraudulent payments. 
   If a corresponding obligation cannot be identified, the payment cannot be made. It is as simple as that. 
   Second, it is helping the department avoid ``problem disbursements'' or unmatched disbursements. 
   A few years ago, the department had unmatched disbursements totaling about 50 billion dollars. This situation created gaping holes in DOD's books of account. 
   And these gaping holes in the books of account are one big reason why DOD consistently fails to earn a ``clean'' opinion in the annual CFO audits. 
   Those are the audits required by the Chief Financial Officers Act. 
   And third, it is helping the department avoid overobligations, that is, making payments in excess of available funding. 
   This year I am recommending that the threshold be retained at the current level of 500,000.00 dollars. 
   The General Accounting Office needs to do more audit follow-up work before the threshold is lowered any further. 
   I thank the chairman and the ranking minority member for supporting this policy and urge my colleagues to vote for the amendment. 
   I should ask the chairman of the committee if he wants to order a rollcall at this point because it is my understanding he wanted a rollcall vote on it.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to commend many of my colleagues who were instrumental in the development of this legislation. The conference report before us today represents new opportunities for family farmers through a reformed crop insurance program and short term assistance in the form of an additional economic relief payment equivalent to the levels established last year. 
   The conference report before us today provides Congress with an opportunity to assist farmers during this time of need. My friends and neighbors just came off a year in which they lost tremendous amounts of equity due to commodity prices hitting twenty year lows. If we would not have provided an economic relief payment last year we would have lost many more family farmers. 
   What does a strong agricultural economy mean for my home state of Iowa? The agricultural industry contributes a total of around $70 billion and 446,000 jobs in Iowa. Therefore, when things are in bad shape down on the farm, all Iowans feel the negative economic effects. 
   While commodity prices have improved slightly from last year, margins are still tight. We promised our constituents a smooth transition from the failed, government-dominated farm policies of the last 63 year period prior to 1996. We must follow through on that promise, and this legislation helps us fulfill that goal. 
   This bill provides tremendous opportunities for farmers. The Crop Insurance title helps farmers utilize additional risk management activities. Farmers can increase their individual coverage levels thanks to better premium subsidies. And for the first time, pilot programs will be available to determine how livestock producers can be included as an insurable commodity. 
   I also want to thank the members of the Senate Budget Committee in supporting my efforts earlier this year in crafting a budget resolution which set aside over $15 billion to help farmers. The bill before us today would not have been possible otherwise. The Budget Committee's work and cooperation allowed the Agriculture Committee to supply farmers with the funds necessary for the smooth transition farmers deserve by providing what is viewed as an additional AMTA payment at 1999 levels. 
   The package also includes $500 million for oilseeds, $7 million to cover pseudorabies vaccination costs incurred by pork producers, and $15 million for what I have termed the Agricultural Marketing Equity Capital Fund. 
   The Agriculture Marketing Equity Capital Fund will provide $10 million to establish grants for developing new value-added agricultural markets for independent producers. This fund will assist agricultural producers by providing grants for ventures to capture a greater share of the consumer food dollar. 
   It is my hope that the fund will help independent grain and livestock producers find real solutions to address the loss of competition in agricultural markets, to combat concentration in food production and processing, and create new value-added business opportunities for groups like: 
   The Iowa Cattlemen, who are developing a regional ``grid'' of producers to supply cattle to a proposed harvest facility being developed with the cooperation of one of the nation's largest processors; 
   Heartland Grain Fuels, a group of grain producers who have banded together in Huron, South Dakota to develop an ethanol facility; 
   Iowa Premium Pork, a group of 1,400 pork producers across my home state which have joined together in a cooperative venture to market their hogs; 
   Sunrise Energy, an ethanol plant in Blairstown, Iowa; 
   The 21st Century Group, independent dairy producers from Kansas; 
   Pork America, a national cooperative of independent pork producers; and 
   The New Jersey Farm Bureau, which recently commissioned a study to determine the feasibility of ethanol production and held a meeting at which 300 New Jersey farmers attended due to their interest in value-added opportunities. 
   An informal poll by my office found hundreds of millions of dollars in possible requests for this type of program. The reason for this is that family farmers cannot compete with an industry that has billions of dollars in equity and capital resources and which seems to be willing to use this advantage to kill any producer driven competition. 
   Industry's aggressive stance toward competition from farmers made it impossible for me to provide more money for independent producers. In fact, the American Meat Institute, which is the political muscle behind 70 percent of the packers and processors in the US, fought against this provision tooth and nail. 
   When I found out that AMI was opposing my efforts to help farmers I knew that I must be doing something right. I just want the leadership of AMI to know that I was very aware of his efforts and I hope that AMI's successful opposition to my request for $35 million to help America's family farmers was worth it to them. 
   I plan to publish AMI's membership in the record and I hope that every independent producer in the nation takes a good look at who is trying to limit value-added opportunities for family farmers. I'm not saying that every processor or packer knew exactly what AMI's Washington lobbyists were doing, but I sure hope to inform every member, through one medium or another, what happened and why independent producers won't have the funds to reach out to processors in joint ventures and receive working capital to help everyone survive and thrive. 
   One last point, if you thought I was pushing hard for my agri-industry concentration legislation before, hold on to your seat. 
   Regardless of my disappointment in industry's effort to kill my provision, on the whole, this bill includes a bold new approach that will help create a brighter future for family farmers and their rural communities. 
   Mr. President, in summation I want to thank my colleagues on the Ag Committee who worked hard to develop this package. This bill is good for Iowa and good for agriculture and the family farmer nationwide. I look forward to sending it to the President and for the President to sign it quickly so that we may provide family farmers with the tools they need to be successful in today's marketplace.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I'd like to take a few moments to address a health issue of critical importance to Americans, especially older women. Osteoporosis affects 28 million Americans, 80 percent of whom are women. Nearly one in every two women and one in every eight men over age 50 will experience an osteoporotic fracture in his or her lifetime. This disease measurably impact the ability of many older Americans to maintain the independence and mobility so integral to mental well-being. 
   Osteoporosis is estimated to cost the United States care system $14 billion annually. In my home state of Iowa, it is estimated that $2.9 billion will be spent over the next 20 years as a result of hip, wrist and vetebral fractures. Annual costs are expected to increase from $76 million in 1995 to more than $229 million in 2015. 
   According to the Iowa Department of Elder Affairs, Iowa is the state with the highest proportion of people considered to be the ``oldest old'' in the country. Twenty percent are 80 years of age and over. The people in this age segment are more frequently women. They are usually living alone; and they are probably the persons with the lowest incomes. 
   One of the most sobering facts is that osteoporosis is largely preventable. Prevention is a key element in fighting the disease, because while there are numerous treatments for osteoporosis, there is no cure. According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation, there are four ways an individual can prevent osteoporosis. First, maintain a balanced daily diet rich in calcium and vitamin D. Participate in weight-bearing exercise. Do not smoke or drink excessively. And finally, when appropriate, have your bone density tested and take any physician-prescribed medications. All this to say, osteoporosis is a disease which we in the Senate cannot afford to take lightly. 
   The National Osteoporosis Foundation has declared May to be National Osteoporosis Prevention Month. In my capacity as an honorary member of the foundation's board of trustees, I am glad to have the opportunity to come to the floor to raise the issue of osteoporosis and speak on the need for continued vigilance in battling this disease. 
   In addition to being National Osteoporosis Prevention Month, May also marks a one-year anniversary for a special group in Iowa. In May 1999, a group of Newton, Iowa, residents formed the Newton Support Group under the leadership of Peg Bovenkamp and with the help of Skiff Medical Center. The Newton group is the first Iowa support network affiliated with the National Osteoporosis Foundation. Today, the members of the Newton Support Group are participating in Newton's Senior Citizen's Health Fair. I wish them success as they provide information to older Iowans about osteoporosis prevention and treatment. It is my sincere hope that in coming years we will see similar groups form in other parts of my great state and throughout the region. 
   Throughout my years in Congress, I have championed effort to increase awareness and research funding for osteoporosis. In the 102nd Congress, I introduced legislation to increase research at the Arthritis Institute, form a research center on osteoporosis, and create a Health and Human Services interagency council to set priorities for osteoporosis research. 
   More recently, I cosponsored legislation which passed as part of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997. The Bone Mass Measurement Coverage Standardization Act, as included in the BBA, provides Medicare reimbursement for bone mass density tests for vulnerable beneficiaries. This benefit took effect July 1, 1998. And, yesterday I sent a letter to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) requesting information and the most recent data possible on program utilization. 
   Osteoporosis deeply affects the lives of older Americans, mostly women. And, it is preventable if healthy lifestyle choices are made at a young age. As we recognize National Osteoporosis Prevention Month, I would commend the National Osteoporosis Foundation, the Strong Women Inside and Out coalition, Peg Bovenkamp and the Newton Support Group, and all those working to raise awareness of the disease. It is my sincere hope that someday in the not too distant future, I can again come to the floor with news of a cure for osteoporosis. Until that time, I will continue supporting efforts to eradicate this devastating disease.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the U.S. Postal Service provides a vital and important communication link for the Nation and the citizens of my state of Iowa. Rural Letter Carriers play a special role and have a proud history as an important link in assuring the delivery of our mail. Rural Carriers first delivered the mail with their own horses and buggies, later with their own motorcycles, and now in their own vehicles. They are responsible for maintenance and operation of their vehicles in all types of weather and road conditions. In the winter, snow and ice is their enemy, while in the spring, the melting snow and ice causes potholes and washboard roads. In spite of these quite adverse conditions, rural letter carriers daily drive over 3 million miles and serve 24 million American families on over 66,000 routes. 
   Although the mission of rural carriers has not changed since the horse and buggy days, the amount of mail they deliver has, as the Nation's mail volume has continued to increase throughout the years, the Postal Service is now delivering more than 200 billion pieces of mail a year. The average carrier delivers about 2,300 pieces of mail a day to about 500 addresses. Most recently, e-commerce has changed the type of mail rural carriers deliver. This fact was confirmed in a recent GAO study entitled ``U.S. Postal Service: Challenges to Sustaining Performance Improvements Remain Formidable on the Brink of the 21st Century,'' dated October 21, 1999. As this report explains, the Postal Service expects declines in its core business, which is essentially letter mail, in the coming years. The growth of e-mail on the Internet, electronic communications, and electronic commerce has the potential to substantially affect the Postal Service's mail volume. First-Class mail has always been the bread and butter of the Postal Service's revenue, but the amount of revenue from First-Class letters will decline in the next few years. However, e-commerce is providing the Postal Service with another opportunity to increase another part of  its business. That's because what individuals and companies order over the Internet must be delivered, sometimes by the Postal Service and often by rural carriers. Currently, the Postal Service has about 33% percent of the parcel business. Carriers are now delivering larger volumes of business mail, parcels, and priority mail packages. But, more parcel business will mean more cargo capacity will be necessary in postal delivery vehicles, especially in those owned and operated by rural letter carriers. 
   When delivering greeting cards or bills, or packages ordered over the Internet, Rural Letter Carriers use vehicles they currently purchase, operate and maintain. In exchange, they receive a reimbursement from the Postal Service. This reimbursement is called an Equipment Maintenance Allowance (EMA). Congress recognizes that providing a personal vehicle to deliver the U.S. Mail is not typical vehicle use. So, when a rural carrier is ready to sell such a vehicle, it's going to have little trade-in value because of the typically high mileage, extraordinary wear and tear, and the fact that it is probably right-hand drive. Therefore, Congress intended to exempt the EMA allowance from taxation in 1988 through a specific provision for rural mail carriers in the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988. That provision allowed an employee of the U.S. Postal Service who was involved in the collection and delivery of mail on a rural route, to compute their business use mileage deduction as 150% percent of the standard mileage rate for all business use mileage. As an alternative, rural carrier taxpayers could elect to utilize the actual expense method (business portion of actual operation and maintenance of the vehicle, plus depreciation). If EMA exceeded the allowable vehicle expense deductions, the excess was subject to tax. If EMA fell short of the allowable vehicle expenses, a deduction was allowed only to the extent that the sum of the shortfall and all other miscellaneous itemized deductions exceeded two percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. 
   The Taxpayers Relief Act of 1997 further simplified the tax returns of rural letter carriers. This act permits the EMA income and expenses ``to wash,'' so that neither income nor expenses would have to be reported on a rural letter carrier's return. That simplified taxes for approximately 120,000 taxpayers, but the provision eliminated the option of filing the actual expense method for employee business vehicle expenses. 
   The lack of this option, combined with the dramatic changes the Internet has and will have on the mail, specifically on rural carriers and their vehicles, is a problem I believe Congress can and must address. 
   The mail mix is changing and already Postal Service management has, understandably, encouraged rural carriers to purchase larger right-hand drive vehicles, such as Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs), to handle the increase in parcel loads. Large SUVs are much more expensive than traditional vehicles, so without the ability to use the actual expense method and depreciation, rural carriers must use their salaries to cover vehicle expenses. Additionally, the Postal Service has placed 11,000 postal vehicles on rural routes, which means those carriers receive no EMA. 
   These developments have created a situation that is contrary to the historical congressional intent of using reimbursement to fund the government service of delivering mail, and also has created an inequitable tax situation for rural carriers. If actual business expenses exceed the EMA, a deduction for those expenses should be allowed. To correct this inequity, I am introducing a bill today, along with Senator ROTH, that would reinstate the ability of a rural letter carrier to choose between using the actual expense method for computing the deduction allowable for business use of a vehicle, or using the current practice of deducting the reimbursed EMA expenses. 
   Rural carriers perform a necessary and valuable service and face many changes and challenges in this new Internet era. Let us make sure that these public servants receive fair and equitable tax treatment as they perform their essential role in fulfilling the Postal Service's mandate of binding the Nation together. 
   I urge my colleagues to join Senator ROTH and myself in supporting this legislation.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining my colleague, Senator GRAHAM, to cosponsor the Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000. This legislation is vital for the safety of our children and our nation. Around the country, Ecstasy use is exploding at an alarming rate from our big cities to our rural neighborhoods. According to Customs officials, Ecstasy is spreading faster than any drug since crack cocaine. This explosion of Ecstasy smuggling has prompted Customs to create a special task force, that focuses exclusively on the designer drug. 
   Along with my colleague Senator GRAHAM, I believe it is important that we act to stop the spread of this drug. I join with Senator GRAHAM in urging our colleagues to support the Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000, and pass this measure quickly. By enacting this important bill, we will get drug dealers out of the lives of our young people and alert the public to the dangers of Ecstasy.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is my distinct pleasure to pay tribute to John C. Gardner, an exceptionally dedicated public servant. Mr. Gardner is retiring after ten years of service as the President of the Quad City Development Group, a public/private not-for-profit corporation. This organization promotes economic growth in and around the cities of Davenport and Bettendorf, Iowa, and Moline and Rock Island, Illinois. The Development Group markets these communities as locations for companies seeking to expand or relocate. It also works with Quad City communities to improve their climate for job creation. 
   Under his leadership, the Quad City Development Group has been the driving force behind the retention and addition of more than 14,000 jobs and the investment of over $1 billion in the Quad Cities area. John's leadership style, which was developed and honed in the private sector, was ideal for his position as the President of this vital community and business-based group. 
   I would like to take a moment to highlight John's career. Immediately before joining the Quad City Development Group, John was the director of economic development for Lee Enterprises, Inc., the owner of the Quad City Times and the Southern Illinoisan newspapers. Before that assignment, John was publisher of the Quad City Times for five years. He learned the newspaper business in a 23-year career as a reporter, editor and eventually publisher of The Southern Illinoisan newspaper in Carbondale, Illinois. He is active in a number of professional and community organizations, and has been involved in various statewide projects in both Iowa and Illinois. He is a member of the Iowa Group for Economic Development and was chairman of the Iowa Future project, a statewide strategic planning effort. 
   It gives me great pleasure to present the credentials of John C. Gardner to the Senate today. It is clear that the Iowa and Illinois communities he has served so well are losing a great talent. They will miss his leadership, his winning smile, and his personal and professional dedication. I would like to wish both John and his wife, Ann, the best in their retirement and continued success in all their future endeavors.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my esteemed colleagues, Senators GRAHAM and JEFFORDS, in introducing this important piece of legislation. Title XX, the Social Services Block Grant, is crucial to states. Congress needs to meet its earlier commitment to this program and restore funding to the level authorized in 1996. 
   The Social Services Block Grant allows states the flexibility to fill in the gaps in their human services system. Through this funding, states, local governments and non-profit organizations can supplement other federal programs and leverage additional funding and resources to support an array of social service programs that are critical to those in need. 
   Millions of elderly people have benefitted from Title XX as have hundreds of thousand of individuals with disabilities. States use these funds to help support crucial services such as respite care for the elderly, adult protective services, supported living and transportation for the disabled. In recent years, more than a quarter of these funds have been used to support children's services. Child protective services, foster care and adoption programs have all been supplemented with these funds. 
   In my home state of Iowa, Social Services Block Grant funds are used to supplement numerous service programs. One program uses these funds to help transport individuals with developmental disabilities to their jobs and so that they may receive medical treatment. Funds are also used to help people with disabilities live in their communities, saving significant amounts of money that would otherwise go to caring for them in institutions. 
   Congress has consistently cut this important program in order to pay for other things. It is time that we restore funding to the level we authorized in 1996. Without this funding, important services that protect children, the elderly and the disabled will not be provided. I urge my other colleagues in the Senate to support our efforts to restore this program to the necessary level of funding.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, getting old is probably the most universal experience no one really likes to talk about. Sure, people talk about minor aches and pains, but the big topics are unmentionable. They include paying for a funeral, preparing for a nursing home stay, or getting checked for prostate problems. These things make people uncomfortable, but they really should not. Consider Katie Couric's comment about colon cancer. She said, ``Some people find the procedures like ..... colonoscopies unappealing. I can tell you they are all much more appealing than dying of this disease.'' 
   In honor of Older Americans Month, I encourage aging adults--and that means all of us--to mention the unmentionable, and to think the unthinkable. Once you get these chores done, the rest of your years will be a day in the country. Here are 10 Smart Things to Do While You Age: 
   1. Secure your retirement income. One financial planner said saving for  retirement is ``like pushing a ball up a hill. The longer you wait, the steeper the hill (seems).'' Yet 56 percent of U.S. households do not save enough for retirement. What should you do? The experts advise developing a financial plan and sticking to it. Save $25 a week for 40 years with 5 percent interest. You will have $165,000. Before you decide how much to set aside, think about how much you will need to maintain a standard of living. 
   My own advice is do not overrely on Social Security. Think of it this way, a solid retirement plan is a three-legged stool of Social Security, retirement savings, and a pension. Look carefully at your pension plan, too. Make sure you understand what's coming to you, and when. 
   2. Think about where you would like to live, and how. Do you dream of staying in the same town or city for the rest of your life? If necessary, could you modify your home to accommodate you as you get older? Would you like to move closer to friends and family? Would you like a condo on the beach in Florida or an assisted living facility, where you pay people to do your laundry and cook your meals? This item goes hand-in-hand with financial planning. The more retirement income you have, the more housing options you have. 
   3. Get preventive health checks, exercise, and eat well. Preventive health checks are getting easier all the time. Increasingly, they are available through insurance coverage. Medicare covers vaccinations, mammograms and screenings for colon and prostate cancer, diabetes and other illnesses. Unfortunately people often do not take advantage of the health screenings available to them. Only one of eight older people gets the recommended testing for colon cancer. This is a shame, when you consider that colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death. 
   More than half of all Americans do not get the exercise they need. Generally, the older people get, the less they exercise. Of course, some people have physical limitations that prevent such activities, but those who can exercise should, and at any age, doctors say. Exercise can help stave off heart disease, colon cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure. A good diet carries many of the 
   same benefits 
   4. Write a will or living trust. Either of these documents delineates how you'd like your property distributed after your death. If you die without a will, the State will distribute your property for you. The result may be contrary to your wishes. It is best to write a will or living trust well before old age. That way, your spouse and children will be provided for if you face an untimely death. More than 40 percent of people 35 or older do not have any kind of legal document determining how their belongings will be distributed after they die. 
   5. Consider long-term care insurance. Many people do not realize that nursing homes are very expensive. Most nursing home residents do not pay out of their pockets for long. They spend down their assets to become qualified for Medicaid, which then picks up the tab. Spending down assets means giving up almost everything, including a house. Long-term care insurance is an option for covering long-term care expenses. The earlier you buy the insurance, the less expensive your premiums. I have sponsored legislation that would establish a tax deduction to encourage the purchase of long-term insurance. 
   6. Plan your funeral and burial or cremation. The national average cost for a funeral, burial and monument is $7,520. These costs can be much lower, but they can be much, much higher. The average mark-up on caskets is high. The latest estimated mark-up is 500 percent. Some are marked up as high as 2,000 percent. The high costs, and the presence of some bad applies in this industry, build the case for arranging a funeral early. It is hard to comparison-shop when you are grieving. If you plan ahead, you can call funeral homes for the best price. Of course, planning ahead has its pitfalls. Be sure you tell your family members about prearrangements, and give them all the relevant paperwork. That way, your family can verify that your contract is fulfilled after you're gone. 
   7. Think about whether a family member will care for you, or vice versa. Unpaid family caregivers keep millions of people at home and out of nursing homes. More than 22 million households have a caregiver who is age 50 or older. The majority are women. Caregiving takes a large toll, both financially and emotionally. I am working to provide more resources to family caregivers, including a $3,000 tax credit that would help them cover their expenses. 
   8. Decide how long you will work. Until recently, people who worked past age 65 lost Social Security benefits if they made more than $17,000 a year. Congress just repealed that penalty for people ages 65 to 69. This likely will cause many Americans to rethink whether they will work past age 65, either part-time or full-time. Choosing the best age at which to retire is an important financial decision. 
   9. Determine your treatment at the end of life. In a living will, which, or course, is completely different from an estate-planning will, you direct how your doctor should administer life-sustaining treatment if you are unable to decide for yourself. A living will guides your treatment if you are terminally ill, irreversibly unconscious, or in a persistent vegetative state. 
   10. Enjoy yourself. You have worked hard to stay financially fit and physically healthy. The opportunities for older Americans are greater than ever before. You can work well into your eighties and nineties if you choose. You can become a competitor in the Senior Olympics. You can write a book, volunteer with your church, or teach people how to read. Surf the Internet. E-mail your grandchildren. Take advantage of the insight and depth that inevitably come with aging. Someone once said, ``Being a fun person is the hallmark of true maturity. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the cloture motion. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this motion. I spoke yesterday, at length, about why this bill is such an important piece of legislation. 
   I guess the best proof of it is that it enjoys such bipartisan support, which does not happen too often on Capitol Hill. But I summed up, in yesterday's remarks, that this conference agreement is about opportunity--opportunity for 48 struggling nations of sub-Saharan Africa; and opportunity for the people of the Caribbean, many of whom are struggling to rebuild their lives following the devastation of their countries by natural disaster. 
   Most importantly, we in the Congress must be concerned about American jobs--our working men and women. This bill does much for the American economy and for America's consumers, as well. The enhanced Caribbean Basin Initiative textile provisions in this conference agreement may create up to $8 billion in new sales and 120,000 new jobs over the next 5 years. Those are not my estimates. Those are not Senator MOYNIHAN's estimates. Those are the textile industry's own estimates. 
   In addition to the textile industry, this bill enjoys the support of many other industries as well. This is because American exports follow American investment when that investment moves abroad, especially exports of capital equipment. 
   This conference agreement enjoys broad support among distinguished Members of both the majority and minority, who have worked together long and hard to fashion this agreement. 
   It also enjoys the support of a vast majority of political, civic, and religious leaders around the United States, and the support of each of the nations that would benefit from its passage. 
   I urge my colleagues to take a look at an advertisement in the Hill newspaper that was put out yesterday. It has a long list of prominent business leaders and organizations. It has a long list of American civic leaders who support this, including even organizations such as Empower America, which is headed by Republican Jack Kemp, and is supported by conservative leaders such as Bill Bennett. 
   Since it enjoys this broad, bipartisan support--both within and outside the political environment--I hope that it gets the support of our colleagues as well. 
   A vote for cloture is also a reaffirmation of America's historic leadership role in international trade. We have much to do in the international trade arena in the next year or two: 
   Restore confidence in American trade policy, and leadership in trade; rebuild confidence in the World Trade Organization; win the fight for permanent normal trade relations status for China; and show our trading partners in Geneva, where negotiations are underway right now, that we in the Senate are engaged with the world, and the world can look to us for that leadership. 
   I ask my colleagues to vote in support of the opportunity to continue America's leadership in the effort to reduce trade barriers. I ask my colleagues to vote in favor of this motion.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator is correct. The Finance Committee reported out the Africa and Caribbean Basin measures separately. The committee reports on each of those measure addresses this issue explicitly. The reports make clear that those provisions commonly referred to as ``807A'' and ``809'' are to be administered in a manner consistent with the then-current regulations regarding the ``Special Access Program'' for textile and apparel articles from the Caribbean and Andean Trade Preference Act countries. The report, in fact, expressly cites the Federal Register notice dated April 3, 1998, that sets out the rules that the Committee intended would apply. The language of the reports then restates the language of the Federal Register notice, concluding that the requirements that products must be assembled from fabric formed in the United States applies to all textile components of the assembled products, including linings and pocketing.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have now reached the final stage of the legislative process with regard to the Trade and Development Act of 2000. The moment has come to vote on final passage. Once again, I urge my distinguished colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote for opportunity, to vote to reaffirm America's historic leadership in international trade. What we do here, what we say here, reverberates all around the world. So I say to my distinguished colleagues, let's send a resounding message, a clear message, a strong message, that America is engaged with the world. I urge my colleagues to vote for the Trade and Development Act of 2000. 
   I hope we will have speakers now on the African trade bill so we can move ahead to get a vote on that. I think I have not had any requests for speakers in support of the legislation because those of us who support the legislation would like to move it to immediate passage. I hope those who would still like to speak in opposition to it and express those points of view will please do that at this particular time.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, following up on what Senator MOYNIHAN just said, and associating myself with those remarks, as important as the bill we passed is for the continent of Africa and the Caribbean Basin Initiative, and as important as it is for the consumers of America and the 120,000 new jobs it is going to create for American working men and women, this bill is far more significant, from my point of view, because it is the first major piece of trade legislation passing the Congress in years, as Senator MOYNIHAN said. 
   In the meantime, I think the United States has been seen by other nations as giving up some of our traditional leadership around the world in negotiations and tearing down trade barriers, which has been our role as a world leader since 1947. I hope that this legislation is the start of America, once again, leading the world in reducing barriers to trade, the promotion of international trade, and seeing trade as more important than aid as an instrument to helping depressed economies around the world. 
   I look forward to the continuation of our leadership in setting the agenda for the World Trade Organization agenda and regional trade agreements, as well. 
   Besides all the staff members Senator MOYNIHAN mentioned, I also compliment my international trade counsel, Richard Chriss, on his outstanding contribution to the passage of the Africa Trade and CBI bill.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senator BOND and Senator DURBIN, as an original cosponsor to the Clean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2000. I commend them for their leadership in resolving a very real problem--not a phony problem. 
   The real problem is that MTBE is contaminating our Nation's water supplies. 
   The phony problem is the proposition that the Clean Air Act's oxygenate standard caused the MTBE water contamination. 
   Unfortunately, powerful, influential forces are trying to sucker Congress and the American public into embracing the phony problem. 
   Some propagandists of the phony problem may be motivated by greed. After all, if the petroleum industry gets its way, its profits will balloon. If they can get Congress or the administration to grant waivers of the oxygenate standard, big oil will be able to squeeze out the 3 to 4 percent of the market currently supplied by alternatives. 
   The Department of Energy has determined that even a small amount of alternative fuels can save consumers billions of dollars each year by leveraging lower gasoline prices. 
   Petroleum companies also tell us that they can produce a gasoline just as clean for the air, but without oxygenates. Of course, they tell you that it will come at some extra cost. 
   Mr. President, I must ask my colleagues: Do we really need to give the petroleum industry both the ability and the excuse to jack up gasoline prices and further gouge American consumers? 
   Of course not. And the way to make certain this does not happen is by enacting the Clean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2000. 
   Other propagandists of the phony problem may be political opportunists seeking to engage in some self-serving election-year shenanigans. 
   The Clinton administration is facing a tough political dilemma. Chevron and other petroleum interests have convinced California's Governor that the only solution to the MTBE problem is to waive the oxygenate requirement. 
   California represents enormous political stakes for November's elections. Understandably, the Clinton administration does not want to say ``no'' to California. 
   But the Clinton administration does not want to say ``no'' to America's farmers. If the administration gives California and other states a waiver from the oxygenate standard, they will have single-handedly destroyed a $1 billion per year market for America's farmers. 
   So, what's the easy political solution? Simple. Throw the hot-potato into the laps of Congress. Hold a press conference laying out quote, end-quote, legislative principles for solving the MTBE problem. 
   By dumping this on Congress, the administration does not have to make the tough decisions, and will be in a position to second-guess and attack anything and everything Congress does do to try to work this out. 
   And the irony of all of this, is that had the Clinton administration followed Congressional intent about the Clean Air Act Reformulated Fuels Program, instead of listening to the oil companies and some misguided environmentalists, other oxygenates such as ethanol could have competed with MTBE, and we would have far less MTBE water contamination today. 
   The Clinton administration was warned loud and clear about the health and environmental problems of MTBE. I personally sent many letters and made a lengthy floor statement in 1993 warning then about MTBE and urging that they not give Big Oil a regulation guaranteeing them a market monopoly over the oxygenated problem. 
   Anyone who has ever smelled MTBE, knows that had consumers been given a choice, they would have overwhelmingly chose to buy reformulated fuel made with ethanol, not MTBE. 
   So the Clinton administration created this MTBE problem in the first  place, and now they tell the world that the only way to 
   correct it is for Congress to fix it. 
   That's just not true. But the truth sort of got lost during the administration's press conference by EPA's Carol Browner. She forgot to tell the American public the truth that each and every State has the authority to protect its water supplies from MTBE contamination. As long as the States pass laws designed to protect the water, as opposed to protecting the air, the Clean Air Act does not legally pre-empt the States from taking action on their own. 
   And I received assurances from EPA during a recent hearing that they would never attempt to stop a State from protecting water supplies from MTBE contamination. 
   Now, some would argue that the oil industry would try to challenge such efforts in court. 
   Mr. President, that proposition is ridiculous. The oil companies chose to use MTBE instead of ethanol. They are now liable for what could be billions of dollars of MTBE clean up costs. And these liability costs mount with every day that passes, that the oil companies refuse to replace MTBE with other oxygenates. 
   Therefore, who in their right mind could think that the oil companies are stupid enough to take court action to block a State from banning the use of MTBE? 
   So, why didn't EPA's Carol Browner announce to the world the States already have the authority to ban MTBE--the source of the real problem? 
   Well, if the administration admits the truth, and if they fail to convince Americans and Congress that only Congress can fix this problem, then the Clinton administration is stuck back at ``square one'' having to choose between California or America's farmers who have suffered the lowest prices in decades. 
   Mr. President, there are others pushing the phony problem who may simply be struggling to save face, hoping that they not suffer the embarrassment of being proven wrong--wrong in their efforts to help petroleum interests in securing a Clinton administration regulation guaranteeing that MTBE would monopolize the oxygenate market. 
   These environmentalists would like the public to believe that ethanol was never really a viable option--not then, not now. If they ever concede that point, then it will be clear to Americans that these environmentalists were key promoters of what has turned out to be one of the biggest environmental crises ever to face America. 
   Mr. President, there are some environmentalists who do not like ethanol, simply because it is something that can be made by farmers. They don't like farmers because sometimes they have to use fertilizers and chemicals. It is that simple-minded. 
   Mr. President, the real problem is MTBE, and the real solution to this problem is passing the bill introduced today by our colleagues Senator BOND and Senator DURBIN. 
   I warn my colleagues, however, that if they buy into the phony problem, they will end up having to buy into phony solutions. 
   For instance, the Clinton administration suggested that Congress might want to only reduce the amount of MTBE used, as opposed to banning it altogether. Well, that's a phony solution. 
   No level of MTBE in gasoline can protect our water supply. 
   My State of Iowa is facing an MTBE water contamination disaster. First, understand, we sell no Clean Air Act reformulated gasoline in Iowa. Second, understand that for years now, no gasoline was supposed to be sold in Iowa that contained more than 1 percent MTBE unless warning labels were posted. 
   Nevertheless, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources recently found that 29 percent of Iowa's water supplies tested contained MTBE above the acceptable levels established by EPA. 
   So what does this mean? Simply this: MTBE is used in conventional fuel as an octane enhancer and will contaminate your water. 
   If a State is allowed to waive out of the oxygenate requirement, MTBE will still be used and will continue to contaminate our water supplies. 
   It is phony to argue the oxygenate requirement is the problem, and it is phony to argue waiving or eliminating the oxygenate requirement will protect our water supplies. 
   Mr. President, this is just one of many phony issues that we are being asked to embrace. I will be speaking further about this at a later time. 
   But in closing, I ask my colleagues to cosponsor our legislation. It provides real solutions to the real problem: MTBE water contamination.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as a person who supports the African trade bill, I rise in support of this conference committee report on the Trade and Development Act of 2000. This legislation contains the conference agreement on the African Growth and Opportunity Act, the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act, and even some miscellaneous trade measures that were passed as part of the Senate's consideration of this legislation in November last year. 
   Passage of the African Growth and Opportunity Act conference agreement by the Senate will send to the President the first significant trade legislation to pass both Houses of Congress since 1988, other than legislation implementing trade agreements under very special fast-track procedures. 
   If I could characterize this conference agreement with one word, it would be the word ``opportunity.'' That word is in the title of the African portion of this bill. 
   First, this conference agreement provides people in sub-Saharan Africa with the opportunity and promise for a better life. In many cases, these countries are not able to sustain their own people. They lack even the simplest, most basic infrastructure. This prevents the people of Africa from meeting necessary agriculture, education, transportation, and health care needs. 
   By giving these countries new tools to develop a textile and apparel industry, they will have new opportunities to participate in the global trade flows and the increased prosperity that have largely bypassed the majority of Africa's people. 
   I stress this bill provides opportunity. Once again, this bill is about opportunity. It is not about a guarantee, and it 
   is not about a panacea, but an opportunity that has, up until now, been missing for the people of sub-Saharan Africa. 
   This legislation will give these countries the opportunity to build the essential capital that struggling economies need to increase their investment in their own people to help themselves. What we will create with this bill is opportunity for these struggling economies, and do it in a way that will not in any way jeopardize U.S. employment. 
   Some 30 sub-Saharan countries of Africa have begun dynamic economic reform programs that help make it much easier to pass this bill because we know they are taking the first steps to help themselves. They are liberalizing exchange rates; they are privatizing state-owned enterprises; they are reducing harmful barriers to trade and investment; they are also ending costly trade-distorting subsidies. 
   All of these things, for those who believe enhanced freedom of international trade is the right direction in which to go, always need a little bit of help from the indigenous economies of the respective countries. We believe the 30 countries of sub-Saharan Africa are doing all the right things. This legislation will create greater opportunities for new partnerships with these African nations based on economic directions they have already begun to take. 
   The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act is designed to compliment the economic reform policies that African nations have already decided to pursue by offering increased access to U.S. markets for non-import-sensitive goods and textiles while creating enhanced opportunities to deepen our bilateral trade relations. 
   Speaking of opportunity, we will open up for American goods and services a market for 700 million potential new consumers, more than in Japan  and all the ASEAN nations combined, if we approve this conference agreement. 
   Both the United States and African nations recognize this legislation for the win-win opportunity it is. The United States benefits and Africa benefits from this legislation. The African Growth and Opportunity Act has been endorsed by every African ambassador in Washington. We don't see unanimous agreement on many things in these cities these days. However, we do here. All of the 48 nations of sub-Saharan Africa are united in support of this legislation. 
   The conference agreement is also a win-win opportunity for the countries of the Caribbean Basin region and for the United States. This conference report grants duty-free, quota-free benefits to apparel made in the Caribbean Basin Initiative countries from U.S. yarn and U.S. fabric. The Caribbean Basin nations will now have an opportunity to compete with Mexico and other developing countries in Asia in a way that will permit them to more fully participate in the global economy. 
   Additionally, the conference report provides benefits for apparel made with regional fabric under clearly specified conditions to be fair to the United States. This will encourage additional U.S. export of cotton and yarn and U.S. investment in the region while also helping to create desperately needed jobs for the Caribbean workers. In fact, I cannot think of a time when this legislation was needed more. We have to act now to help rebuild the shattered Caribbean economies and the ruined lives of those whose nations were devastated by Hurricanes Georges and Mitch. This all happened in 1998, but the recovery is not what it should be. 
   It is hard for us to imagine the destruction these storms inflicted. We were not there. We saw them on television, but, as so many things seen on television, they soon get out of mind. The devastation is still there, although there has been some cleaning up, some enhancement of the economy. But this will help, not by giving them our money, as we have done under the humanitarian programs we have, but helping them to help themselves through enhanced trade opportunities. 
   In the worst-hit Caribbean countries, virtually all sectors of the economy were affected. Houses by the hundreds were washed away. Roads and bridges disappeared under tons of water. Hotels were wrecked. Beach erosion demolished tourism. Both the administration and the Congress deserve credit for joint efforts to enact an assistance package of close to $1 billion to aid in the reconstruction of the most basic elements of infrastructure--roads, bridges, and sewer systems--for what they did 2 years ago. But even this investment falls far short of what is needed to rehabilitate the economies of these countries. 
   The Caribbean nations hit by these disasters have seen the basic pillars of their economies--agriculture and tourism--almost completely ruined. I have spoken to many of the ambassadors from the Caribbean nations about this. I just had a meeting this morning with the President of Costa Rica, thanking us for our work on this particular bill, telling us about how their economies are starting to turn around. In my view, based on these discussions, comprehensive reconstruction will not be possible without an effective trade and investment component. The ambassadors tell me--and the regional leaders and the U.S. officials all agree--it will take years for the hardest hit countries to recover. These countries are more than just our friends; they are our neighbors. They are right there in our backyard. We must put in place a program to help them rebuild and to sustain growth during the long road back to economic prosperity. We can do this without threatening jobs in our own country. 
   The Caribbean Basin is one of the few regions of the world where the United States consistently--I want to emphasize consistently--maintains a trade surplus. In fact, close to 70 cents of every dollar spent in the region is returned in the form of increased exports from the United States. In 1999, the 
   U.S. exports to Caribbean Basin countries exceeded $19 billion, making this group the sixth largest export market of U.S. goods in that year, 1999. 
   We will see other long-term benefits to the United States if we approve this conference agreement and help our Caribbean neighbors to help themselves. We will contribute to the U.S. national security, in addition to our economy, by helping democratic countries in our own backyard maintain political and economic stability. 
   In closing, I want to say a word, then, in addition to all the big components of this bill, a word about the significance of our work. This is very general, but this work is an example of U.S. leadership in trade policy. But that U.S. leadership in trade policy has suffered serious setbacks in the last few years. One obvious setback has been the repeated failure of the Congress to renew the President's fast-track trade negotiating authority. Another setback has been the failure of the negotiations on the multilateral agreement on investment in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. And the most serious blow to U.S. leadership in global trade policy was the failure last December of the Seattle ministerial conference meeting of the World Trade Organization. 
   The entire world is watching, wondering whether the lack of leadership on the part of the United States for the last 7 or 8 years, or maybe the last 5 or 6 years, is a pattern we are going to continue to follow because it is such a different pattern from what the United States has done as a world leader in breaking down barriers to international trade since 1947. 
   I suppose you could go back to the 1930s, when we learned the lesson of the Smoot-Hawley legislation that brought about the world depression, and the world depression brought about World War II. We very quickly learned that high tariffs are not good for the world economy. It was not good for the American economy because we suffered as much or more than they did elsewhere in the world in that Great Depression as a result of Smoot-Hawley. Under Cordell Hull's leadership as Secretary of State, working for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, we started reciprocal trade agreements at that particular time. They were the forerunner of gradually reducing some of these very high barriers to trade we had at that time around the world, mostly high tariffs--bringing them down on a reciprocal basis. But all of that eventually resulted in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade process that we led the world in establishing in 1949. 
   There have been eight rounds of GATT. Those eight rounds have been very successful in breaking down barriers to trade, so successful that President Clinton can tell the American people with all honesty, on a factual basis, that one-third of the jobs created during his Presidency are a result of international trade. 
   So if anybody thinks we are here promoting an African trade bill and Caribbean Basin Initiative bill to somehow benefit the economies of Africa and the Caribbean nations without any concern about the workers of America, the working men and women of America, the taxpaying people of our country, and are they going to have enough jobs, we have history, since 1947, to demonstrate the value of international trade to the economy of the United States and the economic benefit of the United States. 
   Too often, in international trade, we look to the economic issues only. But I believe commerce does more to promote international peace and humanitarian progress than anything we as political leaders or diplomats can do--as important as political leadership is in the world, and as important as diplomats are. But there are just not enough political leaders or diplomats in the world--if you take all the countries combined--to guarantee any peace. But as you break down barriers among the diverse people of our world--that is, one on one, whether it is business or nonbusiness relationships--that has more to do with the promotion of international peace, prosperity, democratic principles, and free market principles than anything. 
   So I see this legislation as part of a small process of promoting those issues as well as our concern about Africa, among others. 
   So the entire world I think is watching what we do today because it is some show of America wanting to retain that leadership in the reduction of trade barriers and enhancing peace and  prosperity of which we have been a part since 1947. 
   It is vitally important to not only approve this conference agreement but to do it in a resounding way. If we do that, we can send a message to the rest of the world that American leadership in trade policy is alive and well. For many in the international community, that leadership, as I said before, is in serious doubt. 
   It is especially important to approve this conference agreement after the profoundly disappointing failure of the Seattle WTO negotiations. We are only now beginning to pick up the pieces with the start of new agriculture and service trade negotiations in Geneva. 
   I have been watching these negotiations very closely. They are both difficult and delicate. We are trying to rebuild confidence, both in the World Trade Organization and in U.S. leadership. After Seattle, this is necessary and vitally important. It is not an exaggeration to say that failure to approve this conference agreement, or even a tepid approval, would send a shockwave through these negotiations. It would undermine our negotiators, jeopardize any progress we might make in Geneva, and do great harm to our long-term international trade interests. 
   By the same token, a strong Senate endorsement of this conference report would say to the entire world that the Senate is engaged, committed, and we want to reestablish the historic leadership role that has characterized U.S. trade policy for the last 50 years. 
   Finally, I salute the hard work of the majority leader, Senator LOTT, as well as that of my distinguished colleagues, Senator ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN. Without their vision, their efforts, and their perseverance, we would not be here today. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in a resounding show of support for American leadership in world trade negotiations by supporting the Trade and Development Act of 2000. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I need only a few minutes to respond to a couple previous remarks. I will not take very long, I say to the Senator from Florida. 
   Mr. President, I want to, first of all, follow up on a comment that Senator DODD and Senator MOYNIHAN made about Colombia and including it in the Caribbean Basin Initiative. I was hopeful we could do that. I sent several  communiques to the leaders about doing that. I am sorry it could not be done in this conference agreement. I hope we get an opportunity this year to include Colombia as a beneficiary country in the Caribbean Basin Initiative program because I think it will help the economy of Colombia, help them overcome the civil distress they have there, even more than the aid that we currently give to Colombia, although that aid is very necessary. 
   I also want to make a short comment on the effort put forth by the Senator from California, Senator FEINSTEIN, to explain the situation with AIDS in Africa, and her attempt to help relieve that terrible situation through the AIDS provision she included in the Africa trade bill. I applaud my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from California, for her great concern for the victims of the AIDS disaster in Africa. We all could not help but be deeply moved by her presentation and the compassion that she expressed this morning. 
   I supported Senator ROTH's efforts to seek a compromise on her provisions that would have been acceptable to the House. The Senator from California, as well as Senator ROTH, have performed a great service in bringing this issue to our attention and in trying to do something about it. 
   Then lastly, I will say a few words on the comments made by Senator HOLLINGS, in his long and very thorough presentation of his point of view--which I disagree with, or at least his conclusions. 
   He is a distinguished Senator with great knowledge on this particular issue. I think he is wrong in opposing the bill because he says that this conference report will devastate the U.S. apparel industry. 
   Sub-Saharan Africa currently supplies less than 1 percent of the total value of apparel imports to the United States. Under the most optimistic circumstances, the recent analysis by the nonpartisan International Trade Commission shows that passage of this legislation would increase apparel imports to this country from sub-Saharan Africa by about 3 percent. Most, if not all, of this increase would come at the expense of Far Eastern suppliers, not the U.S. manufacturers. 
   Again, let me emphasize, that is from the nonpartisan--at least bipartisan--International Trade Commission. The legislation in the conference report establishes a mechanism under which domestic producers can petition for relief from import surges that threaten serious injury. 
   Under these provisions, tariffs could be reimposed in limited instances in which a domestic producer could establish a meritorious case. So we have that option just in case the analysis made by the International Trade Commission might be wrong. I do not think it is going to be wrong. In fact, I have great confidence their predictions will not be wrong. But just in case there are some unexpected import surges, our legislation provides for a petition for relief in those instances. 
   Furthermore, we have the industry's own analysis. It suggests that this legislation will create an additional 120,000 jobs, largely due to provisions requiring that all apparel items benefiting from provisions contained in the Caribbean Basin Initiative portion of this legislation must be assembled by textile components using U.S. fabrics. 
   More generally, I want to say a word about the idea that free trade has not provided economic benefits to the average American. I want to quote from the economic report of the President, who is, of course, a member of the same party as the Senator from South Carolina. 
   The President's own economic report for fiscal year 2000 shows that, because of trade agreements that have liberalized trade and opened new markets, the average American has realized an annual economic benefit of $1,000 every year since 1963. Since we traditionally measure economic benefits by how they affect families, with a family of four, that is an annual benefit of $4,000 per family. 
   Think in terms of what we have tried to do for families through proposals for tax cuts. That amount of $4,000 is far more than any tax cut that we have debated in the Congress. The idea that the average American does not benefit from free trade is simply not true. My source of that information--I tell the Senator from South Carolina--is the leader of his party, President Clinton, making those statements in his own budget document. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. 
   Mr. President, I am sending a bill to the desk to help reinforce our national drug control effort. I held a hearing earlier today on the domestic consequences of a new wave of heroin use. This is a flesh and blood problem that touches all of us. What we see in our homes and schools across the nation is the emergence of a new threat to our young people. A purer form of heroin is making its presence felt. In rich neighborhoods and poor. In our cities and rural areas. In the lives of our young people and their families. 
   No heroin consumed in this country is made here. Every gram of it is grown in some foreign field, processed in a distant, illegal lab, and smuggled into this country. Yet, this heroin makes its way here by every means possible. It walks, floats, flies, and sneaks across our borders. 
   While the heroin used here comes from overseas, the consequences of its coming are felt in our homes, in our schools, in our neighborhoods. It is our young people who die. It is American families who bear the burden and pay the price. Heroin is an equal opportunity destroyer. It blights inner city streets, suburban neighborhoods, and rural communities alike. I fear that the problem is getting worse. And I am concerned that our current policies are simply not up to the challenge. 
   Somewhere along the way, we lost the clear, consistent message that the only proper response to drugs is to say an emphatic ``NO''. We're supposed to be more sophisticated. More tolerant. More willing to listen to notions of making dangerous drugs more available. What all of this ``more'' has meant is that we have more young people using more drugs at younger ages. Today's heroin is cheaper and purer and more widely available. It is more aggressively marketed and it is presented as being safer, as ``user friendly''. 
   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, heroin had a bad rap. All drugs did. That is less true today. In the last several years, heroin use among young people has doubled and attitudes about the dangers of the drug have shifted. While it is true that most of our 12 to 20 year olds still believe it bad, the new heroin that we see on our streets and in our schools is marketed to avoid this stigma. The chief reason that the old heroin was seen as bad was because you needed a needle to use it. With the new heroin you can get high from smoking or inhaling, at least at first. And we now have well-moneyed think tank talking heads who preach that the only consequence of heroin addiction is a mild case of constipation. That it is our drug laws that are dangerous not the drugs. In such an environment, we should not be too surprised that an increasing number of young people should be persuaded that heroin is okay. 
   Communities in Plano, Texas and Orlando, Florida learned this to their dismay when dozens of high school kids died from heroin overdoses. I can think of no pain greater than that of a parent who must bid farewell forever to a child. It is somehow contrary to the natural order for a parent to precede a child in death. But the pain of addiction is a spreading circle of hurt. The hearing I held today on this problem brought this point home in the voices of those most affected: addicts and their families. 
   The legislation that I offer today will help us address this new problem before it gets any worse. I am proposing that we look at the means to improve our prevention message to stop drug use before it starts. I hope to revitalize community and parent involvement. 
   I am also proposing increased resources for addiction research and ways to get the best information and best practices into the hands of the professionals who must deal with addiction problems.  
   In addition, I am calling for a new initiative to support juvenile residential treatment programs that work. Current research shows that we need more focused, long-term critical intervention for young addicts to break the cycle of addiction today before it becomes a worse problem tomorrow. Investment now means better chances for young people and for all of us later. 
   It's not just a new heroin that plagues us. Designer drugs like methamphetamine and now Ecstasy are flooding this country. Along with heroin, these are marketed to our young people as safe and friendly. Left unanswered, we will see another generation of young lives blighted. We will see families torn up by a widening circle of hurt from drug use. We saw what a similar wave of drug use did to us and to a generaton of young people in the 1960s and 1970s. We cannot afford to go through this again. I hope we can begin today to renew our commitment to a drug free future for our young people. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the Drug Treatment and Research Enhancement Act.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Prior to the question, if I can just say, first of all, I compliment the Senator because I know when it came out of committee the first time, that he got the formula that was in the original bill introduced improved dramatically. So our State would be helped and probably a lot of other States would be helped. So I compliment him on that. 
   I do not know anything about his activity in conference or any other process, but I did notice his work in that area, and he did improve it and I compliment him for it. 
   My question is only this: Senator Coats and I are both relying upon the work of the Congressional Research Service. I have not found the Congressional Research Service to be wrong very often, if at all, that I can recall. Has my colleague from Iowa discussed this with the people in the Congressional Research Service to see if they made a mistake and how they made a mistake? Can you tell me how they made a mistake?

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, if my colleague wanted to make the point that what we came back with from conference was not quite as good for certain States, including my own, as was in the bill passed by the Senate, he is absolutely right. But the reality is that the House would not accept that. So we had to work it out with the House, and I think we worked it out in a reasonably fair manner, I must say. 
   The original formula that came out of the Clinton administration, what they had advocated, was devastating for Iowa and for a number of other States. 
   But we worked with Senator Pell, Senator Kennedy, Senator Hatch, Senator Kassebaum and Senator Jeffords. We worked this whole thing out in committee on a bipartisan basis to come up with a better formula. We did that. We had votes on it. We had debates. We even had a debate here on the Senate floor. We had a vote. But in going to conference it was clear that the House Members were not going to accept in totality what we had done in the Senate. And thus we came up with this new formula. And, quite frankly, I must say I think the new formula is fair. 
   I just want to say the Congressional Research Service, again, will do any run that Senators ask for. If you ask for a run on $500 million a year, they will do that. You can do a run on $1 billion a year. They will do that. But just because these tables are prepared does not mean that is actually what is going to happen. As I said, they ran these tables based upon a $400-million-a-year increase in title I. As the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds this program, I can tell you right now, unless somebody comes up with some magic money someplace, we are not going to have that kind of money. We will be lucky to get the average of the $275 million that we have gotten over the last 5 years. 
   So we tried to do two things with title I: target our scarce resources to areas where they have a high concentration of eligible children, but then also to be fair to rural States such as Iowa where we may not have high concentrations but we certainly do have needy children, children in poverty, title I eligible children, but they may be in small towns and communities scattered around the States and thus the formula does address that.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I once again come before the Senate to discuss an often-overlooked population in our schools, talented and gifted students. It's time that we recognized the nearly three million students who are talented and gifted and provide them with the assistance they need. 
   For the past three years, I've been working to change the way people think about talented and gifted students. In order to do this, several destructive myths must be dispelled. 
   Currently, many schools operate under the false assumption that these students are just ``extra-smart'' and can fend for themselves with a little help. One such example of this faulty thinking is giving a talented and gifted third grader a fifth grade math textbook. 
   Students who display gifted qualities look at the world and think in a very different way from other pupils. Instead of thinking in a sequential or linear fashion like most students, they jump from one concept or idea to another. Specialized teaching and activities, designed for their thought process, will help these students excel. 
   In addition, these students often have problems fitting in socially because they are `different' and suffer emotionally from peer rejection and stigmatization. Tragically, as a result, some talented and gifted students experience depression, eating disorders and high levels of anxiety. Some are also vulnerable to violence and antisocial behavior. 
   Another myth is that gifted and talented programs only help middle and upper-class white students. Talented and gifted students cover the entire spectrum in terms of race, background, geographical region, and economic status. In other words, gifted students can be found in every classroom. 
   Along with getting rid of false notions and stereotypes about gifted and talented students, we need to direct resources to these kids to ensure that they will have an educational program that fits their needs. 
   I would like to thank Senator JEFFORDS for his leadership and for including provisions to help talented and gifted students in the Educational Opportunities Act, S. 2. The provisions found in S. 2 are based on a bill I introduced as the Gifted and Talented Education Act, S. 505. 
   These provisions establish a program through which states can apply for grants in order to fashion their own talented and gifted programs. States can use the money for a number of activities such as teacher training, equipment, materials, and technology. Under this program, states have a great deal of leeway in determining how best to meet the needs of their students. It also ensures that 88 percent of these funds will go toward enhancing student learning, not administrative costs. 
   These talented and gifted student provisions fill a gap in current education policy. There is no federal directive to serve this student population. The only federal program dealing directly with talented and gifted education is the Jacob Javits Program. However, that program is directed toward research, not the students themselves. 
   Furthermore, there is a great deal of disparity between the programs available to meet the needs and quality teacher preparedness of talented and gifted students. While most states do have some kind of talented and gifted program, the programs are not uniform across school districts and grade levels. 
   I think all of us, regardless of party affiliation, agree that all students should get the education they need. While all students have the potential to make great contributions to society, the reality, Mr. President, is that talented and gifted students have the greatest potential to be either the leaders of tomorrow or a burden to society. These students will either put their talents to good use or they will direct their energy and gifts toward destructive, wasteful activities. It's important that we help to direct these students in a positive way. 
   As a fiscal conservative, I have always fought for the wise and efficient use of the public's money. Investing in our future leaders, artists, scientists, and law enforcement officials, among others, is the most sound investment we can make. Again, I applaud Senator JEFFORDS for including this important provision in the bill and I urge you to join us in making a commitment to our nation's talented and gifted students.

   Tony Davis, a secondary education major at the University of Northern Iowa--my alma mater--was recently named the NCAA Champion for wrestling in the 149-pound division. 
   Tony was born and raised in Chicago. 
   Before coming to UNI, he wrestled at Mount Carmel High School in Chicago and Iowa Central Community College, where he received two national junior college championships. 
   Tony chose to come to UNI for two reasons: to wrestle at a Division I school and to study to be a teacher and coach. 
   Before the 1999-2000 season, Tony was ranked first in the nation in his weight division. And, he maintained that ranking and came to the NCAA finals with a 26-1 record. 
   Tony's life philosophy is this: focus and dedication lead to success at all levels. 
   Looking at the road Tony has traveled to reach this point, it is evident focus and dedication played a large role in his success. 
   And, to quote Tony:  
   God played a big role in ..... getting on the right track of life. I have a lot of people to thank along the way. It was a long way to come. The most important thing is I got here.  
   This past week was finals week at UNI. And, I want to commend Tony Davis for his commitment and dedication--not only to sports but also to academics. 
   Next year, Tony Davis will return to UNI--again for two reasons. Tony will be finishing up his academic degree while also serving as an assistant wrestling coach. 
   UNI has a long tradition of excellence in training teachers. 
   This legacy of excellence in education will be continued as Tony has an opportunity to train wrestlers to succeed--both on and off the mat. 
   And so, I salute Tony Davis, his teammates, Coach Mark Manning, and the University of Northern Iowa for supporting each student on and off the mat. 
   Go Panthers!

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in 1968 the Congress of the United States passed the Wholesome Poultry Product Act of 1968. 
   A former Congressman from Iowa by the name of Neal Smith--Members of the present Congress will remember--was a person who served the people of Iowa very well and spent a considerable amount of time during his years in Congress trying to build consumer confidence in poultry and other meats American consumers buy. 
   In 1960, there were 1.8 billion chickens produced in the United States and consumed by the public. 
   In 1998, it was up to 8 billion chickens. There has been a very dramatic rise in the consumption of chicken by the American consumer, all the more reason to make sure the Wholesome Poultry Products Act of 1968 is followed. 
   There is a dismal picture painted about the inspection of poultry slaughterhouses in the United States and some question about whether the meat consumed by the American public is as wholesome as the 1968 act intended. This question arises because of a proposal in the Department of Agriculture to shift some routine Federal inspection from Federal inspectors to inspectors hired by the poultry slaughtering companies. An article was in yesterday's Des Moines Register, by Register Washington reporter George Anthan, who has been reporting on the subject of wholesome inspection of meat by the Department of Agriculture for almost his entire journalistic career. George Anthan is very much an authority on both what was intended and the enforcement of that law. 
   Rather than summarizing, I will read what was reported yesterday in the Des Moines Register by George Anthan.  
   The Agriculture Department admits consumers may detest chicken or turkey that contains pus from a pneumonia-like disease called air sacculitis. 
   But the condition fails to threaten human health, federal officials say, and the issue of dealing with it can be left largely to the employees of meat processing companies, rather than to federal inspectors. 
   The poultry condition is at the center of a dispute between the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the union that represents federal inspectors over how best to safeguard America's meat.  
   A former Iowa Congressman, Neal Smith, says, ``I suppose you could sterilize pus and maybe it would not hurt you . . . but the fact is, we should not be eating that kind of stuff.'' 
   Continuing the article:  
   The Department of Agriculture is implementing a new inspection system that assigns many of the more routine duties now handled by federal inspectors to the companies they regulate. The inspectors, in turn, are supposed to look for systemic problems to prevent disease outbreaks before they happen. 
   But the union maintains the change breaks a sacred trust with American consumers, who see the Department of Agriculture approval as proof that an independent inspector has signed off on the meat they put on their dining room tables. 
   The controversy revolves around the Wholesome Poultry Products Act of 1968. 
   Smith said he ``carefully and deliberately'' included the word ``wholesome'' in the law's title because ``people don't want to eat pus, and scabs, sores and malignant tumors.'' 
   Officials at the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service said that even though inspecting birds for air sacculitis will be the responsibility of the poultry companies, federal inspectors will monitor the process.  
   Parenthetically, the question for the consumers in America is whether or not they can be satisfied that their food is safe because there is some Federal inspector monitoring it as opposed to Federal inspectors actually inspecting it. 
   Continuing the article: 
   They said if the inspectors determine birds with air sacculitis and other defects that don't affect human health are being passed for human consumption, they will notify companies, who are supposed to take corrective actions. ``The only thing an inspector could do under the new system is inform the plant that something is going wrong,'' said Felicia Nestor, a food safety specialist at the Government Accountability Project, a group that supports government whistle-blowers. 
   ``They have no club, especially over the products that already have gone out the door,'' Nestor said. The Department of Agriculture's office of the Inspector General recently interviewed federal inspectors at a Gold Kist, Inc., chicken processing plant at Guntersville, Ala., where the inspection system is being tested. 
   According to the inspector general's March 3 report, federal inspectors at the plant said that before the system was installed ``the inspectors were removing bad products from the lines.'' 
   After the new system was implemented, government food inspectors ``were told to stop removing products from the lines,'' according to the report. 
   Spot checks of the Guntersville plant found nine of 60 birds with air sacculitis on Feb. 5 and 20 of 70 birds on Feb. 7. The bad birds had not been removed by company employes ``who had taken the place of (Department of Agriculture) line inspectors,'' the report said. 
   Air sacculitis can fill a bird's respiratory system, body cavity and hollow avian bones with pus and bacteria. 
   While the controversy over air sacculitis involves mainly questions about the wholesomeness of pus-filled chickens and turkeys, the disease also was linked to human health problems at a recent meeting of a Department of Agriculture advisory committee on implementing the new inspection system. 
   Daniel Lafontaine of Columbia, S.C., a veterinarian representing the American Veterinary Medicine Association, said he told agriculture officials at the meeting that ``birds that have air sacculitis may be a wholesomeness issue today and a day or two later these birds may be septicemic.'' 
   After the blood stream has been invaded by virulent microorganisms, a chicken or turkey ``is not safe for human consumption,'' said the South Carolina state meat and poultry inspection system. 
   Even if cooked properly, he said, ``pus can get pretty gross. You sure don't want to eat it.'' 
   Kenneth Petersen, senior program manager in the Department of Agriculture's food inspection service, said birds with severe air sacculitis are supposed to be condemned by company employees. 
   If monitoring federal inspectors determine through twice daily checks that they aren't, the firms involved can be cited for failing to meet food safety standards, he said. 
   Under the new inspection system, as under traditional systems in which federal inspectors examine each carcass, birds with less serious cases of air sacculitis can be ``reworked'' by either cutting away pus-filled air sacs and other tissues or by using a vacuum device to remove the material, Petersen said. 
   ``We recognize that wholesomeness issues are also important and we check for them,'' Petersen said. ``But our emphasis is on those things that may cause an ailment. So, we are seeking an appropriate balance.''  
   I ask the consumers of America to be aware, as they buy chicken and turkey, of whether or not the wholesomeness act of 1968 is being followed by the Congress of the United States. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words today about biotechnology and trade. As a working family farmer, I see the effects of this debate nearly every week at the grain elevators in my hometown of New Hartford, Iowa. 
   With the benefit of this personal experience, and as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee's International Trade Subcommittee, I have addressed the issue of biotechnology and trade in many ways. 
   Last October, my Trade Subcommittee looked at the biotechnology issue during hearings on agricultural trade policy. Last fall, I brought Charles Ludolph, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Europe, to Iowa to hear the concerns our corn and soybean growers have about the European food scare over GMO products. Last December, I addressed this issue at the WTO Ministerial Conference Meeting in Seattle. 
   And I have continued to have high-level discussions about trade in genetically modified foods with the European Commission. I recently had another meeting in this city with David Byrne, the EU Commissioner for Consumer Health and Safety Protection. This was a very informative meeting. If followed  a lengthy session I had with Commissioner Byrne in Seattle. 
   In our Washington meeting, Commissioner Byrne and I discussed recent developments affecting trade and biotechnology within the European Union. 
   It is with this deep background, and my long-standing concern about biotechnology and trade, that I would like to report to the people of Iowa and America that I still have great concerns about what we are seeing in Europe, and now in Japan. 
   For nearly 30 years, Europe's governments have been telling their people that modern agricultural technology is dangerous. First, it was the pesticide scare of the 1970s. Even though we have added eight years to our life spans since we started widely spraying modern pesticides on our crops. Then it was growth hormones in meat. Even though European scientists have confirmed the safety of these hormones. Now it's genetically modified foods. Even though not one person has ever caught so much as a cold from eating a genetically enriched product. 
   Now we learn that just last week, Japan's Ministry of Health and Welfare is getting set to require mandatory safety tests on genetically modified foods before they can be imported into Japan. This will dramatically and adversely affect our farmers, who ship about $10 billion worth of products a year to Japan. Every year, Japan relies on United States production for 80 percent of its corn imports. 
   Japan is taking this action even though genetically modified products produced in the United States must be approved by a food regulatory agency that the world looks to as the model for what a food safety agency should do. 
   And both the Japanese and the European Union governments know that genetically modified foods are only approved for sale after thousands of field trials and rigorous testing. 
   So what's going on? 
   Mr. President, I am convinced that a good part of these developments can be explained by a desire to restrain trade. Non-tariff trade barriers we've been fighting to eliminate for 50 years. Agricultural producers in Europe, and in Japan, can't grow corn, or soybeans, or many other products more efficiently, at better prices, than we can. So they look for other means to counter the competitive edge we enjoy. 
   After the United States and our trading partners agreed to the Agreement on Agriculture, one of the Uruguay Round Agreements, it is more difficult now to use quotas, tariffs, and subsidies to favor domestic producers. 
   So fear is used instead. 
   Mr. President, it was a Democrat President, Franklin Roosevelt, who said, ``The only thing we have to fear is, fear itself.'' As far as biotechnology is concerned, the only thing Europe, and now Japan, have to offer is fear. It's how the Europeans have protected their domestic agricultural markets from American competition for 30 years. 
   Just look at the comment by Germany's environment minister, Ju 4rgen Tritten, when the European Commission proposed a redrafting of the legislation governing the admission of genetically modified products into the EU. Just as they planned it, this new European Union legislation has the effect of slowing the approval of new U.S. genetically modified products in Europe to a trickle. The German minister was elected. He hailed this legislation as a ``de facto moratorium.'' 
   And if it's not the case that the Europeans, and now Japan, are using fear as a new trade barrier, why is it that these governments, and the antibiotechnology activists who are so worried about the impact of genetically modified foods, seem completely unconcerned about biotechnology in medicine? Is it because they really know that medical uses of biotechnology are completely safe? 
   I don't want to give the impression that all of this consumer fear has been whipped up just to restrain trade. There is always legitimate concern about new technology, especially in food. 
   But in my view, the unprecedented safety record of our food regulatory system completely eliminates this concern. 
   And it appears that Europe's governments have overplayed the extent of consumer concern. A recent poll of 16,000 Europeans by the European Commission's own Environment Directorate found that Europe's citizens are less concerned about GMOs than they are over other environmental issues. When asked to rank their chief environmental concerns on a list of nine issues, GMOs finished ninth, in last place. 
   There is also another dimension to this issue you don't hear the antibiotech activists talk about. That is the fact that we can now prove that biotechnology is the most powerful tool for good that our researchers have ever had. 
   Right now, some 400 million people currently suffer from Vitamin A deficiency, including millions of children who go blind every year. A new genetically-enhanced form of rice containing beta-carotene, called ``golden rice,'' will mean these children will not be cruelly robbed of their sight. 
   Another form of ``golden rice'' included genes to overcome the chronic iron deficiency suffered by 2 billion people in rice cultures. Women have always been subject to extra risk from birth complications because of anemia. 
   What are the terrible risks in our food approval system that would justify blinding children, or subjecting Asian women to birth complications? The answer is simple: there are none. There is just the polities of fear. 
   Because biotechnology is such a great force for good, this must change. What can we do about it? I don't have all the answers. But I do know this. We have got to talk about finding a worldwide 
   solution. And we can only do that if the United States leads. 
   Right now, the Quad Countries--the United States, the European Union, Japan, and Canada--lack a coherent vision for how to address the biotechnology issue. This is largely because the senior Quad partner, the United States, has backed away from its traditional leadership role in shaping global trade policy. In fact, as a result of this administration's lack of focus and vision, this is the first time in 50 years that we have not succeeded in going forward with a new global trade liberalization agenda. 
   As a result, the United States is reduced to agreeing to half-hearted ideas put forward by the European Commission in Geneva, like a ``consultative forum'' to look at biotech issues. Mr. President, I'm not even sure what a ``consultative forum'' is, or what it is supposed to accomplish, but we have agreed to it. 
   Another sign of this administration's failure of leadership on trade is the fact that at Seattle, we refused to seek a comprehensive round, knowing this unreasonable posture would never be accepted by our trading partners. In fact, the administration's refusal to negotiate a comprehensive round was a complete reversal of United States policy that successfully launched and completed the last round of global trade negotiations, the Uruguay Round. 
   In 1986, our then United States Trade Representative, Clayton Yeutter, said only a comprehensive round would result in the greatest gains for the United States. He was right. It did. 
   I have a high regard for Ambassador Rita Hayes and her team in Geneva. They are leading agriculture negotiations that started about one month ago. But their hands are tied. They have to negotiate within a very narrow framework because a political decision made months ago to limit the scope of new global trade negotiations made it all but certain that the talks in Seattle would not succeed. 
   This is certainly a far cry from the traditional, bold United States trade agenda that has brought us such tremendous prosperity. 
   Right now, agriculture is struggling. Our farmers are struggling. Mr. President, I said a few moments ago that Europe and Japan are using fear in place of facts with regard to trade and biotechnology. 
   But we cannot counter fear with uncertainty. We cannot combat false information with confusion. And we cannot oppose political expediency in Europe with a lack of resolve at home. 
   There is a great debate going on about extraordinary new technology and trade that we must lead. that sort of focused international leadership can only come from the White House. Because America speaks diplomatically only thru the Office of the President,  we need an administration that understands that we must trade globally, so we can prosper locally. 
   I urge the administration in the strongest possible terms to rise to this challenge.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, every young person in our country should have the opportunity to grow and learn in an environment that is free of drugs and violence. This is the type of environment Safe and Drug Free Schools promotes. 
   With the recent results of the annual Monitoring the Future study, it is obvious that we need to continue to provide our young people with effective programs, such as Safe and Drug Free Schools, to assure positive learning environments. This year Monitoring the Future reported that nearly 55 percent of our high school seniors have used an illicit drug in the past month. In addition, the study found that nearly 50 percent of high school seniors have used marijuana in 1999 and this percentage has remained unchanged in 1998, as well as 1997. Sadly, the study also found that the percentage of 10th graders who reported use of marijuana increased from 39.6 percent in 1998 to nearly 41 percent in 1999. With these discouraging drug use and abuse trends, it is clear that we need to use every resource available for anti-drug efforts. 
   Safe and Drug Free Schools provides our state and local education agencies with the funding necessary to implement effective, research-based programs that prevent and reduce violence and substance abuse in our schools. Studies show a high correlation between drug use and availability and school violence. We need to create a drug-free environment to promote a safe environment. 
   In fact, many states have reported decreases in incidents of violence and drug use because of Safe and Drug Free Schools funds. It is imperative that we continue to provide our communities with the resources necessary to protect our children from violence and drugs.  With our leadership and support, it is certain that these disturbing trends of drug use and increasing school violence will be reduced. I am committed to providing our young people with a positive learning environment free of drugs and safe from harm.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which would make Social Security beneficiaries, who had their benefits misused by organizational representative payees, whole. While most people receive their Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefit payments directly, others must have assistance in money management. Benefits, totaling over $25 billion, to these people are paid through representative payees who receive and manage the payments on behalf of the beneficiaries. Representative payee responsibilities include, but are not limited to, frequently monitoring the beneficiary's current well-being for food, shelter, clothing, medical care, and personal needs; informing the Social Security Administration of changes in the representative payee's own circumstances that would affect the performance of representative payee services; reporting events to the Social Security Administration that may affect the beneficiary's entitlement or amount of benefits; and submitting an annual accounting to SSA reporting about benefits received, used, and conserved. 
   Currently, about 6.5 million Social Security and Supplemental Security Income program beneficiaries rely on representative payees to manage their monthly benefits. SSA usually looks for a payee among the beneficiary's family and friends. For others, those traditional networks of support are not available, and SSA relies on state, local, or community sources to fill the need. Family members serve as representative payees for about 88 percent of the beneficiaries requiring them. 45,050 organizations, such as institutions, government agencies, financial organizations, and qualified fee-for-service organizations, serve as payees for the other 12 percent, totaling 750,570 beneficiaries. 
   As Chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, I am especially concerned about the 795,060 beneficiaries, age 62 and over, who are served by representative payees. With the retirement of the baby boomer generation on the horizon, the number of institutions, such as nursing homes, serving as payees stands to increase dramatically. Therefore, addressing this matter now is all the more urgent. 
   The majority of representative payees provide much-needed help to beneficiaries without abusing this responsibility. A minority of payees misuse their position. SSA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has recently investigated several instances of misuse by organizational representative payees. One such investigation served as the subject of a recent ``20/20'' television news program segment. In this segment, several elderly Social Security beneficiaries accused Greg Gamble, of the Aurora Foundation, a former organizational payee, of using their benefits for his own purposes. On March 14, 2000, Mr. Gamble entered a guilty plea in federal court of embezzlement of Social Security funds. As part of the plea agreement, Mr. Gamble agreed to make restitution to SSA in the amount of $303,314.00. Although this is only one example of misuse, SSA's OIG has just begun investigating several instances of misuse. Since FY 1998, it has identified about $8 million in SSA representative payee fraud loss. SSA's OIG expects the number of misuse cases to increase as SSA increases its review of organizational representative 
   payee records. 
   When any payee has been determined to have misused an individual's benefits, SSA reassigns another payee to the beneficiary. Unfortunately, SSA can reissue the benefits only in cases where negligent failure on SSA's part to investigate or monitor the payee resulted in the misuse. In virtually all other cases, the individual loses his or her funds unless SSA can obtain restitution, through civil processes, of the misused benefits from the payee. If SSA is able to recover the misused amount, it may take years to do so. In the meantime, the beneficiary has lost the amount misused and may be temporarily inconvenienced, by not having money to pay rent, utilities, or food, until a new payee is assigned. 
   In order to prevent misuse of benefits in the future, and to provide better accountability of benefits to beneficiaries, I am introducing the ``Social Security Beneficiaries Protection Act,'' along with my co-sponsor and Special Committee on Aging Ranking Member Senator BREAUX. This bipartisan bill:

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, many times I have come to the floor to express my concerns regarding the threat of illegal drugs to our young people. Today, I want to address one drug in particular, a designer drug called Ecstasy. Although it has been around a long time, its use has exploded recently. As with most such drugs, drug pushers are marketing it as a safe drug. That's a lie. 
   Ecstasy is a Schedule I synthetic drug with amphetamine-like properties that is inexpensive and easy to make. It acts as a stimulant and a hallucinogen for approximately 4 to 6 hours and gives its users a false sense of ease and relaxation. Because of these effects, Ecstasy is often found in big city club scenes that specialize in attracting young people. Recently, however, the nation is experiencing an Ecstasy explosion, which is spreading this dangerous drug into suburban and rural areas. With the recent release of a study on substance abuse in mid-size cities and rural America by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA), this is particularly disturbing. 
   In January of this year, CASA warned that Americans need to recognize that drugs are not only an urban problem, but a rural problem as well. I see this in my own state of Iowa. CASA reports that 8th graders living in rural America are 34 percent more likely to smoke marijuana and 83 percent more likely to use crack cocaine, than those in urban areas. It also reports that among 10th graders, use rates in rural areas exceed those in urban areas for every drug except marijuana and Ecstasy. The key here is that Ecstasy is not yet, but is quickly becoming a rural drug. It is imperative that parents and kids become aware of Ecstasy and the dangers of use. 
   Unfortunately, Ecstasy is quickly becoming the drug of choice among many of our young people. It is perceived by many as harmless because negative effects are not immediately noticeable. In fact, Ecstasy is often referred to as a recreational drug. For this reason, it is not surprising that Monitoring the Future, an annual study that monitors illicit drug use among teenagers, reported Ecstasy use growing. Lifetime use among 12th graders increased from one in fifteen in 1998 to one in twelve in 1999. Past year use went from one in twenty-five in 1998 to one in fifteen in 1999. This is a disturbing upward trend. 
   Ecstasy is a dangerous drug that can be lethal. Many are unaware that it can cause increased heart rate, nausea, fainting, chills, and sleep problems. In addition to physical effects, there are also psychological effects such as panic, confusion, anxiety, depression, and paranoia. Scientists are also learning that Ecstasy may cause irreversible brain damage, and in some cases it simply stops the heart. We need to put an end to the spread of Ecstasy into our communities. We need to take away its image as safe. We need to counter the arguments, that it is a fun drug. 
   However, with recent reports of rises in Ecstasy seizures by the U.S. Customs Service, it seems we have a long, hard battle ahead of us. In fiscal year 1999, Customs seized 3 million doses of Ecstasy. In the first 5 months of fiscal year 2000, Customs seized 4 million doses. Ecstasy has become such a threat that Customs has established an Ecstasy Task Force to gather intelligence on criminal smuggling of Ecstasy. Customs has also trained 13 dogs to detect Ecstasy among those crossing the border and entering major airports. 
   Although much is being done to stop the flow into our country, we need to play our part and educate the young people in our communities. In my home state of Iowa, Ecstasy is not yet a major problem and this may be the case in your home states as well. However, I am here today to tell you that if it isn't a problem now, it may be soon. We need to stop the use of Ecstasy before it starts. And the way to do that is to educate the parents and young people in our communities on the dangers. I don't want to see any more innocent lives cut short or careers ruined because of bad or no information.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation that would give support to community antidrug coalitions nation-wide. The National Community Coalition Institute would strengthen and enhance the role of community coalitions, to reduce and prevent drug use in communities. 
   More specifically, one of the problems we have found in implementing the Drug Free Communities Program has been the inexperience of a lot of the communities, particularly smaller and rural ones in knowing how to evaluate their efforts; get information on best practices from other, successful coalitions, and on how to fill out grant applications. The National Community Coalition Institute would improve the effectiveness of community coalitions by providing state-of-the-art and widely available education, training, and technical assistance for coalition leaders and community teams. The National Community Coalition Institute would ensure that communities nation-wide are adequately prepared to undertake the important work of building drug free communities. 
   Ultimately, the fight against drugs cannot be successful if it does not start in our own backyards. I invite all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this effort.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I take this opportunity, at the start of debate on this important bill to reduce taxes for married couples by eliminating the marriage tax penalty, to give some reaction to comments made from the other side of the aisle yesterday. My reaction probably should have been given last night, but the environment at that time was such that other Members wanted to speak on issues other than the marriage tax penalty, so I did not take advantage of the opportunity. It would have been more appropriate for me to respond to the Senate minority leader and other Members  of the other side of the aisle last night so it would be more in context. 
   These comments are in regard to our efforts to repeal the marriage tax penalty and also to clear up some of the inaccurate and misleading statements made by the other side of the Senate. 
   We heard the charge made yesterday by the minority leader that, in passing this bill, we are going to be dipping into the Social Security surplus. Of course, that is going to be the Democratic mantra from now on, even though it is not the truth. Our own budget document is evidence of it not being our intent. Knowing the other side is salivating at trying to make this bogus political charge stick, we have been very careful in making sure we stay within the $150 billion in tax relief authorized in the budget resolution that will be before us later today in the form of the conference committee report on the budget for the year 2001. 
   By carefully staying within these limits, we aren't touching one cent of Social Security money. That is important because people know the irresponsibility of Congress from 1969 until the Republican majority of Congress, the first Republican majority in both Houses of Congress in 40 years, finally got the job done of balancing the budget with decisions made in 1997. For the first time in 43 years, we are paying down on the national debt 3 years in a row. The budget we are going to adopt this afternoon for the year 2001 will be the fourth year, and we will be paying down $177 billion on that off the debt in the budget year 2001. 
   Regardless of what the members of the other side of the aisle say, this marriage tax penalty bill we are going to pass to reduce taxes for the average married couple by $1,400, because they will no longer get hit with the marriage penalty, fits into the budget and doesn't use one cent of Social Security money to accomplish our goal of justice for middle-class married families in America. 
   Now, we also heard the misleading charge yesterday that we in the majority are trying to dictate what amendments the Democrats could offer. All we have been trying to do is to bring some order to this process so we can get this bill, which even the President of the United States says ought to pass. In his State of the Union Message, he asked us to pass a bill eliminating the marriage tax penalty. So, yesterday, they said we were trying to dictate amendments. Well, during that discussion, we asked if second-degree amendments could be in order to the Democrats' first-degree amendments. We were told absolutely not. So the Democratic side is doing as much dictating as anyone. If we can be accused of complaining about the amendments they want to offer and objecting to it, then they have no right to deny us the opportunity to offer second-degree amendments to their amendments. 
   In fact, the assistant minority leader stated that his caucus was in lockstep behind the minority leader. Well, that is simply part of the problem. The other side does walk in lockstep against reform in an attempt to paint this Congress as a do-nothing Congress. Funny, isn't it, how when Democrats brag about being in lockstep and unanimity behind their leader, somehow that isn't being partisan. But if Republicans were to vote in lockstep behind our leader, they would say we are being very partisan. 
   So, again, it seems as if we have a double standard that is not quite justified. Maybe my accusations should be directed more toward the press and media than the other side of the aisle and their statements. But it seems so often if Republicans are together, we are being partisan. But if Democrats are together, they aren't being partisan. As I have followed the stories on this in the press for the last 2 days, I haven't seen any charge of partisanship by the media toward the other side of the aisle. But, boy, I bet we Republicans would be painted as partisan. 
   Unfortunately, for the other side, this Congress has already made substantial progress and will continue to do so, and they will never be able to label us as a do-nothing Congress. I wish, though, that we had a few independent thinkers on the other side of the aisle, as we do on our side of the aisle, and not the lockstep following of leaders to the extent which it is. All I have to do as a Republican is proudly point out the independence of Senator MCCAIN on this side of the aisle to show that there are Republicans who are independent and do not always follow in lockstep. It would be nice if there were a few ``Senator McCains'' on the other side of the aisle who were willing to break ranks and be very independent. 
   A couple of the amendments the Democrats want to offer deal with prescription drugs. Of course, these are political amendments. We Republicans have already set aside $40 billion in our budget to deal with Medicare and prescription drugs. All we need to do is have people on that side of the aisle--as there are bipartisan Medicare reform proposals with prescription drug provisions in them--get behind some of these bipartisan approaches and get the White House behind them. We will be glad to move on those within the $40 billion we have set aside in our budget to deal with Medicare reform and prescription drugs because we all know this problem has to be solved. We know that some seniors can't afford prescription drugs. Some seniors have to choose between food and drugs. That is not a choice they should have to make. And we have, consequently, taken the 
   initiative in our budget and have $40 billion for that. Now all we need is a little bit of cooperation from the other side of the aisle, following on what one or two on the other side of the aisle have attempted to do with Republicans, to move a bill along in this effort. But the White House happens to be dragging its feet. 
   Now, I think the insinuation is, from the amendments being offered on prescription drugs, that we don't see this as a problem and that we don't want to solve this problem. They aren't telling the truth. 
   Another amendment they have asked us to look at deals with the taxation of Conservation Reserve Program payments to farmers. The Internal Revenue Service--as they so often do in their infinite wisdom but lack of common sense--is trying to impose Social Security taxes on these payments. Of course, this is the Clinton-Gore administration that is doing this to the farmers of the United States. These taxes hadn't been opposed until the Clinton-Gore administration started imposing them through the IRS. And now we have a Democrat amendment to overturn what the Clinton-Gore administration is doing to the farmers on the CRP payments. So why don't the people on the other side of the aisle just call up President Clinton and Vice President GORE and ask them to order their own IRS to drop this silly new interpretation of the law because right now we have the Vice President going around the country saying how much he is willing to help the farmers of the United States and, Lord only knows, they need help with prices at 25-year lows. 
   Well, I guess help came after he invented the Internet because I haven't seen any help in this area since this has been in the courts in the United States. Now we have the Clinton-Gore IRS beating up on farmers with this new tax. Now, there is nothing wrong with the tax being offered from the other side of the aisle, trying to correct this; but it seems to me that there are other ways this could be handled. 
   Yesterday, we also heard what was really a political attack, that this tax relief is somehow a ``risky tax cut scheme.'' How come from the other side of the aisle all we ever hear about is ``risky tax cut schemes''? We don't hear about the risky spending schemes that are offered by the White House or by the other side of the aisle. All you have to do is go back to State of the Union Address on January 2000 and listen to the President of the United States propose 77 new spending programs--77 new spending programs. Somehow, there is shock on the other side that we want to let the people of this country keep their hard-earned money rather than running it through the Treasury in Washington, DC. 
   Now, there is a certain amount of good economic freedom argument you can give that is very philosophical about why the working men and women of America ought to spend more of their own money and send less of it to Washington just so they can have the economic freedom to do with the fruits of their labor and their minds what they want to do. 
   But there is also a pretty good economic argument for not running any more money than is absolutely needed through Washington,  DC. That is because money spent through the Federal budget does less economic good--in other words, it turns over less times for the economy--than money spent by individual taxpayers and working men and women of America. All one has to do is look at the defense budget. The defense budget produces a lot of expensive items. But once they are made, those items are not used for producing wealth. They serve a good purpose for our national defense. But they don't turn over any more money in our economy. 
   We come to these risky spending schemes of this administration with 77 new programs, and we have tax cuts before Congress. Being at the highest level of taxation in the history of our country, at about 21 percent of gross domestic product, if we allow the President, through those 77 risky spending schemes, to build up to that level of expenditure at 21 percent, then when we have a downturn in the economy, the spending is going to stay up here and the income is down here. Then you have another budget deficit; whereas, if we continue the pattern of the last 50 years of taxing at about 18.5 to 19 percent of the gross domestic product, then over the historical average there will be less chance of a deficit. 
   We want to let the working men and women keep more of their money and keep our historical level of taxation at about 18.5 to 19 percent. We do not want the extra money that is now coming into the Treasury to be eaten up by these 77 risky spending schemes of this administration. 
   I feel compelled to correct a statement made by my democratic colleague from Illinois. My colleague stated that the Republican marriage penalty bill would require 5 million more taxpayers to pay higher taxes. My colleague stated:  
   Here's the kicker. They don't want to talk about they have drawn their bill up so that five million Americans will actually pay higher taxes........Take a look around the corner--five million Americans end up paying higher taxes under the alternative minimum tax. So now isn't that something?  
   This is simply incorrect. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation there would be no increase in any taxpayer's overall tax liability as a result of this bill. 
   In fact, the bill attempts to correct an AMT problem for millions of taxpayers. According to Joint Tax, in the year 2010, 9.2 million tax returns will benefit from the AMT provision in the bill--this includes 6.5 million joint returns and 2.7 million other individual returns benefiting from this bill. This is a worthy goal, and we should do what is right. 
   According to Joint Tax, in 2010 approximately 1.5 million joint returns benefiting from the AMT credit extension will become AMT payers under the bill. However, as I just mentioned, Joint Tax estimates that the bill would not increase any taxpayer's overall tax liability. 
   The record must be set straight--no one will pay higher taxes as a result of this bill. 
   My friends on the other side of the aisle have rejected a request we made yesterday to allow a debate solely on the marriage tax penalty relief. The Senate leader has offered 10 relevant amendments, including their alternative marriage tax penalty proposal. The other side has rejected this offer. The other side claims they want to debate other issues--talk about issues other than tax relief. 
   Either way you slice it--by what the Senate minority has done or by what they claim--they evidently don't care about marriage tax penalty relief itself. 
   Senate Democrats could live with a focused debate when it applied to the education savings accounts a month ago, March 2, and ending the Social Security earnings limit for seniors over 65, which only a few weeks ago, on March 22, was passed by the Senate. 
   However, now when it comes down to marriage tax penalty relief, our colleagues and friends on the other side of the aisle say no. Why? What has changed compared to these other two tax bills? Why were those other items only a few weeks ago so much more important than this bill that would help over 40 million families? The bill before the Senate will help 40 million families. They want to debate other issues, so they are holding up the marriage tax penalty bill. 
   Imagine the hue and cry Democrats would raise if the shoe were on the other foot--if we were debating these other issues and we demanded to offer marriage tax penalty amendments. 
   The House has acted. The Finance Committee has acted. The Senate should now act. However, it can't because the Democrats are obstructing this legislation like in-laws on a honeymoon. 
   We have been more than fair. We have said this is a debate on marriage tax penalty relief--offer any amendment you want that related to this bill and we will give you a debate and a vote on it. Any amendment--up to ten of them. 
   How many relevant amendments did the Democrats offer yesterday? Less then half of their ten addressed this issue. By my generous calculation that means that they only half care about marriage tax penalty relief. 
   In the House, it was not this way. Forty-eight Democrats across the Rotunda voted for marriage tax penalty relief. It was bipartisan over there. Why can't it be bipartisan here? Democrats here are seeking to make this a highly partisan Senate. 
   So the Senate must wait and over 40 million American families will have to wait. Every couple who suffers under this marriage tax penalty, which has existed for 31 years, must wait further. In a sense, everyone is going to have to wait while the other side of the aisle obstructs this tax relief effort. 
   This is tax week across America. America's families are hunkered down over their kitchen tables figuring out their tax forms. Isn't it time these taxpayers get a break from the most unfair part of this process, the provisions that tax them at a higher rate just because they are doing what is right and are married? 
   I want to give them that break. My colleagues want to give them that break. However, my Democrat colleagues don't want to give them that break. In fact, they don't want to even give them a debate or a vote on this very important issue. 
   I urge the Senate to go to the final debate on this and pass it before we adjourn this week. I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object, I see this as an effort to delay passing the marriage tax penalty relief bill. Offering or voting for this motion is saying that the Senate does not want to fix the marriage tax penalty. Recommitting the bill is an attempt, I think, to kill the bill. 
   We are going to deal with the prescription drug problem. As I said in my opening comments this morning, Republicans have already set aside $40 billion in our budget to do so. We do not need to delay fixing the marriage tax penalty in order to fix the Medicare problem. We have the resources and the time to do both. 
   Again, I think this is a transparent effort to kill marriage tax penalty relief, and, consequently, I object.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute. And if somebody else wants the remaining 2 minutes, I would be glad to yield it. 
   I take this opportunity, just before the cloture votes, to clear up a couple things. First of all, the Senator from North Dakota is a very good friend of mine. I work very closely with him. I do not dispute what he said. But I do want to clarify his reaction to my saying that taxes are as high as they have ever been in the history of our country. 
   The Senator made the point that taxes have gone down for many taxpayers. Of course, that is true. He concentrated on middle-income taxpayers. But it is mostly true because of the tax credit for children that the Republicans promoted and passed in the 1997 tax bill. For a family with two kids, for instance, that means $1,000 that Republicans provided, or about $25 billion a year. 
   But despite the protests of the Senator from North Dakota, I still stand by my comments that the overall percentage of taxation is at a historical high of near 21 percent of GDP. 
   Then in response to Senator ROBB's comments on the Medicare reserve, it is my understanding that $40 billion was reserved for Medicare and prescription drugs in the conference report. I hope and think that the Senator from Virginia is incorrect. 
   I yield my remaining time to the Senator from Kansas.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator HUTCHINSON in sponsoring this resolution. We have been working closely together to find a solution to this growing problem. Unfortunately it seems the White House fails to grasp the urgency. 
   Mr. President, the DEA, who has for several years reimbursed state and local law enforcement agencies for the costs they have incurred in cleaning up drug laboratories, has run out of clean-up money. This has happened at a time when the number of these labs are growing rapidly, and springing up in towns and counties where there has never been a problem in the past. Iowa alone has a stack of over $83,000 in outstanding lab cleanup bills, and this amount continues to grow. Last year, Iowa received over $1.3 million in reimbursement, and at the current pace this total is expected to be higher this year. 
   Four weeks ago, Mr. President, Mr. HUTCHINSON, Mr. KYL, and I wrote the appropriations committee to alert them to this problem. Our offices were aware of this impending problem, and wanted to insure that no one was taken by surprise so there could be a quick resolution. Two weeks ago, we were joined by Mr. CRAIG and Mr. ASHCROFT in a letter to the Attorney General, encouraging her to work with the Appropriators in reprogramming funds to cover this shortfall. 
   I am pleased to say that within days we had been informed that a reprogramming request had been sent to the White House Budget Office for their approval. The request would allow for the use of returned COPS funds--money that was not going to be spent otherwise--to be used to clean up these environmental hazzards. I want to emphasize that this source was identified by the Justice Department, not by Congress. And I want to applaud their swift action to solve the problem, and not play politics. 
   But then, OMB happened. It did nothing. The problem mounts, and OMB sits. That is why Senator HUTCHINSON and I are offering this Sense of the Senate. We hope to encourage timely action--not more sitting on bureaucratic thumbs. I urge my colleagues to join us.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, these are very interesting discussions. I think that for a long, long period of time people at the grassroots of America have understood there should not be a policy that hurts people who join in bonds of matrimony. Everybody realizes that the strength and foundation of our society is the family. The husband and wife are the strength of our society and the foundation of our society. 
   We have legislation before us that finally will end the penalty against people who marry and get hit with a higher level of taxation rather than two people who aren't married and filing separately making the same amount of income. 
   Basically, we are talking about the issue of fairness--in this case, fairness within the Tax Code; economic fairness for people who are married. 
   For about 30 years, our Tax Code has been penalizing people just because they happen to be married. 
   This is, of course, a perfect example of how broken our Tax Code is, and perhaps is an example that can be given with many other examples of why there ought to be a broader look at greater reform and simplification of the Tax Code. That debate is for another day. Even though 70 percent of the people in this country feel the Tax Code is broken and ought to be thrown out, there is not a consensus among the American people whether a flat rate income tax, which about 30 percent of the people say we ought to have, or a national sales tax, which about 20 percent of the people say we ought to have, should take the place of the present Tax Code. 
   I use those two percentages to show there is not much of a consensus of what should take its place and therefore probably not enough movement being reflected in the Congress for an alternative to the present Tax Code. Therefore, we find ourselves refining the Tax Code within our ability to do it--a little bit here and a little bit there. 
   One of the most outstanding examples of something wrong with our Tax Code is that people pay a marriage penalty, pay a higher rate of taxation because they are married as opposed to two individuals filing separately. As with the earnings limitation that discriminated against older Americans, a bill was recently signed by the President of the United States. This unfair marriage penalty needs to be dumped, as well. 
   I applaud my side of the aisle because it took a Republican-led Congress to repeal the Social Security earnings limit, but the President of the United States was very happy to sign that Republican-led effort. To be fair to the other side, it eventually did pass unanimously. It is the same Republican-led Congress that is taking the lead in repealing the marriage penalty tax. 
   I listened to a number of comments from the minority side yesterday. I came away with the conclusion they want the American people to believe that the other side of the aisle is for getting rid of the marriage penalty tax. Of course, the minority party had control of the Congress for decades and never once tried to repeal it. Even more interesting, I am afraid we could be victims of the old bait-and-switch routine. For instance, as this bill was being considered in the Senate Finance Committee, an amendment was offered by the minority to delay any marriage penalty relief until we fixed Social Security and Medicare. That is a ``manana'' type of amendment, meaning if we wait to do these other things tomorrow before we have a tax cut, we are never going to have a tax cut. 
   We may see that amendment again on the floor of the Senate. Remember, in committee, all of the Democrats voted for delay until Social Security or Medicare was fixed, and all the Republicans voted to fix the marriage penalty tax now. We all know neither the administration nor the Democratic side have comprehensive proposals to fix Social Security and Medicare. I have to admit, I am participating with two or three Democrats on a bipartisan effort to fix Social Security, but the administration has refused to endorse that bipartisan effort. There are also bipartisan efforts in the Senate to fix Medicare, but the White House has not endorsed those bipartisan efforts. 
   Saying that Social Security and Medicare ought to be fixed before we give some tax relief, and particularly tax relief through the marriage penalty tax, is like saying you don't want a tax cut. I am sorry to say at this late stage of this Congress, I don't think we will see from the Clinton-Gore administration any efforts to fix these problems this year in a comprehensive way. When they say we ought to fix Social Security or Medicare first, it is a manana approach--put it off until later; that day will surely never come if we follow that scenario. 
   The national leadership of the unions in America, the AFL-CIO leadership, put out their marching orders in a legislative alert making these very same arguments that I am sure is only 
   coincidental. They urge that the marriage penalty relief should be delayed until these other problems--presumably Social Security and Medicare--are solved. 
   My friends on the other side of the aisle say they are for marriage penalty relief but only some time in the unknown future. That is, in fact, Washington, DC, doubletalk that continues to make the American people more cynical about whether Congress is ever determined and willing and committed to deliver keeping our promises. Delaying this tax relief means no tax relief at all. I hope taxpayers across the country will let their Senators know they have had enough of this doubletalk and that they will demand real action now, and sooner or later we will get this bill brought to a final vote. 
   Another misguided argument used yesterday is that under the majority bill married couples get a tax cut but single mothers with kids wouldn't get one. This is a complicated aspect of the bill, but the argument is not correct. Senators making these arguments repeated it, bringing emphasis to it, as if something new has been discovered, that some kind of smoking gun had been discovered. Unfortunately, for those Members' arguments, the statements are inaccurate. An important part of our bill repeals the alternative minimum tax for over 10 million people. Many helped in that provision will be single mothers. 
   There is something much more interesting about this argument; that is, the alternative that presumably will be offered by the other side of the aisle is the bill that flatout, without question, doesn't help single mothers at all. But that isn't even the most important point. 
   That important point is, if a single mother chooses to eventually get married--and since marriage is the foundation of our society, I think we all agree that this is a good move, both for the mother and the children--then, under our bill, she will not be penalized for being married. There will not be a  higher rate of taxation just because that single mother gets married. Under current law, if she continues to work after being married, the Government is going to slap her and her husband with a big tax increase. It is that sort of very bad situation our bill will eliminate. 
   In addition, it is important to note the alternative, from our friends on the other side of the aisle, discriminates against stay-at-home moms. Why should we have proposals before us indicating, if you decide you want to stay at home and raise your kids, spend full time doing it--probably the most important economic contribution you can make to American society, and you are not going to get paid for it, but it is a great contribution to American society. It might not be much of an economic contribution to the family because there is no income going to come as a result of it, but it is good for American society for kids to have parents who are able to be at home with them. 
   So if you decide to stay at home with the kids, you are going to be discriminated against under the alternative from the Democrat side of the aisle. 
   That proposal only helps two-earner couples. It not only doesn't help those single mothers over whom the other side of the aisle cries crocodile tears frequently, it hurts those families where one parent decides to stay at home with the children. I hope all of you stay-at-home parents out there listening understand what the Democratic alternative would do to your families. 
   It seems to me we should be helping people get married, encouraging marriage--it is the solid foundation of our society --not penalizing them for doing it. So, I hope we can get this bill to discussion without cloture. Obviously, there is a legitimacy for amendments from the other side of the aisle. There is even probably legitimacy for amendments from our side of the aisle. There ought to be agreement to those amendments. 
   It is really time for the gridlock to be over, to move to this bill, to get to a final vote. Now is the time to pass this very important reform, and I urge the Members of this body to come together on amendments, on limitations on discussions, and do what is right by passing this legislation. 
   Before I yield the floor, if I could do something for the leader: I ask unanimous consent the debate only continue on the marriage tax penalty until 5 p.m. today, with the time equally divided, and the majority leader recognized at the hour of 5.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   First of all, I think there is a very general proposition about the Tax Code. I want to relate it to the philosophy of higher taxation on the part of the Democratic Party members; and that is, that the higher the marginal tax rate, the worse the marriage tax penalty is. 
   We have in 1990 the drive for increasing taxes by Senator Mitchell when he was majority leader. That increased marginal tax rates at that particular time. Then we have had the highest tax increase in the history of the country, which was the one that was passed within 7 months after the Clinton administration was sworn in in 1993, 
   in which we still had two higher brackets put into the Tax Code. 
   Remember, that tax increase passed with 49 Democrats for it, and all Republicans and a few Democrats against it. It passed by Vice President GORE breaking the tie. Remember that we have a much worse tax penalty now than we did under the tax policies of the 1980s, when we had two brackets, 15 and 28 percent. The extent to which the marriage tax penalty is worse now than before is a direct result of higher marginal tax rates promoted by the other side of the aisle. 
   I also have to make a point in reference to what the Senator from Montana said today, as well as what he had said yesterday; that is, his accusation that the tax bill that reduces the marriage tax penalty before us is further evidence of the majority party trying to benefit higher income people. The Senator should be aware that his Democrat alternative actually benefits more higher income people than the bill that is before us by the Republican Party. I hope he will take a look at the distribution tables that show his bill helps more higher income people than the bill we are trying to get passed. 
   We have also heard arguments that this legislation does not end the marriage tax penalty in every way. This legislation ends the marriage tax penalty in the standard deduction and the 15- and 28-percent rate brackets and reduces it for virtually every family that suffers from the marriage tax penalty. This is the largest attack on the marriage tax penalty since its inception in 1969. 
   For many working couples, those in the 15-percent and the 28-percent tax bracket, which would be up to about $127,000 under this bill, this legislation effectively ends the marriage tax penalty. For those couples in higher income brackets, this legislation provides a significant reduction in the marriage tax penalty. 
   It is correct that this bill does not end all marriage tax penalties in the Tax Code. There are over 60 instances of the penalty in the code. This bill is about hitting the marriage tax penalty where it hits hardest--in the middle income tax brackets, the standard deduction, and the earned-income tax credit. 
   There is also talk about the bill before us resulting in more Tax Code complexity. Our bill is simpler than the Democrat alternative. Our legislation eliminates the marriage tax penalty in the standard deduction and the 15-percent and 28-percent rate brackets. How could this be more simple? 
   I hope we can have further discussion of these disagreements because I am convinced we can soundly overcome the arguments of the other side of the aisle.  
   I yield the floor. The Senator from Texas may use whatever time she needs or is available.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill on removing federal law enforcement officers convicted of felonies. 
   Under my bill, any federal law enforcement officer, who is convicted of a felony, would have to be removed from his or her position immediately. 
   Mr. President, my colleagues must be wondering why the Senator from Iowa is offering this legislation. Law enforcement officers convicted of felonies are removed immediately. That's just common sense. Right? 
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, common sense does not always prevail in the federal bureaucracy. 
   Common sense is in short supply at one very important place in the Pentagon--the office of the Inspector General or DOD IG. 
   In October 1999, the Majority Staff on my Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts issued a report on the DOD IG. 
   I placed the Majority Staff Report in the RECORD on November 2, 1999. 
   The Majority Staff Report substantiated allegations of misconduct by senior officials at the Defense Criminal Investigative Service--or DCIS--between 1993 and 1996. 
   DCIS is the criminal investigative branch in the DOD IG's office. 
   I would like to remind my colleagues that Mr. Donald Mancuso was the Director of DCIS between 1988 and 1997. Today, Mr. Mancuso is the Deputy DOD IG. He may be a candidate for nomination as the next DOD IG. 
   Some of the allegations examined in the Majority Staff Report concerned one of Mr. Mancuso's top deputies--an agent by the name of Mr. Larry J. Hollingsworth. 
   The Hollingsworth case is the driving force behind my bill. 
   Mr. Hollingsworth was the Director of Internal Affairs at DCIS from April 1991 until his retirement in September 1996. 
   In July 1995, after a fellow agent recognized Mr. Hollingsworth's photo in a law enforcement crime bulletin, Mr. Hollingsworth was apprehended. His home was searched, and he confessed to filing a fraudulent passport application. 
   Mr. Hollingsworth was convicted of a felony in U.S. District Court in March 1996. 
   The authorities who investigated Mr. Hollingsworth's crimes believe that he committed about 12 overt acts of fraud between 1992 and 1994. 
   Mr. President, can you imagine that? 
   While he was hammering rank and file agents for minor administrative offenses as head of the Internal Affairs unit, Mr. Hollingsworth was deeply involved in a criminal enterprise of his own. 
   The State Department agents who investigated the case were troubled by Mr. Hollingsworth's actions. From past experience, they know passport fraud is usually committed in furtherance of a more serious crime. But that crime was never discovered. 
   While the full extent of Mr. Hollingsworth's crimes remain a mystery, this case has helped to shed a whole lot of light on Deputy IG Mancuso. 
   Mr. Mancuso personally approved a series of administrative actions that kept a convicted felon in an employed status at DCIS for 6 months. 
   Mr. Hollingsworth confessed to passport fraud in July 1995. He was convicted in March 1996 and then confined in jail. All this time--for 14 months, Mr. Mancuso kept Mr. Hollingsworth in an employed status at DCIS until September 19,1996. 
   Mr. President, September 19, 1996 was the magic day. That was Mr. Hollingsworth's 50th birthday. 
   That was the very first day he was eligible to retire. On that day, he retired with full law enforcement benefits and Mr. Mancuso's blessing. 
   Mr. Mancuso's generosity will eventually cost the taxpayers a big chunk of money. 
   The Office of Personnel Management--OPM--estimated Mr. Hollingsworth's annuity will cost the taxpayers at least $750,000.00 through the year 2008. 
   This is money Mr. Hollingsworth should never collect had Mr. Mancuso exercised sound judgment under the law. 
   Mr. Mancuso could have removed Mr. Hollingsworth in March 1996 after conviction or maybe even sooner. 
   Instead, Mr. Mancuso chose to personally protect Mr. Hollingsworth until he reached his 50th birthday and could retire. 
   Mr Mancuso shielded Mr. Hollingsworth from the law for at least 6 months. 
   Under the law--5 U.S.C. 7513(b), Mr. Mancuso was authorized to remove Mr. Hollingsworth after conviction--if not sooner. 
   Mr. President, I underscore the words authorized. DCIS was authorized but not required to remove him. 
   Under the law, DCIS was granted discretionary authority to decide when--or if--to remove him. 
   Mr. President, too much discretionary authority in a place so short on common sense can lead to mistakes. The Hollingsworth case was a big mistake. 
   If my bill had been in effect in 1996, Mr. Hollingsworth would have been removed within 30 days of conviction. 
   My staff has consulted with OPM on this legislation. 
   OPM offered some constructive comments on how to strengthen it. Those ideas are now in the bill. 
   OPM was unaware of any other instance where a federal law enforcement agency had kept a convicted felon in an employed status for 6 months after conviction. 
   However, OPM could not guarantee that this would never happen again. 
   The intent of my legislation should be crystal clear: To ensure that personnel management decisions--like those taken by Mr. Mancuso in the Hollingsworth case--are never repeated again. 
   Over the past 10 months, my staff has spoken with many rank and file law enforcement officers about the special treatment given to Mr. Hollingsworth. 
   Rank and file agents are universally disgusted by what happened. 
   They feel--as I do--that law enforcement officers, who are convicted of felonies--should be removed from their posts immediately. 
   They don't want their badges tarnished by having one of their own, who committed a felony, remain on the job--as Mr. Hollingsworth was allowed to do. 
   That undermines morale in the ranks. 
   In closing, I would like to quote from a letter Mr. Mancuso wrote--on official DOD stationery--to Judge Ellis on April 29, 1996. 
   Judge Ellis was preparing to sentence the convicted felon, Mr. Hollingsworth. 
   Mr. Mancuso's statements to Judge Ellis were absurd. They were outrageous. 
   This letter shows that Mr. Mancuso was totally blind to the seriousness of Mr. Hollingsworth's crimes. 
   In the letter, Mr. Mancuso asked the judge to consider extenuating circumstances. He told the judge that Mr. Hollingsworth had taken a half day's leave to file the fraudulent passport application. Mr. Mancuso praised the convicted felon for this unselfish act. Can you believe that? 
   This is what Mr. Mancuso said to Judge Ellis, and I quote: ``Mr. Hollingsworth could have come and gone as he pleased,'' but he ``took leave to commit a felony.'' 
   In Mr. Mancuso's mind, the use of personal leave to commit a felony was a sign of moral excellence. 
   Mr. Mancuso concluded with this telling remark:   
   To this day, there is no evidence that Mr. Hollingsworth has ever done anything improper relating to his duties and responsibilities as a DCIS agent and manager.  
   Mr. Mancuso's statement to Judge Ellis was misguided for two reasons: 
   First, incredible as it may seem, Mr. Mancuso--a sworn law enforcement officer and current Deputy DOD IG--feels that it is OK for law enforcement officers to commit crimes so long as the agents are off duty. 
   Second, Mr. Mancuso's assertion about ``no evidence'' is flat wrong. It's inaccurate. 
   On February 1, 2000, my staff discovered a DCIS file containing information that refuted Mr. Mancuso's assertions to Judge Ellis about no evidence. It shows that in August 1995, both DCIS and the State Department did, in fact, have evidence that Mr. Hollingsworth had engaged in criminal activity at his desk in DCIS headquarters. 
   How could the Pentagon's top criminal investigator be so blind to evidence? 
   This file also contains other important revelations about Mr. Mancuso's misconduct in the Hollingsworth case. 
   It contains documents that indicate Mr. Mancuso was communicating with defense attorneys during the criminal court proceedings against Mr. Hollingsworth. 
   For example, it contains a FAX transmittal memo addressed personally to Mr. Mancuso from the defense attorney. Attached was a motion to dismiss charges against Mr. Hollingsworth. But there was no court date stamp or attorney signature on the document. And there were handwritten notes on it. This was a rough draft. 
   Mr. President, this really bothers me. 
   Mr. Mancuso--the director of a federal law enforcement agency--was furnished with a rough draft of a motion to dismiss felony charges that the U.S. Attorney was attempting to prosecute. 
   That is unethical conduct. 
   The file contains other damaging documents. 
   They suggest that the current Director of DCIS, Mr. John Keenan, returned 11 confiscated handguns to the convicted felon--Mr. Hollingsworth--in direct contravention of a federal court judgment and statutory law. 
   DCIS allegedly returned the guns to Mr. Hollingsworth on September 23, 1997, while he was still on supervised probation. This reckless act could have put a probation officer in harm's way. 
   We also learned that Mr. Hollingsworth was under investigation by the IRS in November 1983 for perjury. That very same month--November 1983, he was hired by DCIS to be the agent in charge of the Chicago Field Office. 
   The IRS concluded Mr. Hollingsworth had ``committed perjury during rebuttal testimony.'' On December 5, 1983, the IRS referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney in New Orleans for prosecution. 
   Mr. President, how could DCIS hire Mr. Hollingsworth under such questionable circumstances? 
   I don't understand it. 
   Mr. President, Mr. Mancuso went to extraordinary lengths to protect a convicted felon. 
   By doing what he did, Mr. Mancuso violated a trust that goes with the high office he occupies. He violated the trust that goes with the badge and gun he carries. In our democracy, when those sacred trusts are violated, our only protection is the law. 
   In this case, the law provides too much discretionary authority. It leaves the door wide open to abuse by irresponsible bureaucrats. We need to close that door. 
   My bill will close the loophole that Mr. Mancuso exploited in such a crafty way. 
   Mr. President, I would like to urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of legislation.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this important legislation today with my colleagues, Senator LIEBERMAN, Senator KERREY, and Senator BRYAN. This bill represents an important step toward ensuring patients receive safe, quality health care in our nation's hospitals and healthcare facilities. 
   The Institute of Medicine (IOM) Report released last fall indicates that nearly 44,000 to 98,000 people die or are seriously hurt in hospitals every year. That is equivalent to having three jumbo jets filled with passengers crash every two days. Should we be safer flying in an airplane than going to a hospital for routine surgery? 
   Take the case of Gary Masiello, who lost his daughter when her breathing tube was accidentally disconnected. Nine months later he lost his wife in another hospital when she choked on her medication. He no longer has the confidence that he or his family are safe when entering the hospital. 
   The case of Betsy Lehman, a Boston Globe health reporter, is yet another example of how medical mistakes can lead to death. She received a drug overdose in 1994 during her chemotherapy treatment. 
   Ironically, even one of the contributors to the IOM report was touched by a medical error. Mary Wakefield, while she was preparing the report, discovered that her 83 year old mother was operated on the wrong hand. 
   Today, Senator LIEBERMAN, Senator KERREY, Senator BRYAN, and I are introducing a bipartisan bill to make patient safety a national healthcare priority. We recognize that mistakes happen, and that in our complex healthcare system, problems will occur. But in a country that is the leader in healthcare research, technology, and advancement, we should be able to do much, much better when it comes to patient safety. 
   We are not here today to point the finger or to blame. We are here to provide a solution to this disturbing problem--a problem we think is preventable. 
   Our legislation establishes a reporting and patient safety program for hospitals and other healthcare providers that participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which would include virtually every healthcare facility in the United States. Billions of federal tax dollars go to these programs. The taxpayers deserve to know that the healthcare system they invest in provides safe, high-quality care. 
   This bill extends confidentiality protections to ensure that providers will report without risk of retaliation by trial lawyers. By creating a safe environment, this bill will foster reporting and corrective action plans in hospitals and healthcare facilities across the country. 
   Our legislation will improve patient safety and give providers the tools they need to address medical mistakes before patients are harmed. These errors are not intentional by any means, but they are preventable. So, I ask that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill to ensure that medical errors become a thing of the past.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to address the issue of the agriculture function in this budget. 
   I thank Senator DOMENICI, chairman of the committee, for the foresight that is represented in this budget, in two respects. 
   No. 1, for the foresight of including money in the budget for the proposed Federal Crop Insurance Program that already passed the Senate. Last year it passed the House. Hopefully, very shortly it will be sent to the President for his signature so that by the year 2001 the farmers of America will be able to manage their risks to a greater extent and be less dependent upon the political whims of Washington, which sometimes is the case, and whether or not there is a natural disaster. Will Congress pass the disaster aid? That is passed to help family farmers, not only when you have a drought but also when we have floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes. When there is a natural disaster, money is appropriated to help people in need at that particular time. 
   Last year, Senator CONRAD of North Dakota and I were able to have money included in the bill anticipating the availability of funds in case Congress passed crop insurance reform. The House got the job done last year. The Senate did not get it done until this year. We are building upon that $6 billion which was put in last year's budget with money through the year 2005 for the continuation of that program. 
   I thank Senator DOMENICI and members of the budget committee for the foresight of encouraging risk management by the American family farmer rather than relying upon the political whims of Congress. Sometimes the family farmers find themselves in that position when there is not adequate crop insurance protection. This is where the individual family farmer makes a decision to participate. 
   By having a better Crop Insurance Program, we hope we will not only encourage participation by a number of farmers but also encourage their participation at a higher level of protection than ever before. 
   We think this budget and the program that passed the Senate give encouragement to farmers. We are trying to give one more additional tool to the farmers. That should have passed in 1996, the last time the farm bill was passed. 
   It was a tool that was supposed to be given to farmers at that time but it was not. 
   So at this late stage with this budget, finally we are fulfilling one more promise of the Congress in the 1996 farm bill to give farmers continuity through a longer farm program, rather than the usual 3- to 4-year farm program, and tools to manage their own decisions rather than waiting upon bureaucrats in Washington, DC, to make those decisions as to what the farmer can plant and how much of each commodity can be planted in order to qualify for the farm program. 
   Beyond that, this budget also includes $5.5 billion of additional payments for the year 2002 and beyond so we can help keep the promise to the farmers that Congress made in the 1996 farm bill that there would be a sound safety net for the farmers throughout the life of the 1996 farm bill. 
   In 1996, we projected it would cost $43 billion for the crop-years throughout the 7-year farm bill. We anticipated then a certain amount for the year 2002 as we did in 1999 and 1998. Because of the lowest crop prices in 25 years, what we projected in 1996 to be that safety net for farmers was not adequate. So in 1998 there was additional money injected late in the budget year and also at the end of the crop-year. In the year 1999, there was an additional amount of money at the end of the budget year and at the end of the crop-year. 
   Congress was expressing its commitment to the family farmer to keep a safety net and income support for farmers when there were things in the price scheme for grains beyond the control of the individual farmer. That dates strictly back to the Southeast Asia crisis when exports took a downturn and to the unpredictability of four very good crop-years, bringing the lowest level of income for farmers for 1998 and 1999 for grains, and in some cases livestock that was the lowest in 25 years. Congress then put in additional money in 1998 and 1999. 
   This budget is somewhat different. This particular budget--again I say this to compliment the Senator from New Mexico for his foresight--includes $5.5 billion because we expect the same low prices for the 2002 crop-year as we expected in 1998 and 1999. It might turn out otherwise. From everything we know now, that tends to be the situation. The compliment is not only for the $5.5 billion in this budget; it is for the foresight that is represented by having it figured in ahead of time--not at the end of the crop-year, not at the end of the budget year but at the beginning of the budget year and about the time that farmers are getting their loans lined up for this crop-year and about the time they are planting this crop-year so the farmers go into this crop-year with more certainty than they had in 1998 and 1999. The Congress would keep its commitment to make sure there was a smooth transition and that there was a sound safety net for farmers as promised in the 1996 farm bill. 
   Everyone knows the simple commonsense answer to prosperity in agriculture is the ability to export. The only way there is going to be profitability in farming is through the ability to export. When you are a farmer in the Midwest and you produce more  than one-third for domestic production, you know that the only way there will be money made, the only way there will be higher prices is if there is a worldwide demand and you are able to export. 
   We talk about a safety net and about appropriating $5.5 billion that was not anticipated when the 1996 farm bill was passed. I say that in the vein of helping farmers keep things together. It is not profitability in farming. When it comes to income of farmers, common sense dictates two sources of that income: One, public money coming through the farm program but not guaranteeing profitability or, two, from the private sector, which basically means the ability to export and to have those export markets and having our Government do what it can to promote our exports so we find foreign markets. That is where the profitability lies. That is where the American farmers want to receive their income--from the private sector and not from the public treasury. 
   However, we cannot always anticipate four good crop-years in a row to bring about an abundance of production and a downturn in prices. We cannot anticipate the Southeast Asia crisis or other things that tend to bring about a downturn. The Southeast Asia financial crisis brought a downturn in exports. That is why we have the 1996 farm bill. That is why we have the safety net we promised. That is why in this budget we are supplementing that by $5.5 billion. 
   For the taxpayers who are listening and wondering why they would be helping the family farmer, that there ought to not be more control by the individual family farm manager--that is the farmer himself, in his productivity and his ability to export--I think I have answered that question to some extent. Whether you have a drought or whether you have a massive amount of rain that will produce in overabundance, the farmer is not in control. When governments in Southeast Asia made bad judgments as to their banking industry and we had the Southeast Asia financial crisis and the economies in a downturn over there and we did not export to them, those were all things beyond the control of the individual family farmer--hence, a safety net for the family farmer and consequently some costs to the taxpayers. 
   What does a person in the city or the general taxpayer get out of this contract we have with the family farmers of America, this social contract? They surely get an abundance of food so when they go to the supermarket they don't have to worry about whether there is enough food. That is not true a lot of places outside the United States, places with malnutrition, where there are droughts and where they live from hand to mouth for a daily supply of food. 
   It used to be that in the Soviet system of agriculture, and of their command and control economy, consumers in Russia did not find their supermarket shelves stocked as well as they were in the United States of America. 
   For the consumers who think they are paying too much for their food, I suggest that as a percentage of their disposable income they are spending less on food than any consumer in any country in the world. 
   Consequently, we do have this social contract between the people of this country and the family farmers of America to maintain a safety net so there is a stability that maintains the institution of the family farm. The institution of the family farm is that entity that guarantees to the consumer of America this supply of food that is in good quantity and in good quality, at the lowest percentage of disposable income to pay for it of any consumer in the world. 
   I hope we make it clear in this budget that Senator DOMENICI has put together that we are keeping our commitment to the family farmer, making sure there is an adequate supply of money for the safety net we promised in the 1996 farm bill. 
   We are giving the consumer, the other half of this social contract, a guarantee of an adequate supply of food, good quality food at a low price, and we are also giving farmers some tools to manage their own businesses to a better extent through money for the Crop Insurance Program so, in turn, they are not subject to the whims of each Congress, whether or not we are going to appropriate the money that ought to be appropriated to meet our commitment to be an insurer of last resort--in other words, appropriating the right amount of money wherever natural disasters might happen, whether it be earthquakes in California or droughts in the middle west. 
   I hope we are not going to hear on the floor of the Senate during this budget debate that we do not have a safety net for farmers. What do our colleagues think this $5.5 billion is for or the $9 billion-some we appropriated in 1999, or the $6.5 billion additional supplement we appropriated in the crop-year 1998, in addition to the $43 billion that was in the 1996 farm bill, total for the next 7 years? If that is not a safety net, what is a safety net? 
   If somebody comes up here and says the present farm bill is not a very good farm bill, all they have to do is go back to the old farm bills that were in existence from the 1930s until 1996. We saw Congress supplementing the old farm bills because the safety net that we suspected would be needed for the ensuing years of that farm bill was not adequate. I do not want somebody to say there is a big tear in the safety net for farmers under the 1996 farm bill because there have been big tears in farm bills for previous years when Congress added funds. 
   The fact is, Congress uses the best judgment based on what climatologists and economists can give us to make our decisions about what we ought to provide in a farm bill for whatever the duration of that farm bill. This one is 7 years; previous ones have been 5, 4, and 3. But, as best as we can guess ahead when we pass that farm bill, we cannot anticipate all the exigencies that might come about in those ensuing years. So we find Congress responding to that safety net that might have a hole in it from time to time, to knit that hole in the safety net so we keep our commitment to the family farmers that we are not going to keep them hanging out there by themselves, whether because of natural disaster or political decisions made in some foreign country or even domestic political decisions made in this country or even international trade decisions that are made that are beyond the control of this Congress. Some of the exigencies are only in the hands of God. Can we anticipate all of those? No, we cannot, whether it is under a Democrat or Republican President, whether it is under a Democrat Congress or 
   a Republican Congress. We have people making judgments, when we pass a farm bill, of what are going to be the situations with weather and world economics over the next few years. We make the wisest decisions that can be made based on the information that is available. Still, sometimes we come up short. 
   I do not want to hear anything about not having a safety net for farmers, or our not keeping our commitment to American farmers for that safety net with the anticipation that this world economy is going to turn around and this oversupply that has come from 4 good crop-years--not only in the United States but worldwide, to bring about an oversupply--is not going to be with us all the time and we are going to, again, pick up our exports; we are going to, again, have somewhat normal production. The farmer is going to get that profit from the marketplace that is anticipated. 
   All we are doing in this farm bill, as we did in 1998 and 1999, is keeping our commitment that when the profitability in the marketplace is not there the Congress of the United States is going to keep its commitment--the social contract we have between the people of this country and the family farmer--that there is going to be a supply of food of a good quality, good quantity, and at a price the consumer can afford. 
   I thank the chairman of the committee for his commitment to the farmers of America I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we often hear about some of the things that are wrong with intercollegiate athletics and how they sometimes detract from the top priority of our colleges and universities, which is educating students. 
   Let me point to an example of how excellence in undergraduate education and excellence in intercollegiate athletics can go hand-in-hand, and it's from my home state of Iowa. 
   Iowa State University is experiencing one of its most successful years ever in intercollegiate athletics. 
   This year, Iowa State made history by being the first university in the Big 12 Conference or its predecessor conferences--the Big 8 and the Southwest Conferences--to win four basketball trophies in one season--both men's and women's regular season and conference tournament championships. 
   Both teams earned ISU record-high seedings in the NCAA Tournament, the men took a second seed and the women took a third and both did well in the tournament. The men advanced to the ``Elite Eight'' and the women to the ``Sweet Sixteen'' after an ``Elite Eight' appearance last year. 
   Marcus Fizer became the schools' first-ever consensus first-team All-American, and Stacy Frese and Angie Welle of the women's team were also All-America selections. Stacy Frese drew this honor for the second year in a row. 
   The Cyclone wrestling team--led by two-time NCAA champion and tournament MVP Cael Sanderson--finished second in the nation. 
   The women's gymnastics team won its first-ever Big 12 Conference Championship. 
   These are just a few of Iowa State's 450 student-athletes, young people who are getting an education while exhibiting their special athletic skills. 
   And just how are they using this opportunity? 
   Here are some examples from last year because the final stats from this year aren't in, but I'm told they will be similar--or even better. 
   Of the 450 student athletes 168, or 40 percent, made the Athletic Department's Academic Honor Roll for maintaining a ``B'' or better GPA and nearly 100 earned academic All-Big 12 recognition. 
   This year, basketball player Paul Shirley, who majors in mechanical engineering, and Stacy Frese, a finance major, are again Academic All-Americans. 
   Iowa State student-athletes also lead the Big 12 in the most important statistic--their graduation rate. 
   They are No. 1 in the Big 12 regarding their four-year graduation rates and No. 1 regarding their six-year graduation rates two of the past three reporting periods. 
   Iowa State student athletes are also No. 1 in terms of overall graduation rate for student-athletes who stay in school for their entire eligibility with 9 of out 10 student athletes getting their degree. 
   We are all very proud of the Cyclones this year for what they have done in competition, and in the classroom. I hope I have the opportunity to come to the floor and offer the same statistics and facts next year. Go Cyclones!

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a private relief bill on behalf a constituent of mine, Jose Pinales. 
   His family and friends call him Lupe, and a private relief bill is his only hope to avoid being separated from the people and the country he loves. Lupe was brought to the United States sixteen years ago, when he was two years old, by his uncle, Miguel Landeros. Mr. Landeros, now a U.S. citizen, never formally adopted Lupe. Not until recently did Lupe learn that he was not a U.S. citizen, when he tried to enlist in the United States Marines, to serve what he believed was his country. 
   The United States is the only country Lupe knows. It's the country he loves, and wishes to serve. Lupe grew up reciting the pledge of allegiance to the United States along with the rest of the children in his class at Jefferson Elementary School. He is now a Senior at Fort Madison High School in Iowa, and works part-time as he prepares to graduate this spring. This young man has almost completed a milestone in his life and has a dream of joining the United States Marines upon graduation. It wasn't until Lupe sought to fulfill this dream did he learn that not only was he not a U.S. citizen, but he was in possible danger of being forced to go to Mexico, a country where the people and customs are foreign to him. He doesn't even speak the language. 
   Faced with Lupe's plight, the generous people of Fort Madison have rallied together asking for our support in passing a private relief bill for him. My office has been inundated with letters and petitions from citizens imploring us to allow Lupe to fulfill his dream and serve our great nation and not be forced to a country he doesn't know. 
   Lupe is a fine example of what an American citizen should be. His love and respect for his country are to be admired and rewarded. So, I ask you to join me and the citizens of Iowa, and allow Jose to serve his country by supporting this legislation.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation on behalf of myself and the senior Senator from Nevada, Mr. REID, to clarify that water and sewage service laterals are included in the definition of contributions in aid of construction (CIAC). The bill clarifies current law by specifically stating that ``customer service fees'' are CIAC. It maintains current treatment of service charges for stopping and starting service (not CIAC). Because this is a clarification of current law, the effective date for the bill is as if included in the original legislation, which is section 1613(a) of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996. 
   The need for this legislation is brought about because the Department of Treasury has issued proposed regulations to provide guidance on the definition of CIAC. Despite the fact that Congress specifically removed language concerning ``customer services fees'' in its amendment in 1996, the Department added the language back into the proposed regulation specifying that such fees are not CIAC. They then defined the term very broadly to include service laterals, which traditionally and under the most common state law treatment would be considered CIAC. 
   The Senator from Nevada and I, along with many of our colleagues here in this chamber, worked hard over the course of a number of years to restore the pre-1986 Act tax treatment for water and sewage CIAC. In 1996, we succeeded in passing our legislation. It was identical to pre-1986 law with three exceptions. Two of the changes were made in response to a Treasury Department request. The third removed the language dealing with ``service connection fees'' primarily because of potential confusion resulting from the ambiguity of the term. The sponsors of the legislation were concerned that the IRS would use this ambiguity to exclude a portion of what the state regulators consider CIAC. 
   As part of our efforts, we developed a revenue raiser in cooperation with the industry to make up any revenue loss due to our legislation, including the three changes. This revenue raiser extended the life, and changed the method, for depreciating water utility property from 20 year accelerated to 25-year straight-line depreciation. As a consequence of this sacrifice by the industry, our CIAC change made a net $274 million contribution toward deficit reduction. 
   It is my belief that the final revenue estimate done by the Joint Committee on Taxation on the restoration of CIAC included all property treated as CIAC by the industry regulators including specifically service laterals. In an October 11, 1995 letter to me, the Joint Committee on Taxation provided revenue estimates for the CIAC legislation. A footnote in this letter states, ``These estimates have been revisited to reflect more recent data.'' The industry had only recently supplied the committee with comprehensive data, which reflected total CIAC in the industry including service laterals. 
   I urge my fellow Senators to join with us in supporting this clarification of current law.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation before us. I think the crop insurance legislation before us this evening is very important. It is one of the pieces of legislation that should have been passed in 1996 when we passed the current farm bill. We promised farmers we were not only going to provide a safety net for them, we were also going to do what we could to expand trade, change the tax laws so they could better manage the highs and lows associated with on-farm income, spend more money for research, and provide a crop insurance program that provided a more opportunities to managing risk. 
   We still have not passed the necessary tax legislation. We have not done all we can do to promote trade in American agricultural products. And we have not done all we can to tear down the barriers to trade around the world. There is still a lot that should have been accomplished in 1996 that has not been done, but finally we are able to add one more thing that was promised in 1996. Now 4 years later, we are finally getting it done. What I am refering to is the ability of farmers to protect themselves from natural disasters over which they have no control by insuring for the productivity that they would normally experience in a good year. 
   This legislation will provide farmers in Iowa and across the country sound risk management opportunities that were promised in 1996. As everyone involved in agriculture knows, the weather is an unavoidable risk farmers must deal with every day. The Federal Crop Insurance Program was established to protect farmers from unavoidable risks such as adverse weather, plant disease, and insect infestation. There are two ways to respond. One is through a crop insurance program that farmers can manage and make their own participation decisions. This would be their decision, not my decision. The other way is through disaster relief. The farmer has little control over whether Congress will provide, at the time of a natural disaster, some disaster relief for him. 
   In most instances, Congress has responded. But that makes the individual family farmer a pawn of Washington. His welfare is based upon decisions that Members of Congress might make, which might not provide the relief that is needed. 
   Once again, the 1996 farm bill was meant to give farmers more control over their own destiny, with the proper tools. Crop insurance is one of those proper tools. 
   The agricultural community has recently been subjected to more than just unavoidable natural disasters. My neighbors in Iowa, where my son and I have a family farm have felt the brunt of the world economic crisis and its increased foreign competition and poor trade diplomacy. These factors have led to significant reductions of farm income. 
   Just last year, it was necessary for Congress to provide $8.7 billion in additional assistance to farmers. This was only a short-term fix, not a long-term solution. But it did keep a promise to the family farmers of America that we made in 1996 when we passed a 7-year farm bill. We set aside $43 billion to meet the obligations of the safety net in that farm bill because we thought $43 billion was enough. But nobody anticipated 4 good crop years with record yields, reduced prices, and the Far East financial crisis that reduced our exports. 
   The $43 billion that was set aside for the 7 year farm bill in 1996 was not enough to meet our promise of a smooth transition for farmers and the maintenance of a safety net. Consequently, we had to provide more money. In doing so we kept our commitment to the farmers of America to provide a strong safety net. 
   With the farm economy in the tank and the price of multiple commodities hitting 20-year lows last year, many individuals have decided to lash out against the 1996 farm bill. 
   I would be the first to admit that Government policy was partly responsible for the instability within the agricultural community. But that is not the farm bill. That is a lack of wise International Monetary Fund policy regarding loans to countries whose banks went in the tank, a seemingly passive pursuit of trade opportunities for agriculture, and Congress, for that matter, not giving the President the authority to negotiate. While I have found fault in the past in our inability to pass a substantive crop insurance bill and the administration's failed efforts to open markets for our agricultural commodities, I hope this bill remedies one of those shortcomings. This legislation provides a long-term solution to the agricultural community for risk management which better mediates the unavoidable risks farmers experience. 
   The Congress can do disaster relief with the political exigencies that are involved with that or it can promote risk management. Through this legislation, we are promoting risk management, giving farmers the tools to respond to and control their destiny rather than having Congress involved in the family farmers destiny. 
   This legislation is entitled the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act. It is bipartisan. It will accomplish many of the most important goals requested by my farm constituency. 
   This has been a bipartisan cooperative effort from the beginning because those of us who understand agriculture know this is the right thing to do. Senators PAT ROBERTS and BOB KERREY wrote an excellent piece of legislation. Senator CONRAD of North Dakota and I, along with Senator ROD GRAMS and Chairman DOMENICI of the Budget Committee, worked hard 12 months ago to provide sufficient budgetary authority to fund this blue ribbon reform proposal that is now before us. 
   By adopting this legislation, we will increase the affordability of crop insurance, make the program more flexible and more responsive to changing demands, improve the public-private  partnership, provide opportunities for livestock coverage--so that livestock farmers will have the same opportunity to better 
   manage risk as crop producers have had in the past--and last, but certainly not least, equalize subsidies for revenue-based products. 
   This means a lot for my State of Iowa. Eighty-one percent of all corn and soybeans are insured in the State of Iowa; in other words, meaning 81 percent of the acreage that is planted to corn and soybeans is insured. 85 percent of the insured acres are covered by buy-up policies. And 65 percent of the insured acres in Iowa are covered by a revenue insurance product. 
   Iowa has the highest percentage of revenue coverage in the United States. This might reflect the idea that farmers in my home State of Iowa distrust Congress to respond with disaster relief more than farmers in any other State in the Nation. My farmers are taking the bull by the horns, making the independent judgment that each one of the 97,000 farmers in my State has an opportunity to make. They are managing their own risks by purchasing crop insurance and not relying upon the Congress to cover their losses. 
   This bill makes crop insurance more affordable, especially when it comes to revenue products. Iowa farmers will use the improved subsidy formula to benefit from the highest subsidy at the highest level of coverage. The higher levels of coverage will help to support family farmers in poor years and alleviate some of the need for what is becoming an annual economic relief payment. Economic relief payments will only end when we stop losing our foreign market share and increase agricultural exports for the one-third of our agricultural products that we produce beyond the necessity of domestic consumption. 
   If we do not export, we will shut down one-third of our production. By shutting down one-third of our production, we would not only be hurting farm income but obviously endangering our manufacturers. We would be manufacturing fewer John Deere tractors with fewer jobs at ``John Deeres,'' having less market for feed, for seed, fertilizer, and chemicals. There would be less income for farmers to buy products from the retail merchants of the small towns of America, and more of those small businesses in the small towns of America would go out of business. 
   When we talk about the necessity of exporting one-third of our products--because that is what we produce in excess of domestic production--we are talking not only about enhancing the income of the family farmers of America, but we are also showing the ripple effect that positive cash-flow has through the economy of rural America. We must reverse this trend to preserve small businesses and preserve numerous other enterprises in America, including the union jobs at John Deere and other farm manufacturers. 
   This program we have before us won't open new markets abroad for new commodities, but it will stabilize the potential losses my friends and neighbors could experience due to poor exports. This legislation will provide the security necessary to help farmers through lean years so they will be around to experience better prices and increased revenue in the future. 
   We have an opportunity tomorrow at 11 o'clock, when we vote on this bill, to provide the agricultural community with a tool, a very important tool to better manage the risks inherent in farming. Improving the Crop Insurance Program and ensuring that quality coverage is more affordable and better suited to the needs of farmers will only serve to provide much needed stability in rural America, not just stability among the family farms. 
   While we have more to accomplish to guarantee stability for the family farmer, this is a very important first step, a step that should have been accomplished in 1996 but wasn't. In so doing, it would have provided the farm bill more of the safety net as we promised. Today we are taking an important additional step. I appreciate the opportunity of fulfilling some of the unfulfilled promises made in 1996, to make the 1996 farm bill the landmark measure it was meant to be. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators KENNEDY, JEFFORDS and HARKIN in introducing the Family Opportunity Act of 2000. This new legislation will make life easier for many families and their children. 
   When you're a parent, your main objective is to provide for your child to the best of your ability. If it takes a 12-hour day in the field or in the factory, that's what you do. Our federal government takes this goal and turns it upside down for parents of children with special health care needs. 
   The government forces these parents to choose between family income and their children's health care. That's a terrible choice. Families must have a low income to qualify their children for both Medicaid and federal disability benefits. This means parents often refuse jobs, pay raises and overtime just to preserve access to Medicaid for their child with disabilities. 
   Families have to remain in poverty just to keep Medicaid. 
   Obviously this affects entire families, not just the child with the health care needs. Melissa Arnold, an Iowan, has a 17-year-old son who can't work even part-time for fear of jeopardizing his brother's Medicaid coverage. Ms. Arnold has accepted several promotions without the pay raises she's earned. Despite these challenges, this family has stayed together. 
   In the worst cases, parents give up custody of their child with special health care needs or put their child in an out-of-home placement just to keep their child's access to Medicaid-covered services. Why is Medicaid so desirable? It's critical to the well-being of children with multiple medical needs. It covers a lot of services that these children need, such as physical therapy and medical equipment. 
   Private health plans often are much more limited in what they cover. Many parents can't afford needed services out-of-pocket. Today, my colleagues and I will introduce legislation to fix the Catch-22 for parents of children with disabilities. 
   Our bill, the Family Opportunity Act of 2000, creates a state option to allow working parents who have a child with a disability to keep working and to still have access to Medicaid for their child. Parents would pay for Medicaid coverage on a sliding scale. No one would have to become impoverished or stay impoverished to secure Medicaid for a child. 
   Our bill also establishes family-to-family health information centers. These centers would be staffed by actual parents of children with special needs as well as professionals. They would provide information to families trying to arrange health services for their children. 
   The Family Opportunity Act of 2000 is modeled after last year's successful Work Incentives Improvement Act. Under that law, adults with disabilities can return to work and not risk losing their health care coverage. Parents of children with disabilities should have the same opportunities as adults with disabilities. 
   Everybody wants to use their talents to the fullest potential, and every parent wants to provide as much as possible for his or her children. The government shouldn't get in the way.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation being discussed today to be more fair to our senior citizens, to encourage them to work. I hope final passage will be voted on tomorrow. 
   I always like to follow the Senator from Florida because it gives me an opportunity to thank him for the cooperation he has given me in our work on some of the other legs of the retirement income stool. We think of Social Security as one of those, another is savings, and the other one is pensions. He and I have worked closely together in a bipartisan way to formulate pension legislation to encourage savings, to encourage employers to have established pension systems, and particularly to encourage the self-employed and smaller corporations to set up pension systems. So I thank him for that. 
   This legislation might not be considered part of the three-legged stool we always talk about of income security for retirement--Social Security, pensions, and private savings--but it is an opportunity for people who want to work, to work without penalty. That obviously is a very strong component, and heretofore there has been a disincentive to that activity. This eliminates that disincentive. 
   If I could sum up, I see at least two perspectives to this legislation. 
   One, as a matter of public policy in America, we should not have disincentives to productivity. Obviously, when you earn over a certain amount of money as a senior citizen drawing Social Security and you have to pay back $1 out of every $3, that is a disincentive to work. We ought to eliminate that disincentive. 
   A second factor is to judge people in American society on the basis of their competence and their merit and not on the basis of some arbitrary age, based on a policy that was thought good for the 1930s. Today we would not think it was good even for the 1930s. It does not  consider people's competence because the policy that was set up 65 years ago was, when you got to be 65, you were shoved out into the street to make room for younger people to come into the workforce. That was wrong. 
   The third thing about this legislation is the high rate of taxation. People who earn over this amount of money have to pay back $1 out of every $3 they earn over a certain amount. That is a very high marginal tax rate, maybe the highest marginal tax rate of any American. 
   Consider, if you earn over $17,000, you pay back $1 out of every $3. Consider also that you are already reporting, if you are earning over a certain income, 85 percent of your Social Security to be taxed a second time. It was taxed when you earned it in your working years; then consider that you pay income tax; then, last, you pay the same payroll tax everybody else pays. You can get such high marginal tax rates that it is almost a laugh to call it taxation. You should call it confiscation. Confiscation of resources in our system of government is not legitimate. It is a disincentive to productivity. 
   At a time in our Nation's history when we are experiencing unprecedented prosperity, we are also experiencing a shortage of experienced labor. The national unemployment rate is 4.1 percent, the lowest level in 30 years. In my home State of Iowa, it is even lower. Iowa's unemployment rate is 2.2 percent. The legislation we are debating would help alleviate some of the skilled labor shortage by removing a disincentive for older Americans to remain in the workforce if they, of their own free will, want to stay in the workforce. 
   The bill before us would eliminate the cap on earnings for Social Security beneficiaries between the ages of 65 and 69. Under current law, those beneficiaries have their benefits cut by $1 for every $3 they earn over that $17,000. I have already referred to that. 
   This benefit cut applies, of course, only to earned income. An individual could still have savings, or income from pensions, totaling any amount and continue to collect full Social Security benefits. The difference between earned and so-called unearned income does not detract from the injustice of the current Social Security and tax policy. That is why this law must be repealed. It sends a wrong message that productivity among our older citizens should be discouraged. 
   I would like to give some examples of people from whom I have heard in my own State who are hurt by this earnings limit. 
   A person by the name of Delaine Jones is working in Glenwood, IA. He is 65 years old. He understands he may live for another couple of decades and may not always be able to work. He would like to earn as much as he can while he is able to, so he can financially prepare for a high quality of life later in his life. 
   Then we have Sherman and Nancy Sorem of Marshalltown, IA. They were affected by the earnings limit last year. 
   Sherman worked for 35 years for Fisher Controls, a major corporation in Marshalltown, IA. When that corporation downsized, he retired from his position as office manager of the accounting department. However, because of his expertise, he was called back each year to help out and to advise and consult with the department. 
   Last year, Fisher Controls needed his expertise for a longer period of time than ever before. Unfortunately, Mr. Sorem could not continue working because he would have worked long enough to earn above the earnings limit. He and Nancy were frustrated. He could not justify losing his Social Security benefits by his continued work. 
   Ron Ballinger, a third person I have heard from, works for a financial processing company in Cedar Rapids, IA. He worked full time last year and was interested in working part time this year. However, he will have to officially retire in April because he will have earned up to the cap on earnings. 
   According to the Social Security Administration, almost 800,000 older Americans nationwide have their benefits cut because of the earnings limit. Mr. President, 800,000 people face the same issue as the three Iowans to whom I have referred. Keep in mind, that statistic does not reveal anything about how many of our older citizens do not remain in or go back to the workforce at all because they cannot afford a cut in benefits. 
   I have received letters and phone calls from all over Iowa and all over the country because in my position as chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, they write to me about their concerns even though I am not their Senator. These letters and phone calls are from older people discouraged by the earnings limit. 
   Their hard-earned Social Security benefits are cut by $1 for every $3 they earn. They see it as a tax on their continued productivity. I see it as unfair and, if I might say, even un-American. This very country of ours, particularly at this time of low unemployment, and particularly when you consider the globalization of our economy, needs skilled labor, skilled workers, people who are skilled because of a lifetime of work in a certain profession. 
   What happens if we do not fill that skilled labor void? We lose productivity. Then we lose our global competitive edge. Where can we look for skilled labor? We have qualified people who want to work, our older citizens. We cannot afford to lose their expertise and skills. 
   A letter I received from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce states:  
   American business is facing a severe worker shortage in many sectors and areas of the country. Jobs are going unfilled, especially those positions that require skilled workers. By removing the disincentive to work, this legislation allows seniors to apply their lifetime of valuable knowledge and experience to the business world and fill some of these positions.  
   Recognizing the need to encourage seniors to remain in the workforce is not a new idea. In fact, a report on Future Directions for Aging Policy was published in May of 1980 by the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aging, the Subcommittee on Human Services. At that time, I happened to serve as ranking Republican on that subcommittee when I was a Member of the other body. 
   I would like to read from the Future Directions for Aging Policy from 21 years ago. I refer to page 3 of the report summary:  
   At the base of such a service approach must lie an economic strategy. We have sketched such an economic base in Appendix 5. It is designed to coalesce around work and income. Tomorrow's seniors will want to work (trends toward early retirement are already reversing according to a recent Lou Harris poll), will be capable of working, and will need to work.  
   I remind you, this was 20 years ago that Congress said this.  
   Inflation's effect on fixed incomes will see to that. Public policy will have to create opportunities to work, both by removing barriers of age discrimination and by stimulating private sector employment of seniors. Moreover, income earned will have to be preserved for much longer than ever before, necessitating major reforms of America's pension systems.  
   That is something I have referred to that the Senator from Florida and I have been working on, as well.  
   Social Security and Supplemental Security Income, because these are the backbone of our present economic strategy, will probably have to be restructured in the future.  
   I think we have known for a long time that what we are finally about to do must be done. I am glad it is being done. The earnings test, enacted as part of the original Social Security Act passed in 1935, is outdated. 
   Sixty years ago, our country was in the midst of a depression. One in five people eligible to work was unemployed. The original law meant to discourage older Americans who were eligible to collect benefits from taking jobs younger people could fill. But that situation has changed--as unjustified as it was at the time--so our public policy today needs to be changed. 
   Because of my position as chairman of the Aging Committee, more acutely than others, I recognize the changing role of senior citizens in our society. This generation of older Americans has different responsibilities than past generations. We have seen a sharp rise in the number of grandparents who are raising their grandchildren. Furthermore, it is far more common for people to live into their eighties and nineties. Some of these very old Americans depend on their children who are often in their sixties to help care for them and pay for their at-home expenses, medical bills, groceries, and a host of other  expenses. Eliminating the Social Security earnings limit will help raise the standard of living for these families. 
   While fixing this inequity in the retirement system will give fair treatment to those ages 65 to 69 who have paid into the program during their working years, I do not stand here and say that it is going to address Social Security's long-term demographic challenges. 
   When the baby boom generation comes on board, the revenue and benefit structure will not be able to sustain the obligations under current law. That is why I have worked with six of my Senate colleagues--Senators JUDD GREGG, BOB KERREY, JOHN BREAUX, FRED THOMPSON, CRAIG THOMAS, and CHUCK ROBB--to craft bipartisan Senate reform legislation. 
   Our bill, the Bipartisan Social Security Act, which happens to be S. 1383, is the only reform legislation which has been put forth in the Senate which would make the Social Security trust fund permanently solvent--meaning, as you have to look out 75 years, under existing law, to project its solvency, our legislation has been declared to accomplish that by the General Accounting Office. In fact, it is the only one before the Congress that does that. 
   I will continue to press ahead and work to build a consensus among our colleagues to save Social Security and achieve long-term solvency for generations to come. 
   We, as a Congress, must recognize that even in this era of surpluses--meaning budget surpluses--there are serious long-term financial problems facing Social Security. These problems do not go away because we have a surplus and a good economy. The longer we wait to address reform of Social Security, the more difficult the problems will be to address, and the less time the baby boom generation will have to prepare. 
   As a nation, we have an evolving definition of what it means to be old. Americans are living longer and in better health. The traditional retirement age comes too soon for older people who want to or need to work past age 65. Some people want to retire; some people want to leave the workforce. Obviously, this legislation does not affect that decision of theirs. They can still do it. But if you want to contribute, if you want to remain productive, if you want to be in the workforce, by golly, through this legislation, we say we would love to have you do that. We remove economic disincentives to your doing that that are presently in the law. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise today to commend Tunisia on its 44 years of independence and to congratulate the people of Tunisia on their many successful endeavors. 
   In 1997, Tunisia and the United States celebrated the bicentennial of the ``Treaty of Peace and Friendship.'' This celebration marked the longest unbroken friendship treaty in the history of the two countries. Throughout our long relationship, the United States and Tunisia have experienced cooperation based upon respect and mutual commitment to freedom, democracy, and the peaceful resolution of conflict. 
   Tunisia has been a leader in promoting stability and peace in Africa and the Middle East. It was the first Arab state to host an Israeli delegation and hold a multilateral meeting promoting peace. In 1996, Tunisia and Israel opened interest sections in each country and established full diplomatic relations. 
   In addition to supporting peace in the Middle East, Tunisia has made impressive economic strides. The people of Tunisia enjoy a high standard of living, and the country has successfully graduated from development assistance  to self-sufficiency. These improvements have come about through the devotion of vital resources to the promotion of its people, education, and economic reform. Tunisia's market-oriented economy has flourished under increasingly privatized companies. And, Tunisia's membership in the World Trade Organization is indicative of its willingness to engage the world and maintain involvement with other nations. 
   Tunisia has been a friend and ally to the United States for many years. I look forward to continued cooperation and friendship in the years to come. As Tunisia celebrates its 44th Anniversary of Independence, I offer my sincere congratulations on their many successful accomplishments.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as most of my colleagues know, agriculture is one of the most crucial industries to my State, Iowa. The small, independent family farmer is a common thread running throughout the cultural, economic and social fabric of my State. I firmly believe that if that thread is pulled, the entire fabric of Iowa could come unraveled. 
   All my life I have lived and worked on a farm. I recognize that Iowa and the world are changing and that agriculture cannot stagnate and stay the same decade after decade. If we are to continue to survive and thrive into the 21st century, Iowa must diversify and adapt. But the best way to do that is not by throwing away the past and the present. The best way to prepare for the future is to build on the best of our heritage. And the family farmer is one of the best things about Iowa's heritage. I am committed to preserving and supporting this valuable member of Iowa's communities. 
   Any farmer knows that agriculture is a risky business. If you are going to be a farmer, you had better be prepared for ups and downs. But farmers feel more vulnerable now than at just about any time I can recall and with good reason. 
   We all know there's been a so-called ``merger-mania'' going on throughout our nation's economy. Large corporations are joining forces with other large corporations to form new business giants in every sector of the economy and agriculture is no exception. 
   In the last couple of years, the AG industry has seen a significant number of multi-million and multi-billion dollar mergers affecting grain and livestock. In the face of all these mergers and new alliances, the independent producer farming a thousand acres or less, sees himself getting smaller and smaller in comparison to many of his competitors. He sees himself having fewer and fewer choices of who to buy from and sell to. Yet, those farmers know, as I do, that the independent farmer is one of the most efficient businessmen in our nation's economy. That's why the United States can feed itself and a good portion of the world. So long as  the market place is fair and open, the family farmer can compete. 
   I am not suggesting that all mergers are in and of themselves wrong or unfair to family farmers. Businesses may be in situations where their survival and success is dependent on joining forces with another. That right is a fundamental principle of a capitalist system and has to be preserved. Indeed, I believe that farmers do not need to be protected from the marketplace. But I believe we should protect their access to the marketplace. 
   That is why I will be introducing legislation to guarantee greater openness and accountability to the merger review process as it pertains to agri-business. 
   My bill will give USDA, the Federal department with the background and expertise in agriculture, a more prominent role in assessing AG mergers. Furthermore, my bill will provide a much-needed balance in the focus of AG merger reviews. 
   Currently, when the Department of Justice assesses a proposed merger, their focus is weighted towards the impact a merger would have on consumers. No one, certainly not I, would argue against ensuring that a merger does not harm consumers. However, given the fact that AG mergers, more so than other kinds of mergers, impact a way of life, not just an industry, it is critical that we give equal importance to the effect these mergers have on producers. 
   My bill will do just that by requiring USDA to do an assessment of how a proposed corporate union will affect producers and their access to the market. My bill will keep DOJ in the driver's seat on mergers, but will make the expertise and knowledge of USDA a prominent part of the merger review record. 
   I am aware other proposals reforming the agri-business merger review process are being crafted. I am certainly willing to consider all suggested reforms. Nonetheless, I believe my bill is strong and balanced in several respects. As I mentioned, my bill provides a heightened role for USDA in the merger review process, giving producers a seat at the table when mergers and acquisitions are being reviewed by DOJ or FTC. 
   In addition, I would like to highlight the following provisions in my bill. 
   There is a requirement that USDA do a merger review that focuses on the needs of producers and whether the transaction would cause substantial harm to farmers' ability to compete in the marketplace. This review will be conducted simultaneously with the Hart-Scott-Rodino review now done by DOJ. There is no disruption in the current DOJ/FTC merger review process. My legislation allows for negotiations between USDA and the parties to a proposed merger in order to work out any concerns USDA has. 
   Under my bill, if USDA's concerns are not satisfied, USDA may challenge the merger in court to either stop the merger or impose conditions on the transaction. 
   Furthermore, this measure calls for the creation of a special counsel in USDA for competition matters, which is subject to Senate consideration. My bill provides money for additional staff at USDA and DOJ. 
   This measure also prohibits the enforcement of confidentiality clauses in livestock production contracts that prevent producers from getting the advice they need to make business decisions in their best interests. 
   My bill provides contract poultry growers the same protections under GIPSA that other livestock producers have. 
   Finally, under my bill, the competition protection authorities of USDA's packers and stockyards division is extended to include anticompetitive practices by dealers, processors and commission merchants of all AG commodities. 
   Several components of this bill are based on proposals by the American Farm Bureau, the largest organization representing producers of all commodities. 
   I believe that bringing to the table a greater understanding of AG producers' needs when examining AG mergers is the biggest missing element to make the merger review process as fair as possible. Closing this gap is the heart of my proposal. 
   I realize that DOJ currently has consultations with USDA on AG mergers. But I believe the current process is not consistent or open enough to assure producers' their concerns are adequately addressed. 
   The approach I advocate will ensure that producers' concerns and needs are fully discussed when Federal agencies examine proposed AG business mergers. By guaranteeing inclusion and openness for small, independent producers, we can go a long way toward alleviating their understandable anxiety. 
   As my colleagues from rural states know, AG concentration is one of the most important issues in agriculture today. It is imperative that we make meaningful progress on this issue before this Congress adjourns. As I stated earlier, I am aware of other efforts, principally by Senator DASCHLE and Senator LEAHY, to craft a legislative response to the recent wave of AG mergers. 
   I commend them for their hard work and I appreciate their efforts to keep me informed of their progress. I did not feel I could offer my unreserved endorsement of the proposal they have crafted thus far and I have chosen to introduce my own bill. 
   However, I believe our proposals are close enough in scope, direction and intent that we can achieve a bipartisan compromise sooner rather than later. I want it to be clearly understood that it is my desire to work with Members from both sides of the aisle to calm farmers' fears about high levels of AG concentration. 
   I am certain Congress will need to take additional steps to secure the freedom of small producers to compete in the marketplace. 
   But my bill will assure that when AG mergers are given the necessary review, the small, independent family farmer who I am proud to serve, will not be left out. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in holding the door open for farmers across the country and I ask for the support of all those who want to preserve the best of our Nation's agriculture heritage and ensure the superiority of U.S. Agriculture for decades to come.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, long-term tax credits may seem like a dull topic. But the expenses of caring for an ailing family member are shocking. Millions of people bear these expenses every day, without any help. 
   Here's a typical example: A state legislator from Ohio named Barbara Boyd testified before my Special Committee on Aging last year. Ms. Boyd cared at home for her mother who had Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer. Her mother had $20,000 in savings and a monthly Social Security check. That went quickly. Prescription drugs alone ran $400 a month. 
   Antibiotics, ointments to prevent skin breakdown, incontinence supplies and other expenses cost hundreds of dollars a month. Ms. Boyd exhausted her own savings to care for her mother, and exhausted herself. She isn't complaining. Family caregivers don't complain. But we can and should use the tax code to ease their burden. 
   Yesterday a bipartisan group of legislators, and two prominent groups--AARP and the Health Insurance Association of America, announced a consensus agreement on a legislative package to help people with a variety of long-term care needs. Our bill contains a tax deduction to encourage individuals to buy long-term care insurance. We want to help people to prepare for their health needs in retirement.  
   The bill also contains a $3,000 tax credit for family caregivers caring for a disabled relative at home. Under this legislation, Ms. Boyd's mother could have purchased long-term care insurance long before she developed Alzheimer's. In addition, Ms. Boyd could have used the tax credit to help with the costs of the medications and medical supplies for her mother. 
   I'm pleased that we have so much agreement in Washington about helping people with long-term care expenses. The legislators sponsoring this legislation have pushed for long-term care relief for years. Today, my colleagues and I will introduce this bill. We'll work to get it passed into law as soon as possible. An aging nation has no time to waste in preparing for long-term care. Family caregivers need immediate relief from their expensive and exhausting work. 
   Joining me in introducing this bill is Senator BOB GRAHAM of Florida, Representative NANCY JOHNSON, and Representative KAREN THURMAN.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my Illinois colleague, Senator FITZGERALD, as a cosponsor of his legislation banning MTBE. MTBE contaminates water, and it has been found in water throughout the United States. 
   With every day that passes, more water is being contaminated. Oddly enough, we have passed a clean air bill to clean up the air, and the oil companies have used a product to meet the requirements of the clean air bill that contaminates the water. 
   But there is an additive to the gasoline that will clean up the air as well as not contaminate the water. I will talk about that in just a minute. 
   It is simple: With every day that passes, more water is being contaminated. 
   Last August, the Senate soundly passed a resolution that I cosponsored with Senator BOXER of California calling for an MTBE ban. 
   In the face of damaging, irresponsible action by the Clinton administration, it is time we put some force to our Senate position. How long must Americans suffer this dilatory charade by President Clinton's administration, also by  the petroleum industry, and particularly by California officials? I say California officials because they have asked that the Clean Air Act of 1990 be gutted. 
   I have intentionally held my fire until after the California primary because I would not want anyone to misconstrue my motives in an attempt to undermine Vice President GORE'S political ambitions. But today I think it is time to say it as it really is: President Clinton, Vice President GORE, and the Environmental Protection Agency's Administrator, Carol Browner, have been dragging their feet--and dragging their feet too long. 
   They gave the oil and the MTBE industry everything they wanted. At the request of big oil, they threw out regulations proposed by President Bush which would have, by some estimates, tripled and even quadrupled ethanol production. This was done on the first day of the Clinton administration. 
   Instead, when they finally got around to putting some rules out, the administration approved regulations that guaranteed a virtual MTBE monopoly in the reformulated gasoline market. 
   This decision by the Clinton administration, way back then in the early part of the administration, opened wide the door for petroleum companies to use MTBE and thus contaminate our water. 
   With egg on its face, with an environmental disaster on its hands, the Clinton administration continues to delay and also duck its leadership responsibilities. 
   A replacement for MTBE exists today, but most oil companies refuse to use it. The Environmental Protection Agency's Director, Carol Browner, has been told time and time again, in every imaginable way possible, how MTBE can be replaced, and in California totally replaced this very day. 
   But she, as other Clinton-Gore officials, always seems to come up with some sort of excuse, a reason for delay, some other hurdle. 
   Last week, as the congressional delegation met with our Governor from Iowa, we were told that Carol Browner asked for more information on this subject about the supply of an alternative to MTBE--which is ethanol--that she needed more information. It happens to be information that the 
   Environmental Protection Agency already has. 
   The new hurdle she is creating is the question: Is there enough of this alternative, ethanol? You might ask: Enough for what? To replace all MTBE today or tomorrow? That is kind of insulting. It is also incredible. 
   I want to illustrate how it is insulting and incredible with this point. Imagine the following: You have a brush fire sweeping to the city's edge, devouring home after home. Panicked citizens call 911, but the fire engines remain silent. The home owners scream to the fire department: Why won't you come to our rescue? The fire chief says: We don't have enough water to save the whole city, and until we can save all, we will save none. 
   It is absurd. Of course it is. Yet an equally absurd and dangerous line has been drawn by most California big oil companies and their political apologists. In the face of the largest environmental crisis of this generation--which is the contamination of water by the petroleum companies' controlled product, MTBE--Californians are being held hostage, forced to buy water-contaminating, MTBE-laced gasoline, even though a superior MTBE replacement is available, and available this very day--not tomorrow, not next year, but today. 
   California Governor Davis' so-called ``ban'' allows MTBE to be sold ``full bore, business-as-usual'' until the end of the year 2002. 
   Worse yet, California legislators dropped the deadline altogether. But why the wait? Well, we are told there is not enough of this MTBE alternative and thus the illogical decree imposed: No MTBE will be removed until all MTBE is removed. And with every day that passes, more of our water is contaminated. Think of this: A mere teacup of MTBE renders undrinkable 5 million gallons of water. CBS's ``60 Minutes,'' referred to by my colleague from Illinois, reported California has already identified 10,000 ground water sites contaminated by MTBE and that ``one internal study conducted by Chevron found that MTBE has contaminated ground water at 80 percent of the 400 sites that the company tested.'' 
   Yet big oil holds you hostage, forcing you to buy MTBE-laced gasoline until either the Clinton-Gore administration or Congress guts one of the most successful Clean Air Act programs, the reformulated gasoline oxygenate requirement. So big oil is hoping that gullible bureaucrats and politicians conclude that MTBE is not the real problem but, instead, the real problem happens to be the oxygenate provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act. Get rid of the oxygenate requirement and, presto, MTBE disappears. 
   People in my State are not buying that line. Iowa has no oxygenate requirement. Yet MTBE has been found in 29 percent of our water supplies tested. Let it be clear, let there be absolutely no misunderstanding: Iowa's water and the water in every Senator's State was contaminated by a product that big oil added to their gasoline, and it was not contaminated by the Clear Air Act. Big oil did everything it could to persuade Clinton-Gore appointees and judges in our courts to guarantee 
   that MTBE monopolized the Clean Air Act's oxygenate market. 
   Our colleagues need to understand that nearly 500 million gallons of MTBE are sold every year throughout the United States, not to meet the oxygenate requirements of the Clean Air Act that I have been talking about up to this point, but as an octane enhancer in markets all over the United States where the oxygenate requirements under the Clean Air Act to clean up the smog don't even apply. 
   So your water is in danger whether you live in a city that has to meet the oxygenate requirements of the 1990 Clean Air Act or not because big oil uses the poison MTBE as an octane enhancer lots of places. So that gets us to a point where they want us to believe that changing the 1990 Clean Air Act is the solution to all the problems. I ask, how will gutting the Clean Air Act's oxygenate requirements protect the rest of America's water, if most gallons of gasoline have MTBE in them for octane enhancement outside the Clean Air Act? Well, that answer is pretty simple. It is not going to clean it up until we get rid of all MTBE. We need to, then, ban MTBE, which this bill we are introducing today does, not ban the Clean Air Act, or at least not gut it by eliminating the oxygenate requirements of it, which big oil says is the solution to our problem. 
   Then we get to what is the superior MTBE replacement that is available today. My colleagues don't have to wait for me to tell them what my answer is to that, but I will. It is ethanol, which is nothing more than grain alcohol. Let's get that clear. We are talking about MTBE, a poisonous product, poisoning the water in California, where the oxygenate requirements are, but also in the rest of the country where it is used as an octane enhancer, and grain alcohol on the other hand that you can drink. Ethanol can be made from other things as well. It can be made from California rice straw. It can be made from Idaho potato waste. It can be made from Florida sugarcane, North Dakota sugar beets, New York municipal waste, Washington wood and paper waste, and a host of other biodegradable waste products. Ethanol is not only good for your air, but if it did get into your water, your only big decision would be whether to add some ice and tonic before you drink it. 
   As my colleagues know, I am a teetotaler, so I am not going to pretend to advise you on the proper cocktail mixes. Today there is enough ethanol in storage and from what can be produced from idle ethanol facilities to displace all of the MTBE California uses in a whole year. It is available today not tomorrow, not the year 2002. And more facilities to produce it are in the works. 
   But big oil proclaims there is not enough ethanol. Translation, as far as I can tell: We, as big oil, don't control ethanol; farmers control it. So we don't want to use it. 
   They argue that ethanol is too difficult to transport. Translation: We would rather import Middle East MTBE from halfway across the world than transport ethanol from the Midwest of our great country. Big oil whines: Keeping the oxygenate requirement will give ethanol a monopoly. This is a whale of a tale, and it is kind  of hard to translate into sensible English. Since it takes half as much ethanol as MTBE to produce a gallon of reformulated gasoline, big oil will reap a 6.2-percent increase in the amount of plain gasoline used in reformulated gasoline. So how in the world does boosting by a whopping 6.2 percent gasoline's share of the reformulated gasoline market 
   constitute a monopoly for ethanol? That issue has been raised with Senators on the environmental committee. 
   Currently, MTBE constitutes 3 percent of our total transportation fuel market. Ethanol, if it replaces all MTBE, would, therefore, gain a 1.5-percent share. Think about that. A 1.5-percent market share, if it is ethanol, is defined as a monopoly share. But a 3-percent market share, if it is MTBE, is not a monopoly. 
   I think it is pretty simple to get it because the translation of this big oil babble is this: Market share, as small as 1.5 percent, if not controlled by big oil, shall henceforth be legally defined as a monopoly. Market share at any level, 3 percent to 100 percent, if it is controlled by big oil, shall never be defined as a monopoly. It is such a bizarre proposition that a mere 1.5 percent of market equals a monopoly. 
   Big oil claims ethanol is too expensive. Let me translate that for you: We prefer--meaning oil--our cozy relationship with OPEC that allows us to price gouge Americans rather than sell at half the price an oxygenate controlled by American farmers and ethanol producers. 
   I hope you caught that. If not, you ought to brace yourself, sit down with your cup of coffee, get anything dangerous out of your hands. The March 7, 2000, west coast spot wholesale price for gasoline was $1.27 per gallon. MTBE sold for just over $1.17 per gallon, 10 cents less. But ethanol came right in at the same price, $1.17 a gallon. Now, remember, it takes twice as much MTBE as it does ethanol to meet the Clean Air Act's oxygenate requirement. In other words, at the March 7 prices, oxygenates made from ethanol cost petroleum marketers half as much as the oxygenate made from their product, MTBE. 
   So even though big oil has at its disposal an oxygenated alternate to MTBE, which costs half as much, and that will protect our water supplies, big oil, with the help of the Clinton administration, continues to hold hostage the people of California and other Americans who are forced to use MTBE. 
   Last summer, I asked President Clinton to announce that he would deny California's request to waive the oxygenate requirement. I asked him to announce that he would veto any legislation that would provide for such a waiver. I have heard nothing on this subject. No answer to my letter has come from the President. His silence, and that of Vice President Gore and the rest of the administration, is very deafening. 
   American farmers are suffering the worst prices in about 23 to 25 years. If farmers are allowed to replace MTBE with ethanol, farm income will jump $1 billion per year. But, no, increasing farm income through the marketplace, both domestic and foreign, seems to be of no interest to the Clinton-Gore administration, considering their unwillingness to act and make these public statements that would send a clear signal, as far as this consideration is concerned, that MTBE's days of 
   poisoning the water are over, replacing that with something that is safe, something that will help the farmers, and something that will send a clear signal to OPEC that we are done with our days being dependent upon them for our oil supplies and our energy. 
   In the process of doing that, they would help clean up our environment as well. But that doesn't seem to be of any concern to this administration either when it comes to MTBE. It seems, unfortunately, that the only thing on the collective mind of this administration is the Vice President running for President, his legacy, his partisan politics; everybody's eyes are on the next election. 
   So I repeat, MTBE is the problem, not the Clean Air Act, as the big oil companies want us to believe. The answer to all this is so simple and clear: 
   As our bill does, ban MTBE, but don't gut the Clean Air Act's oxygenate requirement. 
   Let America's farmers fill this void with ethanol, and let them fill it today. 
   It will boost farm income by $1 billion per year and help lessen our reliance upon foreign oil, and it will not keep us at the whims of OPEC quite so much. 
   It will keep our air clean, and it will protect our water supplies. 
   So all of those things sound good, don't they? Ethanol. It is that simple. It is good, good, good. I might be wasting my breath, but I will make this plea one more time. It is the same plea I made in a letter to the President last June or July, which was: President Clinton, reject the waiver request today and declare that you will veto any legislation that would allow a waiver of the oxygenate requirements of the 1990 Clean Air Act. I assure you, Mr. President, if you do that, the water-polluting MTBE will be replaced as fast as our farmers can deliver the ethanol, and that is pretty darned swift. Do it today, President Clinton. Please do it today. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the conference report before us has been a long time in the making. It is a comprehensive bill that successfully addresses many important aviation issues. Not the least of these is the eventual elimination of the so-called slot rules at three of our nation's airports, O'Hare, Kennedy and LaGuardia. It also adds additional slots at Reagan Washington National Airport. I support these measures. 
   I congratulate Senator MCCAIN, the Senate Commerce Committee Chairman, Senator GORTON, the Aviation Subcommittee Chairman, Senator HOLLINGS, the full committee ranking member, and Senator ROCKEFELLER, the subcommittee ranking member, for their efforts to bring about good public policy. This has not been an easy conference, and all of you have put forth a tremendous effort to see that it was concluded successfully. I wish to also thank their staffs. 
   I also express my thanks and admiration to my good friend, Senator DOMENICI, our Budget Committee chairman. Of all the issues before the conference, the resolution of the budget issues was the most trying and complex. Senator DOMENICI and his staff worked tirelessly to seek a fair and adequate solution to this problem. 
   I express my admiration for my friend and colleague, Senator STEVENS, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Senator STEVENS has played a key role in reaching an agreement on spending. 
   The phase-out of the slot rule at O'Hare and LaGuardia will open a new era in aviation. Because it is a phase-out and not an immediate termination, that era should also give smaller airports a better chance for a piece of the economic pie at the national and international levels. 
   While e-commerce may be all the rage currently, people still need to travel for business purposes. Direct human contact is still the premium way to do business, and air travel is the fastest way to accomplish that over long distances and tight time frames. 
   This compromise follows the direction which my Iowa colleague, Senator HARKIN, and I set forth early in the debate on the slot rule. We looked at the needs of the airports in Iowa, and came to the conclusion together that it was time for a change if our State was to maintain its economic momentum in the national and international marketplace. Iowa does not have a major hub airport that guarantees low-cost or frequent flights. Like most States, we have smaller airports that are greatly affected by the traffic into and out of the major hub airports. In this case those airports are O'Hare and LaGuardia. 
   Our solution was to phase out the slot rule. The first step was to immediately give increased access to the hub airports by turboprop aircraft and regional jets. These are the aircraft that primarily serve our smaller airports. Giving them time before the slot rule is lifted for large airport-to-large airport competition should give the smaller airports time to establish the economic and market base needed to justify service. Otherwise, we would only see increased flights between major cities, to the exclusion of smaller airports. 
   We received the support of a large number of Senators who were also concerned about the future of their small hub and nonhub airports. Together, all of us have been able to accomplish what was unthinkable just several years ago, the eventual elimination of the slot rule at those two airports. I deeply appreciate their faith and support to accomplish this. 
   I also thank President Clinton for having the foresight and courage to recommend the elimination of the slot rule at these airports. He gave a legitimacy and momentum to the debate that would not have existed otherwise. 
   The States attorneys general, lead by Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, also played a significant part and should be thanked. 
   Not everyone is entirely happy with the compromise solution in this conference report. I look upon that as ratification that it must be a pretty good compromise. I truly feel that the airlines were treated as fairly and equally as possible. 
   Our Nation's airports will be receiving additional funds for their capital needs under this legislation. I know that these funds are much needed and will be put to good use. Iowa's airports have rehabilitation and expansion plans that will be enhanced by these additional funds. This includes increased disbursements from the Airports and Airways Trust Fund and the increase in the passenger facility charge, PFC. It is important to note that the PFC will not increase at an airport until local authorities have approved an increase. It is entirely within their realm to grant or deny this increase at the local level. 
   However, I must again warn the Federal Aviation Administration that more money will not cure all of the problems facing the FAA and the aviation industry. Fundamental reform of the way the FAA does business and on a cultural level is necessary if we are to truly make the advances which are needed. 
   As a budget conferee, I believe the budget compromise is the best we can do at this time. I shall work with Chairman DOMENICI to secure the necessary funds through the budget process. 
   The biggest disappoint to me is the inclusion of a civil fine against airline employee whistle-blowers. While I am very pleased that whistle-blower protection has been extended to the aviation industry, I feel that it is flawed due to the civil penalty. Such a penalty does not exist in other whistle-blower statutes. I will work to correct this situation. 
   Whistle-blower protection adds another, much needed, layer of protection for the traveling public using our Nation's air transportation system. I am pleased to have worked with the Association of Flight Attendants AFL-CIO on this important, ground breaking legislation. They have worked tirelessly on this provision, and I know they will continue to work with me to correct this flaw. I call upon the airlines to do the same and seek the help of the public, also. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for this conference report.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, there are a number of misconceptions about the upcoming vote in the Senate to grant China permanent normal trading relations or, as we often call it, PNTR. I will refer to it as normal trading relations. 
   Today, as chairman of the International Trade Subcommittee, and to inform my colleagues about the importance of this issue because I favor normal trading relations with China, I want to address two misunderstandings regarding China. 
   The first misconception is that a vote by the Senate on normal trading relations is a vote to admit China to the World Trade Organization. We do not have anything to do with China being in the World Trade Organization. It is a wrong misconception. Also, there is a belief if we do not approve PNTR, China will not be able to join the World Trade Organization. As a member of the World Trade Organization, we can say something about it through our representative there, but in the Senate our vote on PNTR will not affect China's ability to join the WTO. 
   I want to tell my colleagues what will be consequence of not approving permanent normal trading relations with China. The only thing that will happen if we vote against permanent normal trading relations with China is that American farmers and all of our businesses will miss out on lower tariff rates and the other market-access concessions China will grant to farmers and businesses in other countries. 
   Remember, China is not just a big chunk of land; China is 20 percent of the world's population. When we talk about doing business with China, we are not talking about doing business in East Podunk; we are talking about doing business with 20 percent of the people of this Earth. 
   Let me explain what the PNTR vote is really about. Congress has placed conditions on our trade with China. These stipulations are not consistent with the core World Trade Organization obligations for member countries to grant each other unconditional, most-favored-nation treatment. If we do not grant permanent normal trading relations with China, thus removing the Jackson-Vanik restrictions, and if, at the same time, China eventually becomes a World Trade Organization member--and this is going to happen sooner or later--then the World Trade Organization rules will require the United States to opt out of the tariff and market access concessions we helped negotiate. 
   It does not hurt China, it does not hurt any of the other 137 members of the World Trade Organization, but it is going to help us because these other countries will get market access. Other countries will gain and build market share in China while the United States is sitting on the sidelines. This will be at the expense of the American soybean farmers, at the expense of the American pork producers, at the expense of the American insurance companies, and other financial service providers. 
   You can list any segment of the American economy. I happen to list those that are very much related to the economy of my State. In the process, China--this country with 20 percent of the world's population--will not be hurt one bit, either. 
   Let's make it clear. Let's say somehow the Congress decides we do not want permanent normal trading relations with China, and China joins the World Trade Organization. China gets the benefit of that. All the other countries get the benefit of that. Let's say we decide to not complete the agreement with China. China is not going to be hurt one bit. In fact, hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers--20 percent of the world's population--will reap the benefits of free trade. Our farmers and businesses will surely suffer. This is not fair. 
   Since I am a Republican, I would like to quote a Democrat. Within the last week, before the Senate Agriculture Committee, Secretary of Agriculture Glickman said something very interesting. He said that for a couple decades we have been letting almost anything from China they want to export come into our country, with few restrictions. Yes, this open access has certainly helped our consumers. When we talk about the difficulty of getting our goods into China, we have to deal with state trading organizations, and with a lot of nontariff trade barriers. So it is quite obvious this agreement with China would be a win-win situation for the United States of America. 
   That is Secretary of Agriculture Glickman speaking not only about agriculture but speaking about all the  nonagricultural manufacturing products and services that we can send to that country as a result of this agreement. 
   Remember, the first misconception I cited is that some believe if China does not get permanent normal trading relations, that it is going to keep China from joining the World Trade Organization. But if China does get in the World Trade Organization, she will have a fairly free trade relationship with 137 other countries. And then we will not have that same agreement with China. It will be a lose-lose situation for America. 
   The second misconception I want to address is that even if China does get into the World Trade Organization, it will not mean that much right away for American manufacturers and American agriculture. 
   That is something that could not be further from the truth because we are going to reap immediate benefits from China having normal trading relations with us. As well, with China being a member of the World Trade Organization, we will benefit from that relationship with China. Because we are also in the WTO, we will benefit from what happens with the increased trade that results from that. 
   The fact is, China is not only a large economy, it also happens to be a very dynamic economy. Because they have made economic reforms there, China's leaders have sparked an economic renewal that has led to growth rates of 7 to 10 percent every year of the last decade, easily dwarfing the rates of our own superheated economy in the United States. 
   China's economy has grown 7 to 10 percent. Quite frankly, I do not know whether they want to admit this, but China's economy has to grow at least 5 percent for them to make room for all the young people coming into the workforce. 
   Any way you look at it--the 5 percent they have to have to keep people employed or the 7 to 10 percent they have had in recent years--there is a lot of new prosperity in China. As a consequence of this, China is buying a great deal of everything, especially agriculture products. 
   But because about one-third of China's economic activity is generated and controlled by state-owned enterprises, China often manipulates its markets in a way that harms its trading partners. This agreement we have with China takes care of this problem. I would like to give you an example. It is one that is well known to 
   the soybean farmers of my own State of Iowa. 
   In 1992, China soybean oil consumption shot up from about 750,000 metric tons to 1.7 million metric tons. Keeping pace with this increased new demand, soybean oil imports also more than doubled. 
   In order to keep up with surging domestic demand, China imported more soybeans and soybean meal, much of it from the United States, and, in fact, much of it from my State of Iowa--the leading producer of soybeans of the 50 States. 
   When China's soybean imports hit their peak in 1997, soybean meal in the United States was trading at an average base price of about $240 per ton. This meant for a while farmers were getting a lot better price than they are now for soybeans, sometimes close to $7 per bushel. Everyone was better off. China's consumers got what they wanted. American soybean growers prospered. Of course, this is the way trade is supposed to work. 
   But suddenly, Chinese state-run trading companies arbitrarily shut off imports of soybeans. Soybean meal that was selling in 1997 for $240 per ton in the United States plummeted to $125 per ton by January 1999. Soybeans selling for over $7 per bushel in 1997, fell to just over $4 per bushel by last summer. 
   So you can imagine what happened on the farm with the loss of that income. Combined with other factors, farmers were unable to pay their bills. Many farmers who were considered by their bankers to be well off are struggling to recover. In trade, what happens in China does make a difference in the United States of America, at least with our economy. 
   This shows what occurs when protectionism, when trade barriers, when tariffs, and when government-run controls take the place of the free market. Trade is distorted. Consumers abroad have less choice. And American family farmers suffer. It also demonstrates how important China's entry into the World Trade Organization is for America's farmers. 
   With a new bilateral market access agreement in place, and with meaningful protocol agreements that should soon be in place, China will not be able to use straight state trading enterprises to arbitrarily restrict and manipulate agriculture trade, and trade in any product, for that matter. 
   Once China has entered the World Trade Organization, they will have to do away with those organizations that violate the principles of a free market economy because they will have to in order to get into the World Trade Organization. 
   For the first time in history, China would be bound by enforceable international trade rules. 
   When we trade with other countries, we export more than farm equipment, soybeans, computer chips, insurance, banking, a lot of services. We export part of our society and what our society stands for, the American values and ideals that can be communicated sometimes in commerce, that can never be communicated by American political leaders and by American diplomats. I think the exporting of our values and our ideals is very good. This is surely good for the World Trade Organization. It is good for China. It is good for the United States. I believe it is part of the process of keeping the peace. 
   We seldom get a real chance in Congress to make this a better and safer world in a very large way without expending American blood and deploying American military might around the world. This is one of those rare opportunities, through commerce and through a very peaceful approach, to do something for peace around the world. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting permanent normal trading relations with China. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I introduced a companion piece of legislation to H.R. 3822, the Oil Price Reduction Act of 2000. This bill will help to address the problems our constituencies are experiencing throughout the nation due to climbing fuel prices. 
   Last weekend I traveled back to my home and held a briefing near Des Moines to explain to my constituents that prices will likely rise significantly past current levels. I had the displeasure of looking truckers and farmers in the eye and telling them there is no relief in sight. In my home state we are experiencing price levels not seen in almost a decade, but all I could tell them was that it is going to get worse. 
   Many of my colleagues know the cold, hard truth of the matter. When the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) finally makes a substantive, definitive decision to increase oil production, it will still most likely take 60 days before adequate levels of fuel can be distributed throughout the U.S. That means if the OPEC Cartel decided to remedy the harm they have imposed on the American consumer today, we are still at least six weeks away from witnessing the peak in the price increase. We could very well see $2 per gallon gasoline by May and that is not acceptable. 
   Iowans and the rest of the nation should not have been subjected to this price spike. The monopolistic production controls promulgated by OPEC in March of 1999 should have been challenged by our administration upon establishment, not when we finally felt the pinch. 
   In addition, the Administration's energy policy is an aberration. This crisis only accentuates the problem with relying on foreign energy instead of expanding domestic opportunities. Since 1992, U.S. oil production is down 17% while consumption has risen 14%. We now import 56% of our oil and that number is growing rapidly. DOE predicts that by 2020 we will import 65% of our oil. Guess which country has benefited the most from the Administration's energy policy? As unbelievable as this seems it's Iraq. Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Iraq is now our fastest growing source for oil. How can we be administering a policy that strengthens this dictator's grip on our economy and the Middle East? 
   The bill I introduced today would require the President of the United States to cut off foreign aid and arms sales to countries engaged in oil price fixing. 
   Specifically, the legislation would require the President to send a report to Congress, within 30 days of enactment, detailing the U.S. security relationship with each OPEC member and any other major oil exporting country; assistance programs and government-supported arms sales provided to those countries; and his determination regarding the extent each country is engaged in oil price fixing and whether such price fixing is detrimental to the U.S. economy. 
   The bill would then require the President to reduce, terminate or suspend any assistance or arms sales to the country or countries determined to be fixing oil prices. 
   In addition, the legislation would require the President to submit a report to Congress 90 days after enactment describing the diplomatic efforts by the U.S. to convince all major net oil exporting countries that current price levels are unsustainable and will cause widespread economic harm in oil consuming and developing nations. 
   Even if the production quotas put in place last year are lifted, low reserves  may continue to plunder American consumers and farmers during the busy summer vacation and planting seasons. The Clinton administration was caught off-guard this year without much of an energy policy. Now, the President needs to exercise his authority to help solve the problem, which is going to get worse before it gets better.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, presently we are experiencing the country's highest petroleum prices this decade. And there is every indication the price is going to go higher and higher. I think we need to start looking at why and not look at where to place blame. I think we have to find a common sense solution to the situation because it's not going to get any better in the short term even if OPEC decides to pump more oil and ship more oil to the United States. The fact of the matter is that regardless whether OPEC complies with our wishes there are still two reasons we are bound to face a similar dilemma again in the future. 
   The No. 1 reason is that the United States and other energy-consuming nations are going to continue to consume a greater amount of gasoline and petroleum products over the next several decades. The demand is going to increase. 
   The second reason is that as long as OPEC remains a powerful cartel willing to violate the principles of a free marketplace and continue its stranglehold on the production of oil, it will be able to radically effect our economy and financial stability. 
   As I look at how this administration is responding to the high price of oil, all I can see is that Secretary of Energy Richardson has been dispatched to the various oil-producing nations. The administration in a sense is having the Secretary get down on his knees and beg for OPEC nations to produce more oil. Even if he is successful--some indications are that he might be to the tune of 1 million or 1 1/2 million barrels--it is going to be another 60 days before that oil makes any impact on the price of gasoline at the pump in my State of Iowa or anyplace in the United States. Regardless of whether he is successful or not, this is a pretty poor energy policy. 
   Every time the price of oil gets so high that administration sends the Secretary of Energy around to beg for more oil to be produced, we ought to be looking at what we can do to be energy independent. This sort of extreme energy policy that President Clinton has seemingly implemented is gouging the consumers of America. 
   One example of something the President could do right now would be to develop greater reliance upon alternative energy and renewable sources. The President should be relying upon the ethanol and other renewable fuels instead of the ability of his Energy Secretary to be persuasive. 
   I am not only speaking for the economy of my State when I make this point about ethanol. I am talking about all renewable fuels. Ethanol is one of those renewable fuels. The reason I continue to hound the administration about ethanol is that right now the Environmental Protection Agency has an opportunity, if the President would bring it to their attention--and I called upon him in a letter last year to do this--to eliminate MTBE from gasoline nationwide and replace it with ethanol. 
   MTBE, a nonrenewable source of oxygenated fuel which is a competitor to ethanol, is already documented as poisoning water and has been outlawed in the State of California. The EPA should make the decision that MTBE ought to be outlawed in all 50 States, as the Governor of California has decided to do in the State of California. This action would encourage the production of ethanol and fill the void which MTBE has left in California. 
   The amount of ethanol that could be marketed in California is equal to the use of ethanol in all 50 States right now. The President, in making that decision, would be able to not only continue to use oxygenated fuel to clean up the air, he could also help agriculture, create new jobs, and make us less dependent upon foreign sources of oil, which strengthens our economy and national security. Obviously, since one-third of our trade deficit comes from the importation of oil, he would also reduce our trade deficit by relying on renewable fuels. But the most important aspect is that to the extent which we rely on domestically produced renewable 
   sources of energy, we would not be forced to plead with OPEC every time they meet and decide they are going to gouge the American consumer. 
   Just the fact that the members of OPEC, many being Arab nations, agreed to reduce production and dramatically increase our cost bothers me tremendously. Is this how they show their respect for the Americans who shed their blood in the Persian Gulf war so that the region would not be dominated by Saddam Hussein? This surely is true of Kuwait, the third leading exporter of oil in the world. Kuwait ought to show a little sense of gratitude to the American military and American taxpayers for saving them from that sort of dominance. But this only goes to show me we are actually dealing with a domestic problem. We seemingly cannot force OPEC to act reasonable, because if these nations want to continue their monopolistic practice, unless we are willing to take retaliatory action, we are going to be beholding to them. Consequently, this extreme policy of having no domestic policy on energy is devastating the consumers of America. We need to have that reliance upon alternative fuels. 
   Another glaring problem with the Administration's energy policy is their policy has reduced the domestic production of energy, oil, natural gas, et cetera, by limiting the areas in the United States where exploration can take place. 
   If they had anticipated $30 oil, I don't think they would have followed that policy. They had other thoughts in mind when they adopted that policy and restricted the exploration of oil. Consequently, they have put the United States in a position where we have not had much drilling going on in the continental U.S. or offshore. Now we are paying the price. 
   In addition, there is a lot of regulatory red tape involved with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. One of the pipeline companies put in an application to build a pipeline to the Northeast. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission put so many conditions upon the building of that pipeline, it became too costly and the pipeline company decided not to build. 
   If one wonders why the price is $2 a gallon for heating oil in New England--when a year ago it was only about 60 cents--it is because of a regulatory policy that makes it almost impossible for people who are willing to invest to derive economic benefit from their investment. 
   We ought to look at some of the regulations of this administration that tend to discourage exploration, that prohibit exploration, or that have made it very difficult to deliver the product from the refineries to the consumers. 
   OPEC's attempt to drive up the price of oil, at great cost to the US consumer, is causing economic instability which also serves to injure our national security. The United States has long been the locomotive preserving  peace around the world and when we are in jeopardy, peace is in jeopardy. 
   The concept of world peace promoted by the US has led to an era of trying to free up trade internationally through the World Trade Organization. There are countries in OPEC who want to belong to the World Trade Organization. By simultaneously being a member of the petroleum exporting countries, and being a part of that organization, their whole approach to determining price is antithetical to the free trade principles of the World Trade Organization. I don't think we ought to be supportive of OPEC nations joining the World Trade Organization if they don't want to follow the principles of free trade established within the WTO, which are contrary to OPEC's recent monopolistic action. 
   There is also $415 million of the taxpayers' money that the administration hopes to provide to some of the OPEC nations in the form of foreign aid. While we have traditionally done this for three or four decades, should we continue to give taxpayers' money, paid for by working men and women in this country, to the very same countries that have imposed egregious oil prices upon those same men and women? And at the same time encourage those consumers and working people of America, every day when they go to work, to pay more taxes into the Federal Treasury even though the price of gasoline continues to increase? 
   There is a third lever we can use against some of these countries. Mr. President, 20 percent of all the money for International Monetary Fund loans comes from the American taxpayer. We should encourage the International Monetary Fund to review the anticompetitive energy policy exhibited by foreign states as a factor when considering approval for loans. At the very least our 20% contribution should be conditioned on this criteria. We should not stand by while the same countries who gouge American taxpayers benefit from our 20 percent contribution. 
   I hope we use all the leverage we can against OPEC, but the only real solution is ultimately less reliance upon imported sources of oil and more on domestic production and/or renewable fuels. 
   I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about some provisions in this bill I have long backed to improve education. But before I point my remarks directly to those few provisions of the bill, I would like to put this whole thing into context, if I could. 
   No. 1, the American people are very concerned about education in the United States. If there is any one thing they want the Congress, the State legislatures, and the local schools and municipalities to address, it is the problem of education. I am convinced they want the decisionmaking to be done at the local level, but they would like to have both moral leadership and some resources to come from Washington. 
   I happen to be one who believes those resources that come from Washington, to the extent they are given to States and local communities with few strings attached--less redtape and less paperwork--the better off we are. 
   But I think, in the context of even more money, we want to think in terms of, if the money were the sole solution to the problems of education, then that would be an easy solution: Just appropriate more money. I think in terms of the $5,500 per student per year spent in my State of Iowa and the fact that our graduates end up either first, second, or third on the ACT scores in our competition with Minnesota and Wisconsin. For 7 or 8 years in a row, our graduates have ended up first in the SATs. That is the result. We ought to be concerned about results and not about process when we look at spending the taxpayers' dollars. 
   Compare, on the one hand, that $5,500 per year spent by the State of Iowa--still, my State legislators would say: There is a lot of concern about the need to do more to improve the product of our educational system in our State--with the approximately $11,000 that is spent in the District of Columbia--almost twice the amount spent in my State--and look at the massive dropout rate from the high schools in the District of Columbia. You can only conclude that there has to be a lot done in the District of Columbia other than just spending more money because if you looked at just more money being the solution to the educational problems, then I would quickly conclude that the District of Columbia ought to be doing much better than my State of Iowa. 
   People are very concerned about education. So in each one of our State capitals, and in the Congress of the United States, there is a great deal of time being spent on education, as there ought to be. We believe every child is entitled to a good education, entitled to that good education in a crime-free environment and with the best of teachers. 
   We also have to remember a basic principle: Education is all about children. The product of our schools is what matters. Does the process have the children in mind, or are there sometimes special interests beyond just the children's welfare to which we give too much attention? 
   We have seen studies indicating that whatever we do in the schools, spending money or a policy other than spending money, one of the best things we can do to enhance the environment of learning is to get parents involved in the education of their children, checking the homework, talking about it at the dinner table, in every respect encouraging that child in that family to learn, and also being supportive of the educational environment the child comes from, whether it be the public school or the private school, or some other learning environment of which that child might be a part. We have to make sure we have the educational result that no child will fall through the cracks and, for those who do, that there is a process that the results in getting that child the best possible education so they can succeed in life as well. 
   This bill is all about encouraging families to save money for the education of their kids from kindergarten through graduate school, planning for the future, not relying upon somebody else. With present tax dollars, less than 50 percent of the education dollar is spent in the classroom. That means we have to look at the allocation of resources within education and decide is it better to spend that on administration or is it better to spend it on teachers in the classroom, the ones who have the hands-on contact with the minute-by-minute education of everybody in that classroom. We have to have accountability for education dollars. I am not sure we have that accountability today, when we are spending less in the classroom than we ought to be spending and more on other aspects of education than we ought to be spending. 
   This bill is concerned with our children. When you are concerned about our children, you are concerned about the future. When you are concerned about the future of American children, you are concerned about America's future and our place in the world, our ability to lead the world, and our ability, individually and the country as a whole, to be economically competitive in the global environment in which we are now competing. 
   Too many people look to Washington for the answer. They might say: Well, if you're saying people shouldn't look to Washington for an answer, they ought to look to their parents, they ought to look to their local or private school, why this legislation? 
   Well, this legislation is all about empowering families, empowering parents. It is not concerned with process. It is concerned with giving parents choice. Basically, all the money that comes into the Federal Treasury is taxpayers' money. It comes from that individual working man or woman in America who pays taxes. This is about giving them some control over their own resources. It is about giving them choice. It is about not having help come from Washington with a lot of redtape connected with it to create more paperwork for the teachers than maybe the dollars they receive are worth. 
   This definitely is not about making education policy in Washington, DC--pouring one mold in Washington and making all policy out of that mold. If we were to do that, we would be saying the problems of New York City can be solved in exactly the same way as they can be solved in Waterloo, IA. One of two things is going to happen. Either we are going to fail in one place and succeed in another or, simultaneous with that, if we get the taxpayers' money's worth in New York, we won't get their money's worth in Waterloo. So consequently, it is about saying 
   that our country is so geographically vast and our population so heterogeneous that you shouldn't pour one mold in Washington and expect to accomplish the same amount of good wherever you are in the United States with those same taxpayer dollars. 
   This is a way of saying to the American people: We give you an encouragement to save. We give you a tax incentive to save for the education of your children. What meets the educational policy needs of your family, the needs of your child, in the final analysis it is made by the family for which these resources should be used, empowering the family, involving the family to a greater extent in the education of their children, and also giving them the resources to meet those needs. It is not one size fits all. If we have 110 million different taxpayers in America, then this gives the possibility of 110 million different answers to the problems of education in America. 
   With that background, I will speak about the two or three provisions of this legislation that I have been involved in, some of which were in the tax bill that had been vetoed in the past. In particular, I mention the tax deduction for student loan interest beyond its current 60-month payment restriction. 
   Everybody who is paying attention to this legislation knows that the important part of this bill is expanding the education savings account from $500 per year to $2,000 per year. In conjunction with this, we are trying to do  some things that have other tax benefits to help education, some for kindergarten through 12 and some for higher education. What I am speaking about regarding my involvement is eliminating the 60-month payment restriction for which I fought 6 years and finally got adopted in 1997, the provisions of our Tax Code that reinstitute the deductibility of interest on student loans. 
   To fit that into the overall revenue-neutrality provisions of the budget law, we had to cap it at 60 months. This legislation would remove that 60-month cap. As the cost of higher education continues to rise, the levels of student debt are spiraling upward. Students and their families are finding that financing a higher education is burdensome. Some students, due to financial concerns, are unable to receive the education they need. 
   We have a duty to assist them in their need and, in so doing, send a clear message that the Congress understands their hardships and values their efforts in improving themselves through college. Also, it gives me an opportunity to establish a principle involved in this legislation beyond just the economic points of view we are trying to make about getting an education and the economic value of that--that is, to send a clear signal to the young people of America that borrowing money to enhance their intellect is just as important, as far as the Tax Code of this country is concerned, as borrowing money for capital investment in some business. 
   And it seems to me that parity is legitimate. Eliminating the 60-month payment restriction will eliminate costly reporting requirements that are currently required for both lenders and borrowers. That is an additional benefit to taking that 60-month limit off. 
   Under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, we succeeded in reinstating the tax deduction of interest on student loans, which had been eliminated 11 years previously. This brought much needed relief to students and their families. I spoke about the budget constraints we had in 1997, which today we would not have and we don't have. So we put that 60-month payment restriction in place for revenue neutrality. Our current budget situation makes it possible to reevaluate this limitation. As the price of going to college has continued to spiral upward, student debt has risen to very high levels. 
   The current restriction hurts some of the most needy borrowers. It hurts those who, due to limited means, have borrowed most heavily. It also weighs heavily on those who have dedicated themselves to a career in public service, despite oftentimes lower pay that is connected with that--as an example, teachers. By eliminating the 60-month payment restriction, we will be assisting these most deserving borrowers, while rewarding civic involvement as well. 
   Also in this bill are provisions for assistance in school construction. Last week, a Member on the other side of the aisle asked why we are not talking about school construction and repairs. My simple answer is: Read the bill. If they did, they would find that it contains some very helpful school construction and rehabilitation incentives. School districts across the country today are struggling to fix some of the wornout rungs in a fundamentally American institution, the public schools--the ladder by which people go up the economic scale. In fact, school districts nationwide spent $18.7 billion on school construction in the last year for which we have figures, 1996. Building and repairing U.S. elementary and secondary schools requires massive capital to keep up with growing enrollments, aging buildings, and modernization needs. 
   My State's reputation for educational excellence has gained national prominence, as I have already referred to, throughout the 20th century. Even in my State, we have local school districts that have tremendous needs, and this bill will help them to accomplish a good building environment for the next century. 
   As America prepares to enter this new century--and we have--we must work to strengthen our schools and ensure our classrooms are wired to deliver a 21st century quality education. That includes fixing basic structural damage and, even more so, installing modern communications and computer equipment. But whether it is repairing leaky roofs or removing hazardous asbestos or fixing the structure, everything needs a high-tech facelift at this particular time. 
   Expanding greater access to affordable capital, which this bill does, will relieve pressure on the local tax base and help more school districts build and repair their schools. Initiatives in this bill do that, and I have sponsored some of those initiatives. They build on something that already works. They build upon the principle to establish tax-exempt bonds. In fact, the single most important source of funding for investment in public school construction and rehabilitation is the tax-exempt bond market. Iowa school districts were issued over 
   $625 million in tax-exempt bonds in the last year we have figures for, which is 1998. 
   Whether rural or suburban or urban schools, these school districts from coast to coast are facing substantial school construction costs. The greater the flexibility the better. One size fits all won't work, whether it is in capital investment in schools or investment in personal education. That is why my plan is designed to give local school districts greater leeway to secure critical funding. 
   This legislation would allow school districts to partner with private investors, allowing school districts to tap deep pockets in the private sector and leverage private dollars to improve public schools. Second, it would expand the volume of school construction costs that a small school district could issue annually. This will allow smaller rural and suburban schools a better opportunity to manage the high cost of replacing or repairing aging facilities. 
   In conclusion, I think all of these steps, along with a lot more in this bill, are important first steps. If and when we are able to pass a more comprehensive tax relief measure, I hope to build upon these initiatives and provide even more school construction assistance to our local communities. 
   Unlike a lot of proposals from this administration for school construction that require local school districts to get permission from Federal Government bureaucracies, the incentives in our bill empower local people, people on the local school board, and they preserve local control. Without a doubt, that is what the people of this country want. They do not want the dictation of educational policy from Washington, DC. They do not want, as a local school board, to come hat-in-hand to some Washington bureaucrat to get permission to get a little bit of help for fixing a crack in the wall or wiring for some high-tech improvement. They want to be able to decide the needs for their community. Why should they be the ones to do that? Because they are the only ones who know about it. There is no way, no matter how intelligent a Washington bureaucrat might be, that they would know the needs of all the local school districts of our country. 
   This is a very good bill that will enhance education in America. This bill will provide, through tax incentives, about $8 billion in education assistance to the American people, with local control of that money. It deserves our strong support. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as chairman of the International Trade Subcommittee, I rise to express extreme disappointment about a very adverse decision to the United States handed down in Geneva today by the World Trade Organization appellate body in the Foreign Sales Corporation case, sometimes called the FSC case. 
   I suppose I should not be standing here on the floor crying about the United States losing a case before the World Trade Organization because we win most of these cases. The reason I am so disappointed in this one is that I think there is a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose of our Foreign Sales Corporation tax law. From that standpoint, when we rely so much on income taxes and the European Community relies so much on value-added taxes, this sales corporation tax law is to equalize the playing field between Europe and the United States on a lot of key manufactured products. 
   The appellate body decision essentially means the Foreign Sales Corporation rules in our Tax Code violate the WTO rules. As I indicated, the appellate body fundamentally misunderstood the nature and the intent of the Foreign Sales Corporation plan. The FSC plan was designed to address the competitive disadvantage faced by United States businesses that compete with foreign firms in European countries that have value-added tax regimes. When products from countries with a value-added tax regime are exported, they typically get rebates. However, in the United States, because we rely upon the corporate income tax and not on a value-added tax, our exporting firms don't enjoy this type of tax benefit. This obviously makes our exports less competitive in world markets. The FSC rules were designed, then, to create a level playing field with these European tax systems. 
   The appellate body decision is a very serious development because it comes at a time when the World Trade Organization itself is under attack. In my view, these attacks are unwarranted and unjustified, but politically we have to deal with them. It will probably be the case, in one or the other body of this Congress, that we will even be voting this year on the issue of whether or not the United States ought to stay as a member of the World Trade Organization. I think they should, but this case could impact that decision. 
   Of course, we must not allow this setback to undermine either the World Trade Organization or our support for this vital institution. I will do everything I can to make sure this does not happen. In the meantime, I strongly urge President Clinton to attempt to negotiate a settlement with the European Union that modifies or overturns this appellate body's decision. This should be President Clinton's No. 1 priority at the G-8 summit in Okinawa later this year. 
   I also call upon the European Union not to take any retaliatory action against the United States until we, through our President, have the opportunity to personally discuss this case in Okinawa at the summit there. 
   We must make sure we observe the rule of law in this case and in every case involving international trade disputes. We expect no less from our trading partners, and we must do the same. And since we win the vast majority of these cases, we find ourselves not in a bad position by taking this moral stand. 
   But I hope when we address this case, we bear in mind that while the outcome of the case itself is very important, there is something else at stake; that is, the integrity of our international trading system. We must remember that the WTO benefits every farmer and every business that sells its goods and services in foreign markets. If we did not have a WTO and, more importantly, the discipline in the rule of law in international trade that goes with it, we would have only the rule of the jungle. Those who would suffer the most would be the small exporters. 
   In the United States, two-thirds of all businesses that export have 20 or fewer employees. It is, then, the WTO that prevents these small firms from being dominated by their larger competitors in the international marketplace. 
   Let's make sure we get an appropriate and fair resolution of this case, and let's make sure we maintain our strong support for the World Trade Organization.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the gouging of the American consumer, particularly high energy users and, probably most importantly, working Americans who are paying such high gasoline prices because of OPEC. I do this in the context of supporting a resolution Senator ASHCROFT is offering the Senate. I do this not only because he is my good friend but because he knows the impact on working Americans and on agriculture. 
   This is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to communicate to the leaders of the OPEC nations and even non-OPEC cartel producers, prior to the next meeting of the OPEC nations in March, the importance of stabilizing crude oil prices. 
   I appreciate the importance of the message by my good friend from Missouri. He realizes the significance of this issue because he is from a State with vital interests in the health and well-being of the agricultural economy and the transportation industry. The soaring prices of diesel fuel and of gasoline have had an especially detrimental effect upon farmers and truckers whose livelihood is tied closely to the input costs. 
   We in the Senate should not stand idly by while a foreign monopoly dictates our States' economic stability. 
   Remember, if oil company CEOs were doing this sort of OPEC price fixing, they would be in prison for violating the antitrust laws. We obviously can't apply our law to foreign countries in the sense that their leaders are violating them. But it is antithetical to the principles of free trade and markets, even to the WTO. Saudi Arabia wants to get into the WTO. We should not be supporting their entry into the WTO if they are using their economic power in a way that is antithetical to the very organization they want to join. 
   Just in the past month, gasoline prices in my State have taken their biggest jump in 10 years. We now pay an average of $1.38 a gallon for gas, an average of 17 cents higher than last month and 48 cents higher than in February a year ago. Diesel prices in my State are averaging $1.45, which is 12 cents more than last month and 43 cents higher than a year ago. 
   When considering the family farmers' plight, OPEC's action creates a harsh duty that is applied to every bushel of corn, soybeans, and any other agricultural product produced in the United States. Anyone who is farming can tell you that fuel expenditures are always one of the most costly inputs on the farm. 
   The agricultural industry has not fared as well in recent years. Just last year, prices for all kinds of livestock and grain commodities were at their lowest since the 1970s. The outlook for the next year is, at best, mixed. At a time when margins on farm products are already tight, OPEC has consciously increased the price of petroleum products and expenditures within our agricultural community. It is not the free forces of the marketplace that are doing this. These are political decisions that we ought to stand firmly against. 
   But this isn't just about family farmers and truckers. Sometimes we forget that trucking impacts almost every industry. While farmers and truckers might feel the most immediate impact from this action in my home State of Iowa, it is really true that all consumers will eventually feel the far-reaching effects of OPEC's marketplace shenanigans. In Iowa alone, trucks transport freight for 4,438 manufacturing companies, supply goods to 19,500 retail stores, and stock almost 9,000 wholesale trade companies. 
   Trucks supply goods to 2,359 agricultural businesses and deliver the produce and products to market. Annually, trucks transport approximately 160 million tons in and out of Iowa. Eighty-three percent of all manufactured freight transported in Iowa is carried by trucks, and over 75 percent of all communities in Iowa depend entirely on trucks for the delivery of the  products my constituents use every day. 
   OPEC's action has and will continue to drive up costs for transportation, and the bottom line is that the consumer will eventually be forced to bear the burden of the cost. As anyone can see, this situation has the ability to have a substantial detrimental impact on the economies of Iowa and the entire Nation. 
   For this reason, I have tried to address this problem from every angle available to me. I recently wrote to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and asked him to encourage the President to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to stabilize the price of petroleum products. As he is well aware, the President has the power to use the reserve when a very sharp increase in petroleum prices threatens the Nation's economic stability. In my opinion, the current situation meets this test. At the very least, the option should be heavily weighed. 
   I also sent a letter to Mr. Stanley Fisher, First Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, to ask that the market-distorting behavior of the 11 members of OPEC be weighed when these nations apply for loans. Twenty percent of the IMF money comes from the American taxpayers. We should not be using U.S. taxpayers' money to further the causes of an economy that is anticompetitive and is strangling the economy of the very taxpayers who support the IMF. 
   IMF is an international organization of 182 member nations. Each member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries also belongs to the International Monetary Fund. 
   Due to the fact that the IMF's purpose is to promote monetary cooperation and economic growth, I find it disheartening that the member nations of OPEC have chosen a course of action which adversely affects economic growth and stability in the United States. It is for this reason I ask the IMF to consider developing criteria to judge market-distorting behavior which would be weighed when nations exhibiting monopolistic behavior apply for loans through the IMF. 
   I also spoke out against Saudi Arabia previously in my remarks and about their joining the World Trade Organization. I have made this a formal request of U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky. 
   As we all know, we have become far too dependent upon foreign oil. For a very long time, I have been a leading advocate for the development and expanded use of renewable sources of energy, especially corn-based ethanol as well as wind energy and biomass. I have been successful in getting tax credits applied to these alternative forms of energy. I thank my colleagues for their support of that. 
   You have all heard me say that not only is clean-burning ethanol good for the rural economy and the environment, it helps to reduce America's dangerous and expensive dependence on foreign sources of energy. I am disappointed it took a crisis to make some people aware of this unhealthy addiction, but now we should all see how our dependence on foreign crude can impact our economy and why we should seek to develop domestically-based renewable fuel sources. 
   This is a very important issue, and I applaud the resolution offered by the Senator from Missouri. I thank him for bringing the resolution to the floor and for helping to bring this issue to the attention of the Clinton-Gore administration, which needs to finally get on top of this growing problem. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, while we were away for the winter break, the annual high school survey on drug use trends among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders came out. This annual Monitoring the Future study, released on December 17, revealed little change in trends of illicit drug use among our young people. The administration has tried to put a happy face on the results. But there is little to be happy about. 
   Although the Monitoring the Future study found that the increase in drug use among teens has slowed down, what the data show is that use and experimentation remain at high levels. You can see from this chart that we still face the discouraging fact that nearly 50 percent of our high school seniors reported use of marijuana, not only in  1999, but in the 2 previous years as well. In fact, 12th grader use of marijuana is at its highest since 1992. In addition, 23 percent of the high school seniors questioned in the past 3 years, reported that they had used marijuana in the past 30 days. Sadly, the study also found that the percentage of 10th graders who reported use of marijuana increased from 39.6 percent in 1998 to nearly 41 percent in 1999. Hardly news to find comfort in. 
   Marijuana remains a gateway drug for even worse substances and this next chart shows overall illicit drug use among high school seniors. You can see in this second chart that, in 1999, nearly 55 percent of 12th graders reported using an illicit drug in their lifetime. What that ``lifetime'' means is that 55 percent of 17-year-olds have at least tried marijuana or other dangerous, illicit drugs. That's an appalling figure. You can also see that this number is the highest it's been since 1992. With the Office of National Drug Control Policy's recent blitz of ads through the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, these high numbers are truly disappointing. It seems though, as the news gets worse, the press releases get happier. But it's still double-speak. 
   Another upsetting finding was the increase in the use of the ``club drug,'' Ecstacy. Use of Ecstacy among 10th graders increased from 3.3 percent in 1998 to 4.4 percent in 1999. In addition, use among 12th graders increased from 1.5 percent in 1998 to 2.5 percent in 1999. The increase in the use of these so called club drugs, such as Ecstacy, is particularly disturbing. This is so, because club drugs are frequently referred to as recreational drugs and are perceived by many young people as harmless. On December 23 of this past year, we were given a glimpse of the sheer magnitude and severity of the market for Ecstacy, when Customs officials seized 700 pounds of Ecstacy. These 700 pounds would have been enough to provide 1 million kids each with a single dose. Unfortunately, Ecstacy is quickly becoming the drug of choice among our young people. And it too is a gateway to wider drug use. Parents need to take a harder look at what their children are being exposed to. 
   Last session I gave a floor statement on one particular club drug, that is frequently used in sexual assault cases, called GHB. I am pleased to learn from this year Monitoring the Future study that in next year's survey, young people will be questioned about use of GHB. But the issue is not this drug or that drug but the climate that encourages use and recruits kids into the drug scene. We must work to reverse the trend to normalize and glamorize drug use that has taken root in recent years. 
   There is an encouraging decline in the use of inhalants among 8th and 10th graders. And, use of crack cocaine among 8th and 10th graders is down slightly. In addition, 12th graders reported a significant decrease in the use of crystal meth from 3 percent in 1998 to about 2 percent in 1999. 
   As we begin not only a new year but a new millennium, we are faced with the difficult challenge of making the 21st century safe for our young people. Although we have made some progress, these study results leave our young people facing an uncertain future. We cannot be satisfied with unchanging trends in teenage drug use. We have not seen a significant decline in drug use among our country's young people since 1992. In fact, what we have seen are dramatic increases. This fact makes me pause and wonder what we have been doing for the past 8 years. Whatever it is, it has failed to make the difference we need to be seeing. We need to move toward significant decreases in use. We need coherent, sound, accountable efforts. We must not neglect our duties in keeping our young people drug free. We are not in any position to let our guard down. We need policies and strategies that make a difference.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senate will soon make a very important and historic decision about whether to grant permanent normal trade relations status to China. This decision would pave the way for China's accession to the WTO. China's likely accession to the WTO is one of the most pivotal trade developments of the last 150 years. It is also perhaps the single most significant application of the most-favored-nation principle, or non-discrimination principle, in modern trade history. 
   I believe we should approve permanent normal trade relations for China. I also strongly believe China should be admitted to the World Trade Organization. Because this is such an important matter, I would like to address this issue today in a careful and thorough way. 
   I have two main points. First, The Core principle of the WTO, the principle of nondiscrimination, or most-favored-nation treatment, is the only way we have to keep markets open to everybody. 
   We should seek the broadest possible acceptance of this basic principle of non-discrimination in trade. History shows that when countries trade with each other on a nondiscriminatory basis, everyone wins. History also shows that free and open trade is one of the most effective ways to keep the peace. 
   Second and lastly I also support China's entry into the WTO because it is in our national self-interest to have a rules-based world trading system that includes China. 
   Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about my first point, that everyone wins when we have nondiscriminatory trade, which gives us a better chance to keep the peace. 
   Most-favored-nation treatment, or what we now call normal trade relations, started with Britain and France in the 1860s. These two nations negotiated free trade agreements based on the most-favored-nation principle of nondiscrimination, which later became the cornerstone of the GATT, and, in 1993, the WTO. 
   The results of these early international trade treaties was spectacular. It began a new era of free trade that led to a great increase in wealth around the world. Unfortunately, this hey-day of free trade didn't last long. It ended in about 1885, when Europe turned inward, and retreated from the free-trade principle. 
   Just 30 years after Europe abandoned the nondiscrimination principle in trade, the war ``to end all wars'' ravaged most of the continent. Events following the First World War also massively disrupted international trading relationships. Many countries pursued beggar-thy-neighbor trade policies, including harsh trade restrictions. 
   When the Great Depression set in, many countries adopted extreme forms of protectionism in a misguided attempt to save jobs at home. The worst of these misguided laws was the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, which was enacted into law by the 71st Congress. 
   The act started out with good intentions. Its aim was to help the American farmer with a limited, upward revision of tariffs on foreign produce. But it had the exact opposite result. It strangled foreign trade. It deepened and widened the severity of the Depression. Other countries faced with a deficit of exports to pay for their imports responded by applying quotas and embargoes on American goods. 
   Mr. President, I went back to the historical record to see what happened to United States agricultural exports when other countries stopped buying our agricultural products after we enacted that tariff. I was shocked by the depth and severity of the retaliation. 
   In 1930, the United States exported just over $1 billion worth of agricultural goods. By 1932, that amount had been cut almost in half, to $589 million. Barley exports dropped by half. So did exports of soybean oil. Pork exports fell 15 percent. Almost every American export sector was hit by foreign retaliation, but particularly agriculture. 
   As U.S. agricultural exports fell in the face of foreign retaliation, farm prices fell sharply, weakening the solvency of many rural banks. Their weakened condition undermined depositor confidence, leading to depositor runs, bank failures, and ultimately, a contraction of the money supply. 
   Mr. President, I'm not saying that if we hadn't abandoned the nondiscrimination principle we wouldn't have had a depression. But it wouldn't have lasted as long. It wouldn't have hit as hard. It wouldn't have destroyed as many lives. 
   President Roosevelt attempted to correct this mistake with a major shift  in policy in 1934 with the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act. This legislation authorized the President to negotiate trade liberalizing agreements on a bilateral basis with our trading partners. 
   But the damage was done. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act was too little, too late. 
   Although 31 bilateral agreements were signed, the outbreak of the Second World War completely shattered any hope of a more cooperative international trading environment. I don't think it is a coincidence that another World War closely followed the Depression. If political tensions were not inflamed by severe economic pressures, and made worse by unnecessary and destructive trade disputes, perhaps the history of the first half of the 20th century would have been different. 
   Free trade alone may not keep the peace. But it makes it a lot harder to go to war. 
   At the end of World War II, the United States led the effort to once again construct a world trading system based on the Most-Favored-Nation principle of nondiscrimination. We succeeded with the launch of the GATT, in 1947. 
   Now, once again, we have a world trade system that increases our collective wealth through nondiscriminatory free trade. We also have a world trade system that helps keep the peace. The fact that the cold war never ignited to a hot conflict is due in large part to the success of the GATT in forging closer economic ties at a time when world political tensions were escalating over other issues. 
   Mr. President, we finally got it just about right. But we still don't have a world trade system that includes the world's most populous nation, and one of its most dynamic economies. China's absence from the global trade forum matters because we still have not managed to rid the world of political tensions and destabilizing trade disputes. 
   We could still easily lose it all, just as Europe did in 1885, and as we did in 1930. Increasingly, many of these disputes and tensions will involve, or at least affect, both China and the United States. There are a few Members here who may remember the pressures on the world trading system we had in the early 1970s. Back then, we had a major world recession and two major oil price shocks. 
   These pressures led to the so-called ``New Protectionism,'' when countries increasingly resorted to non-tariff barriers to trade, such as quotas, voluntary export restraint agreements, industrial and agricultural subsidies, and orderly restraint agreements. The heightened tensions brought about by the ``New Protectionism'' were potentially very destabilizing. 
   It was only with the conclusion of the Uruguay round of global trade negotiations in 1993 that we finally reversed the dangerous course of this ``New Protectionism,'' and got free trade back on track. Our experience in the 1970s, when we could have easily lost most of our progress in opening new global markets, demonstrates why it's so important to expand and strengthen the world trade system as much as we can. 
   China was not a GATT member in the 1970s. The disciplines were much weaker. Important sectors like agriculture weren't covered. Dispute resolution was largely unenforceable. 
   Today, that is all changed. Disciplines are stronger. Disputes can be settled and effectively enforced. For the first time, we now have rules that cover agriculture. And now China is ready to end a fifty-year period of going its own way on trade policy. 
   Mr. President, rules and disciplines are meaningless unless they are widely accepted and broadly applied. We cannot have an effective, open world trade system that excludes China. It's as simple as that. 
   There is one more reason why China's entry into the WTO is in our vital national interest. For the first time in history, China would be bound by enforceable international trade rules. I would like to briefly explain why this development is so important. 
   Because of the economic reforms of the 1990s, China's leaders have sparked an economic renewal that has lead to growth rates of 7-10 percent every year of the last decade, easily dwarfing the growth rates of our own super-heated economy. As a consequence of its new prosperity, China is buying a great deal of everything, especially agricultural products. 
   But because about one-third of China's economic activity is generated and controlled by state-owned enterprises, if often manipulates its markets in a way that harms its trading partners. Take just one example well known to the soybean farmers in my own state of Iowa. In 1992, China's soybean oil consumption shot up from about 750,000 metric tons to about 1.7 million metric tons. Keeping pace with this increased new demand, soybean oil imports also more than doubled. 
   In order to keep up with surging domestic demand, China imported more soybeans and soybean meal, much of it from the United States, and much of that amount from Iowa. When China's soybean imports hit their peak in 1997, soybean meal in the United States was trading at an average base of about $240.00 per ton. This means our farmers were getting between $7.00 and $8.50 per bushel for their soybeans. Everyone was better off. China's consumers got what they wanted. America's soybean growers prospered. This is the way trade is supposed to work. 
   But suddenly, China's state-run trading companies arbitrarily shut off imports of soybeans. Soybean meal that was selling in 1997 for $240.00 per ton in the United States plummeted to $125.00 per ton by January 1999. Soybeans selling for $8.00 per bushel in 1997 fell to $4.00 per bushel by July 1999. You can imagine what happened on the farm. With the loss of that income, combined with other factors, farmers were unable to pay their bills. Many lost their farms. Many are still struggling to recover. 
   Mr. President, what happened in China shows what occurs when protectionism, trade barriers, tariffs, and government-run controls take the place of free markets. Trade is distorted. Consumers abroad have less choice. American farm families suffer. It also demonstrated how important China's entry into the WTO is for America's farmers. 
   With a new bilateral market access agreement in place, and with meaningful protocol agreements that should soon be in place, China won't be able to use state trading enterprises to arbitrarily restrict and manipulate agricultural trade--and trade in other products--once it enters the WTO. 
   Let me say one final word. When we trade with other countries, we export more that farm equipment, soybeans, or computer chips. We export part of our society. Part of our American values and ideals. This is good for the WTO. It is good for China. It is good for the United States. And I believe it will help keep the peace. 
   Mr. President, we seldom get a real change in Congress to make this a better and safer world. but this is one of those rare moments. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting China's admission to the WTO.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the legislation of my colleague Senator JOHN ASHCROFT to repeal the Social Security earnings limit. Under current law, workers aged 65-69, can earn only up to $17,000 without losing out on their Social Security benefits. This ``earnings limit'' penalizes hard-working seniors by docking them $1 for every $3 of earnings over the limit. In fact, an older worker's entire Social Security benefit could be eliminated by the earnings limit if he or she earns more than $45,944. A few years ago, I worked successfully to increase the limit to $30,000 by 2002. But we can do better. Penalizing older workers sends the wrong message to those who choose to stay in the workforce beyond normal retirement age. And in today's tight labor market, we need to do a better job about recruiting and retaining good employees. In fact, in my state of Iowa, the jobless rate for December was 2.2 percent. That rate is even below the national jobless rate of 4.1 percent. We cannot afford to discourage older Americans who want to work from remaining in the labor market. 
   I am a strong supporter of efforts under way this year to repeal the earnings limit. Eliminating the penalty would help 800,000 older workers who now lose part or all of their benefits simply because they have the will and ability to stay on the job after 65. From my home State alone, many Iowans have contacted me in frustration over the earnings limit. 
   For the first time in years, I am confident we can get the job done once and for all. The proposal has overwhelming bipartisan support from Congress and the White House. We could see swift action on this commonsense proposal. 
   While fixing this inequity in the retirement system will give fair treatment to those ages 65-69 who have paid into the program during their entire working years, it will not address Social Security's long-term demographic challenges. When the baby boom generation comes on board, the revenue and benefit structure will not be able to sustain the obligations under current law. That is why I have worked with six of my Senate colleagues, Senators JUDD GREGG, BOB KERREY, JOHN BREAUX, FRED THOMPSON, CRAIG THOMAS, and CHUCK ROBB, to craft bipartisan Senate reform legislation. Our bill, the ``Bipartisan Social Security Reform Act'' S..1383 is the only reform legislation which has been put forth in the Senate which would make the Social Security trust fund permanently solvent. I will continue to press ahead and work to build a consensus among our colleagues to save Social Security and achieve long-term solvency for generations to come.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes talking about two very important issues, one of which will come before the Senate later on this year, and that is the trade agreement with China which has just been negotiated. We call that permanent normal trading relations. The other subject is the WTO, which is an ongoing situation on which we probably will not take any action--at least negative action--this year, but it is something we always have to consider because every day and every hour there are certain decisions and discussions going on at the World Trade Organization that affect the U.S. economy. 
   On China and the permanent trade relations vote we are going to have, it is very important that we do this right and do it soon but not do it before we have all the information we need. It is also important to get China into the World Trade Organization. 
   We do not vote on China going into the World Trade Organization as a Senate, but it seems to me it is very necessary that we establish China with permanent normal trading relations with the United States in order to set the stage for China to be in the WTO. 
   This is the first time China has agreed to submit itself to international trade disciplines. That, in and of itself, is a very historic and important development. Clearly, China acts in its own national interest and, of course, the United States should act in its own national interest. That is why I say it is most important to our national interest to agree 
   to rules by which we can conduct more open commerce with China. Common sense dictates that it is a win-win situation for the United States since we have few restrictions on imports of China's products into the United States. Basically, it is a no-brainer, as far as I am concerned, to accept their lowering barriers to our exports to that 1-billion-people Nation. 
   As far as the issue of human rights and national security--and they always come up when we discuss this issue with China--I believe the United States  is big enough, the United States is strong enough, we are sophisticated enough, and we are smart enough to serve more than one vital national interest at the same time. 
   In other words, we can be concerned about human rights, we obviously have to be concerned about our national security because no other nation will be, but we can also be concerned about our commerce with other countries, particularly the biggest country in the world, a country that has reduced, through this agreement, barriers for our goods to go to their country; in other words, setting the stage for a more level playing field because we already let a lot of Chinese goods into this country. There are very few restrictions. 
   We can take our commerce into mind, we can take human rights and national security into mind, and we do not have to compromise. We can and must have a national security policy that protects our vital security interests. When there is a breakdown that threatens our security, we must and will fix it. We can and must speak out for the oppressed who cannot speak for themselves, and we can and must advance our interests in open markets and trade liberalization. 
   We can and must do all these things at the same time. We can do this because trade, in and of itself, has so many different dimensions. Through trade, we export more than goods. We export more than manufactured products and services. When we have people-to-people relations that come about through commerce, we export part of our values, part of what makes America great: our American values. 
   We also export, it seems, part of our society. That is why we must engage China commercially. 
   While I would like to see the Senate vote to approve permanent trading relations for China as soon as possible, the timing of this vote is not entirely in the Senate's hands. 
   First, China has to complete its remaining bilateral negotiations, especially with the European Union. The European Union may conclude a bilateral deal with China later this month. But some tough issues still remain between those two giants. So it is not clear when these bilateral talks will end. 
   If China finishes its negotiations with the European Union, China still has to conclude negotiations with 10 other trading partners, as well as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. 
   Second, we have to complete work on the protocols that provide the underpinnings for the United States-China agreement that was signed last November and which is the basis for permanent normal trading relations between the United States and China. Several challenging protocol issues remain to be resolved. 
   In my view, we can only have the permanent normal trading relations vote after all these steps in the process are completed. Senators, including this Senator, of course, will want to carefully review--in fact we have the responsibility to make sure we carefully review--the results of the protocol working party, which may be held in March, and carefully look at all the details before we schedule the permanent normal trading relations vote. 
   As far as the Senate action on normal trading relations is concerned, I expect that every aspect of the agreement be transparent. That means everything besides the protocols--meaning the written protocols, including side letters, oral or even wink-of-the-eye understandings--must be put on the table before the Senate so that each of the 100 Senators are aware of them. That is what I mean when I say transparency. 
   As Senators, we cannot make the same mistake we made with the Canadian Free Trade Agreement, of being oblivious to the side letter, the agreement contents of which have been unfair to our wheat farmers ever since. Senators never knew about that until about 5 or 6 years after the Canadian Free Trade Agreement was voted on by the Senate. That is why, when it comes to normal trading relations with China--and it is very important we approve that agreement--everything has to be on the table. 
   On the issue of the World Trade Organization, the most shocking thing that happened in Seattle--apart from the riots and the mindless destruction--was that there was no consensus to move forward. No agenda was agreed to. This lack of consensus is especially shocking when you consider how much trade has helped bring unprecedented prosperity not only to the United States but around the world. 
   In 1947, when this all started with the first round of multilateral trade negotiations--that was called the Geneva Round--the total world value of trade was only $50 billion. Today, it is $7 trillion. It is hard to think of a moment in history when such prosperity has been generated in such a short period of time. 
   But despite this huge increase in our collective wealth, the world's trade ministers in Seattle could not reach agreement over how to keep this great economic engine going and create even more prosperity that will naturally result not just to the 
   United States but to everybody in the world through freer trade. It does not take a rocket scientist to understand how much greater our national wealth is because of freer trade. Common sense dictates that we should continue down this path. 
   The mandated negotiations on agriculture and services, the so-called building agenda, are now underway in Geneva. We may even have a special agricultural negotiation process to continue the agricultural portions of the talks. But I do not think we will see any quick agreement on the items that were left on the table in Seattle or even on the question of whether to restart the negotiations on drafting a ministerial declaration. 
   Instead, I think we will see, in Geneva, a period of quiet consultation and consensus building. Considering the disaster that took place in Seattle, maybe it is easy to conclude that we do need a period of quiet consultation, and particularly consensus building, because nothing happens in the WTO except by consensus. So if everybody worries about America's interests being compromised at the WTO, just remember, it is done by consensus. If the United States does not agree to it, it will not get done. 
   Seattle, of course, was a huge shock to the World Trade Organization and the process. We must try to restore mutual confidence among all the parties. The negotiators will need some time, perhaps even a few months, to refine their positions after the start of consultations. 
   In summary, I see the next few weeks and months in Geneva as a period where we try to restore faith in the World Trade Organization and in each other and try to rebuild the groundwork for the process of establishing a consensus on trade. Progress may be incremental, but I believe we can achieve it. 
   When it comes right down to it, rebuilding this confidence is not just a job for the WTO or just for our negotiators; it is a challenge we will have to address in the Senate, particularly in the Finance Committee and in my trade subcommittee. 
   How can we get there? I believe there is one way. We must make a moral case for free trade. We must do a better job of making the case that free trade has helped us keep the peace, that free trade has brought freedom and prosperity to millions, that it has helped families and nations attain new levels of economic progress. I believe it is up to Congress to help make the moral case for free trade. The future of our international trading system may depend upon how well we do it. I intend to address this topic of the moral case for free trade many times this year. It may be one of the most important things we do this year in the Senate. 
   Mr. President, I notice there are no other Members who have come to speak, so I ask unanimous consent to continue on my time in morning business to address another issue. I ask unanimous consent for 15 minutes at the most.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to discuss the recent farmer assistance package outlined in the President's budget proposal. It is often the case that these proposals are complicated and difficult  to explain. But this proposal can actually be explained with one word. That word is ``awful.'' The administration's proposal is simply an awful idea. 
   I am not one to usually criticize anybody who brings ideas to the table that in any way will assist American farmers, but in this instance I believe I must call it what it really is--an awful proposal. In fact, I am embarrassed by the administration's proposals. I can think of all the Democratic Senators who have been on this floor over the last year--the last 12 months--who have chastised Republicans for not doing enough to help farmers, and doing it in the right way, being embarrassed by the paltry sum of money the President has included and, more importantly, the complicated formula by which they arrive at this assistance. 
   Just recently, we had the Vice President in Iowa stumping for political support in the famous Iowa caucuses. He told my fellow farmers he supports a ``sound, sensible farm policy.'' Those are his words. If this is what the administration means by ``sensible,'' they should have saved the effort put into this meaningless gesture and left it to individuals who actually know what is going on in rural Iowa and rural America. 
   While our Nation has enjoyed one of the longest periods of economic growth in our history, the agricultural industry has not fared as well in recent years. Just last year, prices of all kinds of livestock and grain commodities were at their lowest levels since the 1970s, and the outlook for next year is mixed at best. According to the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute located at Iowa State University, prices for corn are expected to hover around $2 a bushel this year and soybean prices will average near $4.50 a bushel. Prices have improved somewhat from last year but not significantly, and obviously it is still, at these prices, a losing proposition; in other words, a nonprofitable situation for farmers. 
   Last year, we in the Congress provided $8.7 billion in economic relief and disaster payments, simply keeping our promise we made to the farmers of America under the 1996 farm program of having an adequate safety net for farmers. We were just keeping our promise with that $8.7 billion. That was divided into three or four different parts. The largest part was the Market Loss Assistance Program payments, and these alone were $5.5 billion. 
   The administration's proposal is for $600 million compared to that $5.5 billion. It obviously believes that payments to farmers under the supplemental income assistance program will satisfy rural America's needs in this year of continuing low prices. The proposal definitely shows me and should show every farmer that the administration does not really care what happens to the family farmer. I could speak for hours about its shortcomings, but let me try to boil it down to three major points. Democratic Senators, speaking on the floor of this body last week, condemned this same proposal. I say this so people won't consider this a partisan shot. I associate myself with the remarks of some of those Senators who considered this to be a paltry and complicated approach to helping farmers and the Congress keep its promise to the American farmers made under the 1996 bill, that we would maintain a safety net for our farmers. 
   On the administration's approach, first, it attempts to establish a countercyclical program. The proposal seemingly is based on a system that pays out when the per acre national gross revenue for a crop falls below a set percentage of the 5-year average of the crop's per acre national gross revenue. The significant shortcoming of the administration proposal is that a program based on national revenue will not capture all regional disasters. 
   As an example from my own State of Iowa, everybody remembers the 500-year flood of 1993. It was a disastrous year for the vast majority of my State. Experts described this 500-year flood as something that is never going to occur again. But production throughout the rest of the Nation during the time that it was ruined in Iowa was strong enough that, under the President's proposal, no payment would have been made to Iowans in need of assistance. Iowans would have been left with absolutely no assistance in the midst of one of the worst natural disasters in decades. 
   I also draw awareness to the administration's belief that this grand plan assists small- and medium-sized producers. It does harm to these classes of farmers who, particularly, the other side of the aisle thinks we ought to have so much concern for--and we ought to have. The fact that their administration doesn't give concern to the small- or medium-sized farmer in their plan ought to be an embarrassment to my Democrat 
   colleagues. 
   Well, if the payment was actually triggered and the farmer wasn't drawing more than a $30,000 Agricultural Market Transition payment, the individual would be subject to the $30,000 combined payment cap. This means that the sum of regular AMTA payments plus the payments under the supplemental income assistance program could not exceed $30,000. In my opinion, this program actually hurts the small farmer and mortally wounds the medium-sized farmer. If we want to guarantee the failure of the medium-sized farmer in the Nation, the farmer who is big enough that he doesn't have time to have nonfarm income but not big enough to weather all the natural disasters that one can have or 3 years of low prices, the President's program is the best way to accomplish the failure of the medium-sized farmer in our Nation. 
   It is simple math that brings me to this point. A farmer with a corn base of 600 acres would receive an AMTA payment of approximately $19,800 this year. But if the market crashed and he qualified for the maximum amount of assistance under the administration's proposal, he would only receive an additional $10,200. Regardless of how much money a farmer has lost, the most he could hope to receive is $10,200. 
   In comparison, the same farmer would have received $19,000 in economic assistance last year due to the Market Loss Assistance payment Congress voted late last year. The administration's approach is $9,600 less for that farmer than he could have received under Congress' approach last year. If we were to revisit historic lows this summer, which could trigger the SIAP-type payment that the President is proposing, the small- and medium-sized producers could not receive more than that $30,000 cap. Due to this cap, the administration's approach ultimately limits potential assistance to small- and medium-sized producers. 
   Some people might think I am comparing apples and oranges when I talk about the two packages, but in the end, the important factor is how much aid are we willing to provide to the farmer. The administration has said that assistance wouldn't be paid to the largest producers. But at the end of the day, it is not just the larger growers who will be left out in the cold, it is going to be pretty darn cold for everyone in the middle and chilly for the smaller producers as well. 
   This proposal reminds me of what a number of Iowa pork producers called the ``4-H'' payments. Remember SHOP 1 and SHOP 2 payments to the pork producers last year? Those payments didn't amount to much either. The administration billed that as a significant measure to help pork producers facing abysmal prices, a 60-year low in hog prices last year. Yet today the number of pork producers has dropped by 3,000, since we experienced these historic lows. 
   Ultimately, the largest producers will still have $40,000 due to the AMTA cap, and the smaller guys will have a $30,000 cap, a $10,000 bonus to the larger farmer the President says he does not want to help, compared to what the small- and medium-sized farmer gets. Does it really matter what the assistance is called? Was that the administration's goal, of hurting the smaller and medium-sized farmers? 
   My final point is this: Who is the administration really then trying to help? It is true that farmers with 450 acres or less in corn base could possibly double their AMTA payment. That is the same approach Congress used last year under the administration's proposal. In fact, this is probably a great deal for all those producers with 100 acres or less. 
   But the fact is that a person who is farming 450 acres or less is probably, to make ends meet, also engaged in some occupation other than farming. 
   I am not saying that most farmers don't have jobs off the farm. In today's  economy, more and more farmers are taking jobs off the farm just to help pay the bills. But as I see it, the medium-sized producer, the producers with 500 to 1,000 acres, are almost entirely dependent upon the profitability of their crops. If they don't receive much-needed assistance, they are probably going to have a hard time staying on the farm, and the administration's proposal does almost nothing to help these individuals. 
   Now, as I indicated earlier, this is by no means a complete list of all the problems with the administration's approach, but these are a few of the issues that I expect Congress will have to consider. The fact is that if the administration really wants to help farmers, it will immediately announce it will block any efforts to waive the Clean Air Act's oxygenated requirements by the Environmental Protection Agency. If the President would do just this, ethanol can replace MTBE, which is poisoning the ground water now, and it would increase farm income by $1 billion per year--it would do it from the marketplace, not from the Federal Treasury--and create 13,000 new jobs in America in the process. 
   The Senate may not be able to unilaterally agree upon exactly what should be done to assist family farmers this year, but I think we can probably agree that the administration's proposal is off base and, most frankly, out of touch with real America. It does not accomplish the goals that they want to accomplish of saving the small and medium-sized farmers and not helping the well-off farmer. 
   So I look forward to working with my constituents, various agricultural groups, commodity groups, and my colleagues in Congress to give family farmers the economic security that they deserve. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of an extraordinary and courageous young lady. Emily Ann Jordt, daughter of Bill and Deb Jordt of Hinton, Iowa, passed away on March 15, 1999, after fighting cancer for three years. My heart is heavy for the Jordt family. No one would disagree that cancer is a devastating illness. However, when cancer touches the life of a child, it seems an especially harsh reality. I know from personal experience the difficulties that follow a cancer diagnosis. My wife, Barbara, is a breast cancer survivor and we believe early detection saved her life. I have long supported biomedical research, and Emily's story reminds all of us the importance of remaining vigilant in providing funding for cancer research. To quote Emily, ``We can do this together.'' It is my hope that by sharing Emily's story with my colleagues in the Senate, Emily's memory may be truly honored. 
   Emily's Story--A Life of Strength and Courage 
   Emily was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma, an aggressive childhood cancer, in 1996 when she was only nine years old. While this cancer is usually found in muscle tissue in an extremity, Emily's was in her jaw and neck. Emily was frightened. Her grandfather had died of lung cancer. Emily came to understand that there were many kinds of cancers, and that not everyone dies of this disease. Emily joined her family and doctors in what was to become a three-year fight for her life. 
   Emily had surgery to remove a tumor below her lower right jaw. Her best chance for remission was simultaneous radiation and chemotherapy treatment. Even though interruptions in the harsh protocol were needed for her body to recover, radiation was completed, and chemotherapy resumed. 
   After radiation Emily had difficulty with muscles of her tongue and throat. A feeding tube was surgically implanted and she used a suction machine to clear her throat and airways. She bravely adjusted to this life-style. 
   Emily dearly loved school. She maintained an A-B average throughout her illness. She played trumpet in the school band. When a facial nerve was impaired because of surgery, she switched to percussion and continued on. She served as a customer representative of the Westerner Bank in her school. She was an ardent fundraiser for school projects. Her classmates regarded her as a peacemaker. 
   Emily played soccer in a YMCA league throughout her treatment. She loved the sport. She was back on the soccer field and played most of a full game only 11 days after having major surgery to remove the tumor a second time. 
   Emily planned and presented a writer's workshop entitled ``Getting through the Tough Stuff'' where she encouraged young people her age to use writing as a vehicle to deal with the difficult challenges of life and be sensitive and caring to others. 
   Picture a nine-year-old presenting her concerns about and suggestions for pediatric  care to the Board of Directors of the hospital where she spent a great deal of time. Emily did it. She believed that one person can make a difference. And Emily did make a difference. 
   Emily was active in 4-H, serving as vice-president of her club. She chose many categories in which to participate, everything from showing her 4-month old filly to playing the piano in Share the Fun. She presented a written and visual display of items used throughout her surgeries and treatment. For this she was awarded an Outstanding Junior Achievement Ribbon. 
   Emily took an active part in Relay for Life in her county. She served as Junior Chairperson, giving a speech the night of the event. She enlisted the help of her classmates and teachers to help publicize events. 
   As only a child can, Emily leaned on her faith to see her through. Church was important to Emily. She took communion instruction, participated in youth group activities, sang and provided special music for worship. She willingly served church dinners. She helped to organize a basketball team and enlisted a neighbor to be their coach. This team won the Good Sportsmanship trophy. 
   Emily maintained a positive and determined attitude. When traditional treatments became ineffective, she willingly tried non-traditional methods. She clung to the hope that she would again be as normal as the other kids. While the disease took her life on March 15, 1999, it could not crush her spirit. It was that very same spirit that caused her to fight to the very end. 
   Emily fought this illness for three long years, showing that with strength, determination, and courage, life is to be lived. Emily strongly believed the scripture verses that say, ``Let the children come to me for such is the kingdom of God,'' and ``A Child Shall Lead.'' Let us capture the essence of Emily's spirit, follow her lead, and make a difference.  
   In Memory and Celebration of the Life of Emily Ann Jordt, February 15, 1987-March 15, 1999 
   Emily's life is meant to be more than just one more sad account of how a child, a person, died from cancer. It is meant to make us uncomfortable. It is meant to make us weep. Then, it is meant to make us determined to act--to do something. 
   Finding a cure for cancer is a very difficult but not impossible task. What is needed to do that? An open mind. When we keep our minds open, ideas and possibilities can flow. One of Emily's favorite movies as a young child was Cinderella. In that movie we hear the line, ``Impossible things are happening every day.'' 
   As lawmakers, do not tie the hands of researchers because dollars are limited. Do not tie the hands of researchers from exploring avenues that may be out of the ordinary. 
   Emily did not care about the insurance companies and the drug companies playing the games that they play to control what happens to people's lives. What she cared about was playing soccer, learning, sharing her talents, having birthday parties, being a friend, all the things that children do best. 
   We must listen to her story with renewed commitment of why most of you were elected, to make a difference. 
   Emily continues to make a difference each time her story is told. Her video continues to play at fundraisers for Children's Miracle Network. Each time ``Em's Environmental Mobile Lab'' (that was purchased through memorials and a grant) is taken on site to provide hands on learning for the students at Akron-Westfield Community School, Emily continues to make a difference. When the CEO of the hospital where Emily spent so much times says, ``I am a different person because of what Emily has taught me and that will make me a better CEO,'' you know that Emily has truly made a difference! 
   Have you made that kind of difference? Emily sacrificed her life so that we, you and I, might see more clearly what our job is. 
   A phrase that Emily and her family adopted as their motto is, ``We can do this together.'' We as her family and friends are making a difference by addressing you as our representatives. Now, It is your chance to make a difference, to vote for additional funding for cancer research, and to clear the way for the impossible to happen. 
   ``Let us capture the essence of Emily's spirit, follow her lead, and make a difference.''

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might consume. I hope my friend, Senator HATCH, will debate the fine points of the law with the Senator from New York because I am not a lawyer. I have strong feelings on the issue of abortion which do not have to be expressed today. My friend, the Senator from New York, has opposite views on that issue and he has not expressed them and does not have to express them as far as this amendment is concerned. I oppose this amendment simply because it is not needed. 
   First, I will comment on the possibility of the Vice President of the United States having to vote today to break a tie. I predict that if the Vice President is in town and this vote is that close, the Vice President will be here and will have an opportunity to cast that vote. If the Vice President is in town to break a tie, there is going to be at least one person who supports that amendment who is going to vote against it just so we can have a tie vote, just so the President can cast his vote because the Vice President running for President of the United States is not going to break into his schedule with the tight vote he had in New Hampshire last night and avoid campaigning in the other States and waste his time here if he does not actually have to cast that vote. 
   We are in for not only political moments on this issue, but we are in for some very constitutional moments on this issue as well. 
   I like the theater that is going on this morning. We have seen it at least once before, and we may see it several times between now and November. I do not blame the people on the other side for creating this theater because I think the Vice 
    President is going to need it between now and the November election if he intends to be elected President of the United States.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. I give the Senator from New York and all the other people on the other side of the aisle the benefit of the doubt, but as a matter of constitutional fact, there is always some theater when the Vice President has to cast a tie-breaking vote. Also, there is some justification for what I said, not based upon what I know is going to happen this time but what I have seen happen in the past. 
   The other thing I want to tell the Senator from New York, regardless of what I said about the theater, I want to base my remarks upon what I think is unneeded legislation. This gets to some of the finer points of law that I am not going to argue and debate with the Senator from New York because he would say under certain circumstances, because of intent or because of court orders, the necessity to go back to State courts, his amendment 
    will enhance the protection of people about whom he is concerned. Those are not serious considerations. His amendment is not needed. 
   First of all, it is very necessary to say, and I hope the Senator from New York will not take offense with this, that we would not even be debating this amendment or anything with bankruptcy if he had his way because he was one of those who voted against the bankruptcy legislation. I do not fault the Senator from New York for doing that. That is, obviously, his right. 
   He can say he wants bankruptcy legislation and he voted against it because this amendment was not included or maybe he is against bankruptcy generally, but the fact is that he voted against the bankruptcy reform bill we have before us. 
   People who generally do not want a bankruptcy reform bill have proposed some pretty politically sensitive amendments--and this is one of them--that are basically a distraction from the real issue of why we need bankruptcy reform. I do not need to repeat what I said yesterday, such as we have had a 100-percent increase in personal bankruptcies over the last 7 or 8 years. From that standpoint, we have a very serious social and economic problem with which we have to deal, and particularly the way the present bankruptcy code is written, the amendment is not needed. I want to state why it is not needed because my colleagues are entitled to know. 
   I hope a lot of the people in this Chamber who want a bankruptcy reform bill will view this amendment in its proper context of being proposed as a distraction from the real issues of bankruptcy reform, particularly since I am going to convince them that this amendment is not needed based upon the way the present law is written. 
   But putting aside the obvious political nature of the amendment, this amendment should fail on its merits. The amendment would make judgments resulting from violent as well as nonviolent activities engaged in by pro-life activists nondischargeable in chapter 7 bankruptcy. 
   The amendment does not provide for the same treatment for violent or nonviolent activities engaged in by pro-choice activists. In other words, this amendment does not even pretend to be fair and balanced. It is an effort aimed only at one side of this very hot political debate that is known as the abortion debate. I do not think the Senate should change bankruptcy policy in such a one-sided way. 
   But the amendment does not even accomplish its one-sided goal. The amendment only affects chapter 7 bankruptcy. So I want to give you a second reason for being against it, based upon the fact that it fails on its own merits. Since it only affects chapter 7 bankruptcy, there is another way that people who are affected by this amendment, who want to go into bankruptcy to protect themselves, can do it. They can do that through chapter 13 because the amendment does not make any new debts nondischargeable in chapter 13. So any of the people to whom the Senator from New York refers to that his amendment is necessary for could file under chapter 13, pay pennies on the dollar, and walk away from debt. 
   As I said when I voted on this amendment in the Judiciary Committee, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has concluded that court judgments resulting from violations of the FACE Act are already nondischargeable in chapter 7 under politically neutral provisions of section 523 of the code. This amendment, the Congressional Research Service says, isn't needed. 
   Finally, it is worth noting that some Senators on the Democratic side have been very critical of making new categories of nondischargeable debts. If you listen to the White House--and we have listened to the White House quite a bit on this bill and have tried to satisfy people by making changes in it that have not hurt our general approach--if you listen to these same people, who have been listened to by me and other people in this body who want bankruptcy reform, you hear that anytime you create nondischargeable debts, the collection of child support suffers. I will bet the Senator from New York has made this same point on other nondischargeable debts concerning child support. 
   Some of those concerns have been very legitimate. We have responded to them. I guess I would have to say, from where I started 2 years ago on this legislation, I have been educated on some of the writing of our original bill to make those changes so that we make child support No. 1 in our considerations in bankruptcy courts. 
   But the White House, regardless, is saying nondischargeable debts make collection of child support much more difficult. But here we have an amendment from the minority to create a nondischargeable debt. So based on the arguments of the White House, this amendment should be rejected because it hurts child support claimants. 
   This is a very serious inconsistency on the part of people, particularly on the other side of the aisle, in proposing this amendment. The fact is, bankruptcy reform is so popular with the American people, so popular with Members of the Senate, that those who oppose real bankruptcy reform look for distractions, 
   distractions based on the merits of their amendment, based on their opposition to the legislation, but also a needless distraction. 
   If, in their good conscience, they believe their amendment is needed, it in fact isn't needed because our bankruptcy code already deals, in a nonpolitical way, with these political questions that people believe can only be responded to by making one more thing nondischargeable. 
   This amendment is, on balance, a distraction and should fail for the reason it was offered. But, most importantly, it should fail on its merits. The merits just do not call for its adoption. I have expressed my views on that.  
   I yield the floor and ask our people to vote against it.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. I wish to respond to what the Senator from Massachusetts spoke about so passionately. I probably do not speak with the same passion he does, but I do want to say that he has it completely wrong. You cannot ignore the fact that since 1980 bankruptcies have increased from around 330,000 in that year to just under 1.4 million in 1999. That is a fact that cannot be ignored. 
   Consequently, it seems to me to be completely wrong for some other Senator to say we do not have a bankruptcy problem in the United States. Congress ought to deal with it, and changing the law will help. I do not pretend changing the law is going to entirely respond to that problem, but the extent to which it does, we should do it because this increase in bankruptcies is a huge increase. The small dip in the filings that Senator KENNEDY has referred to will not erase this very basic, fundamental problem we have in our economy with the bankruptcy laws. We have a real bankruptcy crisis on our hands. We cannot ignore that.  
   Perhaps the Senator from Massachusetts does not remember what his own President said in the State of the Union Address. The President of the United States said, just a few days ago, these are prosperous times. People are not in bankruptcy then because of hard times. If this is a problem when we have very prosperous times, what sort of a bankruptcy problem are we going to have when we have a recession or a depression? 
   One other point that the Senator from Massachusetts spent a great deal of time on is how he sees the problems of minimum wage in this bill. There is a minimum wage increase in this bill. It isn't there because we Republicans sought to join minimum wage with the bankruptcy bill. We were going to debate minimum wage at another time. We were going to increase minimum wage at another time, but it was the Democratic Party that made a decision to put minimum wage on the bankruptcy bill. 
   I do not even like nongermane things being included on other pieces of legislation, but it is a pattern too often adopted and too readily accepted in the Senate. So it is done. But on this side of the aisle, I argued that we should not mix minimum wage with bankruptcy. I do not want the weight of that issue, as important as increasing the minimum wage is, with the issue of reforming the bankruptcy code. But on the other side of the aisle they chose to do it. So what do we hear? 
   Now we are hearing complaints about the minimum wage bill on the bankruptcy bill. We are hearing threats about instructing conferees to do something about it. If it is a problem, it is a problem because the other side of the aisle made it a problem by including it. I remind them that they ought to be very careful what they wish for because sometimes they get it. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts has asked who will win and who will lose. Under this bill, the honest American people, who have to pay the higher prices because other people go into bankruptcy and do not pay their bills--because we have deadbeats out there--are the ones who will win by this legislation. 
   We still preserve the historic principle of our bankruptcy laws that some people who are in debt, through no fault of their own, are entitled to a fresh start. But when it comes to this basic principle of economics that there is no free lunch, there is no free lunch in bankruptcy, either. Somebody pays. 
   In this particular instance, the honest American consumer is paying $400, for a family of four, to cover debts of somewhere between $30 billion and $50 billion a year that go unpaid because of people who ought to be paying their bills. Worse yet, we have a situation where some people who do have the ability to pay their bills are not paying their bills, either. We are sending a clear signal that those who have the ability to pay are not going to get off scot-free. 
   I relinquish the remainder of our time. Hopefully, we can proceed, then, to the next amendment.

So I send it to the desk and ask unanimous consent that the amendment be modified and that the modified amendment be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table. If necessary, I ask unanimous consent to lay the pending amendment aside.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to take this particular time to not speak on either one of the amendments before us but to speak about the necessity of passing this bill. Because we have votes on two or three amendments and then final passage, I will not take the time of the Senate at the time of final passage. 
   As we prepare for final passage on this bankruptcy bill, I remind all my colleagues what we are voting for and on. The most fundamental question we face with this bill is whether or not people should repay their debts. 
   This bill says that when someone can repay their debts, they are not going to be able to take the easy way out. This bill will end the free ride for wealthy freeloaders and deadbeats who walk away from their debts and pass the bill on to the rest of us, to the consumers, who are honest and who should not pick up the tab for those who are not. 
   We have a real bankruptcy crisis in need of action. This bill does it without violating the principle that people who are entitled to a fresh start have that fresh start. 
   As a result of an amendment offered by Senator TORRICELLI and myself, this bill contains the most sweeping, wide-ranging set of consumer protections the Senate has enacted in a long time. 
   Those of us from farm country have an extra reason to vote for this bill since it contains crucial protections for family farmers who may face bankruptcy due to low commodity prices. Chapter 12 will expire in June unless we pass this bill. Under this bill, farmers in chapter 12 will get significant tax relief when they sell off assets. 
   Mr. President, this bill is fair and balanced and deserves to be passed by an overwhelming vote.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. If the Senator from Georgia will yield. I can assure him that during the conference with the House on S. 625, I will in good faith address the Judicial Conference's recommendation for the additional judgeships. The hearing in November was indeed useful in helping us assess the merits of authorizing these additional judgeships. Subsequent to that hearing, my staff and I have engaged in discussions with the Administrative Office to clarify some remaining questions and concerns. I can report that most of my requests have been satisfactorily addressed. However, I am still awaiting some additional information, and so I am reluctant to add these positions to S. 625 at this time.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senate has taken an important step toward real bankruptcy reform on a bipartisan basis. None of this would have been possible without the hard work and cooperation of the ranking member on the subcommittee, Senator TORRICELLI. We introduced the bill together. 
   We have a good bill that will restore personal responsibility and crack down on abuses of debt collectors and provide key information to credit card customers about the problems of minimum payment. 
   I believe we go into conference in a strong position. I think our bill in the Senate is better than the House companion. We will have a spirited conference, I believe, but this year will be easier than last year since the bills are much closer. 
   In any event, the Senate has done a good job. I thank Senators HATCH, SESSIONS, REID, TORRICELLI, BIDEN, and LEAHY for the strong support they showed for reform. 
   I also thank Rene Augustine and Makan Delrahim of Senator HATCH's staff; Jennifer Leach and Eric Shuffler of Senator TORRICELLI's staff; Jim Greene of Senator BIDEN's staff; Eddie Ayoob of Senator REID's staff; and Kolan Davis and John McMickle of my own staff for their hard work on this bill. 
   I also thank Ed Haden and Sean Costello of Senator SESSIONS' staff. 
   Of course, this bill would not be here if not for Senator REID working with us on the floor and Senators HATCH and LEAHY helping steer this very difficult bill through the Senate as they helped get it out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Of course, in this regard, I also thank the people who supported our legislation. 
   Most important, if anybody had asked me when we adjourned last year if we could have passed the bill this early this year, if at all, I would have  been very pessimistic about it. But because of the cooperation we have had on the other side of the aisle, it was possible. Once again, in a very generic sense, I thank all who made this a bipartisan effort and made it possible to accomplish this goal. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is always a pleasure to listen to the Senator from Minnesota because whether he is right or wrong, he always speaks with a great deal of passion. I want people who have ideas to have passion for those ideas. Senator WELLSTONE is a person who speaks with a great deal of passion and conviction. 
   I disagree with a lot of the points he has made; otherwise, we would not have this legislation before us. On the other hand, on the subject of concentration, which he brought up, I have some sympathy for what he has said. The solution to the concentration problem is we should get this administration to vigorously enforce the antitrust laws both within the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. There is a general feeling among people about whether the marketplace is working adequately and, consequently, support the antitrust laws. The antitrust laws are well written and have withstood a period of time, but enforcement is very much an issue. 
   We are not talking about concentration, and we are not talking about enforcement of the antitrust laws when we deal with bankruptcy. We have a very real problem. We have seen a dramatic increase in bankruptcies over the last 6 or 7 years. In 1993, we had 875,202 bankruptcies, and in 1998, it shot up to 1,442,549. 
   We have seen this dramatic increase in the number of bankruptcies during one of the most prosperous times in the history of our country. It has been the most prosperous for several reasons: One, information technology is helping to expand our economy and make it more efficient than ever before. 
   The globalization of our economy has also reduced consumer costs, giving consumers more money to expend on other things. We have seen Congress balance the budget in the last 3 years, and it worked toward that for the last 6 years and made considerable progress. Now we are paying down the national debt for the third year in a row. All that has contributed to it. 
   We are in the 18th year of economic expansion, which started in the second year of Ronald Reagan's administration. We had a turnaround in the economy after the stagflation of the seventies, and except for a 6-month period of time in 1992, we have had 18 years of economic expansion. During that period of economic expansion, we have had this very dramatic increase in bankruptcies. 
   Why? I wish I could say there is just one reason, as the Senator from Minnesota seems to imply; that it is credit being extended too easily, too many credit cards. I agree that is a reason, but that is only one of the reasons. 
   Another reason is we have a bankruptcy bar that has, quite frankly, encouraged bankruptcies. We have shown during previous debates on this bill where bankruptcy lawyers in California advertise in the media how to get out of paying alimony and child support by going into bankruptcy. These types of practices, obviously, are not ethical but are still being used. 
   We also have the bad example set by the Federal Government of 30 years of deficit spending. If Uncle Sam can borrow money into the trillions of dollars over a period of 30 years, isn't it all right for Mary Smith and Tom Jones or the people who are working in Anywhere USA to go into debt as well? Uncle Sam did not set a very good example. Congress, doing the fiscal policy for Uncle Sam, did not set a very good example. It says to others: Yes, it's OK for you to go in debt. 
   The Federal Government has turned that around in 3 years by balancing the budget and paying down some of the national debt and is on the road to paying down the national debt very dramatically over the next 10 to 15 years. 
   We also have a situation where somehow financial responsibility is not considered a personal responsibility anymore. In other words, it is OK to go into debt and not pay your bills. There used to be a certain amount of shame connected with bankruptcy that does not seem to be there now. 
   I gave four reasons--and there may be a lot more--of why we are probably in this situation where we have had 18 years of economic expansion since the second year of the Reagan administration and yet have a historically high number of bankruptcies, and during the best years of our economy, we have seen bankruptcies almost double in a period of 6 or 7 years. 
   Consequently, we have this legislation before us. I do not disregard the words of the Senator from Minnesota that there are some people who are vulnerable and for whom we need to be concerned, but I say to the Senator from Minnesota, we are not extinguishing the principle that has been a part of the bankruptcy law for the last 102 years, permanent bankruptcy legislation. There are segments of our population in bad financial trouble, through no fault of their own, who need the help of bankruptcy. That could be death, divorce, a lot of medical expenses, a natural disaster, for instance, if you are a farmer or some other small businessperson, or maybe even a homeowner who had a natural disaster that was not properly insured. 
   Our code says there are select groups of people who are in a bad financial situation, through no fault of their own, who should have a fresh start. I say to the Senator from Minnesota and all the other Senators who question this legislation, we keep that principle, but we also say this Congress has to send a clear signal to the 270 million people in this country that if you have the ability to repay some or all of your debt, you are not going to get off scot-free. There are large numbers of people who are getting off scot-free, albeit they may be a minority, but they are a significant minority, and it does not set a very good example for some people to be able to use the bankruptcy code as part of financial planning. 
   We are saying to those who can repay that they have to repay, but we are also sending a signal through this legislation to credit card companies that are willy-nilly sending out credit cards that encourage bankruptcy or even a lack of personal responsibility. 
   We are saying it has to be a new day. We want to discourage those people who maybe are low income, who should not have gotten, through their own fault, into debt, and are not in the classification of people who I say are entitled to a fresh start--that somehow they should think again about going into bankruptcy and only use bankruptcy as a last resort.  
   We find that the 1978 law, obviously, has contributed some to the big increase in bankruptcies. This legislation passed by a very wide margin. So I do not think it was intended that the 1978 law ought to make it easier to go into bankruptcy. But, obviously, it sent that signal to a lot of people in America, as we have seen that the number of bankruptcies in 1980 was only 331,000 and now 18 years later, in 1998, the figures are 1,442,000. 
   Something has happened recently. Again, I do not pretend to stand before the American people, or my colleagues in the Senate, and say passing a law is going to solve all these problems. I wish it would. It is going to be a combination of several things: the credit card companies or credit-granting companies to be more careful in who they grant credit to; a Congress to be financially responsible and, hence, set a good example for every taxpayer and citizen in this country that debt isn't OK; the bankruptcy bar to be a little more careful about encouraging people to go into bankruptcy and not to advertise that bankruptcy is OK as a way out; and then the law itself, by discouraging people who can repay to use the bankruptcy code for financial planning. 
   In this whole process, I hope we then enhance personal responsibility. By enhancing personal responsibility, then we can reduce these numbers of bankruptcies and then reduce the economic problem we have--because we are not talking about something that does not make an impact upon everybody. 
   Some people have put this at a $40 billion problem--$40 billion owed by those who go into bankruptcy and do not pay. Then every other consumer in America picks up part of that tab. We have no doubt about it, if you are shoplifting, the honest consumer, who does not shoplift, is going to pay the cost of shoplifting. This is somewhat the same. If you are a businessperson, and somebody does not pay their bills by declaring bankruptcy, the honest person buying goods from that same business is going to pick up the tab. And $400, on average, for a family of four, is what we pay for other people who do not pay. 
   We hope to enhance personal responsibility. We hope to help the economy in the process. But most importantly, this is something that must be dealt with, and I think this legislation deals with it. 
   That is the background for this legislation. I think it is necessary to give some of that background, as I respond to some of the specific issues that the Senator from Minnesota brought up. 
   First of all, he mentioned the point that there has been some decline in the rate of growth of bankruptcies in recent years. We think that is true. It is a little bit too early to make that judgment. I hope it is true. I think it is a direct result of Congress talking about this horrible economic problem we have of $40 billion and the lack of personal responsibility which goes with that economic problem. Perhaps it is sending signals to some of the consumers to think twice about whether bankruptcy is the right direction to go in. Maybe it sent a signal to some of the bankruptcy lawyers in America to counsel people not to go into bankruptcy. 
   I hope the leadership of this Congress over the last 3 years, in discussing this legislation--actually having passed it in the last Congress in both Houses, but not getting the final product to the President in time before adjournment--has done some good. 
   So we have had a very modest decline in bankruptcies in 1999 as compared to 1998. But if you take the historical look--and I have referred to some of those figures since 1980--Senator WELLSTONE's point that the bankruptcy crisis is going away turns out to be false. I have referred to the 330,000 bankruptcies we had in 1980, the year the new code went into effect. But that has gone up to just under 1.4 million in 1999. Unlike the Senator from Minnesota, I think 1.4 million bankruptcies per year is a real crisis. 
   In the past, in the middle 1980s, and even once during the 1990s, we have had some minor dips in the bankruptcy filings; but since then, as I have referred to, we have had this dramatic increase, almost doubling, in the last 6 or 7 years.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator from Minnesota also made reference to some changes in the bankruptcy code that were made by Senator Dole in 1984 which allowed judges to dismiss chapter 7 cases in cases of--these are the words from the statute--``substantial abuse'' of the bankruptcy code. 
   I spoke to this point a week ago. Obviously, the Senator from Minnesota did not have an opportunity to hear my remarks. But he would have heard me state, in detail, how the 1984 legislation has not worked at all, regardless of its good intentions. Because under the 1984 legislation, creditors are banned by law from bringing evidence of abuse to the attention of the judge. 
   Here we have a law that says if there is substantial abuse of the bankruptcy code, then the judge can determine that that certain bankrupt does not have a right to be in bankruptcy court. But then we have another section that says creditors who might know about this abuse cannot bring evidence of that abuse to bankruptcy court. 
   So it seems that the 1984 legislation was designed not to work. We correct that in this legislation by making it possible for people to bring evidence of such substantial abuse to the bankruptcy judge, for it to be considered, and if the judge agrees, then that person cannot continue to abuse the public at large by making misuse of the bankruptcy courts to get out of paying debt. 
   I also remember the Senator saying that tightening bankruptcy law will not reduce the costs of bankruptcy. All I can say is, the Clinton administration's own Treasury Secretary, Larry Summers, said in one of our hearings that reducing bankruptcies could help reduce interest rates. And what helps lower-income people more in America than reducing interest rates? 
   It really helps the very people the Senator from Minnesota speaks of as being vulnerable and as a class of citizens about whom we should all have concern, and I believe all do have concern. 
   I have an example of a vulnerable person at the other end, a person who has been substantially harmed by somebody who went into bankruptcy. It isn't just people who go into debt who are vulnerable and can be hurt by bankruptcy; there are a lot of other hard-working people who are hurt by other people who go into bankruptcy. I hope this body will remember that every abusive bankruptcy hurts scores of Americans. 
   I will read, without using names, from a constituent in Keokuk, IA, writing to me about the need for the passage of this legislation. She had read a headline in the local paper that said: The Senate may toughen bankruptcy laws. 
   ``My son''--I will not use the name--``works for a local electric company as a meter reader full time during the day and then goes right to work nearly every evening and on Saturdays with his own growing washing, vacuuming business. He works so hard to do a good job for his customers. He takes his responsibilities as a father of five very seriously. During the last 3 to 4 months, he has been doing a job for an out-of-town gentleman.'' Then the last name is given. ``I believe he is in the Des Moines area. I have learned that he has several businesses and is known to be a crook.'' That is why I don't want to use the names; I don't know whether  he is a crook or not, but that is the writer's judgment. 
   ``Of course--then she uses the name of her son--'' had no idea about this person's background, but he eagerly wanted the work and took the work. He felt especially good about it because one of his men is very poor, one of the workers he hires for his moonlighting business, and so he turned the job over to him so he could make extra money. 
   ``The sorry ending of this story is, as you might have guessed, just last week Kenny called the original hiring company where Kenny works directly doing cleanup jobs. And before he could talk to the manager about not being paid by this gentleman from Des Moines, Mike told Kenny that he had just called to inform him that he had declared bankruptcy. He owed Kenny over $3,600. To him, this might as well have been $36,000 because of some new, very expensive equipment purchased to be able to handle the additional work. 
   ``Something must be done to keep crooks from sticking hard-working people like my son, who associate with him in good faith, from dropping the hatchet--you know the numbers when it comes to poor management--and then take the easy way out at everyone else's expense.'' Then in capital letters: ``It is wrong and it should not be allowed.'' 
   So there are hard-working mothers and fathers in America, I say to the Senator from Minnesota, who are vulnerable and hurt by other people who take advantage of them and go into bankruptcy. 
   On another point the Senator from Minnesota made, perhaps he isn't aware that the organization of prosecutors who enforce child support says this bill, S. 625, will help women and children who are owed child support. On this point, in fact, there is no point. Both parties have worked hard on this legislation in the compromises that have taken place over the last 2 or 3 years. We are not going to let people use the bankruptcy code to get out of paying child support. Yet we are 
   still hearing, this very day, that old argument that may have had some credibility 2 or 3 years ago but that we had taken care of almost that long ago because it was a very important point raised. But those points are still being made. 
   So I ask my colleagues, as they consider that point made by the Senator from Minnesota, to whom are you going to listen: The people who actually collect child support--that is, the organization of prosecutors who enforce child support who say this is a good bill and will help women and children--or are you going to listen to Washington special interest think tanks that are using smoke and mirrors to say this bill will make it more difficult to collect child support? I think those who prosecute know the difficulty of collecting that. I hope my colleagues will listen to the prosecutors who get child support who say this bill will help women and children. 
   Finally, I wish the Senator from Minnesota had at least mentioned title II, subtitle A, which is entitled: Abusive Creditor Practices. We know creditors can be abusive, and we address that problem to make sure there is a level playing field between creditors and debtors when it comes to the bankruptcy courts. We have numerous new consumer protections. Understand, there are some customers who don't want to go into bankruptcy, and they try to negotiate with their creditor to avoid going to court. That is a good step we want to preserve and encourage. But if that customer then has to declare bankruptcy because of not being able to negotiate, then the creditor is severely limited in his ability to collect that debt. To me, this is real consumer protection that should not be forgotten as we vote on this legislation. 
   I will now turn to a specific amendment the Senator from Minnesota is offering as well and to oppose his amendment that is referred to as the payday loan. For those who don't know, this type of loan happens when a borrower gives a personal check to someone else and that person gives the borrower cash in an amount less than the amount of the personal check. The check isn't cashed if the borrower redeems the check for its full value within 2 weeks. The fact is that payday loans are completely legal transactions in many States. If a financial transaction is explicitly legal under State law, to me, it isn't wise that we use the bankruptcy code to try to undo that transaction. 
   First of all, using the bankruptcy code for this purpose leads to perverse results because the only people who will receive any benefit or relief will be those who file for bankruptcy. Then you have all those other people who are using payday loans who never file for bankruptcy. These people who have taken out loans but don't take the easy way out in bankruptcy court will still have to pay back their loan. 
   So if this is a problem, it seems to me the Senator from Minnesota ought to work to help everybody, not only those who go into bankruptcy court. Then you also have the perverse result of people who don't have the money to file for bankruptcy who will have to pay the loan as agreed. Even if you share Senator WELLSTONE's distaste for payday loans, this amendment won't benefit the poorest of the poor because most of the poorest of the poor don't seek bankruptcy relief. 
   Earlier during the course of the debate, my colleague from Utah, Senator HATCH, sought to include language in an amendment that would have changed the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. This act is in the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. At that very time, the ranking Democrat on the Banking Committee, the Senator from Maryland, indicated that he would not consent to allowing changes to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act on a bankruptcy bill. So to be fair, then, the portion of Senator WELLSTONE's amendment changing the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act should be stricken out in deference to the jurisdictional objections that have been lodged by the ranking Democrat on the Banking Committee. So I am asking Senator WELLSTONE to listen to the arguments of his fellow Democrat about jurisdiction and respect the jurisdiction of the particular committees. 
   If the Senator from Minnesota doesn't want to honor this objection, I think his proposed changes to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act represent poor policy at least. His amendment would not say that lenders can't offer payday loans. His amendment would say that you aren't allowed to use State courts to collect the debt, even if the debt is completely legal under that same State law. In fact, the State of Minnesota specifically allows payday loans, as does my home State of Iowa. I don't think the Federal Government has any business telling State judges they can't enforce debts that are fully legal under the laws of that particular State. I would have confidence in my State legislature correcting this economic and social problem, if it is one in our State. I haven't studied it enough to know whether it is, but I have confidence that my State legislators would correct that. I hope the Senator from Minnesota has the same confidence that his State legislators know what is best for Minnesota, not those of us in the Congress of the United States. 
   I also think this amendment would have the effect of making it harder for the poor and those with bad credit histories to gain access to cash--the very people the Senator from Minnesota is so concerned about because, in his words, ``they are so vulnerable.'' People who use payday loans simply can't get loans through traditional sources because they are too risky, so a payday loan may be the only way they can get quick cash to pay for family emergencies or essential home and auto repairs. 
   I know the intentions of my good friend from Minnesota are honorable, but the effect of this amendment would be to make it harder for poor people to get help when they need that help the most. I hope this amendment by the Senator from Minnesota will be defeated.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I had a chance to listen very closely to what  the Senator from Michigan said. As the sponsor of the amendment, he ought to have the attention of those of us who oppose his amendment. 
   I say that this amendment detracts some from the purpose of the legislation. Maybe it is meant to. To the extent it is, I hope people will vote against it. To the extent that people see this as a legitimate part of what we are debating, then I would offer this point. I am going to offer more than one point very central to the amendment, and then I will stick to my remarks. But the fact is there is a way to handle this problem to make sure that these companies don't get off scot-free. 
   I am going to refer to a product that Senator Heflin from Alabama--before he retired from the Senate--and I worked very closely on, which was bankruptcy legislation. During the years he and I served together--I think 14 or 16 years--during that period of time when we were in the majority on this side, I chaired the committee and he was the ranking minority member. When his party was in control, he was chairman and I was the ranking minority member. I am going to refer to some legislation we were able to get passed in 1994 when he was chairman of the committee. I think it is a thoughtful and bipartisan way to deal with this. 
   First of all, I believe this amendment proposed by the Senator from Michigan is unsound as a matter of policy. Congress has previously dealt with difficult questions of what to do about companies facing massive tort liability and then filing for bankruptcy. We dealt with this, as I indicated, in a bipartisan way, and I think in a way that had a great deal of thought behind it. 
   In 1994, I worked with Chairman Heflin to create a very specific process for asbestos companies that were filing for bankruptcy as a result of a massive number of lawsuits against asbestos manufacturers by those people who had asbestosis. Senator Heflin and I wanted to help these companies continue as an ongoing business concern, but we also wanted to ensure that the victims of asbestos-related illnesses wouldn't be left out in the cold. 
   In the 1994 bankruptcy bill, we created a process where asbestos companies could be discharged of their tort liabilities but only if they created a trust fund, under the control of a bankruptcy judge, to pay victims. This process has worked well and has received favorable comment by the National Bankruptcy Review Commission. 
   This amendment from Senator LEVIN, however, doesn't use a similar approach. This amendment merely provides that gunmakers and sellers can't discharge their tort liabilities. As a result, the amendment has no concern for the employees of the makers or retailers of guns. Under this amendment, retailers from giants such as Wal-Mart and Kmart all the way down to the small family-owned stores could face massive liabilities and be forced to lay off workers. 
   In the case of the Heflin-Grassley legislation of 1994, as I indicated, we allowed the companies to continue to operate and to continue to have their employment, and in the process victims were not harmed in any way because of the trust fund. It seems to me, unless there is some ulterior motive other than helping victims with this legislation, that we should think about that approach--an approach that protects victims, an approach that makes the person who is guilty of wrongdoing have tort apply to pay that tort. Consequently, if that is not the approach, I think it reveals the real purpose of the amendment. I question that the amendment might be about making sure that tort plaintiffs receive compensation if any of the questionable antigun lawsuits were to succeed because that is not what is going to happen. This amendment is merely an effort to drive all segments of American industry involved with guns out of business, even if thousands of innocent, hard-working American employees have to pay the price. 
   Consequently, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. 
   One other thing about the amendment is the presumption is so stated by the Senator from Michigan that this is just one addition--I think he would say that this is the 19th addition --to a long list of exceptions that are nondischargeable through the bankruptcy court. 
   I think he is mistaken about how bankruptcy works for corporations and chapter 11 because his amendment applies just to corporations. 
   Section 1141 of chapter 11 has two separate discharge provisions. 
   It has one section for corporations and it has one for individuals. The discharge provision for corporate debtors discharges all debts. The discharge provision for individuals lists nondischargeable debts. 
   So the idea this exception to discharge is just one more of a long list of 18 is flatout wrong. 
   From this standpoint, then, the amendment by the Senator from Michigan is unprecedented, and I will be glad to share the code sections with my colleagues, if they desire. But subsection (a) discharges a debtor from any debt that arose and that applies to the corporations. But subsection (2) says the confirmation of a plan does not discharge an individual debtor. From that standpoint, this is not one of a long list of things that are nondischargeable.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota is asking the Senate to put these provisions in law in the bankruptcy code for loans that are legal under State law. 
   He would have this done in two ways: No. 1, he would say that the State judges could not enforce these debt collections; and, No. 2, he would say that in bankruptcy it could not be recovered in bankruptcy. 
   First of all, these are legal contractual relations. They are legal under State law. So it ought to be questioned whether or not the Senate of the United States or the legislatures of Minnesota and Iowa ought to be making these determinations. It is my judgment that we should not use the bankruptcy code to upset the legal bankruptcy laws of the respective States. 
   I ask my colleagues to vote this amendment down.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment with my colleagues to discuss a recent article that was in the National Journal. It was about the Pentagon's Acting Inspector General, Mr. Donald Mancuso. The article was written by Mr. George Wilson. Mr. Wilson was a senior defense reporter at the Washington Post for many years. He left the Washington Post in 1991 to write books. He is now a columnist with the National Journal. 
   Mr. Wilson is a top-notch reporter. He is respected for being very thorough and very fair. But, above all, he is respected for an uncanny ability to find the nub of a complex issue and expose it to public scrutiny in an interesting  and also informative way. He had a recent article in the National Journal that is no exception. It has exposed a very raw nerve. The article is entitled: ``Tailhook May Soil Choice for Pentagon's Mr. Clean.'' It appeared in the January 22, 2000, issue of the National Journal on pages 260 and 261.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. The article I refer to raises important questions, even new questions, about Mr. Mancuso's integrity and judgment. At some point down the road, this body may be called upon to confirm or not confirm Mr. Mancuso's nomination because it has been suggested that President Clinton is expected to nominate him to be the next Department of Defense Inspector General. 
   If that happens, then each Member of this body would need to weigh all the facts bearing on Mr. Mancuso's fitness to serve as the Pentagon's watchdog, which is also the Pentagon's top cop. 
   In October, my staff on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts issued, for me, a report on the Defense Criminal Investigative Service. I am going to refer to that, as it is always referred to, as the DCIS--Defense Criminal Investigative Service. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to read this report. It substantiated allegations of misconduct on the part of senior DCIS management, including Mr. Mancuso, and at least one of his investigators, Mr. Mathew Walinsky. Mr. Mancuso at that time was Director of DCIS, and he was so from 1988 until 1997. 
   Since that report was issued in October, my staff has been inundated with new complaints about alleged misconduct by Mr. Mancuso and mismanagement at DCIS while Mr. Mancuso was the Director of DCIS. My staff is now in the process of evaluating these allegations to determine if they have merit. Once that review has been conducted, I may issue a second report. 
   Getting back to Mr. Wilson's article in the National Journal, by comparison, instead of my report opening up a new can of worms, Mr. Wilson's article has opened an old can of worms--in this case, Navy worms. It explores Mr. Mancuso's role in the investigation of misconduct at the infamous Tailhook convention in September 1991. By reopening this very unfortunate episode in naval history, Mr. Wilson has shed new light on Mr. Mancuso's fitness to move into the inspector general's slot. 
   Mr. Wilson reports that the U.S. Court of Military Appeals condemned Mr. Mancuso and the DCIS for, in their words, ``heavy-handed investigative tactics that trampled constitutional rights.'' According to Mr. Wilson, Mr. Mancuso's tactics included ``threats, intimidation, falsification of interviews, and overreliance on lie detectors.'' 
   In an opinion issued on January 11, 1994, on the Tailhook case, the U.S. Court of Military Appeals denounced Mr. Mancuso's tactics. The court compared the Tailhook case review process, which was set up by Mr. Mancuso, to sort of an assembly line justice, where investigative and judicial functions were merged and blurred. ``Merged'' and ``blurred'' are words the court used. ``Assembly line'' are words the court used. The court called Mr. Mancuso's assembly line justice ``troublesome.'' 
   Going on to quote the court:  
   At best, it reflects a most curiously careless and amateurish approach to a very high profile case by experienced military lawyers and investigators. At worst, it raises the possibility of a shadiness in respecting the rights of military members caught up in a criminal investigation that cannot be condoned.  
   That is what the U.S. Court of Military Appeals had to say. That is the highest military court in our land. It is often called the United States Court of Appeals of the Armed Forces. So this highest court has condemned Mr. Mancuso for ``shadiness.'' The court said his practices were ``careless and amateurish'' and even ``troublesome.'' The court said he and his investigators failed to respect the constitutional rights of members of the armed services. 
   I hope the Chair will agree that these are very serious charges about a person whom the President may nominate for our confirmation as inspector general of the Department of Defense. The court's criticism--again referring to the Court of Military Appeals--may help to explain why the Tailhook investigation was a total failure. The entire investigation probably cost the taxpayers close to $10 million and involved several thousand interviews. Unfortunately, not one single naval aviator who faced an assault charge was ever convicted by a court-martial. 
   As the Director of DCIS, Mr. Mancuso led the Tailhook investigation. He is accountable for failing to conduct it as a professional. A legitimate question for my colleagues and for the President: Should that same man, a man who used shady investigative tactics, a man who failed to respect naval judicial process in Tailhook, be confirmed as the Pentagon's watchdog? It is legitimate to ask if Mr. Mancuso is the best person to fill that position. 
   I leave those thoughts with my colleagues over the next several weeks as this nomination may come up for consideration. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I have had a chance to discuss this issue with the Senator from Wisconsin over a long period of time, both at the subcommittee level, the committee level, and during floor action on this bill which has been going on now since last October, with a long interim for a holiday break. 
   I appreciate what the Senator from Wisconsin is trying to do. We have joined together on a bill dealing with one aspect of this problem and that happens to be a bill which deals with arbitration in the automobile industry. As the lead Member of the Senate on alternative dispute resolution issues, I certainly do not want alternative dispute resolution to be used in unfair ways. So following up on the request of the Senator from Wisconsin that if we could make some sort of arrangement for his not offering his amendment at this time--and he has withdrawn it--I have scheduled a hearing in my judiciary subcommittee on our bill. I hope to air some of these other problems the Senator has raised. 
   I do have a great deal of sympathy for what the Senator from Wisconsin is attempting, but I think more groundwork needs to be done so we all have a better understanding of these issues before moving ahead at this time. 
   The bottom line, I say to the Senator from Wisconsin--and I hope he will answer yes or no--is that I wish to make sure he is working with us between now and our hearing so every commitment I have made in regard to his offering or not offering his arbitration amendment to this bill at this time is to his satisfaction.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. As everyone knows, we have started with the new Congress what we hope will be the final 2 days of the bankruptcy bill that we started sometime during the last 2 weeks of the session last year. We hope to finish by next Tuesday or Wednesday. We have the number of amendments down to about nine, with limits on debate on most of those amendments. It looks as if we can see the end of the debate and what I hope will be final passage. I think I can predict final passage because we did pass this legislation with only one or two dissenting votes during  the year of 1998. At that particular time, it was too late in the session to get the bill back to the House before final adjournment, so obviously in 1999 we had to start over again. That is concluding now with the House passing the bill in the middle of last year by a veto-proof margin. 
   At this point, I will say a few words about how we have thought of the proper role of bankruptcy over the course of our Nation's history. Congress' authority to create bankruptcy legislation derives from the body of the Constitution. Article I, section 8, clause 4, authorizes Congress to establish ``uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcy throughout the United States.'' 
   Until the year 1898, we did not have permanent bankruptcy laws; they were temporary. They were temporary reactions to particular economic problems. With each successive bankruptcy act and each major reform of our Nation's bankruptcy laws, we have refined our concept of how bankruptcy should promote the important social goal of giving honest but unfortunate Americans a fresh start while at the same time we guard against the moral hazard of making bankruptcy too lax. Quite frankly, since 1978 that is exactly what has happened. In the last 6 or 7 years, we have seen an explosion of the number of bankruptcies, from about 700,000 to about 1.4 million. 
   We do not have solid statistics on this, but hopefully that 100-percent rise in bankruptcies over the last 6 years has leveled off now. We think it has. If it has leveled off, hopefully it will start to decline. Some of that is attributable to our working on this legislation and sending a signal not only to people who are unfortunate and are considering bankruptcy, but to our entire society that Congress is taking a look at this 1978 legislation. The point of that legislation may not have been to make it easier to go into bankruptcy, but that has been the final product of that 1978 legislation. Hence, our reconsideration of that 1978 legislation with the amendments that are in this bill will send a signal to the people of this country that those who have the ability to pay should not be in bankruptcy in the first place. But if they decide to go into bankruptcy, they are not going to get off scot-free. That still retains our social practice, which has been that if they deserve a fresh start, they will still get it. 
   The bill before us proposes fundamental reforms which are a logical outgrowth and an extension of our prior bankruptcy reform efforts. I am talking about certain reforms that have taken place over the last 102 years. From 1898, which is the start of our permanent bankruptcy legislation, until 1938, consumers had only one way to declare bankruptcy. It was called straight bankruptcy, or chapter 7 bankruptcy. Under chapter 7, which is still in existence, bankrupts surrender some of their assets to the bankruptcy court. The court sells these assets and uses the proceeds to pay creditors. Any deficiency, then, is wiped out, hence the term ``a fresh start.'' 
   In 1932, the President recommended changes to the bankruptcy laws which would push wage earners into repayment plans. Later in the 1930s--and the exact date is 1938--Congress created, then, as a result of this suggestion 8 years before, chapter 13, which permits but does not require a debtor to repay a portion of his or her debts in exchange for limited debt cancellation and protection from debt collection efforts. Chapter 13 is still on the books to this very day, although it has been modified several times, most notably that modification in 1978. 
   Under current law, the choice between chapter 7 and chapter 13 is entirely voluntary. Since it is entirely voluntary, that is the cause of part of the problems we have now. People who have the ability to repay, who might use chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code as part of their financial planning, try to get into 7 and do not have to go into 13. As a result of not going into 13, they can get off scot-free. 
   Senators, decades before this Senator, saw a weakness in this. In the late 1960s, there was a distinguished Senator from Tennessee by the name of Albert Gore, Sr. He introduced legislation to push people into repayment plans. This proposal was reported to the Senate as part of a bankruptcy tax bill passed by the Finance Committee, but the Gore amendment ultimately died in the Senate. 
   Later, in the mid-1980s, Senator Dole and a Congressman from Oklahoma by the name of Mike Synar tried to steer higher income bankrupts--those who could repay some of their debt, those who were going into bankruptcy chapter 7 to get off scot-free--to steer those people to chapter 13. That was a good idea by Senator Dole and Congressman Mike Synar. The efforts of Senator Dole and the Congressman, though, ultimately 
   resulted in the creation of section 707(b). This section gives bankruptcy judges the power to dismiss the bankruptcy case of someone who has filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy if that case is--and these are the words from the law--if that case is a ``substantial abuse'' of the bankruptcy code. 
   This idea sounds very good and probably was quite a step forward by Senator Dole and Congressman Synar, but it has not worked so well in the real world. First, the term ``substantial abuse'' has not been clearly defined, and its actual meaning is very unclear. Why? Not because of the intent of the authors, but because we have had so many conflicting court cases. The decisions have brought conflicts in this area of the law from different parts of the country, so people are not sure what the rules are. 
   There is a second reason. Creditors and private trustees are actually forbidden from bringing evidence of abuse to the attention of the bankruptcy judge. I want to think that this was an oversight by Senator Dole and Congressman Synar. Or it may have been part of a necessary compromise at the time to take a small step forward. But it is unreasonable, if you believe there has been a substantial abuse of the bankruptcy code, and going into chapter 7 and, according to the language of the statute, there has been ``substantial abuse,'' that somehow knowledge of that cannot be brought to the attention of a bankruptcy judge by creditors and private trustees. 
   The bill before our body corrects these two shortcomings. Under this bill, 707(b) now permits creditors and private trustees to file motions and actually bring evidence of chapter 7 abuses to the attention of the bankruptcy judge. This change is very important since creditors have the most to lose from bankruptcy abuse, and, of course, the private trustees are often in the best position to know which cases are abusive in nature. In certain types of cases where the probability of abuse is high, the Department of Justice is also required to bring evidence of abuse to the attention of bankruptcy judges. 
   Additionally, the bill requires judges to dismiss or convert chapter 7 cases where the debtor has a clear ability to repay his or her debts. Under this bill, if someone who has filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy can repay 25 percent or more of his or her general unsecured debts, or a total of $15,000 over a 5-year period, then a legal presumption arises that this case should be dismissed or converted to a repayment plan under another chapter. 
   Taken together, these changes will bring the bankruptcy system back into balance. I am sure it is a balance that Senator Dole and Congressman Synar sought in the first instance. Importantly, these changes preserve an element of flexibility so each and every debtor can have his or her special circumstances considered. That is important, as well, as we give some leeway, some flexibility, to the bankruptcy judge when this sort of evidence is brought. This will not put any group of bankrupts in a straitjacket. All of this means then that their unique situation will be taken into account. 
   As we proceed to consider this bill, I hope my colleagues will keep in mind the balance of this legislation, the fair nature of this legislation, as well as its deep historical roots, not going back, I suppose, to the beginning of our country but, as far as a uniform permanent bankruptcy code, to 1898. 
   I also think this is a tribute--as the Senator from Vermont spoke about earlier--that we have been working very closely between Republicans and Democrats on crafting a bipartisan measure. 
   That reminds me again that, as with last fall when we first started consideration of this bill--we are continuing it now because we did not finish it last year--a great deal of credit goes to the Senator from New Jersey, Mr.  TORRICELLI, for his outstanding cooperation with me on this legislation, in addition to Senator LEAHY because as chairman of the subcommittee that handles this legislation, I had to work very closely, and enjoyed working very closely, with Senator TORRICELLI. We introduced the bill together. We got it out of subcommittee together. We got it out of the full committee together. This enjoyed a great deal of bipartisan support in the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
   Lastly, I just ask my colleagues to come to the floor. We were told that a couple of the authors of these amendments would be prepared to come to the floor this afternoon to debate these amendments and, except for votes, to take care of some of these amendments. I hope my colleagues will come. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in my capacity as chairman of the International Trade Subcommittee and getting ready for the Seattle Round, as well as considering China's accession to the World Trade Organization, I want to speak on Congress' power and our responsibility on the whole issue of international trade. 
   It is very clear in the Constitution that the Congress of the United States has the power, as one of the specifically delineated powers of Congress in the first article, to regulate interstate and foreign commerce. So the United States has just concluded a bilateral market access agreement with China. It should pave the way for China's accession to the World Trade Organization. 
   From what I have heard about this agreement--and, of course, we only have summaries at this point--it is an exceptionally good one for the United States and especially for American agriculture. I said, when the agreement fell through on April 8, I was fearful that a lot of ground would be lost. I don't think, from what I know, there has been any ground lost with the renegotiation. Charlene Barshefsky, our U.S. Trade Representative, conducted herself in a highly professional way and negotiated what appears to be an excellent agreement, and she did it under very difficult circumstances. 
   Now that the negotiations are finished, the job of the Senate and the House of Representatives becomes even more important. Our constitutional responsibility requires that the Senate and the House carefully review the agreement in its entirety, and the extent to which there are changes in law, they obviously have to pass the Congress, as any law would, and be signed by the President. 
   It is a responsibility every Senator takes very seriously because it is assigned to us by the Constitution. And because the Congress has a unique and close relationship with the American people, we must also keep faith with the people who sent us here to fulfill our constitutional responsibilities. 
   That is why it is critical we know everything that was negotiated. 
   I want to put emphasis upon that statement. 
   That is why it is important that the Congress of the United States know everything that was negotiated--everything, every issue, every detail, and every interpretation--so there can be no surprises, no private exchanges of letters, no private understandings about the key meanings of key phrases in the agreement, and no reservations whatsoever that are kept just between negotiators. 
   In other words, if Congress is going to legislate these agreements and secure these agreements, Congress has a responsibility not only to make sure everything is on the table but to make sure the administration puts everything on the table. 
   Let me be clear about this. There is an absolute requirement of disclosure. Congress must see everything that is negotiated. And it has not always been this way, or I wouldn't be to the floor asking my colleagues to consider this, and with an admonition to the administration to make sure everything is given to Congress. When congressional approval is required, only what we see and vote on should become the law. Nothing should become the law of the land that is secretly negotiated and that isn't submitted to Congress for our approval. 
   Because there have been problems in this area in the past, Senator CONRAD of North Dakota and I have introduced legislation. This legislation is contained in the African trade bill. That trade bill was recently approved by the Senate. I will work very hard to see that this provision is part of the final bill approved by conference committee before the African trade bill is sent to the President. 
   Why are we where we are today with what Senator CONRAD and I have tried to accomplish, and did accomplish, as far as the Senate is concerned? Unfortunately, past administrations have not complied with their basic principles of complete disclosure and complete openness in their submittal of agreements to the Congress. A prior administration--it happened to be a Republican administration--violated the spirit, if not the letter, of this absolute good faith requirement of complete disclosure. This incident occurred in 1988. I want to give background on it because it was in regard to the Canadian Free Trade Agreement which became part of the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
   At that time, there was disagreement about the meaning of a term relating to Canada's price support system for wheat. 
   If anybody has heard the articulate speaking of the Senator from North Dakota on this issue--Senator CONRAD has talked about this many times, about wheat unfairly coming into the northern United States in violation of the free trade agreement but somehow being legal because of these side agreements that Congress didn't know about in the past. 
   There was a disagreement about the meaning of a term relating to Canada's price support system for wheat. The issue dealt with whether the Canadians were manipulating their price support system by unfairly defining a very key term in their favor, thus allowing them to sell wheat below cost in the United States market in violation of the clear meaning of a provision of the Canadian-United States free trade agreement. 
   The United States insisted that Canada was, indeed, selling wheat below cost in violation of the agreement. Canada denied 
   the violation. The dispute was even taken to a binational panel for resolution. 
   In the argument before the binational panel for dispute resolution, the Canadian side at that time produced a letter from a few years back from the United States Trade Representative to the Canadians supporting the Canadian interpretation of the provision and very devastating to the case brought by the United States. 
   The question now is whether the U.S. Trade Representative's letter, or his interpretation of this controversial and important provision, was properly reported to the Congress before we considered that agreement, voted on it, and it became the law of the land. Some might argue that it was disclosed. Others say it was not. 
   In my view, because the issue of Canada's price support system for wheat was such a politically sensitive issue in the context of the NAFTA agreement, there should not have been any room for doubt what the administration's interpretation was. The disclosure of the administration's interpretation of this key language should have been fully and completely disclosed--not just in the fine print or in response to questions raised by a Senator at a hearing. 
   When important issues of foreign commerce are at stake and Congress is exercising its constitutional power of regulating foreign commerce, we in the Congress should not have to guess what the answer is or even have to figure out how to ask the right questions in the hearing at the right time and in the right way to get an honest answer, to have open disclosure of what our agreements are and what the results of the negotiation are. 
   This incident on the wheat and the Canadian Free Trade Agreement had unfortunate and profound consequences. It led some in Congress to believe they could not trust our negotiators. Some of us believed we weren't dealt with fairly. The American wheat farmer has been harmed as a result of it. 
   Now, I want to say I have the highest regard for our negotiators, especially for Ambassador Barshefsky. She has done a remarkable job. She has my complete trust. So this is not about Ambassador Barshefsky. It is not about any one of our negotiators. Nor is this a partisan concern. The incident that sparked my concern occurred during a Republican administration. I am concerned about one simple thing. The principle of openness and full disclosure to Congress. 
   This simple, basic principle applies not just to the agreement with China. In about ten days, the United States will help launch a new round of global trade negotiations in Seattle. This new round of trade liberalization talks will  cover agriculture, services, and other key trade issues. Many of these issues are sensitive, and even controversial. 
   We must be confident that we will see everything that is negotiated in the new round before it can become law. The legislation Senator CONRAD and I wrote that is part of the Africa trade bill requires full disclosure to Congress of all agreements or understandings with a foreign government relating to agricultural trade negotiations--what 
   we refer to here as agricultural trade negotiations, objectives, and consultation. 
   Anyway, our provision says that any such agreement or understanding that is not disclosed to Congress before legislation implementing a trade agreement is introduced in the Congress shall not become law. In other words, if Congress doesn't know about the agreement, it should not become law. That is very simple. It is very clear. It is a restatement of the principle of full disclosure. It is consistent with Congress' constitutional responsibility for foreign commerce, but I understand the administration opposes this commonsense provision. They want it removed from the bill. 
   Mr. President, it says in the Conrad-Grassley bill, no secret side deals. The Congress agreed that there should be fully submitted to Congress all of the provisions of any negotiations that must be approved by Congress. I don't know why the administration wants this language removed from the trade bill, but this is what they have sent to the conferees in the Congress of the United States. They list this section that says no secret side deals. They are suggesting we strike this subsection. 
   We cannot let this happen. I will do everything I can to make sure this physical disclosure provision becomes the law of the land when the House and Senate conferees finally consider the African trade bill. I believe our Government should live by the same standards we expect from farmers in my hometown of New Hartford, IA, or any businessman in Des Moines, IA. Tell us exactly what you mean. Show us everything in the agreement. Act in good faith. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this provision and vote for it when it comes back from the conference committee so we have physical disclosure of everything so Congress isn't asked to vote on something that is secret, that we don't know anything about. If we do that, we are violating our constitutional responsibility to the people of this country.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to ask the distinguished Chairman of the Committee on Finance a question regarding a tax provision which Congress adopted this summer as part of the vetoed Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999.  
   Mr. Chairman, section 1005 of that Act would have provided that the principles of section 482 should be used to determine whether transactions between tax-exempt organizations and related non-exempt entities give rise to unrelated business income tax. This provision was needed to insure that legitimate arms length transactions between these entities are not penalized. 
   Unfortunately, it appears that this session will end without our having another opportunity to once again enact this vitally needed protection for the tax exempt community. As a result, I would like to ask the distinguished Chairman whether he would agree that this provision should be included as a high priority in the first tax vehicle that we adopt in the second session.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to express my deep disappointment at the language affecting Federal dairy policy included in the Omnibus appropriations bill before us. As the Members know, the Omnibus measure includes an extension of the Northeast Dairy Compact and language on reforming our Nation's Federal dairy policy which has been in place since the Depression. 
   It may seem unusual to some Members that a Senator from Iowa would have an interest in this matter. While Iowa's reputation as an agriculture powerhouse is well-established and well-deserved, I think when many people think of agriculture in Iowa, they think of commodities such as soybeans or pork. However, the dairy industry is very important to Iowa as well. The total economic contribution of the dairy industry to the Iowa economy is over $1.5 billion annually. Nearly 10,000 Iowans are employed through dairy farming and processing. Furthermore, Iowa ranks 12th in the Nation in Dairy Production. So the State of Iowa has good reason to be concerned about Federal dairy policy. 
   I have long been concerned about the impact of the Northeast Dairy Compact, which was authorized by the 1996 farm bill and which was due to sunset in October of this year, has had, and how it will affect producers in the future. I voted in 1996 to strip the language from the farm bill which allowed for the formation of the Northeast Dairy Compact. The only reason the language was included in the farm bill was political trading at the last minute. Since the inception of the Northwest Compact, it is clear that its consequences have not been good.  
   According to the International Dairy Foods Association, the Northeast Compact has cost New England milk consumers nearly $65 million in higher milk prices, at the same time costing child nutrition programs $9 million more. Consumers have paid a price that is too high for the Northeast Compact. We should not make more consumers suffer the same consequences. I also believe that compacts are an abuse of the Constitution. While the Constitution does allow for the formation of compacts, it is usually invoked for transportation or public works project. 
   The Northeast Dairy Compact is the first time that compacts have been used for the purpose of price fixing for regional interests. For the most effective functioning of the U.S. economy, it must be unified. Preventing economic protectionism is at the heart of our Constitution. Renewing or expanding compacts flies in the face of that basic tenet. Furthermore, neither the Judiciary Committee or the Agriculture Committee, which have jurisdiction over such matters, has had the opportunity to review this measure. Such a committee examination is warranted and necessary. 
   One of the things that worries me about dairy compacts is their potential effect on other commodities. Higher prices mean more milk and less demand. The key to increasing dairy producers' income is expanding demand for milk and dairy products. If we take steps to expand dairy compacts, we will be going in the opposite direction. It is also my view that compacts are contradictory to the philosophy of freedom to farm, which my friend, the senior Senator from Vermont, supported. The whole philosophy behind freedom to farm was moving away from the old ``command and control'', government-run AG policies of the past. We need more free markets and free trade, not less. 
   which brings me to my final point on compacts. As Chairman of the Finance Committee's Subcommittee on Trade, maintaining a strong trade position for the United States is my top priority. One of the reasons why the United States is the only true superpower left in the world and why our Nation remains economically strong while others have faltered is because we function as one economically. Our economic prosperity is undeniable proof of the superiority of free and open markets. If we were to allow the perpetuation of dairy compacts, it would send a very damaging signal to the rest of the world. 
   It would send the message that we do not have the confidence that a free and open economy will ensure that producers who come to the market with a quality product will be able to support themselves. Not only is the compact language in this bill unacceptable for dairy producers in the Midwest, but the Omnibus bill also includes language on the Nation's milk marketing orders that is detrimental to Iowa's dairy producers. Members know that milk marketing orders are a system put in place over 60 years ago to regulate milk handlers in a particular order region to promote orderly marketing conditions. 
   The 1996 farm bill required USDA to cut the number of marketing orders by over half and implement an up-to-date market oriented system of milk distribution. After a great deal of study and comment, USDA came up with two proposals, Option 1-A, and Option 1-B. Option 1-A is close to the status quo and Option 1-B is geared toward the free market and modernizing the system. While neither proposal was perfect, Option 1-B was definitely a better choice. However, given the concerns expressed by the public about both proposals, USDA issued a compromise initiative, which was still preferable to Option 1-A. Unfortunately, Option 1-A proponents have succeeded in getting Option 1-A language included in the Omnibus appropriations bill. 
   Those who favor 1-A sometimes make the argument that the compromise devised by USDA would cost dairy farmers nationwide $200 million. However, according to the USDA, net farm income would be higher under the compromise that under the status quo which is what 1-A is in many ways. The Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute, which is located in my State at Iowa State University, has concluded that 60 percent of the Nation's dairy farmers would receive more income under the USDA compromise plan. 
   The unequal treatment of the old system, which is maintained by 1-A, artificially raises prices for milk in other parts of the country, encouraging excess production which spills into Midwestern markets. This simply lowers the price that Midwestern producers receive. 
   The Federal Milk Marketing order System is out of date and out of touch with modern production and economics. It is long overdue for reform and this language in the Omnibus bill just puts that off. My producers and others in other Midwestern States have endured the inequities of the Milk Marketing Order System long enough. I am very disappointed that the unfairness of the old system would be perpetuated by the language in this bill. We could still correct the mistakes made by this bill which would have a tremendously detrimental effect on dairy producers within Iowa and the rest of Midwest. 
   I urge the leadership on both sides of the aisle to work with Midwestern Senators to help put an end to the unfair treatment of the Midwestern dairy farmers. Thank you.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the critical issue of foster care. Today, there are more than 500,000 children and teens in our nation's foster care system. These children represent one of the most vulnerable segments of our population: Children who have been taken from unsafe homes, and children who have suffered from abuse and neglect. This group of children deserves all the love and attention of a loving, caring and permanent family. Foster care is not permanency. I repeat, foster care is and should not be viewed as permanency for children. 
   Unfortunately, some youth in foster care--estimated at 20,000 each year--  are not placed in a permanent, safe home before they are graduated from the child welfare system. These youth are expected to be self-sufficient, in many States at the age of eighteen. Foster care independent living programs, also known as ILPs, were initiated in 1985 in an attempt to provide this segment of the foster care population with the skills necessary for self-sufficiency. States have flexibility in the type of services they provide to their older foster youth; some options include assistance in locating employment, help in completing high school, or training in budgeting and other living skills. 
   The results of ILPs have been, at best, mixed. Two weeks ago, the Government Accounting Office released a report entitled ``Effectiveness of Independent Living Services Unknown.'' GAO conducted a study of ILPs at the request of House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources Chairman Nancy Johnson. This report reveals that only one national study has been completed to date, and the study determined that ILPs have the ``potential to improve outcomes for youths.'' The study went on to say that ``while HHS is tasked with overseeing implementation of ILP, it has done little to determine program effectiveness and has no established method to review the states' progress in helping youths in the transition from foster care.'' The GAO report recommends that the Secretary of HHS develop ``a uniform set of data elements and a report format for state reporting.......and concrete measures of effectiveness of assessing state ILPs.'' 
   I have, for a number of years, been concerned about the issue of accountability within the child welfare system. And, the GAO report supports my belief that more explicit information is needed from the States and HHS in order to ensure that Federal money is being spend in a manner that truly benefits the lives of our nation's troubled youth. 
   Today, the Senate passed legislation that will double the amount of money provided to States to conduct independent living programs. And, I am highly disappointed in the lack of specificity and accountability measures within the bill. Yes, the Secretary of HHS will be required to develop outcome measures and identify data elements in an attempt to collect uniform data from the States. However, there is great leeway provided the Secretary in developing such measures and States are not required to improve upon their own past performance. The Foster Care Independence Act, as passed by the Senate, does require the Secretary to report within 12 months her plans and timetable for collecting data and information from States. I am committed to following the progress of the Secretary in collecting data and developing standards for the States. Rest assured, I will be watching. And, I will do whatever is required of me to ensure that our nation's foster youth are provided with the most effective and worthwhile services their State agencies can provide. 
   Accountability is critical in any human undertaking. It provides an environment for those doing well to be commended and recognized. And, it sheds light on those acting irresponsibly. We in Congress have the responsibility to see that taxpayer money is spend wisely. I see a no more critical responsibility than in ensuring States are responsibly spending money on vulnerable youth in foster care. 
   November is National Adoption Month. Earlier this month, I joined my colleagues with the Congressional Coalition on Adoption in celebrating those who have made a difference through adoption. I was able to honor three worthy individuals from the great State of Iowa: Ruth Ann Gaines and Jeff and Earletta Morris. Ruth Ann adopted an autistic boy more than 14 years ago, and the Morrises adopted a teenager just over a year ago. I am grateful for their efforts and heart-felt belief in the value of family, and I am glad to announce them ``Angels in Adoption.'' 
   In closing, I want to reaffirm my commitment to finding permanent, loving families for each boy and girl currently without a loving and safe home. I am disappointed the Foster Care Independence Act did not contain more provisions supporting permanency. However, I will continue my efforts in support of permanency for children in foster care. Among others, Congresswoman NANCY JOHNSON has given me her word that she will work with me to improve accountability in the child welfare system. I look forward to working with all my colleagues in the next session to that end.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment because it sets up a double standard which lets below median-income bankrupts load up on debt on the eve of bankruptcy and then get those debts wiped away without judicial scrutiny. I know the Senator from New York is well-intentioned, but this amendment is a very bad idea. 
   Last night, the Senator from New York, in proposing his amendment, correctly noted that there is no evidence whatever that below median-income debtors could ever pay a significant amount of their debts. We have taken care of the problem the Senator from New York has raised by totally exempting below median-income debtors from the means test. I think that is fair and reasonable. It is a fact of life. It means the poor won't be forced into repayment plans they could never complete.  
   However, this amendment raises an entirely different question. This amendment isn't about whether the poor should be given a pass in terms of being forced to repay their debts. This amendment says people below the median income can purchase over $1,000 in luxury goods, such as Gucci loafers, and get over $1,000 in cash advances just minutes before declaring bankruptcy and they won't have to justify their debts to a bankruptcy judge. 
   This is not good bankruptcy policy. Anybody who loads up on debt on the eve of bankruptcy should have to justify their debts. When it comes to suspicious and perhaps fraudulent behavior, we should treat everyone the same, below median income or above median income. Anybody who loads up on debt right before filing for bankruptcy should have to explain themselves; otherwise, we open the door to an obvious abuse. 
   Last week, we defeated the Dodd amendment which contained very similar provisions. I ask my colleagues to defeat this amendment.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from New York for his cooperation with us on a couple of amendments he has worked out with us and has withdrawn so we could get closer to completion of work on this particular amendment. 
   In the case of his amendment just now offered, and my opposition to it, I want to say we have taken into consideration some of the complaints he has made--not about our bill, but complaints he would have made about some of the people writing legislation in this area, that they would go too far. But I think his amendment goes too far because it would have the effect of letting bankrupts below the national median income file for bankruptcy and do it in bad faith. That would make the small businesses and honest Americans who stand to lose out--they will be told they can't do anything about it. What we want is opportunity in our legal system, in the bankruptcy system, in the courts there, to be able to make a judgment, if there is bad faith used, to do something about it--most importantly, to discourage that sort of activity. 
   So I think this amendment gets us back to the point where we are now under existing law--inviting abuse of the bankruptcy code. 
   Under our bill, which we have been debating for the last several days on the floor of the Senate, and particularly as modified by the managers' amendment now, people below the national median income are not subject to motions by anybody under the means test. But there is another part of this bill that says the bankruptcy cases can be dismissed if the debtor filed for bankruptcy in bad faith. At this point, the creditors are allowed to file motions asking a bankruptcy judge to dismiss a case if it is filed in bad faith. That is the way our litigation system works and should continue to work. 
   In an effort to go the extra mile, however, I accepted an amendment, by Senator REED of Rhode Island and Senator SESSIONS, to put new safeguards in place to prevent creditors using any power they have to file bad faith motions as a tactic to force a debtor to  give up his or her rights. That should not be allowed. The Reed Sessions amendment corrects that. The projections in the Reed Sessions amendment were also developed in close consultation with the White House. 
   Our bill further provides that if a motion to dismiss is filed and the judge dismisses it, the judge can assess penalties against a creditor who filed the motion if the motion wasn't substantially justified. So we want to make sure that creditors who would abuse some of their power in court would not--if it was not substantially justified, if their position was not substantially justified, then action should be taken against them, and that is entirely fair as well. So we have a fair system with tough penalties for creditor abuses. 
   Now, the amendment of Senator from New York will return to the system we have today. Under current law, creditors can't file motions when a chapter 7 case is abusive or improper. And every observer acknowledges that the current system doesn't work at all in terms of catching abuse; hence, a major part of this bill is to correct this situation. 
   We went to great length in our committee report on this bankruptcy bill to discuss this point in very much detail. So this amendment should be defeated because it prevents the provisions prohibiting bad faith bankruptcy from being enforced. That is like saying to deadbeats it is not OK to file for bankruptcy in bad faith, but we are not going to do anything about it if you do. And, of course, that is exactly the wrong signal we want to send. 
   We want to make sure that people who go into bankruptcy are people who have a legitimate reason for being there and that they aren't taking advantage of bankruptcy to somehow help themselves, and in bad faith is part of that process. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have left?

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the issue that the Senator from New York just brought up of threats being used is exactly what the Reed-Sessions amendment deals with. I suggest this was also very much a point that was raised by people at the White House that we have been discussing--the whole issue of bankruptcy over a long period of time. 
   This was also worked out because this was a major concern. They did not want this abuse. They did not want the issue of threats. We agree with them, as we had to work it out with Senators SESSIONS and REED because the bill, as they saw it, was not adequate enough in this area. 
   As people vote on this amendment, I hope they will consider that we have been trying to respond in a very legitimate and strong way against the use of threats.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I know the Senator from New York is very sincere about the amendment he has proposed. I know he is cognizant of a discussion on a similar subject that we had on the amendment by the Senator from Connecticut last week. I think in a good-faith effort he comes in with something that does not go quite as far as Senator DODD's amendment goes. But I still think, for the very same reasons I expressed opposition to the Dodd amendment last week, I must express opposition to the Moynihan amendment. 
   In addition, I think perhaps by setting up one category for people who are in bankruptcy court who are below the national average and allowing a certain behavior on their part that you don't for people above the national average of income sets up a double standard that is not justified. 
   I oppose this amendment for pretty much the same reasons I opposed the Dodd amendment--that Congress needs to be very careful to fight against fraud and abuse and to say no to fraud and no to this financial abuse whenever we can. It seems to me it is a standard of ethic that is justified--being against fraud and abuse and treating it the same wherever it might happen. 
   One type of fraud and abuse involves loading up on debt right before bankruptcy and then discharging that debt. It doesn't seem to me we need to allow that above the limits of our legislation. The bill before us now contains provisions limiting the amount of debt incurred to purchase luxury goods within 90 days of declaring bankruptcy. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN's amendment would let people below the median income load up on more debt than higher income people. This lets people at low income levels get away with fraud and more fraud. I think this is not a very good idea. I respectfully oppose this amendment with obvious good intentions. I have never known Senator MOYNIHAN to have anything but good intentions, but this is one amendment that could bring about very unfair results as we allow people at a lower income get away with more fraud and abuse than we would people with higher income. 
   I oppose the amendment and yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, responding to the Senator from Nevada and going back to his efforts of last Wednesday before we adjourned for the national Veterans Day holiday, I can say that on that day as well as other periods of time over the weekend, and even as late as yesterday, between his efforts working with me and the efforts of our respective staffs, I have found the Senator from Nevada very cooperative. As a result of his cooperation, what we thought was an impossible amount of amendments to work our way through to bring this bill to finality has been dramatically reduced. The Senator needs to be credited with that extra effort. 
   I encourage Members on my side of the aisle to reach agreement. There may be one or two items that are above my pay grade, maybe even above the pay grade of the Senator from Nevada, that will have to be decided by leadership, but except for those items, we are making tremendous progress. I want to work in that direction, and I assure the Senator from Nevada of my efforts in that direction.

By previous consent, the Senate will proceed to a vote on the amendment following the use or yielding back of all the time. A vote on the Moynihan amendment, No. 2663, has been ordered to occur immediately following the vote on the Wellstone amendment. 
   Therefore, Senators may expect two back-to-back votes at approximately 10:30 a.m. tomorrow. If my plans work out, I prefer to have a third vote immediately afterwards on an amendment on which we are working to try to get consent. Then, in addition, other votes may be anticipated during tomorrow's session in an effort to complete the first session of the 106th Congress. 
   Therefore, Senators should adjust their schedules for the possibility of votes throughout the day and also into the evening on Wednesday. The leader appreciates the patience and cooperation of all of our colleagues as we attempt to complete the appropriations process.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I don't take exception to anything the Senator from Nevada stated. I simply add, we have been on this very important bankruptcy reform legislation over a week and we have gotten to where we are on this legislation only because we have had an extreme amount of bipartisan cooperation, starting with the introduction of the bill by Senator TORRICELLI and myself, getting it out of the Judiciary Committee in April by a vote of 14-4, awaiting our place in line to come up on the floor of the Senate, and having had considerable success eliminating a lot of amendments and hoping to get it to conference before we adjourn for the first session of the 106th Congress. 
   We have had that bipartisan cooperation. I expect to continue to work with the Senator from Nevada; the Senator from Vermont, Mr. LEAHY, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee; and Senator TORRICELLI, my partner on the subcommittee, to bring this bill to finality.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I consume. 
   First of all, on the issue of the Hatch-Abraham-Ashcroft amendment on drugs that is now before the Senate, I am very pleased that this action is being taken on this bill by the Senate because any action we can take to stiffen the laws against drug use, to discourage drug use, or anything else connected with the horrors of drug use and abuse in America is a very important thing for the Senate to be working on because drug abuse is a serious problem. 
   I believe the methamphetamine antiproliferation amendment that is before us will assist Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials, treatment professionals, prevention groups, and others who are on the front lines of the drug fight. So I will take a few minutes to highlight some important sections of this amendment. 
   In particular, I am happy to see additional resources in this legislation for training programs for State and local law enforcement officials. That is because methamphetamine is a new challenge for law enforcement. Of course, this methamphetamine problem is spreading across America. It may just be a California and Midwest issue right now, but it will not be long before it will be an issue all over the United States because, unlike other drugs that have to be imported, meth can be produced here in the United States with recipes available off the Internet. It can be made from chemicals available at your local drugstore. 
   These home-grown laboratories contain chemicals and chemical combinations that are hazardous both to the environment and to the people. They are potentially explosive. Even in my State of Iowa, some people have been injured in the process of making drugs. Most importantly, when it comes to law enforcement or for an individual who is violating the law by making methamphetamines, the disposal of this laboratory requires specialized handling. 
   We have all heard these horror stories about the dangers methamphetamine labs pose to both the manufacturers and to the people in the neighborhood. Because of the smell associated with it, you find a lot of this going on in the really rural parts of our States. So what this means is, the local county sheriff has more risk. Because of this, there is a need for training and for more equipment to clean up these labs. 
   This amendment provides for additional training opportunities for State and local law enforcement in techniques used in meth investigations. It supports training in handling meth manufacturing chemicals and chemical waste from meth production. 
   In addition, this amendment provides for additional DEA agents to assist State and local law enforcement in small and midsized communities in all phases of drug investigations, including foreign language assistance, investigative assistance, and drug prevention assistance. 
   I am pleased to see the proposal Representative MATT SALMON and I have worked on to encourage Government web sites to include antidrug information in this legislation. This is the second provision of this bill about which I am very happy. Positive antidrug messages are an affordable and creative way to especially reach the young audience. Funding is needed for research to discover chemical agents that can be added to anhydrous ammonia to make it unusable for meth manufacture. This is a long-term solution that has the potential to be very beneficial. The authorized funding provided for in this bill will allow continued and expanded research to find an appropriate additive to ensure anhydrous ammonia can not be misused. 
   In the agricultural regions of the United States, a nitrogen additive to  the soil is used to get a greater amount of productivity. That is involved with the raising of corn in the Midwest, as an example. Anhydrous ammonia is a source of nitrogen that farmers knife into the ground. We have seen these clandestine methamphetamine laboratories steal the anhydrous ammonia to use it in manufacturing methamphetamine. It is very dangerous to steal anhydrous ammonia. We have even had people hurt by that. But it is a cheap way to get some of the ingredients for this product. 
   So what we want to do, through this research--and Iowa State University is involved in this research--is to have a chemical agent that can be added to anhydrous ammonia so if a person steals it from the tanks that are around the countryside during the period of time when farmers are putting it on in the spring of the year, it won't do the manufacturer of methamphetamine any good because it would not be able to be used at that point--if such a chemical additive can be made. 
   A vital part of this bill, then, is the growing problem of this theft of anhydrous ammonia. States have even adopted tougher laws to combat the theft of anhydrous ammonia. But because these are separate State laws--the laws are not uniform --this has encouraged thieves to steal anhydrous in one State and transport it to an adjoining State with lesser penalties where it is used for the manufacture of methamphetamine. A Federal statute, as provided for in this amendment, will provide a strong deterrent to thieves who cross State lines to avoid stiffer penalties back home. 
   Last night, the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. DODD, and the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. LANDRIEU, came to the floor to offer an amendment which would essentially gut this entire bill. In the process, they made some statements about the bill which, with all due respect to my very capable colleagues, are very inaccurate statements and analyses of this legislation. I would like to clear the air today on some points they made. I will hit three points they made: First, their analysis of my means test in this bankruptcy reform legislation; second, what is the proper definition of household goods; and, third, their judgment of the antifraud provisions, which would prohibit loading up on debt right before bankruptcy. I will respond to each of these points. This will not take me long, for those colleagues who are waiting to speak. 
   First, the means test we now have in this bill is very flexible. Some of my colleagues would say it is too flexible. 
   The means test says if a debtor in chapter 7 can pay $15,000 or 25 percent of his or her debts over a 5-year period after deducting living expenses and certain other types of expenses, such as child support, then that debtor in bankruptcy may have to repay some portion of the debts owed. Paying some portion of debts owed is very legitimate because the signal we are trying to send in this bill is, no longer will anybody get off scot-free if they have the ability to pay. 
   If a bankrupt is in some sort of unique or special situation, the means test in this bill allows that person to explain his or her situation to the judge or to the trustee and actually get out of paying these debts. 
   Again, a lot of my colleagues say, why would you have a provision like that in this bill? If somebody has special circumstances or not, if they owe, they ought to pay. Well, it is an attempt to make changes that are dramatically different, even with these compromises, than what we have had as a law of the land since 1978. 
   If there are these special expenses which are both reasonable and necessary, and this reduces repayment ability, then, as I said, the debtor doesn't have to repay his or her debt. That is a simple process that everyone can understand. Somehow that has been interpreted by some people in this body as not actually doing what the bill says, or they are reading the bill a different way. I want to clear this up. The way we determine living expenses in the bill is to use a very simple template established by the Internal Revenue Service for repayment plans involved in back taxes. 
   I am going to read from a chart. This study was done by the General Accounting Office. It noted, in this June 1999 report to Congress about bankruptcy reform, that the template we use as a basis for this legislation, to allow the debtor to declare necessary living expenses, does include child care expenses, dependent care expenses, health care expenses, and other expenses which are necessary living expenses. 
   Right here is where it says: Other necessary expenses. I want this very clear, that this legislation allows, as you can see, child care, dependent care, health care, payroll deductions, on and on, life insurance. Let anybody tell me on the floor of this body that this is not a flexible test to accommodate very extraordinary circumstances or very regular circumstances. 
   So the suggestion last night that the bill is unfair because it doesn't allow for child care expenses or these other expenses associated with raising children is misplaced. According to the General Accounting Office, the Internal Revenue Service living standards--and these standards are the basis for the court to decide the ability to repay--in the bill now provide that any --I emphasize any--necessary expense can be taken into account. So, again, how much more flexible can we get? The only living expenses not allowed under our bill are very unnecessary and unreasonable expenses. The only people who oppose the means test, as currently written, are people who want deadbeats looking to stiff their creditors to dine on fancy meals or live in extravagant homes and take posh vacations. 
   And there is no reason why we have a $40 billion bankruptcy problem in this country, and that honest people in this country, a family of four are paying $400 a year more in additional costs for the goods and services they buy to make up for deadbeats who aren't paying, and that we have to put up with still other people who have the capability of paying to live high on the hog. 
   I think what is really behind the effort is the desire to have a means test which, quite frankly, doesn't do anything. Why have the bill at all? We could continue to go on under the 1978 law, where we doubled the number of bankruptcies in the last 6 or 7 years, from 700,000 to 1.4 million--an irresponsible public policy. Before I ever introduced this bill, I made numerous compromises to make the means test flexible, as I have said--more flexible, in fact. Some of the changes have even been suggested by this Democrat administration. They were suggested at the end of the last Congress when a bill that passed here 97-1 didn't get through. This bill has incorporated some of those. It is a compromise bill. I have taken heat from my side of the aisle for that.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before I make my final point, and then yield the floor--hopefully, the Senator from Vermont will hear this--I hope we can get some agreement on both sides  to yield back some time when the present speakers are done speaking. 
   The issue of household goods is where I left off when the Senator from Vermont asked me to yield for a minute. On this next statement, I might surprise Senator DODD and some of my colleagues, but I do somewhat agree with what was said last night. Under the bankruptcy code, household goods can't be seized by creditors. The point, as I understand it, from the Senator from Connecticut, is that perhaps the definition of household goods in the bill now could be loosened up so creditors can't get certain essential household items. I do see merit in this point. If the Senator from Connecticut were to modify his amendment just to deal with household goods, I would be pleased to work with him on that to get the bill accepted. But right now, the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut does much more than just deal with the household goods issue. I simply can't accept the other changes he has suggested. 
   Finally, last night, the Senator from Louisiana raised some criticism of the provision of the bill that fights fraud. Here is the problem we must address in doing bankruptcy reform: Some people load up on debts on the eve of declaring bankruptcy and then, of course, what they try to do to wipe those debts away by getting a discharge. Obviously, this is a type of fraud that Congress needs to protect against for the honest consumers who are paying that additional $400 per year. The bill now says debts for luxury items purchased within 90 days of bankruptcy in excess of $250 and also cash advances on credit cards made within 70 days in excess of $750 are presumed to be nondischargeable. 
   Now, again, this is very flexible on its face. Under the bill now, you can't buy $249 worth of luxury items such as caviar the day before you declare bankruptcy and still walk away scot-free. Under the bill now, you can get $749 worth of cash advances minutes before you declare bankruptcy and still walk away scot-free. 
   The question we have to answer is, How much more fraud do we want to tolerate in this bill? Haven't we tolerated enough in this bipartisan compromise, which I thank the Senator from New Jersey for working so hard with me on to get it put together? So we go to the amendment offered last night. This would allow $1,000 worth of fraud. In my view, that is way off base. So if you want to crack down on out and out fraud, you should support this bill Senator TORRICELLI and I have introduced. If you want to make it easier for crooks to game the bankruptcy system and to get a free ride at everybody else's expense, then you should support the amendment that was offered last night. 
   Well, obviously, unless the Senator from Connecticut would modify his amendment to limit it to household goods, I oppose that amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. Second, I thank the Senator for being a very cooperative member of the Judiciary Committee to help Members move the bill out of committee, particularly on this very issue that he has brought to the floor. He was hoping to bring this up in committee. It would have been very divisive in committee. It probably would have kept Members from getting the bill out of committee. He cooperated fully. I said when he brought it to the floor I would speak for and support his amendment. I am here to do that. But I think it is more important I tell him and his constituents who are interested in bankruptcy reform that he has been very helpful through this process. 
   One of the most unfair aspects of the bankruptcy code is the ability of very wealthy people to shield large amounts of assets in homesteads. As do many parts of our bankruptcy laws, the homestead exemption has a noble purpose. I don't deny that. That noble purpose is to protect the poorest of the poor from being thrown out into the streets to pay creditors. Everybody is entitled to a roof over their head. 
   As so many parts of our bankruptcy laws, this noble idea has been perverted by rich scoundrels and well-paid bankruptcy lawyers. Obviously, we need to do something about any part of the law that lets people hide money while paying nothing to their creditors. 
   We said one of the motivations of this legislation is to make sure that the people who have the ability to pay who go into bankruptcy are not going to get off scot-free. Allowing people to shield assets while paying nothing to their creditors creates perverse incentives for wealthy scoundrels. 
   A recent General Accounting Office study on this subject confirms the homestead exemption is used by a select few to avoid paying their bills. Unlike other areas where Congress attempts to regulate with very little constitutional basis for doing so, the text of the Constitution in this instance gives Congress the authority to set uniform bankruptcy laws, one of the specific powers of Congress in article I. 
   A homestead cap with a provision allowing some States to opt out and to have unlimited homestead will continue the unfairness of current law and will run counter to our constitutional mandate to have uniform bankruptcy laws. I support a strong cap and oppose a State opt-out. I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Our colleagues should also be aware the underlying bill deals with very wealthy people in bankruptcy by pushing them in chapter 11 with special modifications designed to deal with individuals instead of corporations. Allowing the super rich to live high on the hog is a more widespread problem than homestead abuse. 
   I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for his leadership in this area.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. I am trying to satisfy the Senator from California, although I don't think I can do any better than the Senator from Nevada has just done. But I pled for two reasons. No. 1, I still hope to work with the Senator from Texas, the chairman of the Banking Committee, to see what we can do to facilitate the amendment, whether it is now or a week from now or next year, if we aren't finished with this bill. No. 2, we are trying to get to a situation where we can get to a vote, which is something we promised a Member who has been waiting for a long, long time. 
   We still have the third situation where Senator REID and I are going to sit down with our staffs to see what we can do with 
   all of the amendments so we know where we are and have a complete picture. That is why I would plead with her to let the unanimous consent request go through.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this bill, the original bill, contains many  provisions to help collect past due child support. This is not just the authors saying this. These provisions are endorsed by the prosecutors who actually enforce child support laws. 
   On another point, in response to what the Senator from Connecticut has said, if one is under the median income, the means test doesn't even apply to that person. The people Senator DODD is worried about won't be affected. 
   In a more broad sense, this amendment should be defeated. First, the means test we now have in the bill is very flexible. The charge has been that we are not flexible enough. I will point out that flexibility. If a bankrupt is in a unique or special situation, our bill, the means test, allows that person to explain his or her situation to the judge or to the trustee and thus get out of paying these debts if there are special expenses. If these special expenses are both reasonable and necessary and this reduces repayment ability, the debtor doesn't have to repay his or her debts. 
   The way we determine living expenses in this bill is to use a template established by the Internal Revenue Service for repayment plans involving back taxes. 
   I have a chart and a study of the bill which was done by the General Accounting Office. The General Accounting Office noted in its June 1999 report, which was to Congress, and a report about bankruptcy reform, that this template includes a provision allowing a debtor to claim child care expenses, dependent care expenses, health care expenses, or other expenses which are necessary living expenses. 
   Tell me, with all these things included, and with the General Accounting Office backing up the intent of our legislation, that this bill is not flexible, that this bill does not take into consideration the living expenses and needs of the potential person in bankruptcy. 
   This is, frankly, as flexible as you can get. According to the General Accounting Office and the Internal Revenue Service, living standards in the bill now provide that any necessary expense can be taken into account. The only living expenses not allowed under this bill are unnecessary and unreasonable expenses. What is wrong with not allowing unreasonable and unnecessary expenses? The only people who oppose the means test as currently written are people who want deadbeats looking to stiff their creditors to dine on fancy meals and to live in extravagant homes and to take posh vacations. 
   On the issue of household goods, this might by a surprise to the Senator from Connecticut, but I tend to agree with some of what he said now and last night. If Senator DODD were to modify his amendment, just to deal with household goods, I will be pleased to work with him on that, to get the amendment accepted. But his amendment does much more than just deal with the household goods issues. I simply cannot accept these other changes. 
   Finally, this amendment by the Senator from Connecticut makes fraud much easier because the problem we must address in doing bankruptcy reform is that some people load up on debts on the eve of bankruptcy and then try to wipe out those debts, wipe them all away, by getting a discharge. Obviously, this is a type of fraud which Congress needs to protect against. The bill now says that debts for luxury items purchased within 90 days of bankruptcy in excess of $250, and cash advances on credit cards made within 70 days in excess of $750, are presumed to be nondischargeable. This is pretty flexible on its face. Under the bill now, you can buy $249 worth of luxury items such as caviar the day before you declare bankruptcy and still walk away scot-free. Under the bill, you can get $749 worth of cash advances minutes before you declare bankruptcy and still walk away scot-free. 
   But this is not enough for the people proposing this amendment. So the question we have to answer is how much fraud do we want to tolerate? This amendment is way off base. If you want to crack down on out-and-out fraud, and that is what we are talking about, you should support the bill and you should be against this amendment because by supporting the amendment, you make it easier for crooks to game the bankruptcy system and get a free ride at everyone else's expense. Consequently, if you do not want to do that, you will not support the Dodd amendment. I oppose the amendment and I ask my colleagues to do the same. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to point out the big deal the Senator from Connecticut made about the IRS regulations and the guidelines not mentioning the word ``children.'' 
   The point is very clear, from the General Accounting Office, but in their study of the IRS guidelines, under a category ``other necessary expenses,'' if it does not mention children, if it does not take the needs of children into consideration, what in the heck do the words ``child care'' mean? What does ``dependent care'' mean, if the needs of children are not taken into consideration? It may not be mentioned in the IRS guidelines per se, but under ``other necessary expenses,'' it is very clear that the needs of every child will be taken care of. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in response to what the Senator from Vermont said, obviously I am in no position to speak for our majority leader or assistant majority leader on some of the things he said. But I do share his view, especially coming from a rural State, as the Senator from Vermont does, that there is very much benefit for our rural constituents in that satellite viewers legislation. I, too, would like to see it pass. 
   I can say again, not for the leader but for myself, I have observed a lot of contact between important Senators around here on that issue. There is a real effort being made to find a solution so that can be passed so on December 31 what you said would happen, and what would actually happen if the bill does not pass will not in fact happen.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. We are suggesting for the Schumer amendment, according to the agreement, because the other side of the aisle had suggested in the preliminary negotiations that we had on this--negotiations which fell through--that it was very necessary to have a lot of time to devote to debate these amendments on which we had not had votes.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are on legislation we started Thursday night. We had discussion this Friday, although we had no votes on any amendments to the bankruptcy reform bill. I hope we can move forward with this legislation and get it passed before we adjourn. 
   This is the same piece of legislation that passed the Senate by a 97-1 vote in 1998. It was conferenced with the House. The conference committee report passed the House of Representatives by a very wide margin. The bill came to the Senate in the last 3 or 4 days of the session with a threat of long debates and filibusters against the conference report. Consequently, a bill that passed 97-1, probably coming out of the conference more favorable to the point of view of those who still had some questions about it. Yet a lot of those Members did not want that bill to go to final passage. Therefore, the last Congress ended with the bankruptcy conference report not passing. 
   We started over again in the new Congress. Since the first of the year, Senator TORRICELLI of New Jersey and I have been working on this legislation to bring our colleagues a bipartisan approach to bankruptcy reform that we hope will end the situation of some people who have the ability to repay some debt getting off scot-free. We think this legislation is a big step in that direction. 
   In my earlier statements on the Senate floor on Thursday and Friday, I alluded to the role that overly aggressive bankruptcy lawyers play in the current crisis of our bankruptcy system. Although I cannot statistically support it, when I refer to the role of overly aggressive bankruptcy lawyers I really think, in my heart, we are talking about a very small minority of bankruptcy lawyers. Still, there are those who play a role in people going into bankruptcy who I do not think the bankruptcy laws were ever intended to help, or, in any case, harming people who have a debt owed to them which is not paid. 
   One of the major problems with the bankruptcy system is the mind-set of some of the lawyers who specialize in bankruptcy. Many lawyers today view bankruptcy simply as an opportunity to make money for themselves with a minimal amount of effort. And this profit motive causes bankruptcy lawyers to promote bankruptcy even when a financially troubled client has the obvious ability to repay his or her debts. As one of the members of the National Bankruptcy Commission noted in the Commission's 1997 report, many who make their living off of the  bankruptcy process have forgotten that declaring bankruptcy has a moral dimension. Bankruptcy lawyers shouldn't counsel someone to walk away from his or her debts without pointing out the moral consequences of making a promise to pay and then breaking that promise. As I have said before, it cannot be good for the moral foundation of our nation if people learn that it is okay just to walk away and not pay your bills because that's easier and more convenient, and obviously better for somebody's pocketbook. 
   All across America some of the more unsavory bankruptcy lawyers have created high-volume law offices that herd people into bankruptcy as if they were cattle instead of individual human beings in need of advice and counseling. These offices are known as bankruptcy mills. These bankruptcy mills are nothing more than large scale processing centers for bankruptcy--there is little or no investigation done as to whether an individual actually needs bankruptcy protection or whether or not a person is able to at least partially repay their debts. For example, one bankruptcy attorney from Texas was sanctioned by a bankruptcy court for operating a bankruptcy mill. According to the court, this attorney had very little knowledge of bankruptcy law, but advertised extensively in the yellow pages and on television. Apparently, his advertising worked, because he filed about 100 new bankruptcy cases per month. Most of the work was done by legal assistants with very limited training. The court concluded that the attorney's services  
   Amount to little more than a large scale petition preparer service for which he receives an unreasonably high fee.  
   The practices of bankruptcy mills are so deceptive and sleazy that the Federal Trade Commission went so far as to issue a consumer alert warning consumers of misleading ads promising debt consolidation. 
   I refer you to this Federal Trade Commission Consumer News Bulletin, right here on this chart. It refers to a question,  
   Debt Got You Down? You are not alone. Consumer debt is at an all-time high. What's more, record numbers of consumers--more than 1 million in 1996--are filing for bankruptcy. Whether your debt dilemma is the result of an illness, unemployment, or simply overspending, it can seem overwhelming. In your effort to get solvent, be on the alert for advertisements that offer seemingly quick fixes. While the ads pitch the promise of debt relief, they rarely say relief may be spelled b-a-n-k-r-u-p-t-c-y. And, although bankruptcy is one option to deal with financial problems, it's generally considered the option of last resort. The reason: Its long-term negative impact on your creditworthiness. A bankruptcy stays on your credit report for 10 years, and can hinder your ability to get credit, a job, insurance, or even a place to live.  
   I think that there is a widespread recognition that bankruptcy lawyers are preying on unsophisticated consumers who need counseling and help with setting up a budget, but who do not need to declare bankruptcy. It is not surprising, Mr. President, that bankruptcy lawyers are leading the charge against bankruptcy reform. 
   Now, we have heard complaints from some on the Senate floor about protecting child support and alimony during bankruptcy proceedings. I want to point out that some bankruptcy lawyers actually advertise that they can help deadbeat dads get out of paying their child support and other marital obligations. One bankruptcy lawyer has even written a book entitled ``Discharging Marital Obligations in Bankruptcy.'' Some things about that book are displayed on this chart. 
   I think that it is outrageous that bankruptcy lawyers are helping deadbeats to cheat divorced spouses out of alimony and to cheat children out of child support. This is a recipe for promoting poverty and human misery. Those who are concerned about protecting child support should join with me in condemning this sort of amoral conduct. Bankruptcy was never designed for the purpose of helping deadbeat spouses escape their financial obligations. Not only are the current practices of bankruptcy lawyers a disservice to their clients, they also cheat society as a whole. 
   Mr. President, I ask consent to have printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD an article from the Los Angeles Times dated August 12, 1998.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. In this article, bankruptcy lawyers are advised to send out letters to anyone who has visited them recently asking about bankruptcy. This form letter encourages people to declare bankruptcy because, if Congress passes bankruptcy reform, ``Bankruptcy will be much more difficult, more expensive, and probably embarrassing.'' I hope this bill makes bankruptcy more embarrassing and more difficult. Opinion polls clearly show that the American people want those who voluntarily incur debts to pay those debts as agreed. Bankruptcy should be difficult, and the moral stigma that used to be associated with bankruptcy should be resurrected. 
   I have reviewed the conduct of bankruptcy mills and bankruptcy lawyers to illustrate the need for Congress to hold bankruptcy lawyers accountable for unethical and dishonest conduct. In the bill before us, we have tried to do this by codifying rule 11 penalties for lawyers who needlessly steer people into the bankruptcy system. It's my hope that these penalties will cause lawyers to think twice before they willy-nilly cart off their clients to bankruptcy court without asking a few questions first. I would have preferred tougher penalties, as we had in last year's Senate Bill, But I understand that many on the other side of the aisle strongly object to tougher penalties. So, in an effort to work with the other side, this year's penalties aren't as tough as they were last year. 
   As I've said many times, the bankruptcy crisis is partly a moral crisis. And bankruptcy lawyers who push bankruptcy play the role of carnival barkers who promise an easy way out to anyone who will listen. 
   As it stands now, this bankruptcy reform bill, S. 625, merely requires attorneys to investigate the financial resources of their clients before putting them into bankruptcy. That is not too much to ask and, it seems to me, something basic when advising people according to the tenets of the legal profession. 
   Our bankruptcy system needs to be reformed in a balanced way. We need to address abuses by debtors who do not need bankruptcy. We need to address abuses by creditors who use coercive and deceptive practices to cheat honest debtors. And we need to address abuses by bankruptcy lawyers who exploit bankruptcy laws for financial gain. 
   As I said before, I prefer tougher penalties against bankruptcy lawyers, but this bill is a step in the direction of addressing the problems of fast-talking bankruptcy lawyers. 
   Does the Senator from Minnesota seek the floor?

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the pension reform provisions which have been included in the minimum wage and business tax amendment sponsored by colleague Senator DOMENICI. 
   Earlier this year I cosponsored with Senator Bob GRAHAM of Florida, comprehensive pension reform legislation--S. 741, The Pension Coverage and Portability Act. Many of the provisions in S. 741 were included in the vetoed Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999. Now, those provisions have been included as part of the Republican minimum wage amendment. 
   Experts say that, ideally, pension benefits should comprise about a third of a retired worker's income. But pension benefits make up only about one-fifth of the income in elderly households. Obviously, workers are reaching retirement with too little income from an employer pension. Workers who are planning for their retirement will need more pension income to make up for a lower Social Security benefit and to support longer life expectancies. While we have seen a small increase in the number of workers who are expected to receive a pension in retirement, only one half of our workforce is covered by a pension plan. 
   There is a tremendous gap in pension coverage between small employers and large employers. Eighty-five percent of the companies with at least 100 workers offer pension coverage. Companies with less than 100 workers are much less likely to offer pension coverage. Only about 50 percent of the companies with less than 100 workers offer pension coverage. Small employers who may just be starting out in business are already squeezing every penny to make ends meet. These employers are also people who open up the business in the morning, talk to customers, do the marketing, pay the bills, and just do not know how they can take on the additional duties, responsibilities, and liabilities of sponsoring a pension plan. 
   I firmly believe that an increase in the number of people covered by pension plans will occur only when small employers have more substantial incentives to establish them. The pension provisions contained in the minimum wage amendment offered by Senator DOMENICI would provide more flexibility for small employers, relief from burdensome rules and regulations, and a tax incentive to start new plans for their employees. These reforms would create new retirement plans which would help thousands of workers build a secure retirement nest egg. 
   The amendment also contains provisions which promote new opportunities to roll over accounts from an old employer to a new employer. The lack of portability among plans is one of the weak links in our current pension system. This amendment contains technical improvements which will help ease the implementation of portability among the different types of defined contribution plans. 
   There has been criticism that the benefits of pension reform legislation would largely be directed toward the rich. However, to the contrary, evidence suggests that pension benefits largely benefit middle class workers.  Over 75 percent of current workers participating in a pension plan have earnings of less than $50,000. Among married couples nearly 70 percent of those receiving a pension had incomes below $50,000. Among widows and widowers, over 55 percent of pension recipients had incomes below $25,000. 
   Furthermore, there are provisions in the amendment specifically designed to help rank-and-file workers earn meaningful benefits. Provisions such as reducing the vesting period for employer matching contributions in defined contribution plans and eliminating the twenty-five percent of compensation limit on combined employer and employee contributions to defined contribution plans. 
   Finally, let me say there is a precedent for including reforms to the employer provided pension system with an increase in the minimum wage. Three years ago we increased the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 as part of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996. Included in that legislation were a number of reforms to the employer-provided pension system. One in particular, was the creation of the SIMPLE pension plan--which has expanded coverage to thousands of employees of small businesses who otherwise might not have been able to participate in a pension plan. 
   We have an opportunity to improve the incomes of the lowest paid members of the American labor market, and to improve retirement security for millions of workers and their families. I support my colleague's efforts, and encourage others to do the same.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before the Senator from Vermont leaves the floor, I want to thank him for his comments. He has expressed very well some statements about parts of the bill on which he has questions. I want to assure him, most of those--in fact, the way the Senate works, probably all of those--will have to be addressed in some way through the various amendments which are likely to be adopted. We do have a very close working relationship, even at this point, on some of those things with people on the Senator's side of the aisle. We will try to do that. 
   If I could also make the Senator from Vermont aware of a study he referenced, the study done by the American Bankruptcy Institute on the utility of chapter 7 debtors to repay their debts--the Senator may not know this, but we have had the General Accounting Office look at this study; in fact, all the studies on this question. The General Accounting Office has concluded that this specific study by the American Bankruptcy Institute was flawed. In fact, it understated the repayment ability in a very significant way. 
   I do not expect the Senator to accept that right now, just because I have said it. I hope he will be able to take a look at that and see if there are any remaining questions that he might have which we could address, and if we can't do that and the Senator might be considering some amendments that are a direct result of the American Bankruptcy Institute study, that we would have an opportunity to talk about it before he might move in that direction. 
   Overall, his statement is very accurate, stating some disagreements, some questions he has. Hopefully, we will be able to address those questions.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I know Senator TORRICELLI is expected to come to the floor to make a statement. While we are awaiting his arrival, I will address the Senate on a small but very important part of this legislation. That is the one that deals with chapter 12, making it permanent, as part of the bankruptcy reform legislation, so we do not have to, every 4 or 5 years or, as has been the case in the last 12 months, since it has sunsetted, had to reauthorize it two or three times on a short-term basis. 
   We are all in agreement it should be made permanent. People who have opposed making it permanent as a separate bill have thought it was necessary to do it at the same time as we offer the overall bankruptcy reform legislation. Hopefully, with this bill, S. 625, being adopted, we will never in the future have to deal with a separate reauthorization of a sunset chapter 12 because why should we have to sunset chapter 12, a provision that is made specifically for farming, when we don't do it for chapter 13, that is made specifically for individuals or small businesses, or chapter 11 that works very well for major corporations in America. 
   I want to visit with my colleagues about some very important provisions in the bill before us that are vital to family farmers in the Midwest generally, in Iowa in particular, as well as the country as a whole. Agriculture, wherever it is, is something unique and different from a lot of businesses in their situations, where sometimes they have a decline not only in income that might make bankruptcy be considered but also a decline in value of real estate that, previous to chapter 12, made it very difficult to keep up with the needs of a chapter 11 bankruptcy procedure. 
   As we all know from the recent debate we had within the last month on the emergency Ag appropriations bill, many of America's farmers are facing financial ruin. We have some of the lowest commodity prices in 30 years. Pork producers have lost billions of dollars in equity, not just in income but billions of dollars of equity, with the lowest prices of pork in 60 years that we had just 12 months ago. Pork producers have not only lost, but the price of corn is currently well under the cost of production. The cash market for soybeans has reached a 23-year low. This is all in addition to poor weather conditions in parts of the United States, particularly the drought of the East Coast, the drought of Texas, the fires in Florida, and flooding in various parts of the Midwest.  
   These circumstances have sent many farming operations in a tailspin. Clearly, we need to make sure family farmers continue to have bankruptcy protection available to them and a protection that satisfies the uniqueness of farming, as we have had other sections of the code try to be written to meet the uniqueness of other business arrangements within our society and our economy. 
   Particularly, chapter 12 is going to be needed in good times as well as bad times--maybe not used in good times, but it needs to be there to meet the different arrangements of the different segments of the country and also the different drought and flooding conditions that happen from time to time, as well as the unpredictability of the economy, particularly the international economy, when the Southeast Asian financial crisis brought a downturn in our exports and squeezed the farmers' income at this particular time. 
   Title X of S. 625 of this bill makes chapter 12 permanent and makes several changes to chapter 12 to make it more accessible for farmers and to give farmers new tools to assist in reorganizing their financial affairs. 
   Back in the mid-1980s when Iowa was in the midst of another devastating farm crisis, I wrote chapter 12 to make sure family farmers would receive a fair shake when dealing with the banks and the Federal Government. At that time, I didn't know if chapter 12 was going to work or not, so it was only enacted on a temporary basis. 
   Chapter 12 has been an unmitigated success. As a result of chapter 12, many farmers in Iowa and across the country are still farming and contributing to America's economy. With a new crisis in farm country now, just 15 years from the last one, we need to make sure chapter 12 is a permanent part of Federal law, and this bankruptcy bill does exactly that. 
   As was the case with the dark days of the mid-1980s, some are predicting that family farms should consolidate and we should turn to corporate farming to supply our food and agricultural products. As with the 1980s, some people seem to think family farms are inefficient relics that should be allowed to go out of business. This would mean the end of an important part of our Nation's economy and a certain heritage that is connected with it. And it would put many hard-working American families--those who farm and those whose jobs depend on a healthy agricultural sector--out of work. 
   But the family farm didn't disappear in the 1980s, and that crisis was very bad as well. It was not only an income crisis, as is the situation now, but there was a tremendous drop in equity at that particular time. 
   I believe chapter 12 is a major reason for the survival of many financially troubled family farms. We have an Iowa State University study prepared by the outstanding Professor Neil Harl. He found that 84 percent of the Iowa farmers who used chapter 12 were able to continue farming. Those are real jobs for all sorts of Iowans in agriculture and in industries that depend upon agriculture. According to the same study, 63 percent of the farmers who used chapter 12 found it helpful in getting them back on their feet. In short, I think it is fair to say chapter 12 worked in the mid 1980s and it should be made permanent so family farmers in trouble today can get breathing room and a fresh start if that is what they need to make it. 
   But the most obvious reason for having it is that chapter 11, written for corporate America, does not fit the needs of agriculture or the economics of agriculture. 
   The Bankruptcy Reform Act before us doesn't just make chapter 12 permanent. Instead, the bill makes improvements to chapter 12 so it will be more accessible and helpful for those in the agricultural community. First, the definition of the family farmer is widened so that more farmers can qualify for chapter 12 bankruptcy protection. Second, and perhaps most important, my bankruptcy bill reduces the priority of capital gains tax liabilities for farm assets sold as part of a reorganization plan. This will have the beneficial effect of allowing cash-strapped farmers to sell livestock, grain, and other farm assets to generate cash flow when liquidity is essential to maintaining a family farm operation. These reforms will make chapter 12 even more effective in protecting America's family farms during this difficult period. 
   So it is really imperative that we keep chapter 12 alive. 
   Before we had chapter 12, banks held a veto over reorganization plans. They would not negotiate with people in agriculture, and the farmer would be forced to auction off the farm, even if the farm had been in the family for generations. Now, because of chapter 12, the banks are willing to come to terms. We must pass S. 625 to make sure America's family farms have a fighting chance to reorganize their financial affairs. 
   Before I yield the floor, I see my good friend and coworker on this legislation, the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. TORRICELLI, has come to the floor to make some remarks. As I said last night and I want to say today, because he wasn't able to be here last night, I really appreciate that from day 1 of our even visiting about the possibility of putting together a bipartisan bill, as we had done in the previous Congress, because he was new to the committee and to this effort, not participating at the committee level in the efforts I had with Senator DURBIN of Illinois during the previous Congress on a bill that just about made it through--not knowing those things could work out, we sat down and visited about that possibility. 
   That initial visit brought us to putting together the legislation that is before us, legislation as introduced with the idea that he and I may not have agreed to everything down to the last jot and tittle with that legislation, but that we would be able, through the ensuing months, to work out differences and come to an agreement and get a bill out of committee. He has kept his word, and he has worked with us. 
   I don't know whether people who don't participate in the legislative process know how much easier that is, such a better environment in which to write legislation and to make public policy. I don't see that often enough. I see it in this legislation through the cooperation of Senator TORRICELLI. Obviously, that sort of cooperation is two ways: He gives; I give. People who look to him for leadership--he has to carry some water for colleagues of his who want him to work things out. I have to do the same thing. But whether it is as a water carrier for our colleagues or whether it is for the individual philosophy of Senator TORRICELLI or myself, we have been able to bring this together. I thank him for that cooperation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have a situation now in which several nursing home chains, maybe even some independent nursing homes, are going into bankruptcy. When this happens, we do not have public policy in place to guarantee the economic and accounting decisions that the bankruptcy involves take into consideration the needs of the residents of these nursing homes. 
   If a hospital goes bankrupt, the basic question then is, What happens to the patients? The moving of elderly patients, particularly those who have been in a single nursing home for a long period of time, is a very traumatic experience. Many times, the trauma that results from that removal leads to almost immediate death. I suppose a more accurate statement would be that under any circumstance, patients' welfare varies from case to case.  
   If a bankruptcy trustee is thinking about patients, he may act to protect them. If he is not thinking about the patients, they could end up on the street. This has happened before, and it could happen again. The amendment I am offering today with Senator TORRICELLI and Senator LEAHY would modify our bankruptcy laws to deal with the failures of health care businesses. Our intent is simply to protect patients in a system that is not designed to protect them. 
   The fate of patients caught in business failures does not always make headlines. But when it does, the stories can be quite moving. The Los Angeles times on September 28, just 2 years ago, described the terrible consequences of a sudden nursing home closing:  
   It could not be determined Saturday how many more elderly and chronically ill patients may be affected by the health care company's financial problems. Those at the Reseda Care Center in the San Fernando Valley, including a 106-year-old woman, were rolled into the street late Friday in wheelchairs and on hospital beds, bundled in blankets, as relatives scurried to gather up clothes and other personal belongings.  
   As horrifying as this example is, it could easily be repeated. What happened at the Reseda Care Center, less than 2 years ago, could happen again and again across the country. 
   The Nation's bankruptcy laws are geared towards creditors and debtors. One purpose of the bankruptcy system is to ensure that creditors receive what debtors owe them. To this end, bankruptcy trustees concentrate narrowly on the bottom line. They try to maximize the amount of money returned to creditors. In a system so focused on finances, the human toll is often merely an ancillary concern. 
   Unfortunately, the poor financial conditions that led to the Reseda Care Center's collapse are increasing. Large portions of the health care industry are financially ailing. Almost one-third of our hospitals could face foreclosure. At least two of the Nation's largest nursing home chains are in deep financial trouble and may file for bankruptcy. We have had some chains already do that. Two large nursing home chains that declared bankruptcy, before they declared bankruptcy, had already cut 10,000 jobs. An increasing number of home health agencies are shutting their doors. All in all, health care business failures were up 15.5 percent between 1996 and 1997. 
   Thousands of patients tie their fate to health care providers. They have no alternative. Yet Federal law shows absolutely no consideration for patients' well-being during the process of bankruptcy. While the State of California has tried to prevent any more surprise nursing home evictions, each 
   Federal bankruptcy judge decides whether any State law applies in an individual case. No Federal law protects patients in bankruptcy cases. With simple changes to the bankruptcy code, our amendment will fill this very dangerous gap in patient protection. 
   Specifically, one section covers the disposal of patient records. It provides clear and specific guidance to trustees who may not be aware of State or Federal requirements for maintaining these records, or confidentiality issues associated with patient records. Another section of our amendment makes the cost of closing a health care business, such as transferring patients to another health care facility, a top priority debt. This ensures these expenses will actually be paid. 
   In the ideal situation, though, we want to even keep these patients from being moved if that is possible, and I think it is possible. In fact, we have had the assurances of some of these chains that have gone into bankruptcy already that they are providing for the continuing care of their patients. 
   But perhaps the heart of this amendment, as I point to the third and main part of it, is the requirement that the bankruptcy judge appoint an ombudsman to act as an advocate for patients of health care businesses in bankruptcy. This ensures judges are fully aware of all the facts when they guide health care providers through bankruptcy. Prior to a chapter 11 filing, or immediately thereafter, the debtor may employ a consultant to help in its reorganization effort. The first step is usually cutting costs. Sometimes this step may result in a lower quality of patient care. An ombudsman, under our amendment, would provide an institutional voice for the patients to help ensure an acceptable level of patient care. 
   Our amendment also requires a trustee to make the best effort to transfer patients to another facility in the face of a health care business closing. This is designed to prevent a trustee from putting patients out on the street. 
   Our amendment provides a tremendous benefit for patients with a minimal impact on creditors and debtors. As policymakers, we must eliminate the possibility of midnight evictions at bankrupt nursing homes and hospitals. We must ease the fear of abandonment in individuals who are at a very vulnerable stage in their lives. 
   This is the amendment. We have had about 6 months pass since the first talk of bankruptcies by some major chains in the United States took place. I happen to also be chairman of the Senate Aging Committee. In that capacity, I consulted with HCFA when these first threats of bankruptcy came forth and we did not have the bankruptcy protection for the patients that our amendment proposes. I asked HCFA about plans for this, or what plans each of the States had for States that would have nursing homes in bankruptcy. We found a total vacuum of either Federal concern or Federal policy and, also in most States, that to be the situation. 
   Last spring, I asked the Health Care Financing Administration to start instituting a process that the States will go through as they license nursing homes. They should be concerned with the quality of care in nursing homes and have an interim plan for those nursing homes that go into bankruptcy, pending adoption of our legislation. 
   HCFA has carried out that responsibility very well. We now have word that each of the States have such a plan in place. We want to make sure this is a permanent part of the consideration of bankruptcy courts and, hence, the necessity of our legislation which goes beyond what the Federal Government, through HCFA, and the States through their licensing and quality control departments, has a responsibility to do. They now have in place a plan to deal with nursing home bankruptcies.

I hope my colleagues will look at this amendment and that it will not become controversial and we can adopt it. When the overall bankruptcy legislation becomes law, we will have appropriate protection, beyond the protection we give to creditors and debtors in this legislation, for the needs of patients as well. 
   We should not have these traumatic experiences that happened in Reseda  Nursing Home in San Fernando Valley and the over 100,000 patients who were in jeopardy in the example of the Senator from New Jersey.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have sent a letter to the majority leader requesting that I be consulted on certain nominations. I am asking to be consulted on the nominations of Anthony Harrington to be United States Ambassador to Brazil, Calendar No. 364, and for Charles Manatt to be United States Ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Calendar No. 361. Further, I ask to be consulted on all the promotion lists for career State Department foreign service officers. 
   I take this step reluctantly but believe it is necessary. The administration is required by law to submit to Congress on 1 November every year the so-called Majors' List, the list of major drug producing and trafficking countries that the President intends to certify on 1 March of the following year. The administration has never met this deadline, despite the fact that Congress extended it several years ago from 1 October to 1 November in order to give the administration more time in which to meet the requirement. Last year the list was over a month late. Despite repeated messages that this deliberate flouting of the law was not acceptable, the administration has again failed to submit the list or to offer any explanations. The list has yet to leave the State Department and must still wait for the laborious interagency review process. There is every likelihood that the list will be significantly late again this year. 
   With this as background, I have asked to be consulted on any unanimous-consent requests involving consideration of the nominations I have indicated until such time as the administration complies with the law. I will consider additional requests depending on the delay that is involved in the administration complying. I regret this course but I regret more the administration's failure to comply with the law.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before we start this very important bankruptcy reform legislation, first, thanks for working out the necessary parliamentary arrangements for bringing this bill up are owed to our majority leader, the Senator from Mississippi, and our minority leader, the Democratic leader, the Senator from South Dakota. So I thank them very much. 
   Then secondly, not only because this bill is up now on the floor of the Senate but also for the process of getting it through the Judiciary Committee, we, obviously, thank the Senator from Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. HATCH, for his leadership at the level of the committee and for a lot of things that had to be worked out to get us to the floor. And also thanks to the Senator from Vermont, the ranking Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, for his cooperation. 
   Since the beginning of the year, I have had the opportunity to work with the ranking minority member of our subcommittee that I chair, the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. TORRICELLI. Working with him has been a real treat, always with efforts to reach agreement. And for people throughout this country who have a tendency to be cynical about Washington, because of the lack of cooperation between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, I wish they could feel the working relationship Senator TORRICELLI, a Democrat, and I have had working on this legislation from its original introduction, with his not agreeing to everything I  introduced--he was a cosponsor--but with a spirit that throughout this process, which has gone on since January to this point of bringing the bill up on the floor of the Senate, that we would work cooperatively and in a spirit of cooperation to reach further compromises. I hope that brings us to a point where we do not have a lot of controversial amendments on the floor of the Senate, at least as they relate to the bankruptcy subject, the relevant amendments. 
   There will be a lot of amendments that have been in this bipartisan unanimous-consent agreement that are considered nongermane amendments, which will be brought up, that are controversial. We expected that to be part of the process. But for the amendments we have that relate to bankruptcy, I think there will be a lot fewer amendments because of the cooperation Senator TORRICELLI has shown in this compromise. 
   For the second time in 2 years, the Senate is considering fundamental bankruptcy reform. Last year, we passed a bankruptcy reform bill but the Senate was prevented from considering the final conference report at the very end of the 105th Congress. This year, we have the chance to finish this important work. We've been waiting for some time to get this bill up on the floor, and now that we're here, I'm anxious to begin the debate. 
   Bankruptcy is one of the most complicated subjects we will consider this year. So, at the outset, Mr. President, I think it's important for me as the chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over bankruptcy to take a few minutes to describe what bankruptcy reform is really all about in commonsense terms that we can all understand. Simply put, bankruptcy is a court proceeding where people get their debts wiped away. Every time a debt is wiped away through bankruptcy somebody loses money. That's plain and simple common sense. Of course, when somebody who extends credit has their obligation wiped away in bankruptcy, they are forced to make a decision. Should this loss simply be swallowed as a cost of business? Or do you raise prices for other customers to make up for your losses? 
   When bankruptcy losses are rare or infrequent, lenders can just swallow the loss. But when bankruptcies are frequent and common, lenders have to raise their prices to offset losses. For this reason, Treasury Secretary Larry Summers testified at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee that bankruptcies tend to drive up interest rates. Mr. President, if you believe Secretary Summers, bankruptcies are everyone's problem. Regular hardworking Americans have to pay higher prices for goods and services as a result of bankruptcies. The bankruptcy bill we're considering will discourage bankruptcies, and therefore lessen upward pressure on interest rates and higher prices by making it harder for people who can repay their debts to wipe them away. It seems like common sense to require people who can repay their debts to pull their own weight. But under our current bankruptcy laws, someone can get full debt cancellation in chapter 7 with no questions asked. If we pass S. 625, bankruptcy judges and trustees will start asking questions about ability to repay. And, if someone seeking bankruptcy can repay, they will be channeled into Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, which requires people to repay some portion of their debts as a pre-condition for limited debt cancellation. Of course, people who can't repay can still use the bankruptcy system as they would have before. But, for people with higher incomes who can repay their debts, the free ride will be over. 
   The basic bankruptcy policy question the Senate has to answer is this: Should people with means be required to pay at least some of their debts under Chapter 13 or not? Right now, the current bankruptcy system is oblivious to the financial condition of someone asking to be excused from paying his debts. The richest captain of industry could walk into a Bankruptcy Court tomorrow and walk out with his debts erased. And, as I described earlier, the rest of America will pay higher prices for goods and services as a result. 
   I would ask my colleagues to think about that for a second. If we had no bankruptcy system at all, and we were starting from scratch, would we design a system that lets the rich walk away from their debts and shift the costs to society at large, including the poor and the middle class? I don't think that any of us here would design such a system. But somehow, that's exactly the system we have now. I could easily imagine the fiery rhetoric from our more liberal friends if we on the Republican side were to even suggest that the Senate create a bankruptcy system that lets the wealthy and the well-to-do walk away from their debts and stick working Americans with the tab. But we have just such a system in place today. 
   Mr. President, if Senators ask themselves the question ``Who wins and who loses under current law, and who will win and who will lose if we pass S. 625,'' then I think that the importance of bankruptcy reform becomes pretty obvious. If you believe President Clinton's own Treasury Secretary, society at large loses under the current system when bankruptcies drive up interest rates. Of course, it's the deadbeats who walk away from their debts who win under the current system. If we pass this bill, then the American people will win as upward pressure on interest rates and prices 
   is removed. And people who look at bankruptcy as a convenient financial planning tool will lose. 
   Mr. President, I think our situation is urgent. Our bankruptcy system is spiraling out of control. These are good times in our Nation. Thanks to the fiscal discipline initiated by Congress, and the hard work of the American people, we have the first balanced budget in a generation. Unemployment is low, we have a burgeoning stock market and most Americans are optimistic about the future. But in the midst of such prosperity, about one and a half million Americans declared bankruptcy just in 1998. Based on filings for the first two quarters of 1999, it looks like there will be just under 1.4 million bankruptcy filings for this year. To put this in some historical context, since 1990 the rate of personal bankruptcy filings has increased almost 100 percent. Now, I don't think that anyone knows all the reasons underlying the bankruptcy crisis. But I think I can talk about what's not at the root of the bankruptcy crisis. I have a chart here that shows the dramatic increase in bankruptcies since 1993. During the same timeframe, as the chart shows, unemployment has declined just as dramatically and real wages have risen to an all-time high. 
   The economic numbers tell us that the bankruptcy crisis isn't the result of people who can't get jobs. And the jobs that people do have are paying more than ever. So, the bankruptcy crisis isn't about desperate people confronting layoffs and underemployment. With the economy doing so well, and with so many Americans with high-quality, good-paying jobs, we have to look deep into the eroding moral values of some to find out what's driving the bankruptcy crisis. Some people flat out don't want to honor their obligations and are looking for an easy way out. In the opinion of this Senator, a significant part of the bankruptcy crisis is basically a moral crisis. Some people just don't have a sense of personal responsibility. 
   It seems clear to me that our lax bankruptcy system must bear some of the blame for the bankruptcy crisis. Just as the welfare system we used to have encouraged people not to get jobs and encouraged people not to even think about pulling their own weight, our lax bankruptcy system doesn't even ask people to consider paying what they owe. Such a system obviously contributes to the fraying of the moral fiber of our Nation. Why pay your bills when you can walk away with no questions asked? Why honor your obligations when you can take the easy way out through bankruptcy? If we don't tighten the bankruptcy system, this moral erosion will certainly continue. 
   Mr. President, the polls are very clear that the American people want the bankruptcy system tightened up. In my home State of Iowa, 78 percent of Iowans surveyed favor bankruptcy reform. And the picture is the same nationally. According to the PBS program ``Techno-Politics,'' almost 70 percent of Americans support bankruptcy reform. The American people seem to sense that the bankruptcy crisis is fundamentally a moral crisis. According  to a poll conducted by the Democratic polling firm of Penn & Schoen on perceptions of bankruptcy, 84 percent of Americans think that bankruptcy is more socially acceptable today than a few years ago. Of course, Penn & Schoen is a Democratic polling firm used by President Clinton. So, I think that this number is very telling given that it was produced by a liberal polling firm. 
   In my State of Iowa, the editorial page of the Des Moines Register has summed up the problem we have with the bankruptcy system by stating that bankruptcy ``was never intended as the one-stop, no-questions-asked solution to irresponsibility.'' I totally agree. So, let's look at the situation we face today. We have a bankruptcy system which fosters irresponsibility and which operates as a regressive system for redistributing economic resources from America's working families to the wealthy. In effect, blue collar factory workers are paying the tab for well-compensated professionals to live high on the hog. 
   Mr. President, as we move forward to debate bankruptcy reform, I believe that we must keep in mind the fact that the bankruptcy crisis is both an economic problem and moral problem. If we pass meaningful bankruptcy reform this year, as I hope and expect that we will, the Senate can remove a drag on the economy and at the same time contribute the rebuilding of our Nation's moral foundations. 
   Mr. President, over 30 years ago, Senator Albert Gore, Sr.--the father of the Vice-President--introduced a bill to means-test Chapter 7 debtors. In his introductory statement, in words that still ring true today, he described the similarities between special tax loopholes and lax 
   bankruptcy laws. Senator Gore said that bankruptcy is like a special interest tax loophole in that someone gets out of paying his fair share at the expense of hardworking Americans who play by the rules. I think that Senator Gore had it exactly right all the way back then. 
   In the last Congress we almost closed the Chapter 7 loophole. The Senate and House both passed good bills, and we made them both better in a conference report that received overwhelming bipartisan support in the other body. But we ran out of time in the Senate. I've made every effort to be fair and bipartisan throughout this process. When Senator TORRICELLI became my ranking member at the beginning of this year, I went to him and asked him to work with me on a new bankruptcy bill. Senator TORRICELLI asked for several modifications to last year's bankruptcy bill to respond to concerns raised by Members on his side of the aisle. I agree to make many of these changes. The means-test is much more flexible in this year's bill, giving judges greater discretion to consider the individual circumstances of each debtor. The bill contains much tougher penalties for using threats to coerce debtors into paying debts which could be wiped away once they are in bankruptcy. The bill also requires the Justice Department to concentrate law enforcement resources on enforcing consumer protection laws against abusive debt collection practices, and allows State law enforcement to enforce State consumer protections in bankruptcy court. The committee report lists these modifications in greater detail and summarizes the major changes from last year's conference report. Mr. President, when all of these many changes are considered in a fair and reasonable way, I believe that it will be clear that a great majority of Senators can support S. 625 as it is right now. But there's more. The Grassley-Torricelli amendment contains even more changes to ensure that lower income Americans are not disadvantaged by this reform. A provision to impose personal liability on debtor attorneys--which I strongly suppport--has been removed. And the Grassley-Torricelli amendment contains numerous changes to the small business title of the bankruptcy bill to add new flexibility. 
   Shortly, I will cosponsor an amendment with Senator TORRICELLI to require credit card companies to give consumers meaningful information about minimum payments on credit cards. Consumers will be warned against making only minimum payments, and there will be an example to drive this point home. Finally, consumers will be given a toll-free phone number to call where they can get information about how long it will take to pay off their own credit card balances if they make only the minimum payments. This new information will truly educate consumers. This new information will improve the financial literacy of American consumers. 
   In the Judiciary Committee, S. 625 was passed on a strong, bipartisan vote of 14-4. All Republicans and half of the Democrats voted for the bill. So, we have a good bill and one that most Members of the Senate should be able to support at the end of the day. With so many consumer protections and disclosures, I'm confident that the Senate will pass S. 625 with strong support. 
   In addition to benefitting society at large, lessening upward pressures on interest rates, S. 625 makes a number of changes which I believe will be very beneficial to especially vulnerable segments of our society. Child support claimants have been given the highest priority when the assets of a bankruptcy estate are distributed to creditors. Bankruptcy trustees and creditors of bankrupts are required to give information about the location of deadbeat parents who owe child support, turning our bankruptcy courts into a low cost locator service for custodial parents. And finally, under S. 625 parents owning child support can erase a wider array of debts than is typically the case, thereby preventing private creditors from competing with child support claims in a post-bankruptcy environment. This is an important point that I think everyone should realize. Under the Senate bill, child support will never compete with private creditors after bankruptcy. This is a unique feature of this year's Senate bill, so many Members may not be aware of it. I would ask Senators interested in child support and bankruptcy to study section 314 of the bill.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I rise in support of an amendment I am sponsoring with Senator CONRAD to establish trade negotiating objectives for the new round of multilateral trade negotiations the United States will help launch in about four weeks with 133 other WTO member nations in Seattle. 
   The principles contained in this amendment are important because the upcoming negotiations in agriculture are so vital to our farm economy, and vital to the United States. 
   The last multilateral trade round, the Uruguay Round, established, for the first time, multilateral rules on market access, export subsidies, and domestic support for agriculture. 
   But as significant as the Uruguay Round was for agriculture, it was only a first step. Much remains to be done. 
   Agricultural tariffs in industrial countries still average more than 40 percent, compared with tariffs of 5 to 10 percent in manufactured goods. 
   The average world agricultural tariff is 56 percent. In the United States, it is 3 percent. But tariffs for some agricultural products reach 200 percent or more. 
   Export subsidies are still far too high, and distort trade in third-country markets. 
   Producer subsidy equivalents, which measure assistance to producers in terms of the value of transfers to farmers generated by agricultural policy, are also far higher in the European Union than in the United States. 
   These transfers are paid either by consumers or by taxpayers in the form of market price support, direct payments, or other support. 
   The Producer subsidy equivalent for all agricultural products in the EU has averaged around 45 percent. 
   In the United States, the producer subsidy equivalent is only 16 percent. 
   So-called ``Blue Box'' spending is also out of control. This is the trade-distorting spending that was authorized in the Uruguay Round. 
   Currently, the United States has no programs that fall within the Blue Box. But the European Union maintains huge trade-distorting subsidy payments. 
   We should finally admit that the Blue Box is a mistake, and eliminate it completely. 
   State trading enterprises allow some countries to undercut United States exports into third markets and restrict imports. 
   And the principle of sound science is being thwarted with regard to bio-engineered products, to the great detriment of our farm economy. 
   We need to address all of these issues in the upcoming WTO negotiations. 
   But we also need to make certain that when we negotiate with our trading partners, that the deal we finally implement is the one that was actually negotiated, and not a different agreement that was changed later through secret understanding or side arrangement. 
   This is an important principle of international law. It is also a basic principle of equity and fairness. 
   Only after the WTO Agreement was signed into law did some of us in the Senate learn for the first time that there was more to the Uruguay Round agreement than we originally thought, due to secret side agreements. 
   This must not happen again. 
   The amendment I am offering with Senator CONRAD will insure that this practice will end. 
   The only trade deal that should be enforced is the one the parties actually negotiated. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment, so that we can get this new round of trade negotiations off to the best possible start.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is with a feeling of disappointment that I come to the floor today. What's bothering me is a disturbing report I am releasing today on the Office of the Inspector General, or IG, at the Department of Defense, DOD. 
   This is about a report prepared by the Majority Staff of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, of which I am the Chairman. 
   I have always had such great respect for the DOD IG. I have always thought that we could rely on that office to be fair and independent and thorough, and above all, honest. 
   In the past, I always felt like I could trust the DOD IG's judgment. 
   This report, Mr. President is disturbing. 
   The evidence in this report questions the credibility of the IG's investigative process. And it raises questions about the judgment of the Acting IG, Mr. Donald Mancuso. 
   It is a report on the Oversight Investigation of allegations of misconduct at the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, or DCIS. DCIS is the criminal investigations arm of the DOD IG. 
   The allegations examined by the Staff involve possible misconduct by DCIS agents between 1993 and 1996. 
   The current Acting DOD IG, Mr. Mancuso, is associated with the allegations. Mr. Mancuso was the Director of DCIS from 1988 until 1997, when he became the Deputy DOD IG. 
   I also understand that Mr. Mancuso is a potential candidate for nomination to be the next DOD IG. 
   In June 1999, the Staff was approached by a former DCIS agent, Mr. William G. Steakley. 
   Mr. Steakley raised numerous allegations regarding prohibited employment practices at DCIS, but these were far too extensive and complex to be examined by my small Subcommittee staff. 
   However, one of Mr. Steakley's allegations caught our attention. This was the allegation that DCIS officials had ``made false statements'' in adverse reports on his conduct. 
   Mr. Steakley alleged that an agent assigned to the DCIS internal affairs unit, Mr. Mathew A. Walinski, had a history of falsifying investigative reports to damage the reputations of fellow agents. 
   Mr. Steakley further alleged that senior DCIS management, including Mr. Mancuso, was fully aware of the allegations about this agent's unethical practices, yet failed to take appropriate corrective action. 
   And Mr. Steakley claimed he had proof to back up the allegations. 
   The staff conducted a careful examination of these allegations and concluded that some have merit. 
   To evaluate the allegations, the staff reviewed numerous documents to include the extensive files at the Office of Special Counsel, OSC, DOD personnel files, and DCIS investigative reports. The staff also conducted a number of formal interviews. 
   A careful review of all pertinent material makes one point crystal clear: 
   The evidence shows that Mr. Walinski fabricated his reported interview of the Air Force payroll technician, Ms. Nancy Gianino, on May 21, 1993. This reported interview was conducted in connection with the investigation of possible tax evasion charges against Mr. Steakley. 
   In addition, OSC files contain numerous references to a second internal affairs case handled by Mr. Walinski, in which he apparently fabricated another report. 
   When the staff asked the DOD IG for this case file--known as the Johanson stolen gun case, they discovered that Mr. Walinski had apparently fabricated the reported interview of Agent Jon Clark on March 2, 1994 and possibly others. This file contains sworn statements by the agents involved that Walinski's reported interview with Clark never took place. 
   These two cases--when taken together--show that Mr. Walinski has a history of falsifying reports. 
   And more importantly, the record shows that rank and file complaints about Mr. Walinski's unethical investigative practices went directly to top DCIS management, including Mr. Mancuso. 
   The record also shows DCIS management knew about the Walinski problem but failed to take appropriate corrective action. 
   Yet despite rank and file complaints, Mr. Walinski's false reports were used by DCIS management to discredit and punish Agents Johanson and Steakley. 
   In January 1999, Mr. Walinski was allowed to transfer to another federal law enforcement agency--the Treasury IG--with no record of punishment or accountability. In his new assignment, Mr. Walinski is still responsible for investigating employee misconduct. 
   In fact, the record shows that at least 3 weeks after DCIS management was informed that Mr. Walinski had fabricated the Clark interview, he was given a generous cash bonus award. 
   Moreover, Mr. Walinski was assigned to conduct an inspection of the field office where rank and file complaints about his false reports had originated. 
   While investigating Mr. Steakley's allegations, the staff discovered that the DCIS internal affairs unit--to which Mr. Walinski was assigned--was directed by Mr. Larry J. Hollingsworth. 
   Mr. Hollingsworth was convicted of a felony in U.S. District Court in March 1996. He was apprehended and confessed to filing a fraudulent passport application after a fellow agent recognized his photo in a law enforcement bulletin. 
   The government authorities, who investigated Mr. Hollingsworth's criminal conduct, believe that he committed about 12 overt acts of fraud. These overt acts of fraud were committed while Mr. Hollingsworth was Director of the DCIS internal affairs unit--Mr. Walinski's office. 
   Mr. President, can you imagine that? The head of the internal affairs unit of DOD's criminal investigative division was committing passport fraud. That's certainly a confidence builder in that organization, isn't it? 
   These authorities further believe Mr. Hollingsworth's actions were especially disturbing since passport fraud is usually committed in furtherance of a more serious crime, but the underlying crime was never discovered. 
   Although Mr. Mancuso and Mr. Hollingsworth were considered friends by associates, Mr. Mancuso failed to recuse himself from administrative actions affecting Mr. Hollingsworth. 
   Mr. Mancuso even aided in Hollingsworth's defense during criminal trial proceedings--even though Mr. Hollingsworth was considered uncooperative. 
   What's more, Mr. Mancuso endorsed an outstanding performance rating for Mr. Hollingsworth three weeks after he confessed to felonious activity to U.S. State Department special agents. 
   Mr. Mancuso even wrote a letter on official DOD IG stationary to the sentencing judge, Judge Ellis, on the convicted felon's behalf. 
   In this letter, he asked the judge to consider extenuating circumstances. He told the judge that Mr. Hollingsworth had taken a half day's leave to file the fraudulent passport application. Evidently, Mr. Mancuso thought that taking leave to commit a crime was sonehow exculpatory. 
   This is what Mr. Mancuso said in his letter to Judge Ellis, and I quote: ``Mr. Hollingsworth could have come and gone as he pleased,'' but he ``took leave to commit a felony.'' 
   Mr. Mancuso concluded with this telling remark: ``To this day, there is no evidence that Mr. Hollingsworth has ever done anything improper relating to his duties and responsibilities as a DCIS agent and manager.'' 
   Coming from a law enforcement officer like Mr. Mancuso, these words defy understanding. The last time I checked, part of doing your job as a law enforcement officer is not committing crimes. 
   Mr. Hollingsworth confessed to and was convicted of felonious activity while employed by DCIS as a criminal investigator. 
   As State Department agents put it, these crimes were committed in the furtherance of a more serious crime that was never discovered. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. Mancuso seems to have been completely blind to the problem. 
   As a result of a series of decisions--personally approved by Mr. Mancuso, Mr. Hollingsworth was allowed to remain in an employed status at DCIS for 6 months after his felony conviction. He was then allowed to retire with a full federal law enforcement annuity exactly on his 50th birthday in September 1996.  
   Had Mr. Mancuso exercised good judgement and other available legal options, Mr. Hollingsworth could have been removed from DCIS immediately after conviction--in March 1996. Under these circumstances, he would have been forced to wait 12 years--until the year 2008--to begin receiving a non-law enforcement annuity commencing at age 62. Had Mr. Mancuso exercised this option, he would have saved the taxpayers at least $750,000.00, which is the amount of money Mr. Hollingsworth will collect thanks to the generous treatment he received from his friend and colleague, Mr. Mancuso. 
   Think of the signal this sends to rank and file law enforcement officers who look to their managers for leadership and fair treatment. 
   The office of the DOD IG demands the highest standards of integrity, judgment, and conduct. 
   Does Mr. Mancuso meet those standards? 
   Given Mr. Mancuso's poor judgment and his irresponsible handling of the three cases examined in the staff report, I believe it is reasonable to question:

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an amendment I am sponsoring with Senator CONRAD to establish a new, limited Trade Adjustment Assistance Program for farmers and fishermen. There are two key reasons why this new program is so necessary, and why Senator CONRAD and I are offering this legislation. 
   The first and most important reason is that the existing Trade Adjustment Assistance Program simply does not work for farmers. When a sudden surge in imports of an agricultural commodity dramatically lowers prices for that commodity, and sharply reduces the net income for family farmers, these farmers are undeniably hurt by import competition. 
   They are just as hurt as steel workers, or auto workers, or textile workers who experience the same thing. But because farmers lose income, but not their jobs, they do not qualify for the existing Trade Adjustment Assistance for workers program. The reduction in family farm income from important competition hurts farmers in a very serious way, because it comes at a time when farmers desperately need cash assistance to repay their operating loans and adjust to the import competition. 
   The second reason why I offer this legislation is to correct an inequity that should not continue. The inequity is that it is clear that President Kennedy, who designed the original Trade  Adjustment Assistance program as part of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, clearly intended farmers to benefit from the program, just as much as other workers hurt as a result of a federal policy to reduce barriers to foreign trade. In his message to the Congress on the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, President Kennedy spoke about his Trade Adjustment Assistance Program. In fact, in his March 12, 1962 message, he referred to farmers at least three times. 
   Here is part of what President Kennedy said.  
   I am recommending as an essential part of the new trade program that companies, farmers, and workers who suffer damage from increased foreign import competition be assisted in their efforts to adjust to that competition. When considerations of national policy make it desirable to avoid higher tariffs, those injured by that competition should not be required to bear the brunt of the impact. Rather, the burden of economic adjustment should be borne in part by the Federal Government.  
   What President Kennedy said was so important I want to emphasize what he said: those who are injured by the national trade policies of the United States should not bear the brunt of the impact. And trade adjustment assistance should be available for companies, farmers, and workers. 
   Mr. President, this is simply an issue of fairness. Basic American fairness. The United States has lead the world in liberalizing trade. We started this process of global trade liberalization in 1947, when most of the world was reeling from the enormous physical and economic devastation of World War Two. We saw then that the way to avoid this type of catastrophe in the future was to bring nations closer together through peaceful trade and open markets. That process has been spectacularly successful. Through eight series, or rounds, of multilateral trade negotiations, we have scrapped ten of thousands of tariffs. Many non-tariff trade barriers have been torn down. Others have been sharply reduced. The result of 50 years of trade liberalization has been the creation of enormous wealth and prosperity, and millions of new jobs. But not everyone has prospered. 
   Some have been injured by this deliberate policy of free trade and open markets. And that's exactly why President Kennedy and the 87th Congress created the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. To help those injured by our national policy of free trade and open markets adjust to their changing circumstances with limited assistance. 
   President Kennedy's Secretary of Labor, Arthur J. Goldberg put it the best. Secretary Goldberg said:  
   As a humane Government, we recognize our responsibility to provide adequate assistance to those who may be injured by a deliberately chosen trade policy . . . It is because of the desire to do justice to the people who are affected. . .  
   Mr. President, we cannot do justice by helping only some of the people affected by our national trade policy. We cannot do justice by ignoring farmers. We must do justice by ignoring farmers. We must reach out to everyone, including farmers, just as President Kennedy envisioned. Now, I know there are some in this Chamber who believe that we should wait to make changes in the Trade Adjustment Assistance program until we can do a full review of the entire TAA program. 
   I do not agree with that view, for a very fundamental reason. We are only about four weeks away from the start of the WTO Ministerial Conference in Seattle. In Seattle, the United States will help launch the ninth series, or round, of multilateral trade negotiations since 1947. 
   A key goal of the Seattle Ministerial will be to liberalize world agricultural markets even more. This will mean increased import competition for American agricultural products, not less. Farmers have always been among the strongest supporters of free trade, because so much of what they produce is sold in the international marketplace. 
   The income our farm families earn in these foreign markets sustains our economy, and contributes greatly to our national well-being. But farm support for free trade cannot, and should not, be taken for granted. 
   As I said in support of this legislation last week, we are in the worst farm crisis since the depression of the 1930s. Now, low commodity prices are not caused exclusively by import competition. But it is certainly a contributing factor to these historically low prices. 
   If we lose the support of the farm community for free trade, Mr. President, I doubt that we will be able to win congressional approval for any new trade concessions that may be negotiated in the new round of trade talks. So this is all about fairness. It is about equality. It is about common sense. 
   For all of these reasons, and because, as Labor Secretary Goldberg said 37 years ago, we must recognize our responsibility as a humane government, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to say some words about the loss of our mutual friend, John Chafee from Rhode Island. 
   His passing away this week was obviously sad for all of us in this body, as well as his family and his friends. 
   He has left an impressive legacy both for this body and for his service to the United States. 
   I would like to take a few moments to express my thoughts about this truly heroic person. 
   When I came to the Senate in 1981, Senator Chafee was already one of the body's giants. He was well respected. I remember the budget battles we had in those years in the early 1980s, and the impact he had as a leader of moderate Republicans--usually about half dozen or so Senators who always had a major influence on the budget process. Disagree though some of us might with Senator Chafee's position on these issues, there was no disagreement among any of us that the results of his efforts were always a moderating influence on what this body did. 
   I served with Senator Chafee on the Finance Committee for many years--the committee that has jurisdiction over taxes, over Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, foreign trade, and welfare. He had a passion; that was to preserve the safety net programs, and especially in the health sector. He was a strong supporter of the Community Health Center Program of Medicaid, and most importantly children's health programs. 
   In fact, one of the last meetings in which I joined Senator Chafee was his handling of a hearing a week ago in which he was proposing and forwarding legislation to make sure that people who were part of the foster care system did not fall through the cracks as far as their health care was concerned once they were forced out of the system because of age. 
   Above all else, Senator Chafee, as demonstrated by that hearing last week and his promotion of that legislation, was committed to the proper amount of health care and quality of health care. He also worked long and hard in a very generic area we call health care reform, sometimes minuscule fine-tuning, but also Senator Chafee was in the middle of the big battles of health care reform. 
   During the time the Senate was considering the Clinton health care plan, then-majority leader Bob Dole appointed Mr. Chafee to chair a Republican health care reform task force. Senator Chafee for several months convened meetings every Thursday in his Capitol office. During those meetings, he led discussions on various aspects of health care reform. I had an opportunity to participate in a lot of those meetings and know firsthand Senator John Chafee's commitment not only to informing and providing the procedure for informing fellow Members about the issue but also his efforts working toward compromise that would eventually get the votes to bring legislation to the floor and through the Senate. 
   The work we did in this task force culminated in a major health care reform bill that had the support of most of our Republican colleagues. It was a major achievement, needless to say. It wasn't something that finally was passed by this body because the whole Clinton health care issue got so overburdened with so many controversial aspects that the Clinton health care proposal went down, and compromises, more moderate and more bipartisan, obviously, were taken off the Senate's agenda at the same time. 
   That still does not denigrate in any way the hard work of John Chafee on health care generally. In fact, it is a very good example of his hard work and, most importantly, his commitment to the overall issue, over a long period of time, leading up to that last hearing he chaired just 1 week ago. 
   More recently, Senator Chafee urged the modernization of the traditional Medicare fee-for-service program. It is likely, as we go further down the road, that Senator Chafee will have had much influence on what we as a body produce even though he is no longer with us. In that regard, his influence will certainly have outlived his own life. That is a hallmark of a truly great man and a great Senator. 
   I, along with my colleagues, will miss Senator Chafee for many reasons. I respected him. I liked him. I listened to him. I looked to him as a leader. He spoke with authority and with credibility. Most importantly, he was a very compassionate person. Above all, what is important in political leadership is that he was very independent. He stood up for what he believed in, sometimes in the face of opposition from even his own party, my party, the Republican Party. That is the quality of John Chafee I grew to admire most. 
   Senator Chafee's legacy is his extraordinary service to his country. The way he knew to serve was in a very mighty way, whether it was on the battlefield as a genuine war hero or his service as Governor, Secretary of the Navy, or for 23 years as a Member of the Senate from Rhode Island. Not everyone is capable of making a big difference in this world, but John Chafee did. We salute him. I salute him, his life, and his accomplishments. I join my colleagues in remembering his greatness and appreciating the contributions he made to this country.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this morning Senator CONRAD offered an amendment which I cosponsor. I ask my colleagues to consider voting for this amendment that will make the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program available for farmers as well as industrial workers. 
   This program, trade assistance, is being reauthorized in this legislation. 
   This amendment would expand it just a little bit. 
   President Clinton, about a month ago in an address spoke about one-third of the jobs that have been created during his administration have come as a result of opening foreign trade and all the economic activity that takes place because of foreign trade. 
   If we can have millions of jobs created during this administration because we have had a 50-year history of breaking down trade barriers between countries, we have to conclude that the liberalization of trade is good for American workers and good for our economy. 
   Free trade has produced many winners in our economy. This has been true since 1947 when the United States and just 22 other countries created the regime for liberalized trade we have been under since 1947 called the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
   Since 1987, we have had eight series--sometimes they are called rounds--of multilateral trade negotiations to break down these barriers. These multilateral trade negotiations have liberalized trade in many sectors. Tens of thousands of tariffs have been scrapped. Many nontariff trade barriers have been eliminated. Others have been sharply reduced. 
   The result of 50 years of trade liberalization has meant the creation of enormous wealth and prosperity and, as I have said, millions of new jobs, one-third of the new jobs created just in this decade. But whenever you have a free market economy, probably even when you have a regimented economy, as the socialist countries have had, there is always some adjustment in the economy. There are some winners and some losers; that is true in our economy, and it is true in the foreign trade part of our economy. 
   For this reason, more than 35 years ago President Kennedy and the 87th Congress thought it was only fair to transfer some of the net gain from free trade to injured workers or firms or industries or even entire communities. The first U.S. Trade Adjustment Assistance Program was designed by President Kennedy and authorized by the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to help workers dislocated as a result of a Federal policy to reduce barriers to foreign trade. 
   It is very important for the purposes of our amendment and also the spirit of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act to hear what President Kennedy, its author, had to say about its intent and scope:  
   I am recommending as an essential part of the new trade program that companies, farmers, and workers who suffer damage from increased foreign import competition be assisted in their efforts to adjust to that competition. When considerations of national policy make it desirable to avoid higher tariffs, those injured by that competition should not be required to bear the brunt of the impact. Rather, the burden of economic adjustment should be borne in part by the Federal Government.  
   What President Kennedy said was so important, and I emphasize, once again, a small part of it:  
   Trade adjustment assistance should be available for companies, farmers, and workers.  
   In spite of President Kennedy's belief that farmers should be able to get relief from trade adjustment assistance, just like others who suffer from trade-related job losses, the 
   reality is, few, if any, individual family farmers are ever able to qualify for this program. Hence the amendment by Senator CONRAD and myself that is offered today to address this inequity. 
   Senator CONRAD and I think it is only fair that not only farmers be included but fishermen be added to this group as well. They are workers, they help put food on our tables, and they have the same problems under the current program as farmers. 
   Our program will create a limited new trade adjustment assistance for farmers program. It will provide cash assistance to farmers and fishermen when the price of a commodity falls sharply as a result of imports and causes a farm's net income to drop. The formula ensures farmers will recover a portion, but not all, of the income lost due to import competition. 
   This is not an open-ended program. Assistance is capped at $10,000 per farmer and a total of $100 million per year, and, of course, as must be under the Budget Act, this Trade Adjustment Assistance Program is paid for. In order to qualify for this limited Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, farmers will have to consult with the USDA's Extension Service to develop a plan for adjusting to the import competition. 
   In about 5 weeks, the United States will launch a new round of global trade talks with 133 other WTO--World Trade Organization--member countries. That is an extension of the organization that started out with 22 countries in 1947 for this regime of liberalizing trade. In 5 weeks, these talks start. 
   Farmers have always been among the strongest supporters of free trade because so much of what they produce is sold in overseas markets. In fact, there is an absolute necessity of selling overseas because, even in normal production, we produce a third more than can be domestically consumed. Profitability and farming must come by selling the surplus overseas. 
   The income our farm families earn in these foreign markets sustains our economy and contributes greatly to our national well-being. Farm support for free trade cannot and should not be taken for granted by the rest of the people in this country who benefit from free trade. 
   We are in the worst farm crisis since the Depression of the thirties. Low commodity prices are not caused exclusively by import competition, and I do not mean to imply that. In fact, it is just the opposite. It is caused because a lot of our markets overseas have been hurt by the financial crisis that started 2 1/2 years ago in the Far East. But, of course, in our complex economy, even in our complex agricultural economy, trade might be a contributing factor to these historically low prices. 
   Through trade adjustment assistance, we look after Americans who are harmed by import competition but not farmers. Through trade adjustment assistance, we have looked after communities harmed by import competition but not farm communities. Between 1979 and 1996, 12 trade adjustment assistance centers in the United States assisted about 6,130 firms with petitions for trade adjustment assistance. During this same 17-year period, these centers assisted only 200 food growers and processors, 
   200 firms in 17 years that were nonindustrial. But these firms were not individual family farms. I am concerned that if we lose farm support for free trade, it will be very hard, and perhaps impossible, to win congressional approval for new trade deals when these negotiations conclude among these 133 countries.  
   Fairness, equity, common sense, and, most importantly, the original intent of President Kennedy's program, all tell us that farmers and fishermen should and must be a part of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program. 
   So as Senator CONRAD did this morning, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on the Africa trade bill, which is now before the Senate, we are in a parliamentary position in which all the amendments offered have been offered by the Republican side. Such a position had to be taken by the majority leader because of failures to get time agreements and commitments from the other side, meaning the Democrat side, on a limitation on amendments and time agreements on those amendments so we could bring this bill to a vote. 
   I hope our Democrat friends will heed the necessity of this legislation from President Clinton's State of the Union Address that this was one of the most important goals of his administration. Since the Republican majority in the Congress is often criticized by the President for not working closely with the President--and I think those charges by the President of the United States are overblown most times, but those charges are still made. So in the present environment in which one of the President's prime pieces of legislation is before the Senate, with a determination by our majority leader to help get this part of the President's program into law, I would think the Democrat minority would be embarrassed that they are taking actions that make it difficult to get one of the President's programs through this Congress for the President's signature. 
   I hope, as one Senator--not speaking for the majority leader, just speaking for myself--they will reach agreement on these very important amendments so we can bring this bill to finality and get it sent to the President, not because it is one of the President's major goals, not that it shows the President's charges against the Republican majority are many times unfounded, not for any of those reasons, as legitimate as that might be, but because the substance of this legislation is very important for the economy of the United States and the economy of the countries that it applies to--because free trade strengthens economies, free and fair trade creates jobs, not only in the United States, but also economies that practice free trade anywhere around the world are stronger economies because of it. That is the goal we seek in this legislation. 
   We have heard we have a lot to fear from free trade. In the last few months, we have heard from many quarters that free trade is harmful because it destroys jobs. We have heard free trade is not fair trade because it causes investments to shift overseas. We have heard that the Africa trade bill will do both of these things, as well as cause illegal transshipment that we cannot do anything about. 
   When you look at the facts, none of these three arguments that are used against this piece of legislation has any merit. First, let's look at the claim that free trade destroys jobs. The 50-year history of the multilateral trade negotiations, first under the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade, and now under the World Trade Organization, called WTO for short, shows the enormous positive effect on the world economy of liberalizing trade by reducing tariffs and getting rid of nontariff trade barriers.  
   We have had eight series, or rounds as they are called, of multilateral trade negotiations since GATT first started in 1947. We are about to launch a new round, the ninth one, at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Seattle in about 5 weeks. 
   During the first round, the Geneva Round it was called, in 1947, we negotiated 45,000 tariff concessions affecting one-fifth of world trade. 
   In the sixth round, which was called the Kennedy Round, we slashed custom duties on average of 35 percent. 
   During the last round, the Uruguay Round, starting in the middle 1980s, ending in 1993, we reduced or eliminated many nontariff trade barriers. 
   The results of this trade liberalization have been nothing short of astounding--creating jobs, expanding the world economic pie, creating better economies in various countries around the world, enhancing political opportunities and, most importantly, political stability. The expansion of free trade that has followed this 50-year period of trade liberalization has spurred one of the greatest bursts of wealth creation the world has ever seen. 
   In 1947, when we started postwar trade liberalization, the total value of world exports was about $50 billion. Today, the total value of world exports is $7 trillion, more than 3 1/2 times the total budget of the United States. 
   Free trade has enriched every American family. According to the President's own 1998 economic report, the added economic benefit to each American through expanded trade is $1,000 per year or $4,000 per year for a family of four, as we measure families in America. This is equivalent to an annual $4,000 per family tax cut. Where can one get a $4,000 tax cut these days? Even the tax cuts now being debated in the Congress do not come anywhere close to this amount of money to enhance family income and disposable income. 
   The facts that show the benefits of free trade seem to be so compelling that in explaining them, I don't know where to begin. 
   Let me mention a recent example that comes from NAFTA. According to a September 1998 report published by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, approximately 191,000 jobs were certified, between January 1, 1949, and August 12, 1998, as potentially suffering NAFTA-related loss--affecting 191,000 workers. That is on the negative side. We have always said that free trade will cause some job 
   dislocation. That is why we have programs such as trade adjustment assistance--to ease the transition that is sometimes necessary when we have open markets. 
   On the positive side, there has been much more gain. Let's go back to that Congressional Research Service study I cited. The number, 191,000 workers affected negatively by NAFTA over 4 years, represents less than the number of jobs created in any single month in 1997. In contrast, then, on the positive side, more than 1 million new jobs were created from new exports to Mexico and Canada after NAFTA was enacted into law--more than 1 million new jobs. 
   Next let's look at the claim that is made by opponents of this legislation or free trade generally that it causes investment to shift overseas. That claim, too, has little or no merit. Section 512 of the NAFTA Implementation Act required the President to provide a comprehensive assessment of the operation and effects of NAFTA to Congress. The President's report shows that the amount of new United States investment in Mexico is very low. Again, the specific facts are compelling. In 1997, direct United States investment in Mexico was $5.9 billion compared to United States domestic investment in plant and equipment of $864.9 billion. In other words, United States investment in Mexico was less than 1 percent of all United States domestic investment in plant and equipment in 1997. So much for that giant sucking sound we were supposed to have heard continuously from south of our border. 
   Free trade has been so good for our economy. If all these predictions about economic disaster haven't come true when we have liberalized trade in the past, it is clear we shouldn't fear tearing down barriers around the world, as we have for the last 50 years with the good results we have for the 50 years, without the expectation that those beneficial impacts would continue. We should, then, embrace such an opportunity. 
   Let me get specifically to the Africa trade bill. The fear that the Africa trade bill will cause a huge influx of illegal textile transshipments from Asia, as has been stated on the floor of the Senate, just is not true. I cite the International Trade Commission study, our own Government. It looked at the transshipment issue. Here is what our International Trade Commission found: 
   Assuming we will get illegal transshipments in a worst case scenario, the ITC study shows that U.S. apparel shipments would drop by one-tenth of 1 percent and result in the loss of less than 700 jobs. Again, to put this number in perspective, the U.S. economy has created about 200,000 jobs each month this year. 
   Remember, the ITC study guesstimate of 700 jobs is based on a worst case scenario. It is highly unlikely, then, that sub-Saharan Africa will see this level of export growth in the near term. They don't have the infrastructure. They don't have the trained workforce. They don't have good transportation. And the Africa bill has strong anti-transshipment provisions. 
   One might say, then, why the big deal about the Africa trade bill? Because trade is better than foreign aid and because, when you want to build up the economies of the developing nations, you start someplace. This is how we can best help them to help themselves. 
   Participating countries will have to commit to full cooperation with the United States to address and take any necessary action to prevent transshipment. The spirit of this legislation is that there not be transshipment. In addition, the U.S. Customs Service has effective procedures to thwart illegal transshipments, as Customs jump teams have proven to be successful in doing in both Hong Kong and Macao. 
   And there are many other provisions aimed at preventing transshipments. So free trade works. Free trade creates jobs and prosperity in the United States, adding $4,000 every year in economic benefits to each American family at home. Free trade keeps the peace by building interdependence among nations, and by bringing political stability to nations that heretofore have relied upon dictators and relied upon a government-controlled economy. Finally, free trade will help Africa break the shackles of poverty by bringing economic freedom to the most economically unfree and also the poorest regions in the world. So I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of legislation. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment, No. 2335, be temporarily laid aside in order for Senator REID of Nevada to offer an amendment. I further ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of that amendment, amendment No. 2335 become the pending business.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this resolution I am offering with Senator BAUCUS calls for fair access to Japan's $35 billion telecommunications equipment market. Telecommunications is one of our most important exports and one of our most significant areas for future export growth. 
   Recently, the United States and Japan reached a new telecommunications procurement agreement covering procurement by the successor companies of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company. This agreement replaced the 1997 agreement that expired when the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company was restructured. 
   We have had many difficulties gaining access to Japan's telecommunicates market in the past, probably not too different from a lot of sectors as we try to enter our products into Japan. It may be nothing new in that respect, but this is a new agreement that will be in effect for 2 years, and we should give it a chance to work. But history shows we have not made much progress when it comes to implementing fair bilateral market access agreements with Japan. 
   You know the usual story: We are always overjoyed, after several months or even years of negotiating an agreement with the Japanese, that it has been some major breakthrough; and then down the road a few months or years, when you expect the agreement to be carried out--not only according to its word but also according to its spirit--you find the victory you anticipated and were thankful for at the time it was signed comes out to be a half a loaf or a quarter of a loaf in practice. I think that is what we are finding out here a little bit with this telecommunications agreement. 
   The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company and the government in Japan, which owns 65 percent of the telecommunications group, have traditionally maintained that Nippon Telegraph and Telephone is a private company which should not be subject to government interference but be allowed to make its own procurement decisions. 
   Our concern is that we need effective bilateral government oversight so Japan's telecommunications industry does not revert to its traditional reliance upon domestic suppliers and consequently circumvent this agreement. That is because Nippon Telegraph and Telephone's procurement history shows that even nearly two decades after the first bilateral agreement on this company's procurement, Japan still tends to make a large portion of its procurement from the ``NTT family'' of Japanese equipment makers; thus, not opening their markets to products from overseas, including U.S. products. Often, NTT over-engineers specifications, which in the past were very Japan-specific or company-specific--another nontariff trade barrier to keep out products from the United States and other countries. 
   World telecommunications trade is growing very rapidly, but global market access is not keeping pace with the fast pace of technology development. The Baucus-Grassley resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that the only effective way for the United States to achieve significant market access in Japan is through Japan staying with serious and sustained deregulation and consequently having market opportunities for imports from other countries, including the United States. 
   This resolution carriers a message that ought to be heard loud and clear in the runup to the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference that will take place in Seattle at the end of November. So I strongly urge my colleagues to approve this resolution.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue which affects children across the country. 
   Brachial plexus injuries (BPI), also known as Erb's palsy, occur when the nerves which control the muscles in the shoulders, arms and hands are injured. Any or all of the nerves which run from the spine to the arms and hands may be paralyzed. Often this injury is caused when an infant's brachial plexus nerves are stretched in the birth canal. 
   What is devastating about BPI is that the children will have paralyzed arms and hands which may be misshapen or extending out from the body at unnatural angles. This can retard a child's physical development, making everyday tasks such as coloring, drawing, dressing and going to the bathroom, which their peers can perform with no trouble, almost impossible. The feeling in the children's arms and hands is similar to how a non-paralyzed person's arm feels when he or she sleeps on it. This numbness leads to more serious injuries--toddlers and young children will accidentally or purposely burn or mutilate themselves because they lack feeling in their extremities. Some children can undergo expensive surgery and therapy and, though never fully recovering, can regain some normal function of their arms and hands. However, many children suffer permanent, debilitating paralysis from which they never fully recover. 
   On Thursday, October 21, I sponsored a meeting between members of the United Brachial Plexus Network (UBPN), surgeons, occupational therapists and experts from the Social Security Administration to discuss why so many families with children with brachial plexus injuries were being turned down for Supplemental Security Income despite seeming to meet the qualifications for such payments as laid out in the Social Security Administration handbook. 
   The Social Security Administration gave a presentation explaining the statutory qualifications for receiving SSI. Their presentations were followed by presentations by surgeons and therapists explaining how children with BPI function and why they feel children paralyzed by BPI should be eligible for SSI payments because of their disability. 
   Most moving were the presentations made by children with BPI and parents of BPI children. These courageous people talked about their daily lives and the difficulties children with BPI must endure in attempting to perform everyday tasks. 
   I want to commend UBPN board member Kathleen Kennedy from my home state of Iowa, Iowa State Senator Kitty Rehberg and Sharon Gavagan, who also sits on the board for UBPN, for their hard work and dedication in organizing the meeting between the UBPN and the Social Security Administration. I want to thank the surgeons and therapists who traveled from Texas to make presentations. I also want to commend Susan Daniels, Kenneth Nibali of the Social Security Administration and the experts from SSA for their willingness to travel from Baltimore to participate in the meeting. I am encouraged by their willingness to consider issuing new guidelines to the personnel in the SSA field offices regarding brachial plexus injuries. 
   We must work to ensure that everyone who meets the guidelines for receiving SSI has the opportunity to apply for the benefits and be given a fair hearing. I look forward to seeing the new guidelines from SSA, and I am eager to continue working with the Social Security Administration on this issue.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am introducing today for Senator HELMS and myself legislation to help the Administration better understand the importance of representing the US national interest. I am sending to the desk a bill on additional considerations for assessment of cooperation of foreign countries with United States counter-drug efforts. The purpose of this bill is to help the Administration get its act together when it comes to the certification process on illegal drugs. Recent statements by the Drug Czar and other Administration officials on certification, along with their actions in regard to such countries as Syria and Iran, show that they may have misplaced US national interests when it comes to drug policy. I want to help them find it again. 
   Over a decade ago, Congress passed measures in the Foreign Assistance Act that require US Administrations to certify whether other countries are taking serious steps to deal with major illegal drug production or trafficking in their territories. The view behind this legislation was to force an accounting, at least once a year, of what the US and other countries were doing to address a major foreign policy concern that, in the view of Congress, governments here and abroad would just  as soon have ignored. Administrations do not like accounting for themselves. Not many foreign countries welcome it either. They would prefer that legislatures and the public give them the money and approval they want with no questions asked. It's less troubling than having to explain actions, account for shortfalls, or demonstrate that the money being provided is achieving anything. Congress, however, thinks differently. It should and it must, in my view. 
   Today, the Clinton Administration, like its predecessors, is trying both to ignore certification as a genuine responsibility and to undo it where it can. It has made efforts to get Congress to scuttle the requirement. It has poor-mouthed the idea internationally while denying it has done so. It has resorted to lawerly gimmicks and low tricks to drop from certification some of the worst countries imaginable. And lately it has been trying to broaden, as it says, the evaluation and accountability process in the Western Hemisphere to make it fairer by participating with the Organization of American States in the creation of what is called the Multinational Evaluation Mechanism (MEM). This is a subterfuge for trying to get rid of the process by calling it something else. Given this Administration's poor performance on international drug control, I am not surprised at an effort to disguise shortcomings in some artful bureaucratic way. I am not surprised, but I am disappointed. 
   As part of the effort to discredit certification, the Administration has resorted to distortions and misrepresentations about what it involves and has enlisted a set of arguments that, while sounding plausible, are really little more than the old magician's trick of ``watch the birdie'' while hoping that you will not notice what he is really doing with his other hand. Well, we deserve better than sleight-of-hand on an issue as important as this one. I thought it might be useful to provide an antidote to these shenanigans with a few home truths. 
   There are many arguments advanced against certification, and I have addressed many of these in earlier statements on this floor, but the best one argues that while certification may once have been 
    useful--time unspecified--it has served its purpose and is counter-productive because it hampers further cooperation with other countries that resent being subject to a unilateral, U.S. judgment of their performance. Mexico is often advanced as an example. This view is fine if you are working from the idea--which seems to be so much of the philosophy behind our present foreign policy--that we should be guided by everyone in the world's interests before our own or in spite of our own. 
   Now, I have no doubt that other countries resent being evaluated. In my experience, they resent being evaluated by any individual country or collectively. This is not new, whether we are talking drugs or policies on intellectual properties or nuclear proliferation. And I am sure that this resentment over being judged can complicate negotiations. Both these points, however, are irrelevant to the circumstances under consideration. As a matter of our national interest, we are obliged to make judgments about the actions of other countries whether they like it or not. Let me try to make this point clearer in a different context. 
   The United States is currently embroiled in a controversy with the European Union over rules governing the importation of bananas. I am not going to comment on the merits of the particulars of the case, apart from noting that the United States, the present Administration, has determined--has judged--that EU restrictions, quotas, and preferences on the importation of bananas are unfair and prejudicial. This, folks, is an evaluation. And it is one deeply resented in Europe, as an infringement of the rights of not just one country but of an association of many countries, which happen to be our major allies. Nevertheless, the Administration is prepared to pursue the case in the teeth of this resentment to force a change it wants. And in doing this it is prepared to invoke sanctions to achieve its goals. 
   Similarly, the Administration is prepared to condemn a gaggle of other countries for permitting the pirating of various intellectual properties, such as books, videos, and copyrighted products. It is prepared to pursue sanctions to achieve a remedy. I can extend this list to judgments about states that support terrorism or are engaged in systematic human rights abuses. This Administration involved this country in a major military engagement--the ultimate sanction--to stop what it regarded as gross violations of human rights. I have no doubt that Slobodan Milosevic and his cronies deeply resented U.S. judgments about the fitness of his actions and even more objected to the steps we took to change his behavior. I do not detect that this resentment at being judged or the knowledge that there were objections to the actions then taken based on that judgment carried any weight in the decisions made by this Administration to bomb and strafe military and civilian targets in the former Yugoslavia. 
   What these examples show is that even this Administration understands, when it wants to, that there are matters of such import requiring judgments about the actions of other countries and involving responses based on those judgments that resentment or objections by others do not signify when it comes to deciding what we should do to protect interests we regard as important. Now, certification only requires that we make the involvement of other countries in the production and transit of illegal drugs--which kill more Americans every year that all the terrorists have in the last ten years or more than Mr. Milosevic did at any time--a matter of judgment and possible action of a degree at least as important as bananas. I happen to believe that judgments about drugs coming to the U.S. are at least as much in our interest as judgments about bananas going to Europe. 
   I am puzzled by the Administration's reluctance to apply meaningful standards of judgment to the actions of other countries when it comes to drug policy. I am further puzzled by its willingness to be so moved by the resentment of other countries when it comes to judgments about drug policies and programs. The requirements in the law are not written in some mysterious dialect nor apply unfamiliar concepts. The idea is not so alien to our experience or even to this Administration's own actions as to be beyond comprehension. Yet, the Administration seems to have its own sources of bemusement when it comes to taking this issue seriously. 
   In essence, what the law requires is that the Administration determine first whether countries are major producing or transit areas for illegal drugs. You would not think this terribly difficult or controversial, or too intrusive on the feelings of others. It then asks for the Administration to determine whether these countries are acting in good faith to enforce their own domestic laws against these practices; are acting in conformity with any bilateral agreements with the United States to address these activities; or are doing what is reasonable and responsible to do in light of international law that governs the conduct of all countries on this issue. I am hard pressed to see how this infringes on the sovereignty of other countries or what in it is so outrageous as to occasion abandonment of the effort. 
   The law then requires that if, in the judgment of the Administration, any given country is not acting in good faith, it may then be subject to sanctions. The law does not require that the efforts of another country be successful in order to be certified. It does not require that judgments be without consideration of other national interests. It does ask, on this very important question, that the Administration supply to Congress and the American people at least once a year its considered opinion of whether other countries where a truly pernicious practice is being engaged in that affects directly the lives of U.S. citizens each and every day are, as a matter of fact, doing all that is reasonable to stop this practice. It then requires that if these countries are receiving U.S. assistance--that is, money from U.S. taxpayers--that this money be cut off--unless it is humanitarian aid or this self-same counter-drug assistance. 
   While I understand perfectly why an aid recipient might squawk, I do not know what act of imagination it requires to manufacture outrage on behalf of other countries threatened with  losing this assistance because in our judgment they are doing less than their best to cooperate with us. But that outrage is trotted out as an argument against certification. That aside, the most onerous part of the certification decision, and what other countries truly object to, is what world opinion makes of a U.S. judgment that a particular country is not cooperating with U.S. and international efforts to stop drug production or trafficking. What the Administration would have us do is forgo this judgment lest it hurt the feels of other countries. And yet, it is this judgment or the threat of it that has, in fact, been the primary impetus to encourage the very cooperation that the Administration says we do not need the certification process to achieve. 
   What the Administration would really like to do is to stop accounting to Congress and the public for its international drug policy. It knows that this is a non-starter. So it has proposed instead to bury this accountability in an elaborate ruse in cooperation with the OAS to neuter the process. In doing this, it has helped to devise through the OAS a list of over 80 evaluation items to help in developing a so-called multinational evaluative mechanism. There are, of course, no teeth in the evaluation 
    process, and each of the member states involved has an effective veto over any adverse judgments of their respective efforts. In this regard, I am reminded of the inhabitants of Garrison Keiller's Lake Wobegon, where all the children are above average. The details behind the evaluation are to be kept confidential, which is okay since no one has much faith in the ability of most of the countries party to the evaluation to actually collect and evaluate the information in the first place. The countries involved lack the necessary reporting mechanisms, the budgets to sustain them, or the staffs to ensure ongoing, consistent information. This farrago is then supposed, gradually, to substitute for certification, somehow being fairer and more likely to ensure cooperation. 
   Ironically, the premise underlying this process is the same as that informing certification, that is, that a judgment about performance does need to be made. The difference here is that somehow a multilateral judgment would be better, and it wouldn't be offensive since it would be collaborative. In my view, it won't be offensive because it won't be effective. You can make what you want to of a process that is supposed to involve judgments about the effectiveness of actions that are designed not to offend anyone being judged. But I am not reassured. And if this is the face of cooperation, then we are in for some rude shocks in our international relations. 
   Having said this, I am prepared to help the Administration in its efforts. In order to give the Multinational Evaluation Mechanism some chance of effective implementation, I am, along with Senator HELMS, today introducing legislation that would require that in future certification decisions the Administration incorporate the MEM as part of its deliberations in determining whether to certify other countries or not. Taking the Administration at its word that the mechanism is not an attempt to replace certification, but rather an effort to complement it, I offer this bill to enhance the process.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair. 
   Madam President, it is my privilege, for a few moments, to take the place of our distinguished chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, who will be here shortly, and in my capacity as chairman of that committee's Subcommittee on International Trade, to speak for our side in support of this legislation. 
   From the standpoint of speaking for our side, this is pretty much a bipartisan approach that will have overwhelming support. It is all the more a privilege to work for legislation that does have such broad bipartisan support. 
   So, Madam President, I rise in support of the motion to proceed to H.R. 434. When we have the opportunity, we intend to offer a managers' amendment. And we would do that as a substitute for the House-passed language. That substitute will include the Senate Finance Committee's reported bills on Africa, an expansion of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, an extension of the Generalized System of Preferences, and the reauthorization of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act. 
   I want to explain the intent behind these different Finance Committee bills that will be grouped together in the managers' amendment. 
   Africa, as everyone knows, has undergone significant changes, as recently as the last decade. Many of those changes have been enormously positive: an end to apartheid in South Africa, a groundswell in support of democracy in a number of the sub-Saharan countries, and a new openness to using the power of free markets to drive economic growth, with the resultant raising of living standards. 
   At the same time, there is no continent that has suffered more from the ravages of war, disease, hunger, and just simple want than Africa. The daily news has more often been filled with the images of violence and starvation than the small seeds of economic hope. 
   The question before us is, How can our great country, the United States, help the transition that Africans themselves have begun? 
   There are many problems we might try to address and an equal number of approaches to solving those problems. I am not going to argue that our managers' amendment we will offer is an entire panacea; nor is it equal to the tasks that our African partners have before them in the sense that if there is going to be real change there, it has to come from within. 
   Instead, what our approach attempts to do is to take a small but very significant step towards opening markets to African trade. The intent is to encourage productive investment there as a means of building a market economy and doing it from the ground up. 
   It is a means of giving Africans the opportunity to guide their own economic destiny rather than the economic policies of the past that attempted to dictate a particular model of development that was based upon so much government control of the economy. 
   The strongest endorsement I can offer for moving this legislation comes from these African countries themselves. Every one of the sub-Saharan African nations eligible for the benefits under this proposal has endorsed our efforts. There was a recent full-page advertisement in Roll Call that you may have seen recounting the number of U.S. organizations that support this initiative. They range from the NAACP to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to the National Council of Churches. 
   Our supporters include such notables as Coretta Scott King, Andrew Young, and Robert Johnson--the head of Black Entertainment Television who testified eloquently about the need to create new economic opportunities in Africa when he appeared before our Senate Finance Committee. 
   The effort to move the bill also enjoys broad bipartisan support that I have already alluded to and complimented our colleagues on. It goes beyond bipartisanship in this body. It goes to the President himself because in his State of the Union Address, he identified this bill as one of his top foreign policy and trade priorities. The Finance Committee's ranking member, as you have already heard, Senator  MOYNIHAN, is a cosponsor and public supporter of the Africa bill, along with being a tireless advocate of trade expansion in both word and deed over several decades. 
   The distinguished minority leader was one of the first to recognize the need for a special focus on Africa in trade terms when he called for such a program as part of the Uruguay Round implementing legislation that passed this body 4 years ago. And, the very fact the majority leader has found time for us to debate this bill this late in this session, when there is so much pressure to address other issues, is indicative of our majority leader's support. 
   So in summation, you can see strong bipartisan support exists for the managers' amendment, and that the managers' amendment will also include the Caribbean Basin Initiative. 
   The approach adopted by the Finance Committee is consistent with the administration's own proposal. It is also broadly consistent with the proposal introduced by Senator GRAHAM, who has also been a tireless advocate on behalf of the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the opportunity that that bill and that program provide for the beneficiary countries in the Caribbean and Central America. 
   In substance, the managers' amendment on CBI adopts an approach similar to that afforded sub-Saharan Africa under the proposed bill. Indeed, both of those proposals build on the model established with the passage of the original CBI legislation, I believe, now, 15 or 16 years ago. 
   In fact, it was 1983 that that bill was adopted. When it was adopted, the region was beset with economic problems and wrenched with civil strife. The goal of the original legislation was to encourage new economic opportunities and a path towards both political and economic renewal. It accomplished that by offering a unilateral grant of tariff preferences designed to encourage productive investment, economic growth, and the resultant higher standard of living. 
   The original Caribbean Basin Initiative, which we made permanent in 1990, recognized that economic hope was essential to peace and political stability throughout the region. However, since 1990 we have had the intervening negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and that undercut the preferences initially offered to the Caribbean and Central American beneficiaries of the Caribbean Basin Initiative. 
   So the managers' amendment we will offer is an attempt to restore that margin of preference to the Caribbean producers and the economic opportunity the original CBI legislation was designed to create. 
   It is also an attempt to respond to the hardships the region has faced due to natural disaster. That region, as we know, including both the Caribbean and Central America, has been hard hit in the past 2 years by a series of hurricanes that in some instances devastated much of the existing economic infrastructure. No one can forget the pictures of devastation we saw of the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, and Honduras following Hurricane Mitch--homes, farms, factories, we saw on television, literally washing away overnight, buried in clay. 
   Members of the Finance Committee and many of our other colleagues had the opportunity to meet recently with the presidents of a number of Central American countries. Those presidents indicated that the single most important action we in the United States and our Government could take in their interest was not foreign assistance but economic opportunity to compete in a growing regional market. 
   They saw this proposed legislation as a fulfillment of the promise extended by this Congress in that original legislation of 1983, the promise for a new economic relationship with the Caribbean and Central America. We must continue to fulfill that promise as, hopefully, our country keeps its promises, and not act as a charity but as a continuation of the leadership we have shown in our continent and our hemisphere, leadership that has put us on the cusp of the ultimate goal of the 21st century version of the Monroe Doctrine, a hemisphere of democratically elected governments, a hemisphere of free markets, and a hemisphere with rising standards of living. 
   By moving this legislation forward, we will help these 
   economies continue to grow and we will be investing in important markets that will become more integrated with our own, a market integration that benefits the United States as well. 
   In light of that fact, it might be worth mentioning the importance of this legislation to one industry in particular, the textile industry, something the Senator from South Carolina has addressed but from a different point of view than I. When I say textile industry, I mean everyone from a farmer growing cotton to the yarn spinner, the fabric maker, the apparel manufacturer, producers of textile manufacturing equipment, as well as the wholesalers and retailers, everything from the farm to the consumer. The Africa bill and the Caribbean Basin Initiative bills are drafted to create a win-win situation for both our trading partners and for our own domestic industries. 
   The managers' amendment we will offer takes a different approach than that of the House bill. Our bill is designed to create a partnership between America and industries, not to the benefit of one or the other, but to the benefit of both regions. Our proposal would accomplish that by affording preferential tariff and also preferential quota treatment to apparel made from American-made fabric, and it would be American-made fabric in order to qualify. 
   This does two things: First, it gives American firms an incentive to build a strong partnership with firms in both Africa and the Caribbean. Secondly, it helps establish a platform from which the American textile industry can compete in this global market. 
   I want to refer to the industry's own analysis. That analysis shows that the approach adopted by our Senate Finance Committee offers real benefits to U.S. industry and to U.S. employment. It gives our industry a fighting chance in the years to come, as textile quotas are gradually eliminated pursuant to the World Trade Organization agreement on textiles. 
   The reason I raise this point goes back to the efforts of our committee and our chairman to reestablish a bipartisan consensus on trade. In my view, the textile industry and all of its related parts will face significant economic adjustment as a result of the World Trade Organization textiles agreement. That adjustment has already begun to take place. 
   What the industry found, however, based on its experience under NAFTA, is that partnering with Mexican firms or investing there for joint United States-Mexican production made our own United States firms very competitive. They discovered that United States firms became competitive even in the face of fierce competition they faced from textile industries in the developing world, and particularly the countries of China and India. 
   The Finance Committee bills would broaden the base from which American firms could produce for the world market. In the context of the Uruguay Round, we made an implicit commitment to the textile industry to allow them a period of adjustment to a new economic reality. I am proud to support the proposed legislation and to make good on that promise by encouraging the industry to compete globally as well as locally. 
   Through our managers' amendment, we intend to propose something that would take two other significant steps. The first is the renewal of the Generalized System of Preferences. We call that GSP for short. The GSP program has been on our statutes since 1975. GSP affords a grant of tariff preferences to developing countries generally, although not as extensive as those the proposal offers to Africa and to the Caribbean. GSP is generally described as a unilateral grant of preferences, and that is a very accurate description. 
   What is little known is that the program has had more profound benefits for U.S. trade than is captured by that fairly significant description that doesn't describe the program so well. 
   The original GSP program was instrumental in obtaining the commitment of continental powers like Great Britain to give up, finally, the highly discriminatory tariff systems they enforced in their economic relations with their former colonies. In other words, the creation of the GSP was instrumental in eliminating discriminatory  trade barriers that distorted trade and thwarted our exporters' access to markets throughout the entire developing world. 
   That beneficial program--GSP--has been around a while and accomplished a lot of good, but it has lapsed; it lapsed a few months ago, in June. So our managers' amendment would propose its renewal. 
   The managers' amendment will also renew our Trade Adjustment Assistance programs. As my colleagues know, I am a strong supporter of free and fair trade. But I have, at the same time, consistently taken the view that those who benefit from expanding trade must look out for those who may be injured by the process of economic adjustment that trade brings. 
   The Trade Adjustment Assistance programs are one part of that commitment. They offer assistance to both workers and firms that have faced a significant increase in import competition as they adjust to these new economic conditions. They have been on the books since the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. And the committee has made every effort to ensure that they are renewed to fulfill the bargain on trade policy originally struck with U.S. firms and U.S. workers over 30 years ago. So what we do with this reauthorization is keep our contract with these industries, and if trade unfairly affects them, we will be able to help them in a transition period. That is something we should do. It has worked well and we propose to continue it. 
   There is, however, a real urgency to their renewal at this time. As I have said, they have lapsed and, unless they are renewed promptly, they will fall out of the budget baseline and will, in the future, need a revenue offset. 
   In the context of the current debate over trade and trade policy, I view these programs as a minimum downpayment on reestablishing a bipartisan consensus on trade matters. And so I urge our colleagues to support the motion to proceed to the bill in order to renew these essential programs. 
   Having discussed the intent behind each of the measures I intend to move as a part of the Senate substitute, I want to add one last point. We have before us in this legislation an opportunity to reestablish a strong measure of bipartisan support for what we in the Finance Committee view as an important trade and foreign policy initiative. So let us take this step and let us move forward in a way that will benefit Africa and the Caribbean--a way that will benefit much of the rest of the developing world--and a way that will serve our own national interests as well. 
   And we propose this legislation with the U.S. national interest in mind, because we are cognizant of the fact that if we in the Congress do not look out for the interests of the American worker, we can't expect anybody else to do it. But when we can have the benefits of protecting our workers and creating jobs and expanding our economy and still help the rest 
   of the world through these policies--and we have done that--we should continue to do that because, as President Kennedy said, ``Trade, not aid.'' 
   For an American populace that doesn't like foreign aid, I hope that they will join us in the Congress behind these bipartisan efforts to promote our national interests and strengthen our world leadership through these trade policies that help us, as well as helping these developing nations. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I would like to say a few words about the $69 billion annual U.S. Department of Agriculture appropriations bill that happens to contain $8.7 billion in emergency money for American farmers. 
   This legislation was sent from Capitol Hill to the President's desk last Wednesday, October 13. Every day the President delays signing this bill is one more day relief money is not in the farmers' pockets at this time of the lowest prices in 25 years. 
   Naturally, I know the White House is entitled to a few days to review the document for signature by the President. But that process does not and should not take 8 days that the bill has been sitting on the President's desk, particularly considering the emergency economic crisis in American agriculture. 
   Since September 30, President Clinton has been engaged in a strategy to confuse the public and to try to get Congress to accept tax and spending increases. The only conclusion I can draw is that the President has decided to use the agricultural relief bill for leverage in the political game we have seen with the budget this year. If that is true--and I hope it is not true, based on some comments made by Secretary Glickman; but the fact remains, the President has not signed the bill containing emergency relief for farmers--then, of course, it is unforgivable on the part of the President, given the terrible situation our farmers face. 
   Again, prices remain at 25-year lows. The package we moved through Congress is critical to helping farmers' cash-flow. President Clinton has given speeches about helping farmers. Why isn't he taking, then, affirmative action and putting pen to paper to help the farmers who he knows have tremendous needs at a time of prices being at 25-year lows? 
   Last year, an election year, the President immediately signed the supplemental spending bill that contained more than $5 billion, when this crisis in agriculture started 12 months ago. The U.S. Department of Agriculture had those funds in the mail to farmers within 10 days. The President has already lost 7 days in that process. This year, of course, is a sharp contrast with getting the bill signed and getting the money to the farmers. Every day that President Clinton delays is one more day that farmers don't have the assistance Congress passed and they desperately need. 
   I happen to know that the President understands American agriculture, being the Governor of the State of Arkansas for as long as he was. I know that one time, in his first couple years in office, he looked me in the eye at a meeting at the Blair House and he said, ``I understand farming more than any other President of the United States ever has.'' I believe that, but he doesn't show an understanding of the crisis in agriculture at this particular time, as he has waited now too many days to sign this bill. 
   I urge the President this very evening to sign this bill so that the farmers who are in crisis--which he has even given speeches on, recognizing farming is in crisis--can have the help of the $2.7 billion provided for in this legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in introducing the Multidistrict Jurisdiction Act of 1999. This legislation would make a technical fix to section 1407 of Title 28, the multidistrict litigation statute, in response to the recent Supreme Court decision in Lexecon v. Milberg Weiss. 
   Section 1407(a) of Title 28 authorizes the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation to transfer civil actions with common issues of fact to any district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings, but requires the Panel to remand any such action to the original district at or before the conclusion of such pretrial proceedings. Until the Lexecon decision, the federal courts followed the practice of allowing a transferee court to invoke the venue transfer provision and transfer a case to itself for trial purposes. However, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed this practice, holding that the literal terms of section 1407 do not give a district court conducting pretrial proceedings the authority to assign a transferred case to itself for trial. 
   This legislation would amend section 1407 of Title 28 to permit a judge with a transferred case to retain jurisdiction over multidistrict litigation cases for trial. This change was approved by the Judicial Conference and is supported by the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation. The legislation also includes a provision under which a transferee court would transfer actions back to the federal district courts from which they came for a determination of compensatory damages if the interests of justice and the convenience of the parties so require. 
   The Multidistrict Jurisdiction Act of 1999 will promote the efficient administration of justice by allowing the federal courts to continue an effective practice they have been using for almost thirty years. It makes sense to allow the transferee judge who has conducted the pretrial proceedings and is familiar with the facts and parties of the transferred case to retain that case for trial. This significantly benefits the parties to a case, and reduces wasteful use of judicial and litigants' resources. I am glad to support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it as well.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come before you today to submit a resolution which would designate the week of each November in which the holiday of Thanksgiving is observed as ``National Family Week.'' Each Congress since 1976 has passed legislation which established Family Week on a bi-annual basis, and I have been a frequent cosponsor of it. In fact, last Congress, I was the sponsor of the legislation, and am pleased to be able to further contribute to this longstanding tradition of recognizing the importance of family. 
   This Congress, however, I would like to pay special tribute to the hard work of the man who founded the idea of Family Week, Mr. Sam Wiley. Ever since 1971, Mr. Wiley worked hard to see that Family Week was recognized on every Thanksgiving in every state, and by every president. Unfortunately, however, Mr. Wiley passed away in December after a long battle with cancer. Remarkably, even during this fight with the painful and deadly disease, Mr. Wiley was more concerned with making sure Family Week continue, as it was his constant vigilance that kept the idea and spirit of Family Week alive year after year. 
   A friend, Mr. Noel Duerden, has said that Mr. Wiley's greatest desire was to make sure that after he died Family Week would still live on. As a tribute to Mr. Wiley, my legislation will guarantee that Family Week continues by making it permanent. The resolution I am submitting today will ensure that every year the President will issue a proclamation dedicating the week of the Thanksgiving holiday as Family Week. 
   As we all know, the family is the most basic element of our society, and the tie that binds us to one another. It is the strength of any free and orderly society and it is appropriate to honor this unit as being essential to the well-being of the United States. 
   Since Family Week will be observed during the weeks on which Thanksgiving falls, we will be paying homage to what we as a nation already know--the strength of the family provides the support through which we as individuals and a nation thrive. Therefore it is particularly suitable to pause during this special week in recognition of the celebrations and activities of the family which bring us closer together. 
   I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort and ask that an article from the Indianapolis Star about Mr. Wiley and Family Week be placed in the RECORD.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I greet my colleagues with the often bad news of drug use by young people, and particularly with reference to the very important role of parents in preventing youth drug use. As I do occasionally, in my capacity as chairman of the International Narcotics Control Caucus of the Senate, I come to the floor to report on national surveys that go on in this area, surveys that have been going on for a couple of decades, so we are able to compare the incidence of increasing drug experimentation by young people as well as following trends we had in the last decade in declines in drug use by young people. 
   I seek the floor today to visit with my colleagues on this very same subject, as I have many times in the past since I have been chairman of this group of our colleagues who spend a great deal of time on drug problems generally and, of course, a lot of time on the issue of drug use by young people. 
   So, again, as happens at the beginning of every school year, there are these national surveys that are made public. Within the last month or so, several of these have been made public. That is what I want to discuss with my colleagues. There have been three national surveys released that tell the story of drug use in the United States, particularly among teenagers. 
   On September 8 of this year, the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse--that is called CASA, for short. Let me say it again: It is a National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse. That organization released its annual back-to-school survey on the attitudes of teens and parents regarding substance abuse. The survey stressed how essential it is for parents to get involved in their children's lives. The survey indicates that kids actually do listen to their parents. In fact, 42 percent of the teenagers who have never used marijuana credit their parents with that decision. Unfortunately, too many parents--45 percent--believe that teenagers' use of drugs is inevitable. In addition, 25 percent of the parents said they have little influence over their teen's substance abuse. 
   I suggest to that 25 percent that they ought to consider that 42 percent of the young people in America have already responded to this survey, saying they do not use marijuana because their parents have influenced them not to. And for the 25 percent of the parents who do not think they can have any influence over their teen's substance abuse, they would probably have considerable and beneficial influence. 
   CASA stresses how important parental involvement is. A child with a positive relationship with both parents is less likely to get involved with drugs. The survey also suggests that family-oriented activities such as eating dinners together and attending religious services together can reduce the risk of substance abuse. 
   The second week in September also marked the release of the annual Parents Resource Institute for Drug Education survey. That acronym is PRIDE, P-R-I-D-E. PRIDE's survey on teenage drug use. The survey also indicated the importance of parents' influence in shaping the attitude of teens regarding the harmful effects of drugs, just like the CASA survey. 
   Unfortunately, this past year the overall attitude among youth towards the harmful effects of drugs remains mostly unchanged. In fact, some attitudes worsened. Sadly, about 27 percent used an illegal drug at least once in the last year, and about 16 percent used drugs monthly or more often.  Moreover, the number of students who regarded cocaine and heroin as harmful has decreased from the previous year. We know that, as perception of risk of use goes down, actual use of cocaine and heroin goes up. The monthly use of cocaine by high school students rose from 3.1 percent to 3.2 percent, hallucinogens went up from 3.9 percent to 4.2 percent, and liquor--and we don't often think enough of a legal product, liquor, being used illegally by young people as being a problem--but it went up from 26.9 percent to 28.1 percent. 
   Worse yet, beer tends to be a gateway for uses of these other drugs that eventually leads, by some young people, to worse drugs. Unfortunately, in this PRIDE survey, the number of students who said drugs cause no harm increased over the previous year. 
   So that message out there that is strong and hard and definitive and constant that drug use is bad, does work but not if it isn't consistently heard and reinforced. 
   The PRIDE survey reiterates that parents have the power to change these attitudes. Those young people who say their parents talk with them a lot about drugs show a 37 percent lower drug use than those students who say their parents never talk to them about drugs. Despite this statistic, less than 31 percent of the students say their parents talk with them often or a lot about the problems of drugs. 
   So we have one-third of the parents shirking their responsibility; and in shirking their responsibility, they are losing an opportunity to make a difference in whether or not their young people will experiment with drugs. Because we have that other survey that shows 42 percent of the young people in America do not use drugs because they have been influenced by their parents not to use drugs. 
   The last survey I want to refer to is a National Household Survey on drug abuse. It was released 2 months ago. It gives a very clear picture that we still have much work ahead of us when it comes to educating our kids about drugs. 
   The survey stated that almost 10 percent of our young people, ages 12 to 17, reported current use of illicit drugs. An estimated 8 percent of youths in the same age category reported current use of marijuana fairly regularly. 
   Unfortunately, this was not a significant change from last year. According to the survey, young people reported great risk of using cigarettes, marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol; and that percentage was unchanged from the previous year. 
   The disturbing fact is 56 percent of the kids, ages 12 to 17, reported that marijuana was very easy to get. And 14 percent of these young people reported being approached by someone selling drugs within 30 days of their interview for the survey. 
   Although these statistics seem daunting, we have made some progress in keeping drugs out of children's hands. The National Household Survey--the last one I referred to--stated that the number of youths using inhalants has decreased significantly from 2 percent in 1997 to 1 percent last year. 
   The PRIDE survey reported that monthly use of any illegal and illicit drugs fell from 17 percent last year to 16 percent this year. Even more important is the fact that 60 percent of the students say they do not expect to use drugs in the future. And this is a 9-percent increase from the 51 percent last year. 
   There may be some hope shown in those statistics, then, that finally a message about ``just don't do it,'' ``drugs are bad,'' may be making some progress. 
   But we all know the war on drugs is tough and it is not one that will be won easily, but it is not one from which we in public life or within our families can walk away. Although these numbers and statistics remain exceedingly high, our efforts can make a difference and are not futile. I believe creating a drug-free environment for our youth is an accessible goal that we must work to reach. 
   Surveys such as these play an important role in measuring our progress and determining the work that lies ahead of us. It is clear that the public is aware of the problem and expects Congress and the administration to do their part in finding ways to make counterdrug programs work. 
   In a national poll on national drug policy, produced last month by the Mellman Group, the public supports effective drug control programs. As you can see from chart No. 1--if you would look at chart No. 1--the public particularly supports strong 
   interdiction programs and consistent interdiction efforts. The survey shows 92 percent of the people questioned view illegal drugs as a serious problem in this country. 
   I will now refer to chart No. 2. The majority of individuals think drug use in this country is increasing. Few see it declining, in other words. So it seems obvious to me--and I hope to all of you--that the American people are aware of the problem and are eager for a more assertive national drug policy from Congress and from the administration. 
   When Americans are more concerned about the availability of drugs than they are about crime, we clearly need to take action. We cannot afford to let drugs devastate our country any further; we cannot afford to let drugs devastate any more young people. We have to be proactive in our efforts if we want to change these disturbing numbers that have come out in the CASA survey, the National Household Survey, and the PRIDE survey. 
   We do not need a miracle for our young people. We need a strong family life and positive role models to guide our youth in the right direction. 
   Education of the dangers of drugs starts at home. But it needs to be carried over into all of society. Parents need help in sustaining a clear and consistent ``no use'' message. 
   In closing, I refer to an effort I am making in my State called Face It Together, an organization that tries to bring together all elements of our society. 
   There are two elements of our society--at least in my State--that I do not think have done enough to be supportive of families because the front line in the war against drugs is the home. We cannot, in the home, push it off on the school, off onto law enforcement, off onto substance abuse professions. That front line is the home. 
   But two institutions of society, in my State, I think, can do a better job. Maybe it is true of the other 49 States as well. Although it is more encompassing than just involving industry and business on the one hand, and the churches on the other hand in supporting families, that is where I want to concentrate my effort. Because most businesses and industries in my State have substance abuse programs, as a matter of necessity, for the health and well-being of their workers and to maintain the productivity of their workforce, we want those businesses that have a drug education and drug awareness program in the workplace to get their workers--men and women alike--to carry that message home and use it in the families, in the home, to support the effort which ought to be in that family already, of telling their children of the dangers of drugs. 
   The other place where I do not think we have used enough of our resources is in the churches of our State, for messages from the pulpit, and to use the institution of the church to disseminate educational information to, again, be supportive of the family--mom and dad--to keep that message strong back home. This is something we all need to work on. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   First, let me say I do believe my colleagues and I share the goal of decreasing the number of weapons of mass destruction found throughout the world. With that aside, my utmost concern is for the safety of each American, and I take very seriously my constitutional responsibility to review the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as it relates to the security of American citizens. I must take into consideration not only the present state of the world, but the future as well. 
   I have, in the past, supported moratoriums on nuclear testing. In 1992, I voted in favor of imposing a 9-month moratorium on testing of nuclear weapons with only limited tests following the moratorium. Since the Eisenhower Administration, each President has sought a ban on nuclear testing to some degree. However, never before has an administration proposed a ban on nuclear testing with a zero-yield threshold and an unlimited time duration. 
   The goal of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, also known as CTBT, is to ban all nuclear testing. However, I have not been convinced this treaty is in the best interests of the United States. From the lack of clear definitions to the incorrectness of underlying assumptions to the verification and enforcement provisions, I believe the treaty is fundamentally flawed. And, these flaws cannot be changed by Senate amendment. 
   I want to take a few moments to discuss my concerns regarding the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   Verification is critical to the enforcement of any treaty. Without verification, enforcement cannot truthfully occur. The Clinton Administration has called for zero-yield under the CTBT. No yield. This means there should be no nuclear yield released when an explosion occurs. There is agreement among the Administration, the intelligence community and the Senate that a zero-yield threshold cannot be verified. 
   The issue of zero yield takes on another level of importance when it becomes clear that zero-yield is not the standard defined in the Treaty. It is the standard interpreted by President Clinton. Nowhere in the Treaty is there a definition of what is meant by a ``test.'' Other countries, notably Russia, have not interpreted the Treaty in the same manner. We don't know how China has interpreted the ban on ``tests.'' We don't know because we cannot verify that China and Russia are not testing. Therefore, not only do we have a potential standard that is impossible to verify, but other countries have the ability to interpret the Treaty differently and act upon their interpretation, and the United States will not be able to enforce the higher standard. 
   A second major concern of mine involves our existing nuclear stockpile. The cold war 
   may be a thing of the past, but threats to our nation's security exist today. Our nuclear stockpile  exists for a reason, and not only are new weapon technologies essential to our defense, it is also critical to maintain the security and safety of existing weapons. 
   Proponents of the CTBT maintain the United States does not need to conduct nuclear tests to maintain the integrity of our existing stockpile because of President Clinton's Stockpile Stewardship Program. The Stockpile Stewardship Program relies upon computer modeling and simulations as a substitute for testing. I believe the intent of the Stockpile Stewardship Program is good. However, I am not confident in the ability of the Stockpile Stewardship Program to keep our existing stockpile safe. One-third of all weapons designs introduced into the U.S. stockpile since 1985 have required and received post-deployment nuclear tests to resolve problems. In three-fourths of these cases, the problems were discovered only because of ongoing nuclear tests. In each case, the weapons were thought to be reliable and thoroughly tested. 
   I see three problems with the Stockpile Stewardship Program as it exists today. First, the technology has not been proven. In 1992 laboratory scientists proposed a series of tests to create the data bases and methodologies for stockpile stewardship under a ban on nuclear testing. These tests were not permitted. At the very least, actual nuclear tests are necessary to produce an accurate computer simulation. Second, data from past tests don't address aging, which is a central problem in light of the highly corrosive nature of weapon materials. Shelf life of U.S. nuclear weapons is expected to be 20 years, and many weapons are reaching that age. Without testing we will not have confidence in refurbished warheads. My third concern relates to China. Apparently, China has acquired the ``legacy'' computer codes of the U.S. nuclear test program. The Clinton administration proposes to base its efforts to assure stockpile viability on computer simulation which is highly vulnerable to espionage--and even to sabotage--by introducing false data. There is no such thing as a secure computer network. 
   The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will not go into effect until 44 specific countries both sign and ratify the Treaty. In addition to the United States, China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, India and Pakistan have yet to ratify, and India and Pakistan have not even signed the Treaty. The argument is made that U.S. ratification would quickly lead to ratification by these other countries. I would reply by saying that--as the Treaty is constructed--each of these countries could indeed sign and ratify the Treaty. Then, they could proceed with low-yield nuclear testing which cannot be verified. 
   Even if nuclear testing is suspected, under the terms of the CTBT, any inspection must be supported by 30 of the 51 members of an Executive Council elected by all State Parties to the Treaty. And, the United States is not even guaranteed a position on the Executive Council. Furthermore, onsite inspections are subject to a number of limitations. First, inspection activities are subject to time limits (25 days.) Any collection of radioactive samples must be accompanied by an approval by a majority of the Executive Council. No State Party is required to accept simultaneous on-site inspections on its territory. And finally, the State party under inspection may refuse to accept an observer from the State party requesting the inspection. There is currently a supporter of inspection limitations similar to these; his name is Saddam Hussein. 
   Effective arms control treaties can be extremely helpful in limiting the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Moratoriums on nuclear testing and limiting the yield of tests have highlighted the ability of the United States and other responsible countries to shape the current environment while protecting against the intentions of rogue states. I remain hopeful that our technology will one day rise to the level of verifying a zero-yield nuclear test ban. I remain hopeful that China, Russia, India and Pakistan may one day commit themselves--in both words and actions--to cease developing and testing nuclear weapons. Until that day, or until a Treaty is brought before the Senate that can be verified and fairly enforced, I will continue to support policy that protects American citizens. And in this case, it means opposing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, because of the lowest commodity prices in a quarter century in the Midwest and probably every place else in the United States, I support the conference report we are considering this afternoon. While there are elements of the legislation that I might not support, or would rather not have in the bill, I think the greater good is served by passing this legislation as quickly as possible. The sooner we pass this legislation, the sooner we can assist the family farmer. That was our intention when we began this process the first week of August, and I am glad to see it will be accomplished in the near future. 
   As everyone is aware, there is a crisis in rural America due to these low commodity prices. I made a promise 3 years ago to guarantee a smooth transition from big government command and control to a market-driven agricultural economy. We predicted 3 years ago, in the 1996 farm bill, that that smooth transition would require about $5.5 billion for the year 1999. We didn't anticipate the lowest prices in 25 years and, obviously, that transition turned out to be more difficult than we anticipated. To remedy the situation we have added economic assistance in this bill that we did not predict was necessary three years ago. 
   A number of factors have contributed to the downturn in the agriculture economy that we have experienced over the last 18 months. I would like to tell you that the answer to our problem is as easy as changing the 1996 farm bill. But, in fact, the economics involved are complex and international. For example, we saw soybean prices take a nosedive a while back, not because of anything we did in this country, but because the Brazilian currency lost one-quarter of its value overnight.  Brazil happens to be a major soybean producer and also an exporter. That action also shaved roughly a dollar a bushel off of U.S. soybean prices. 
   Another example is that Asia has been one of our fastest growing and strongest export markets. But when the Asian economy crashed, they could no longer buy American pork and our grain. The financial crisis Asia experienced hurt all our farmers in America, even my friends and neighbors back at New Hartford, Iowa. 
   Global trade manifested by exports has become a mainstay of our Nation's family farmers. Roughly one-fourth of farm receipts today come from overseas sales. Iowa is a significant supplier to the world, being the Nation's No. 2 exporter of agricultural commodities, after California. The solution is to increase our access to world markets by passing fast track and opening doors through the World Trade Organization and other trade agreements, not by limiting our ability to compete in the world market by choking our own production. 
   There are 100 million new mouths to feed every year, almost a billion in the next decade. Farmers someplace in the world are going to feed those new mouths. I would rather it be Iowa or United States products than Brazilian and Argentine products. We can do it and compete. In the short-term though, the most effective means of helping our family farmers in need is providing economic assistance as quickly as possible. 
   The fastest means to provide emergency relief to our farmers is through the AMTA mechanism. I would like to mention that some of my colleagues have criticized our plan to distribute income assistance through the AMTA payment mechanism. I have heard and witnessed statements that would lead some to believe that landowners who do not share in production risk or management are benefiting from this assistance. The 1996 farm bill states that payments are only available to those who ``assume all or part of the risk of producing a crop.'' 
   Recently, 53 Senators signed a bipartisan letter asking Secretary Glickman whether there are payments being made to those who do not share risk in agriculture--risk in a specific farming operation. If that is occurring we have requested in the letter to Secretary Glickman that the proper disciplinary action for any official approving payments in this manner be administered. But if 
   this is not happening, I apologize for my colleagues who have delayed the process by making baseless claims due to their own ignorance. 
   So the action we take today guarantees the future stability of the family farmer and the agricultural economy. It is with this in mind that I support this cloture motion and hope this bill passes, because within 10 days after getting this bill signed by the President, this money can be distributed to the farmers of America.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I agree with the remarks of my fellow Senator from Iowa. We need to eliminate the slot rule which is detrimental to the air service for cities in Iowa and throughout the Midwest. But, the elimination of slots does need to be done in the proper way. Otherwise the major carriers will absorb all of the capacity of the airport, not [providing sufficient service for small and medium sized cities. We need to provide for service by new entrant carriers that can provide for real competition on the price of tickets, increased ability to provide for turboprops so our smaller cities can have proper service, and regional jets for improved service to mid sized cities. While I am pleased with the action by the House, I do believe that it is important that the conferees support the content of the original Gorton proposal.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. 
   Mr. President, I share many of my colleagues concerns about the need to do more to aid Colombia. But I also believe that our aid must be based on a clear and consistent plan, not on good intentions. We do Colombia no favors by throwing money at the problem. We do not help ourselves. Too often, throwing money at a problem is the same thing as throwing money away. For that reason, I, along with Senator HELMS and Senator DEWINE, am introducing legislation today calling on the U.S. Administration to present a plan. 
   Colombia is the third largest recipient of U.S. security aid behind Israel and Egypt. It is also the largest supplier of cocaine to the United States. But, we seem to find ourselves in the midst of a muddle. Our policy appears to be adrift, and our focus blurred. 
   This past Tuesday, the Caucus on International Narcotics Control held a hearing to ask the Administration for a specific plan and a detailed strategy outlining U.S. interests and priorities dealing with counter-narcotics efforts in Colombia. Before we in Congress get involved in a discussion about what and how much equipment we should be sending to Colombia, we need to discuss whether or not we should send any and why. Recent press reports indicate that the Administration is preparing a security assistance package to Colombia with funding from $500 million dollars to somewhere around $1.5 billion dollars. 
   And yet, Congress hasn't been able to evaluate any strategy. That's because there is none. From the hearing, it seems the Administration is incapable of thinking about the situation with  any clarity or articulating a strategy with any transparency. It seems confused as to what is actually happening in Colombia. 
   At Tuesday's hearing, representatives from the Department of State and the Department of Defense assured me they were currently working on a detailed strategy to be unveiled at some future point. So far there have been difficulties in creating a detailed and coherent strategy and presenting it to Congress. Today we are introducing a bill that requires the Secretary of State to submit to Congress within 60 days a detailed report on current U.S. policy and strategy for counter-narcotics assistance for Colombia. 
   This is an issue that will not just simply disappear. Before we begin appropriating additional funding for Colombia, we need strategies and goals, not just piecemeal assistance and operations. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the sense-of-the-Senate resolution regarding diabetes. I thank my colleagues from Maine for sponsoring this resolution. Senator COLLINS and I were among the original co-founders of the Senate Diabetes Caucus and have worked together to raise awareness of the disease and the need for a cure. 
   Diabetes is a devastating illness that affects people of every age, race, and nationality. More than sixteen million Americans suffer from diabetes and 800,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Diabetes is also a leading chronic illness affecting children, a special population with which it places an especially heavy burden. 
   Although many people with diabetes are able to survive with multiple daily injections of insulin, it is not a cure for this dreaded disease. Despite the availability of insulin, diabetes continues to cause serious health complications, including kidney failure and blindness, and it is the cause of nearly 200,000 deaths per year. 
   Diabetes costs our nation nearly $100 billion each year in direct and indirect costs. In fact, more than forty billion tax dollars are spent each year in treating people with diabetes through Medicare, Medicaid, veterans and federal employees health benefits. 
   Past investments in diabetes research at the National Institutes for Health (NIH) are beginning to show real promise for a cure and the number of research opportunities in the field continue to expand. We now stand at a pivotal juncture in the fight to cure diabetes and its complications. 
   A report released in February by the congressionally mandated Diabetes Research Working Group (DRWG) called upon NIH to substantially expand its support for diabetes research and has identified specific research recommendations as part of a new national plan to find a cure. 
   On April 26, 1999, a letter signed by myself, Senator COLLINS, and 37 of our colleagues was sent to Chairman SPECTER and Ranking Member HARKIN in requesting increased funding for diabetes research within NIH in accordance with the DRWG report. And, it is clear from the work of the Senate Appropriations Committee that diabetes has not been neglected. Therefore, in an effort to bolster the work of the committee, and I believe rightly so, this resolution is being introduced today to send a clear signal to all Americans that diabetes is a serious concern of the United States Senate. 
   We have not yet found a cure for diabetes. But, I am confident that in time and with sufficient support, a cure will be found and we will be able to declare victory over this debilitating disease. 
   Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. I know the Senator from New Jersey has to leave. But before he does, in front of all of my colleagues, I want to thank him very much for an outstanding statement that focuses on the complexity of the bankruptcy problem. Most importantly, he focused attention on the bipartisanship of this legislation and on our commitment to getting it passed not only this Congress, but this year. It can be done. 
   I encourage the Democratic and Republican leaders to have the necessary meetings and conversations it takes to bring this bill to the floor under a reasonable agreement so we can start work on it. In just a few hours, we can work our way through the disagreements that other Members might have and do it in a bipartisan way and get this bill on its way to the President of the United States. 
   So in public, I am happy to thank the Senator from New Jersey for his cooperation. He has worked with me in a truly bipartisan way. For constituents who might be listening anyplace in the United States who are concerned about this body or Congress as a whole or Washington, DC, being too partisan, this bankruptcy bill is an example of where bi-partisanship has worked. If I had tried to do this in a partisan manner, this bill would not even be as far as it is.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Before getting to the big bankruptcy bill, I want to touch on a related matter--the problem of the sunsetting of the agricultural provisions of the bankruptcy code, chapter 12. I believe it is the only section of the bankruptcy code that is sunset from time to time. It is not a permanent part of the bankruptcy code. It was passed about 13 years ago to meet the needs of agriculture in depression in the 1980s, and it has been renewed by Congress continually since then. 
   It has been a very successful part of the bankruptcy code because, of the farmers who have sought the protection of chapter 12, an Iowa State University study indicates that 84 percent are still in business farming, family farmers still farming. 
   We are at a situation where 1 year ago, about this period of time, chapter 12 actually sunset. It was extended for 6 months in the omnibus spending bill because the feeling was that we wanted to take it up at the very same time a revision of the entire bankruptcy code was taken up. The comprehensive bill is the bill that Senator TORRICELLI has spoken about and which I will discuss shortly. Within that bill, there is a permanency brought to chapter 12 in the bankruptcy code so it will no longer sunset. 
   The March 31 deadline came, and this bill was not up. It was extended yet again for 6 months. I urged the majority leader to extend it for a year because I anticipated some of the problems we have recently faced regarding the bankruptcy code. It was thought by a lot of interests in this city that it was necessary to have chapter 12 not made permanent, separate from the entire bankruptcy law, because it was needed to help get the general bankruptcy revisions through. So it was extended for another 6 months. 
   This week it is going to expire again. It is ludicrous that the House of Representatives, just yesterday, passed only a 3-month extension of chapter 12 so that somehow if we don't get this permanent bankruptcy bill passed, we are going to have chapter 12 expiring again on New Year's Eve. That is a Y2K problem for agriculture we better be alerted to because Congress is not going to be in session on New Year's Eve to renew chapter 12. I hope that when the Senate considers the House version, we ignore it, and we move with a permanent extension of chapter 12 bankruptcy which I introduced last week and which is currently on the calendar. 
   As the Senators from West Virginia, New Jersey, and also the Senator from Montana were just speaking about the agricultural crisis, it is that way in agriculture any place in the United States. This is no time to play footsie with chapter 12 being extended for just a 3-month period of time. Those are games that don't need to be played. They don't do justice to agriculture in America, and they do not put the family farmer in the forefront of our policymaking or thinking in Washington. 
   I want to go to this issue about which Senator TORRICELLI spoke--the Senate not invoking cloture on the bankruptcy bill last week. 
   While this is unfortunate, I think it is important to say a few words in support of the bill outside of the adversarial context and the very political context of the cloture vote. I think it would really be a tragedy if both parties can't come together and deal with this bill, which has such broad support from Senators on both sides of the aisle. It was voted out of committee by a 14 to 4 vote, very bipartisan. 
   Bankruptcy reform is really all about a return to personal responsibility in a bankruptcy system which actively discourages personal responsibility by wiping away debts on a no-questions-asked basis. 
   Basic common sense tells you every time a debt is wiped away through bankruptcy, someone loses money. Of course, when somebody who extends credit has that obligation wiped away in bankruptcy, that creditor is forced to make a decision: Should this loss simply be swallowed as a cost of doing business? Or, do you raise prices for other customers to offset those losses? 
   When bankruptcy losses are rare and infrequent, lenders may be able to swallow a loss. But when bankruptcies are very frequent and common, as they are today, lenders have to raise their prices to offset losses. For this reason, when Treasury Secretary Larry Summers testified at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, he said that bankruptcies tend to drive up interest rates. 
   If you believe Secretary Summers, bankruptcies are everyone's problem. Regular, hard-working Americans have to pay higher prices for goods and services as a result of bankruptcies. That is a real problem for the American people, and one which the Senate has an obligation to tackle. 
   Under our current bankruptcy laws, someone can get full debt cancellation in chapter 7 with no questions asked. If we pass our reform bill, if someone seeking bankruptcy can repay his or her debts, they will be channeled into chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code, which requires people to pay some portion of their debts as a precondition for limited debt cancellation. 
   The bankruptcy bill, which the Senate will hopefully consider soon, will discourage bankruptcies and, therefore, lessen upward pressure on interest rates and prices. Right now, under present bankruptcy laws, one of the richest captains of industry could walk into bankruptcy court and walk away with his debts erased. Of course, the rest of America will pay higher prices for goods and services as a result. If we pass this bill, higher-income people will be unable to use bankruptcy as a financial planning tool. All Americans will be better off. The message of Senate bill 625 is simple: If you have the ability to pay debt, you will not get off scot-free. 
   These are good times in our Nation, thanks to the fiscal discipline initiated by Congress, and the hard work of the American people--and more due to the hard work of the American people than what we have done in Congress. We have the first balanced budget in a generation, unemployment is low, we have a burgeoning stock market. Most Americans, except for the American farmers who are in a depression, are optimistic about the future. But in the midst of such prosperity, about one and a half million Americans declared bankruptcy in 1998. Based on filings for the first two quarters of 1999, it looks like there will be just under 1.4 million bankruptcy filings for this year. To put this in some historical context, since 1990, the rate of personal bankruptcy filings has increased almost 100 percent. 
   Now, I don't think anyone knows all of the reasons--I don't pretend to know either--underlying the bankruptcy crisis. But I think I can talk about what is not at the root of the bankruptcy crisis. I have a chart here that has four smaller charts on it that I think demonstrates it is not the economy that is  driving the crisis. Here we have the high rise in bankruptcies over the last 6 years, a very rapid near 100-percent increase in bankruptcy filings. We have, during that same period of time, a very dramatic drop in unemployment in the country. We have a very sharp rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. We have a rise in the average wage of American workers. This shows that it is not the economy that is causing so many bankruptcies. 
   The economic numbers tell us that the bankruptcy crisis isn't a result of people who can't get jobs; and the jobs that people do have are paying more than ever. So the bankruptcy crisis isn't about desperate people confronting layoffs and underemployment. With the economy doing well and with so many Americans with high-quality, good-paying jobs, we have to look deep into the 
   eroding moral values of some people to find out what is driving the bankruptcy crisis. Some people flat out don't want to honor their obligations and are looking for an easy way out. In the opinion of this Senator, a significant part of the bankruptcy crisis is basically a moral crisis. Some people just don't have a sense of personal responsibility. 
   It seems clear to me that our lax bankruptcy system must bear some of the blame for the bankruptcy crisis. Just as the old welfare system encouraged people not to get jobs and encouraged people not to even think about pulling their own weight, our lax bankruptcy system doesn't even ask people to consider paying what they owe, particularly when they have the ability to pay. Such a system, obviously, contributes to the fray of the moral fiber of our Nation. Why pay your bills when you can walk away with no questions asked? Why honor your obligations when you can take the easy way out through bankruptcy? If we don't tighten the bankruptcy system, the moral erosion will certainly continue. 
   The polls are very clear that the American people want the bankruptcy system tightened up. In my home State of Iowa, 78 percent of Iowans surveyed favor bankruptcy reform, and the picture is the same nationally. According to the Public Broadcasting System program Techno-Politics, almost 70 percent of Americans support bankruptcy reform. 
   The American people seem to sense that the bankruptcy crisis is fundamentally a moral crisis. I have a chart that also deals with that. This chart is done by the Democratic polling firm of Penn & Schoen. It talks about the perceptions people have about bankruptcy. You can see here that 84 percent of the people think that bankruptcy is more socially acceptable than it was a few years ago. This is the same polling firm President Clinton uses; so I think this number is very telling, given that it was produced by a liberal polling firm. In my State of Iowa, the editorial page of the Des Moines Register has summed up the problem that we have with the bankruptcy system by stating that bankruptcy ``was never intended as the one-stop, no-questions-asked solution to irresponsibility.'' I totally agree. 
   I hope we can soon get to the bankruptcy bill, which has so much support in the Senate. As my colleague who worked so closely with me on this legislation, the Senator from New Jersey, has said, we are committed to bringing this bill to a vote this year and getting it done in a fashion that will show the bipartisanship that has operated throughout this year to bring us a 14-4 vote out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to duplicate that wide margin on the floor of the Senate, to send a clear signal to people who use bankruptcy as financial planning that if you have the ability to pay, you are never going to get out of paying what you have the capability of paying. That is good for our country, it is good for the economy and, most important, it is good for the pocketbooks of honest Americans. Bankruptcies cost the average American family to the tune of $400 a year. That's not fair to the American men and women working to pay taxes and make a better life to have to pay $400 more per year because somebody else isn't paying their debts. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the President of the United States vetoed the largest tax decrease bill to pass the Congress since 1981. By doing this, he wants to continue the tax overpayment that working Americans are paying into the Federal Treasury. 
   The President is saying in his veto that we ought to continue to tax the taxpayers at the 21 percent of gross domestic product level, where taxes are now, the highest level in the history of our country, as opposed to the last 50 years when taxes fell in the range of 18 to 19 percent of gross domestic product. 
   The people of the United States have been willing and, through consensus, settled on the level of 18 to 19 percent of gross domestic product, both from the standpoint of what they are willing to pay into the Federal Government and also from the standpoint of how that is, at a lower level of taxation, better for the economy. 
   The President said in his veto message we would put in jeopardy several government programs if we did not continue to tax at this level. The President didn't say in so many words, but he has a plan for spending the $792 billion that the Congress would let the American taxpayers keep. By spending it, he would do it in a fashion that would end up with a $200 billion additional national debt than what we would have by giving the $792 billion to the taxpayers. He would, in a sense, jack up the level of expenditure of the Federal Government to well over the present level of expenditure and put in jeopardy balancing the budget if we had a downturn in the economy and the taxes did not come into the Federal Treasury at the rate of 21 percent of gross domestic product. 
   Even though the bill passed in a bipartisan way when it first went through the Senate, on final passage it ended up being a Republican tax reduction that went to the President because there were not any people on the other side of the aisle who voted for it. 
   We were saying that this tax overpayment ought to be left with working  Americans because only the people spending the money or investing it do it in a way that creates wealth in America and creates jobs as a result of the creation of wealth. 
   Anybody who thinks money is better left in the Federal Treasury--at the highest rate of taxation in the history of the country, at 21 percent of GDP--ought to realize that there are not jobs created as a result of that money going into the Federal till because the Federal Government is not a creator of wealth. Our involvement with the creation of wealth is to leave as many resources as we can to the ingenuity of American working men and women to invest and to spend because it turns over so many more times in the economy than when it is spent by us in Washington. 
   So this tax decrease, the largest since 1981, was our effort to give a tax refund to working Americans by returning the tax overpayment. We do it in a responsible manner, by devoting 75 percent of the $3 trillion surplus that is going to come into the Federal Treasury over the next 10 years to Social Security, Medicare, paying down the national debt, and other domestic priorities. We would leave three-fourths of that extra dollar that people pay in taxes that do not need to be paid, with the Federal Government for paying down the national debt, strengthening Social Security, $505 billion that could be set aside for strengthening Medicare and other domestic programs, and we would leave 25 percent of that surplus with the taxpayers because we know that hard-working men and women in America can use that money better than it can be misspent here in Washington. 
   It seems to me the President was intellectually dishonest last week when, in his veto message--that was on television; everybody heard it--he said we were threatening Social Security, we were threatening Medicare, we were not paying down the national debt when we had this tax cut. I say that is intellectual dishonesty because the plan we sent to the President had in mind reserving all of the Social Security payroll tax money to Social Security, paying down the national debt, with $505 billion for strengthening Medicare and other domestic priorities within our Government, and still leaving $800 billion to the taxpayers. 
   It is only fair to give the taxpayers this money because it is their money that created the surplus in the first place. It is not the hard work of bureaucrats in Washington, it is not the hard work of Members of Congress that created this surplus, it is the ingenuity of the American people. For that ingenuity, they are being overtaxed at this particular time to the tune of 21 percent of gross domestic product compared to the 50-year history of somewhere between 18 percent and 19 percent. It is only fair to give them their money back. 
   Even Democrats agree that the surplus should be returned to the taxpayers. One Member of the other side of the aisle said this:  
   I strongly believe we should return part of that money [meaning the surplus] to hard-working Americans. To suggest we cannot afford to cut income taxes when we are running a $3 trillion surplus is ludicrous.  
   That is from a Member of the Senate from the other side of the aisle. That same Member said:  
   To say that tax cuts stand in the way of needed domestic spending, Medicare and debt relief, is also folly.  
   It is too bad the President of the United States does not listen to Members of his own party. 
   The President wants you to believe he vetoed just a $792 billion tax bill--and that is a 10-year figure. But when you look at the bits and pieces of it, I think it will demonstrate the President did not veto just a $792 billion tax bill, but he vetoed lower taxes for middle- and lower-income Americans, he made health insurance less affordable, and he took away incentives to save more. Let me go through what the President vetoed to be very specific, so people know exactly what we planned in this Congress when we passed this tax bill. 
   We planned to encourage savings, to encourage entrepreneurship, and to give hard-working families the money they need to support themselves. We reduced tax rates for middle- and lower-income Americans. The President vetoed that. 
   Our tax bill made health insurance more affordable by providing 100-percent tax deductibility for all premiums for the self-employed and, starting for the first time in the history of our tax laws, gave employees who work for corporations, who do not have a corporate health plan, the same tax deductibility for their own individual plans that employees of major corporations have had since World War II. The President vetoed both of those items. 
   Our bill made it easier for children to care for elderly parents by giving some tax incentives for family caregiving and also making tax deductibility possible for long-term care insurers. The President vetoed that. 
   One thing we hear about more than any other injustice in the Tax Code is the marriage tax penalty. That correction was in the bill. The President vetoed the provisions to do away with the marriage tax penalty. 
   We hear from farmers and small businessmen how wrong it is to break up a business to pay a death tax. This bill did away with the estate tax, so there was no tax on death, so you could pass on the family farm and the family business. The President vetoed that. 
   We had increased incentives for retirement savings because everybody knows Social Security has never been intended to be a sole retirement plan and is not adequate today. So we have to have more encouragement for families to save for retirement. The President vetoed that. 
   We hear from families, particularly from women who work outside the home, that child care ought to be more affordable. The President vetoed that. 
   We had full tax deductibility of interest on student loans in this bill. The President vetoed that. 
   We expanded the Individual Retirement Account opportunities. The President vetoed that. 
   In short, President Clinton vetoed tax relief measures that would benefit men and women nationwide. 
   The President has vetoed it, and I do not think there will be a compromise with the President on this because the $800 billion is such an infinitesimal amount of money--only 3.5 
   percent of all the revenue coming into the Federal Treasury over the next 10 years--that how do you compromise between zero and 3.5 percent when the 3.5 percent is so puny that we in the Congress ought to be embarrassed we could not find ways of saving money and giving even a larger tax cut? 
   This means this issue will be taken to the country, and we will let the Democratic candidate, presumably Vice President GORE, campaign next year on a platform of spending this money, as President Clinton proposes to spend it, and we will let the Republican candidate for President run on a platform of, hopefully, backing at least this much of a tax cut and more of a tax cut. We will take this issue to the country. Let the people decide, and in letting the people decide, let's have a clear mandate for spending the $792 billion or letting the taxpayers keep it. 
   The President, in his veto message and all during the month of August, has been trying to make a mountain out of a molehill, as far as this tax cut issue is concerned. He has suggested that $800 billion is a mountain of money--and it is a lot of money--but as I said, it is 3.5 percent of all the money that is going to come into the Federal Treasury over the next 10 years that we could let the taxpayers keep in their pockets or spend it or invest it to create jobs and wealth in America to expand our economy. But, in fact, the mountain is the $23 trillion that is coming into the Federal Treasury over the next 10 years, and the $792 billion tax cut is the molehill. 
   On this chart, we have the mountain over here, the $22.8 trillion that the working men and women of America are going to pay into the Federal Treasury over the next 10 years. Mr. President Clinton, that is the mountain, but right here is the $792 billion tax cut that you vetoed last week, and that is truly the molehill. Mr. President, you can't make a mountain out of a molehill. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to warn the Senate of intensifying harassment against government whistleblowers. This trend threatens Congress'  right to know, and preserves secrecy that shields bureaucratic misconduct. From the IRS to the State Department, retaliation is increasing against government employees who blow the whistle on wrongdoing by high government officials. 
   How did we get here? In the view of this Senator, one of the major problems has been the judicial activism of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction over challenges by government employees to illegal retaliatory acts, and which has grossly misinterpreted existing federal laws. To illustrate my concerns, I am enclosing for the RECORD a New York Times editorial; and a Federal Times article by the Government Accountability Project about the most extreme Federal Circuit precedent, involving Air Force whistleblower John White. This precedent could functionally cancel both the whistleblower law and the Code of Ethics. 
   I have no intention of passively acquiescing to the judicial equivalent of contempt of Congress.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to recognize and enter into the RECORD a recent speech presented to the Des Moines Rotary Club by Hans Becherer, Chairman and CEO of Deere and Company. His remarks are insightful and provide a long term outlook from one of the leaders in our agricultural community. The speech is entitled, ``All Farming is Global''.  
   Today I'd like to discuss some of the major trends that will help shape agriculture as it moves into the new century and millennium. This is of particular importance to Iowa since almost one-fourth of the state's population works in the agricultural complex ..... and 90% of the land area is devoted to farms. 
   Farming remains critical to John Deere, as well. Although we've diversified a good deal in recent years, both in product breadth and geographic reach, farm machinery remains our flagship business ..... and the domestic farmer our number one customer. 
   Needless to say, the farm sector is struggling right now due to depressed grain and livestock prices. As a result, North American retail demand for farm equipment is expected to be off 25% or so this year with lesser reductions in Europe. Accordingly, we're making aggressive cutbacks in our production in order to adjust inventories and bring more balance to the market. 
   One farmer, on an Internet message board devoted to Deere, recently summed it up this way: ``The quality of the green tractor is there,'' he said. ``The quality of the green money to pay for it isn't.'' 
   Thus far, that seems to be a fair assessment of the situation. 
   Of course, the farm economy was in good shape heading into this downturn, from the standpoint of debt levels and land values, and will likely prove quite resilient. There's nothing to suggest this will be a rerun of the 1980s. 
   Moreover--the next year or two aside--the future of farming looks extremely promising for the long run. 
   That's what I'd like to focus on this afternoon--less the problems of the present, than the promise of the future. 
   Of the key forces dictating change in agriculture today, the most important ones concern increasingly open markets and freer trade; the explosive growth in technology, which is transforming the entire economy these days; plus, the continuing importance of environmental issues. 
   Let's take a closer look at these issues now. * * * * * 
   As a first point, farming is becoming far more market-oriented. 
   Most of us, I suspect, believe in free trade and open agricultural markets. We feel farmers in Iowa have a lot to gain from such a situation. We have, after all, some of the world's best farmland literally in our backyards, plus an excellent distribution system for getting crops to market, and access to highly productive farm machinery. 
   Just what does an open market, increasingly free of controls and restrictions, mean to the farm sector? 
   Mostly, it will accelerate trends already under way--putting a premium on large, efficiently run operations that are able to make the most of today's technology and fast-moving markets. 
   Less-regulated farming will have a positive impact in terms of overall economic efficiency--and it's likely a plus for the nation's agricultural complex as a whole. It certainly gives U.S. farming a leg-up in a global market, something that works to Iowa's benefit. 
   As for the decline in smaller farms, this very definitely marks the passing of an era, which many find a source of regret. But it's a process that has been in motion for some time: Even in the robust economic environment of the last few years, Deere was selling less than half as many tractors and combines to the domestic market as in the early 1970s. The number of U.S. farms has contracted by one-third (from 3 to 2 million) over this time, with a similar pattern seen in Iowa. 
   I should point out that some small operators will do quite well in tomorrow's less-regulated market. These are the ones who devote themselves to a type of management-intensive, or niche, agriculture, such as growing organic crops. Still, it will take quite an entrepreneurial breed to overcome the economies of scale that are becoming more and more a part of farming. 
   Along the same lines, a more open agricultural climate means farming will become more internationally focused and geared to exports. Indeed, the farmer of the future will have to be a man of the world. 
   And that's definitely a plus for Iowa. 
   Agriculture has always been regarded as the most basic of local enterprises. And rightly so: What could be more a part of our communities than our own soil? Farming, moreover, has constituted the soul of rural life in our country for over 200 years, and been widely associated with the virtues of honesty and hard work that built America. 
   But in truth, ladies and gentlemen, all farming is global. 
   Every ear of corn, or pod of soybean produced in Iowa makes an impact on the world market ..... and affects farmers in faraway places such as Australia and Argentina. 
   Similarly, every drop of rain that falls on Brazil's creddados ..... has an effect on Iowa's farms and fields. 
   Legislation approved in Berlin and Brussels ..... is felt by farmers in Burlington and Belle Plaine. 
   Soybean prices went into a nosedive awhile back ..... not because of a leap in supply or a lag in demand, but because the Brazilian currency lost one-quarter of its value over-night. Brazil, of course, is a major soybean producer and exporter. That action alone shaved roughly a dollar a bushel off bean prices. 
   Global trade, manifested by exports, has become a mainstay for our nation's farmers. Roughly one-fourth of farm receipts today come from overseas sales. And Iowa is right in the thick of things, being the nation's number-two exporter of agricultural commodities ( $4B year) after California. 
   Farm exports will drop this year due to the economic travails of the developing world and are down almost 20%--or $10 billion--from their peak. But this is almost surely a short-lived phenomenon ..... and completely at odds with the long-range picture. 
   The world's fundamentals--namely, strong population growth, improved diets and more open trade policies--all point to U.S. farming, and Iowa agriculture, being an export-driven, growth-intensive business with solid prospects well into the future. * * * * * 
   Farming will get more competitive, too, as farmers scramble to add value to their crops and gain an edge in productivity, yields and costs. 
   Technology--my second point--will help them get there. Technology, of course, has been the story in agriculture since the days of Cyrus McCormick's reaper ..... John Deere's plow ..... and the Waterloo Boy tractor. Forerunners of modern-day combines and cotton-pickers weren't far behind. 
   The cultural effect of ever-more productive machinery goes well beyond the farm. It's what transformed our society into an industrial power since it takes so much less physical labor to feed our population today. The average farmer gets as much done by 9 a.m. now as in a full day in the post-war 1940s. Over this time, crop production has nearly tripled from virtually the same amount of farmland. Especially noteworthy, farm-labor's role in the agricultural process has dropped by more than two-thirds during this time. 
   What accounts for such improvements? Technology, mostly ..... in the form of better seeds and fertilizer, as well as--indeed--more sophisticated farm machinery. 
   As important as technology has been to farming's past ..... it's fair to say we haven't seen anything yet. Genetically modified seeds ..... plus precision, or satellite-guided, farming and other, almost unimaginable, advances in information technology ..... put farming on a truly exciting, high-tech plain for the new century. 
   Going forward, in fact, a farmer's biggest problem will not be having access to technology, but figuring out how to apply it to his best advantage. ``What we're trying to do here,'' one farmer recently said at a precision-farming conference, ``is create knowledge out of chaos.'' 
   Meeting this need--helping farmers bridge the gap between information and intelligence--may constitute a promising business opportunity in its own right. Deere recently formed a new business unit--John Deere Special Technology Group--to help supply solutions to these challenges. 
   One of the unit's most exciting new ventures is the VantagePoint network, a kind of silo in cyberspace. More to the point, VantagePoint is an Internet-based data-warehouse subscription service that allows farmers to collect, store, and reference a full array of data about their farming operation--such as yield and seed population. Subscribers can also see aggregated data from neighboring areas. VantagePoint functions as a server to contain this information ..... and, as an interface, to organize and present the data in creative and useful ways. 
   As for the Internet itself, we believe it adds an important new dimension to the selling process, which should work to the benefit of our John Deere dealers ..... by helping them provide even more responsive service and counsel.  
   A number of dealers have their own websites. Many more are listing used equipment on a company-sponsored site called MachineFinder-dot-com, launched late last year. Roughly 6,000 pieces of equipment, mostly tractors and combines, are presently available over MachineFinder ..... and about 15,000 users have registered for the site. 
   What ever the future of MachineFinder and other emerging Internet-related services, one can safely assume that technology will play as big a role in the success of tomorrow's farmers as the weather or government policies. * * * * * 
   As technology makes farmers more productive, it's also helping them be good stewards of the soil, the air and the water. That's the third area I'd like to touch on today. 
   Outside of large hog lots--which is certainly a newsworthy issue in Iowa--the environmental side of farming doesn't grab many headlines. But it's quite a factor in the farming process ..... and seems likely to stay that way. 
   Regulation, for one thing, will see to it that farmers remain serious about limiting emissions ..... preserving the soil ..... and controlling the run-off of chemicals and waste. Some of the proposals you hear about would even limit the hours farmers spend in their fields, based on dust restrictions. Noise abatement is an emerging concern. And water quality seems likely to be the next big area of regulatory focus. 
   All this, of course, adds cost and complexity to the farming process. But many of the very things that make farmers environmentally sensitive ..... are actually fiscally sensible. That is, they help farmers become more productive and profitable. 
   New engines are cleaner-burning and more efficient. Precision farming helps farmers cut down on input costs. New sprayers apply herbicides with laser-like precision, cutting down on waste and over-spray. 
   All that's good for the environment, of course. But it's also beneficial for the farmer's bottom line. 
   Iowa's farmers are truly among the unsung heroes in today's environmental movement. For without modern fertilizers, herbicides and machinery ..... without high-yield production practices ..... and without the tremendous yield gains we've seen over the years ..... an additional one-million square miles of our nation (all the land east of the Mississippi River, in size) would need to be plowed under and made into cropland, merely to equal present levels of grain production. 
   That's no less than three miles the amount of land currently devoted to farming. It's fair to say, moreover, that these new fields would come at the direct expense of forested areas and other land now serving as wildlife habitat or as part of our natural watershed. 
   Clearly, farmers have done quite a job of safeguarding our natural resources, while meeting the world's growing need for food. Nevertheless, tomorrow's increasingly formidable environmental pressures will require an even more intensive commitment on their part. * * * * * 
   Regardless of the challenges ahead for agriculture, I assure you that Deere remains firmly committed to providing solutions to our customers' needs and customers in our case go far beyond the farm. 
   Over the last several years, John Deere has worked hard to achieve a good deal of diversification in our operations. We've done so not by plunging into altogether-new businesses, but by applying the lessons learned from generations of dealing with farmers to a broader range of customers. 
   Our view is that the characteristics of our Waterloo-made tractors, or Des Moines cotton pickers--such as durability and reliability--work just as well for construction equipment, such as Dubuque-made backhoes. 
   The same goes for our new skid-steer loaders, Gator utility vehicles, golf and turf equipment or the full range of lawn-care machinery now being offered in green and yellow. 
   Similarly, our Des Moines-based credit operation owes its success not to the fact that the money it lends goes farther than anyone else's ..... but because of the integrity and service that has long been associated with the John Deere name. (John Deere Credit, incidentally, is quite a successful enterprise in its own right, normally adding 20% or so to the company's overall net income.) 
   Moreover, it is these non-ag operations that have been the focus of major investment programs of late ..... and which we're counting on to help us achieve more consistency in our profits whenever the farm economy weakens. * * * * * 
   None of which, in any way, dampens our enthusiasm for farming. 
   Because despite some of the challenges I've mentioned--and the current downturn is very real and painful--the future for agriculture looks good. 
   Darned good, in fact. 
   Regardless of Indonesia's financial problems ..... the world still has 10,000 new mouths to feed every hour, and, again, will need three times today's grain output within 50 years. 
   No matter what's ahead for Brazil's real or Russia's ruble ..... a good deal of money will be spent on the increased consumption of meat--which is a primary driver of demand for grain. 
   Beyond the Third World's growing pains ..... the global farm population, now over 40%, will shrink as industrial growth creates new opportunities and higher living standards. This will make Iowa's contribution to the world food supply all the more important. 
   True, these things may take shape more slowly than we expected, but the fundamental trends are headed in the right direction. 
   All point ..... to a promising future ..... for a globally attuned ..... technologically astute ..... environmentally aware ..... agricultural sector--such as exists in Iowa and surrounding states.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to co-sponsor this amendment to increase the appropriation for veterans medical care by $600 million over the amount reported by the committee. 
   This additional $600 million will bring the appropriations for veterans health care in both the House and the Senate to a total of $1.7 billion over the amount requested by the President. This increase should help stabilize veterans health care services in Iowa. 
   Iowa is in Network 14, which includes most of Nebraska, part of Illinois, and parts of Kansas, Missouri and Minnesota. Network 14 is one of those which has steadilly lost funding under the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation System, the funding system which, several years ago, changed the way VA monies are distributed around the country. 
   In addition, as my colleagues know, the VA health care system, following developments in the rest of the nation's health care system, has been emphasizing care in outpatient settings where appropriate. In keeping with this policy, the network including Iowa has developed outpatient clinics in several communities around the State, as well as health screening activities around the State. 
   In many respects, this shift to an outpatient focus is good policy. Certainly care should be given at the most medically appropriate level. Veterans can receive that care closer to home than might otherwise be the case if sufficient community clinics can be created. It is also probably the case that more veterans can be served by such an approach to health care services. This has certainly been the case in Iowa. Between 1996 and 1998 the total number of veterans served in Iowa has increased from 43,856 to 47,225, an increase of 3,369. Veterans treated on an inpatient  basis declined from 7,615 to 5,204 over that period, but veterans treated on an outpatient basis increased from 36,241 to 42,021. 
   Unfortunately, the combination of the shift of funding away from States like mine to the south and southwest, and tight Federal budgets for veterans health care has resulted in a squeeze on the budget for Network 14. Although the network has been able to continue to serve the category 7 veterans, I regularly hear complaints about very long waits for service, and, occasionally, about episodes of poor quality service which seem linked to too few staff. 
   I hope that this increase of $1.7 billion beyond what the President requested will help ease the budget squeeze of Iowa and Network 14, and will help prevent any further deterioration in access to services for Iowa's veterans. I am aware, of course, that the VA will be providing a 4.8 percent increase for VA employees, and this will come from the appropriation for VA programs. And health care costs continue to inflate. Nevertheless, this increased appropriation should help us in Iowa.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.

<DOCNO>106-grassley-ia-2-19990921</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all, before the Senator from Alabama leaves, he needs to be thanked for the outstanding work he has done to help put this compromise piece of legislation together that came out of committee by a bipartisan vote of 14-4, and also during the remarks he just presented for laying out the history of this legislation last year in which the bill passed 97-1. He very accurately stated what the situation is. 
   He also now raises the question, which is a legitimate question: What has gotten rotten in Denmark, so that all of a sudden a bill that passed 97-1 about a year ago is being filibustered in the effort to bring it up, if some people aren't playing some sort of game? 
   I thank the Senator from Alabama for his work on this bill. 
   I also thank him for reminding the Senate of what that situation was a year ago and raising the question of what has changed. Not much has changed. It is just that some people want to use tactics behind the scenes to keep a bill from coming out in the open when they wouldn't express those same views in a vote on the floor of the Senate. 
   Also, there was a previous speaker on the other side, a friend of mine, who recently spoke against the cloture motion to bring debate on this bill to a halt on the motion to proceed and then immediately get to the bill; he expressed a view that there ought to be opportunity to offer nongermane amendments on the issue of agriculture. 
   Normally, I am sympathetic to those opportunities to bring to the floor of the Senate the complaints and concerns of an economic crisis such as we are facing in agriculture. But I think there are opportunities available to do that other than messing up an opportunity to bring needed reform to the bankruptcy code. 
   Besides, during my remarks today, I am going to point out to the Senator from Minnesota how there are opportunities in this very bankruptcy bill to help the family farmer. They relate directly to the permanent reauthorization of chapter 12 bankruptcy. If that is not authorized in this bill--in fact, if this isn't done by the 1st of October--there is no chapter 12. Then, instead of using a chapter of the bankruptcy code that is written to the special needs of agriculture, the farmers are going to have to file for bankruptcy under chapter 11. That was written for corporate America. That doesn't fit the needs of agriculture. They are going to find, unlike chapter 12's existence for reorganization of farmers where 88 percent of them are still able to farm and maintain the family farming operation, that there will be a very high percentage of farmers forced to file under chapter 11, the chapter friendly to corporate structure, and they are not going to be farming anymore at all. They won't be farming as family farmers, if they farm. 
   Mr. President, we are coming soon to a cloture vote on the bankruptcy bill. If cloture is not invoked, it will be very unfortunate. I've worked very closely with the minority and with Senator TORRICELLI, who is the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the courts, to fashion a bill which contains many changes and modifications requested by Democrats. For instance, the means-test is looser than I would personally prefer. But I have made this change to respond to concerns raised by the other side of the aisle. 
   I think we're in this situation because we have Members from the minority party who want to offer an unlimited number of amendments on subjects totally unrelated to bankruptcy. 
   This, of course, is a delay and stalling tactic by imposing these nongermane amendments upon a very important bill, a bill that will pass this body by an overwhelming margin, if we get it up for a vote, but a bill that can be stalled by people who maybe don't want this bill to pass and don't want to face it head on, because this bill passed by a 97-1 vote in the last Congress. 
   From my conversations with the Republican leadership, I think it's fair to say that we are willing to accommodate a few unrelated amendments from the minority. But, it appears that some Members of the Minority want to turn the bankrupticy bill into a Christmas tree for everything you can think of. Obviously, that's not acceptable. So here we are. At some point, I hope that this situation is resolved. We Republicans stand ready to be reasonable. 
   I want to take this opportunity to talk about what is being delayed. The bankruptcy bill contains some very important provisions that are vital for family farmers, especially Midwestern family farmers, and particularly with this economic crisis even in my State of Iowa. 
   As we all know from recent debate on the emergency agriculture appropriations bill, which is in conference this very night to iron out the differences between the House and Senate, many of America's farmers are facing financial ruin. We have some of the lowest commodity prices in 30 years. Pork producers have lost billions of dollars--not just in income but in equity. The price of corn is currently well under the cost of production. And the cash market for soybeans has reached a 23-year low. This is all in addition to the poor weather conditions in parts of the Midwest and the drought in the 10 States of the Eastern United States. 
   Just last week, I sent a letter with a number of farm State Senators from both parties, including the Democratic leader, Senator DASCHLE, signing it, to all Senators, discussing the needs for reauthorization of chapter 12, which is done in this all-encompassing bankruptcy reform legislation. 
   As you can imagine, these difficult financial circumstances have sent many farming operations into a tailspin. Clearly, we need to make sure that the family farmers continue to have bankruptcy protection available during this difficult period. But bankruptcy protection won't be available if this bill is blocked by turning it into a Christmas tree. 
   I don't pretend to talk about bankruptcy being needed by the family farmers as a substitute for anything that can be done here in the Congress or what can be done through the marketplace to bring profitability because that is what is absolutely necessary. But under any circumstances, in good times or bad times, some farmers are going to need to have the protection of chapter 12, just as corporations in America have the protection of chapter 11. And farmers are entitled to a chapter that fits the needs of agriculture, the same way corporate America is entitled to a chapter that fits the needs of corporate America. 
   Title X of this bill makes chapter 12 permanent and makes several changes to chapter 12 to make it more accessible for farmers and to give farmers new tools to assist in reorganizing their financial affairs. 
   As things stand now, chapter 12 will cease to exist by September 30 unless we get this bill through the Senate, through conference, and on the President's desk. It would be a supreme act of irresponsibility if we let chapter 12 die and we leave our farmers without a last ditch protection against foreclosure and forced auctions. 
   Make no mistake about it. By delaying this bill, Senators who vote against cloture will leave family farmers across America exposed to forced auctions and foreclosures. That is what I urge the Senator from Minnesota to be cognizant of as he votes against cloture, as he indicated he would do. 
   Back in the mid-1980s, when Iowa was in the midst of another devastating  farm crisis, I wrote chapter 12 to make sure family farmers would receive a fair shake in dealing with the banks and the Federal Government as a lender of last resort. At that time I didn't know if chapter 12 was going to work or not, so it was only enacted on a temporary basis. Chapter 12 has been an unmitigated success. As a result of chapter 12, many farmers in Iowa and across the country are still farming and contributing to the American economy. With a new crisis in the farm country, we need to make chapter 12 a permanent part of Federal law. This bankruptcy bill provides for permanency for farmers. 
   Chapter 12 worked in the mid-1980s and it should be made permanent so family farmers in trouble today or any time in the future can get breathing room and a fresh start. This statement that chapter 12 works for farmers is backed up by an Iowa State University study of farmers who used chapter 12 during the 1980s. Mr. President, 88 percent of those farmers were successfully farming at the time of the study. 
   The Bankruptcy Reform Act doesn't just make chapter 12 permanent; the bill makes improvements to chapter 12 so it will become more accessible and helpful for farmers. First, the definition of a family farmer is widened so more farmers can qualify for chapter 12 bankruptcy protections. Second, and perhaps more importantly, my bankruptcy bill reduces the priority of capital gains tax liabilities for farm assets sold as a part of a reorganization plan. This will have the beneficial effect of allowing cash-strapped farmers to sell livestock, grain, and other farm assets to generate cash-flow when liquidity is essential to maintaining a farming operation. Together, all of these suggested reforms will make chapter 12 more effective in protecting America's family farms during this difficult period. These reforms will never happen if the bill is continually blocked by Senators offering unrelated and nongermane amendments. 
   It is imperative we keep chapter 12 alive. Before we had chapter 12, banks held a veto over reorganization plans. They wouldn't negotiate with farmers and the farmer would be forced to auction off the farm, even if the farm had been in the family for generations. The fact is that fire-type sales under these circumstances actually drive down prices at those auctions so both the creditor and the debtor end up with less. Now, because of chapter 12, the banks are willing to come to terms. 
   We must pass this bankruptcy reform bill to make sure America's family farms have a fighting chance to reorganize their financial affairs. Unless things change, this bill may be set aside because of stalling tactics by some Members on the other side of the aisle.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for yielding. 
   Even though I am not going to speak on the issue of taxes, I just heard the remarks by the Senator from Arkansas. Obviously, voting for that bill was difficult. I agree with the statements and plead with the President to sign the bill and give the people back some of the money or let them keep the money rather than running it through Washington. We are overtaxing the people at the highest level of taxation in the history of our country.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I chair the Committee on Aging. We  have been holding some hearings about the nursing home industry over the last several months. I would like to make a comment. 
   First of all, I would like to speak about credibility. It is similar to an old maple tree. It takes years to develop, but a big storm can wipe it out just like that. I have a story that makes the point. 
   The nursing home industry challenged the credibility of nursing home inspectors. The nursing home industry, after this challenge, lost. 
   When I refer to the nursing home industry, I mean the American Health Care Association. This group represents the for-profit nursing homes. It has thousands of members across the country. 
   Nursing home inspectors operate in every State. They inspect every nursing home that accepts Federal money. The inspectors gauge whether nursing homes follow the Federal laws that were passed to protect nursing home residents. They evaluate everything from the most severe problems to the most minor problems. The most severe problems include malnutrition, dehydration, bedsores, inadequate medical treatment--matters that can be life-threatening. The most minor problems might include things such as comfortable lighting and access to stationery. 
   At my request, the General Accounting Office has issued a series of reports documenting severe problems in too many nursing homes, thus pointing up the shortcomings of the inspection. 
   On March 18, when I released one of these reports, the American Health Care Association issued a critical news release. The association said:  
   Inspectors have closed down facilities, without consulting residents and their families, for technical violations posing no jeopardy to residents.  
   The association also said:  
   Unfortunately, the current Federal inspection system has all the trademarks of a bureaucratic government program out of control.  
   These, of course, were very serious charges made by the association of nursing homes, and I took those charges very seriously. The Federal inspection system is responsible for the welfare of 1.6 million nursing home residents. If that system fails, these frail individuals will bear the brunt. That is something that should concern every one of us in the Senate. 
   Following up, I asked the American Health Care Association for proof of its claims issued in that news release critical of what the General Accounting Office had to say at my behest to study the issue. On May 6, I received an information packet from the American Health Care Association describing 10 examples that the association saw as proof of overzealous regulations. I turned this information over to the General Accounting Office and asked for its analysis. 
   The GAO did not find evidence of overzealous regulation. In fact, the General Accounting Office found just the opposite. There was adequate information for an objective assessment for 8 of the 10 industry examples. In each of those 8 cases, the General Accounting Office found that regulators acted appropriately. 
   I am not going to go through all eight examples, but I will use three. I think they show that there is a big difference in what the industry presented and what the General Accounting Office found; in other words, the industry's accusations that the inspection system was a bureaucratic thing out of control and that it was based upon just technicalities was wrong. 
   Example No. 1: The industry complained that a Michigan nursing home was severely punished for providing complimentary coffee to family members, staff, and residents. The General Accounting Office said that the nursing home inspectors saw two vulnerable residents pulling at the spigot of the hot coffee urn. The inspectors believed that the residents were in immediate danger of suffering serious burns from the coffee. Of course, with this, the General Accounting Office agreed. 
   Example No. 2: The industry complained that a California nursing home was cited for bed sores on a resident's foot that predated his admission, and in fact the bed sores were healing. The General Accounting Office said the inspector found conditions that actually had worsened the bed sores. The resident was wearing leather shoes when in a wheelchair. His feet were not elevated when in bed. His bedsore dressings were changed without proper techniques to prevent infection. There again, the example given by the nursing home association was wrong. 
   Example No. 3: The industry claimed that an Alabama nursing home was cited for a bald kitchen worker who failed to wear a hair net. The GAO reported that the industry did not identify the nursing home involved nor provide any documentation; therefore, the General Accounting Office could not assess what had happened. 
   I could go on in more detail from the General Accounting Office report. I have that report here, and I would like to point out to my colleagues that they should look at it, read it. Hopefully, everyone is interested and they will do so. It tells a valuable cautionary tale. Members of Congress, as I felt a responsibility to do, should always seek out both sides of every story. Industry associations work hard to seek our agreement with their side and, of course, in our system of government, and whether individual, or an association of individuals, that is their right. But it is our obligation as representatives of the people to weigh every issue with all the facts at hand. It is equally our obligation to consider the credibility of every source. 
   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of time for Senator THOMAS.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday I spoke about the hope that we could get a bipartisan agreement. I spoke also about the fact that I consider ag programs and Social Security and Medicare as social contracts that we have with segments of our population and the Government, and the extent to which, for the most part, those social contracts have been bipartisan when there have been changes made. 
   I welcomed the opportunity yesterday to have Democratic leaders and people interested in agricultural issues wanting to meet with Republicans to reach that bipartisan accord. An accord such as this is one where each side gives some. I think Republicans have given, the extent to which this is more than some magic $7.5 billion, but, there again, as the Senator from North Dakota explained, it is about halfway between the extremes of what both parties were offering. 
   What I know is very strongly felt by a lot of people on the other side of the aisle is that there should be a division of the cash infusion into agriculture between AMTA payments and LDPs. We on this side of the aisle believe more strongly about that than almost any other issue--that that is the wrong way to go, for two reasons: One, LDP is a convoluted way to get money to farmers; and the second one is that when we have an emergency such as this, we ought to be able to get the money to the community as fast as we can. This can be done within 10 days after the President signs the bill. 
   On the other side of the aisle, at least I can say for the Senator from North Dakota, they have given a lot in order to reach this compromise. It is very deeply felt by Republicans that all of this money should go out through AMTA. This is give and take on both sides, and I hope that it does get a massive amount of support so we can say we did something with a social contract that is bipartisan, which is a tradition of this body. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is a health issue, yes, but it is more than just an issue of whether or not we are going to continue to poison the environment and the ground water and permit poison, on the one hand, or a product that you can drink, on the other hand, to take its place. This is also an economic issue, 
   although we have almost exclusively debated the health issues tonight. We just as easily could be conjuring up the debates of previous years between big oil on the one hand and agriculture on the other hand--agriculture being the base product for the production of ethanol, and big oil because of its interest in MTBE. 
   So it is an economic issue, not just an issue of poisoning the environment. It is also an issue of whether or not we ought to rely upon a renewable source of energy that comes from agriculture and corn, to make ethanol, or whether you ought to rely upon a nonrenewable fuel, MTBE. It is also an issue of whether or not this country ought to be energy-dependent upon foreign sources, because like our importing more than half of our petroleum, we also import half of our MTBE. The issue should be how we are going to be less dependent upon foreign sources of energy when we fully use our own family farmers to grow our own crops and use our own agricultural products to produce ethanol, a renewable fuel. 
   It is an environmental issue in regards to whether or not you are going to produce MTBE from a nonrenewable source, a finite source, and poison; or whether you are going to have the more clean-burning, renewable source that doesn't poison from ethanol. 
   Our balance of trade is also an issue due to the fact that one-third of our unfavorable balance of trade comes from the fact that we import so much of our energy. We should use more of our domestically produced energy, a renewable source of energy which is not imported and not controlled by oil companies. This would provide the nation with a more favorable balance of trade. 
   Our national defense should not be devoted in part to defending foreign sources of energy. An admiral in the Navy once explained that about half of the Navy's budget is dependent upon protecting oil, the flow of oil from the Middle East to the United States. This should be considered a subsidy. This source of energy partially compromises our national defense. We should base our national defense more on energy independence through the use of renewable energy, domestically produced energy, of which ethanol is part of that equation, produced from a renewable source. 
   Yes, this is an issue of poison versus a product that isn't poison. Ethanol is a product that you can drink, but it has a positive economic impact, solidifies our national defense, benefits our environment, and reduces our trade deficit. 
   So let's look at it in a very broad vein because this is not a brand new debate. This is a debate that has been going on in this body over a period of time, dating back to 1980 when we first started the renewable resource of ethanol as a supplement to gasoline. 
   Now, this isn't just a recent health issue because of California and what the Governor of California has done to phase out MTBE, the poisonous product in their State. The Governor has already made that decision. 
   But I have given evidence on the floor in this body, in previous debates on this issue, where people using MTBE in Alaska got sick and the Governor had to ask for waivers. I think I also produced evidence in those previous debates regarding a similar situation in the State of New Jersey, just as an example. 
   I think it has been well established that this does not just come from leaky gasoline tanks leaking into the underground water. It has been presented very clearly that this product also is emitted into the air and because of rainfall finds its way into our water supply. 
   In my State of Iowa, the legislature has banned MTBE. My State banned its use in the last legislative session. The Governor of California has also moved to phase the poison out of its fuel. While we have been moving forward on this issue, the debate tonight might appear new to many of my colleagues. To those colleagues it might make sense to study this more, to let the committees make the proper decisions. But there are numerous state legislatures that have made the conclusion that MTBE should be banned. I hope we will favorably consider the Boxer amendment because I think it is very legitimate that we immediately move forward on this issue.  
   Obviously, my State of Iowa, as the No. 1 corn-producing State in the Nation, will benefit if this poisonous product is phased out. I stand guilty of promoting ethanol. But it is not fair to say that just because you as the traveling public--and every one of you in this body owns an automobile--who pull up to the gasoline pump and pay a little bit less gas tax because a portion of your gasoline is ethanol which doesn't have the Federal gas tax in it, that this is a subsidy. The word ``subsidy'' implies that there is money paid out of the Federal Treasury to somebody to use that product. That is not true. Do we want to raise the tax on people motoring? Then do away with the ethanol tax exemption and you would have it. 
   I think we have the arguments on our side. I think it is going to be easy to cloud the issue and claim this needs to be studied. Remember, there are legislative bodies elsewhere in this country that have come to the conclusion that this has had enough study and that something as poisonous as MTBE should not be in the water.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on June 24 I announced that I had placed a hold on the nomination of Mr. Richard Holbrooke to be the new U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. At that time, I had indicated that it was not a personal dispute with Mr. Holbrooke, but that it was a signal to the State Department. The Department has been mistreating a whistle blower, Ms. Linda Shenwick. She had made protected financial mismanagement disclosures to Congress. Her disclosures led to the creation of an Inspector General at the U.N., as well as other management reforms and statutory requirements. 
   My interest in this matter is simple. Congress cannot function as an institution if government employees cannot  communicate with Congress about wrongdoing. And the executive branch should not be allowed to shoot the messenger with impunity. I am simply trying to get the two parties to return to the negotiating table, where they had been up to as recently as two months ago, and arrive at a mutually agreed-upon new job for Ms. Shenwick. 
   Accordingly, I have placed a hold on three new nominees from the State Department. They are the following: A. Peter Burleigh as Ambassador to the Philippines; Carl Spielvogel as Ambassador to the Slovak Republic; and, J. Richard Fredericks as Ambassador to Switzerland. 
   In addition to these new holds, I have taken additional steps which I choose not to disclose at this time. They are designed to increase my and other interested colleagues' ability to insist that Ms. Shenwick be treated fairly. Several of my colleagues have indicated a desire to assist me on my further endeavors. 
   My interest, as I said, was not with Mr. Holbrooke. I intend to vote for him. My interest is, and has been from the beginning, in making sure the process for Ms. Shenwick remains fair. It became evident to me that the Secretary of State was not out of sorts with the hold-up of the Holbrooke nomination. Yet the hold accomplished some progress. 
   In the first place, the Department had long ignored a letter signed by nine United States Senators in October of last year, raising our concerns about its mistreatment of Ms. Shenwick. The Department did not even respond until June 30 of this year--eight months later. Since then, we have corresponded again, and I met with State Department attorneys through the good offices of my friend from Virginia, Senator Warner. 
   I also met with Administration officials and have engaged in useful dialogue. It has resulted in a more highly sensitized Administration as to the need for effective communications with the State Department to ensure fair treatment for Ms. Shenwick. These communications have produced one small yet positive step toward ensuring the fairest possible process. 
   In the meantime, I have chosen to increase my leverage by putting the holds on these three nominees. At the same time, I will release my hold on Mr. Holbrooke, satisfied that I have greater leverage, and the Administration's heightened awareness and assurances of a fair process.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered on this side of the aisle because I think it meets all the income deficiency needs of American agriculture pretty much in the same way as the Democrat proposal does, but it also does not spend money in a lot of other areas that do not meet the immediate needs of agriculture. 
   I have always thought of agriculture and the needs of food production and the process of food and fiber production in America as kind of a social contract between the 2 percent of the people in the United States who earn their livelihood in farming and the rest of the 98 percent of the people, as well as a social contract of the last 60 years of some Government involvement and some Government support of agriculture, particularly in times when income was very low. 
   Thinking of it as a social contract, then, I do not like to believe there is a Democrat way of helping farmers or a Republican way of helping farmers. I like to think of our being able to work together on this social contract pretty much the same way we work together on Medicare and Social Security--to get agreements when there are changes made in those programs. 
   In those particular programs--and, thank God, for most agricultural programs--there have not been dramatic changes over the years unless there has been a bipartisan way of accomplishing those changes. So, here we are, with a Democrat proposal and a Republican proposal. People watching this throughout the country, then, have their cynicism reinforced about how Congress does not cooperate. 
   While this debate has not been going on just today and yesterday but over the last 2 or 3 months, there was an assumption that there would be help for agriculture under almost any circumstances; it was just a question of how to do it and exactly how much. While this debate was going on, we have had different approaches, and it has brought us to a point where we have a Republican proposal and a Democrat proposal and we are talking past each other. I am hoping sometime before this debate gets over today and we have a final document to vote on, that we are able to get together in a Republican and Democrat way and have a bipartisan solution, at least for the essential aspects of the debate today, which is to have an infusion of income into agriculture considering that we have the lowest prices we have had in a quarter century. 
   I think there are two stumbling blocks to this. I think on the Democrat side the stumbling block to bipartisan cooperation is a belief among some of those Members that some of the money should find its way to the farmers through changes in the LDP programs as opposed to the transition payments. On our side, the stumbling block seems to be that we are locked into no more than $7 billion to be spent on the agricultural program. 
   So I hope somewhere along the line we can get a compromise on this side and a compromise on that side of those two points of contention. Hopefully, we on this side could see the ability to go some over $7 billion--and that the Democrats would see an opportunity to use the most efficient way of getting all the money into the farmer's pocket through the AMTA payments. 
   The reason for doing it that way is because we do have a crisis. The best way to respond to that crisis is through that mechanism because within 10 days after the President signs the bill, the help that we seek to give farmers can be out there, as opposed to a convoluted way of doing it through the LDP payment. 
   I do not know why we could not get a bipartisan compromise with each side giving to that extent--Republicans willing to spend more money and the Democrats willing to give it out in the way that most efficiently can be done. 
   So I see ourselves right now as two ships passing in the night, not speaking to each other. We ought to be able to get together to solve this. That is my hope. I know there are some meetings going on about that now. I'm part of some of those meetings. I hope they can be successful. 
   In the meantime, talking about helping the family farmer, I think it is very good to have a description of a family farm so we kind of know what we are talking about. I am going to give it the way I understand it in the Midwest, and not only in my State of Iowa. 
   But it seems to me there are three factors that are essential in a family farming operation: That the family makes all the management decisions; that the family provides all or most of the labor--that does not preclude the hiring of some help sometimes or maybe even a little bit of help for a long period of time; but still most of the labor being done by the family--and, thirdly, that the capital, whether it is self-financed or whether it is borrowing from the local bank or from another generation within the family, is controlled by the family farmer--the management by the family, the labor by the family, and the capital controlled by the family. 
   Some people would say: Well, you have a lot of corporate farms. I do not know what percent, but we do have corporate family farms. But that is a structure they choose to do business in, especially if they have a multigenerational operation to pass on from one generation to the other and want to with a little more ease. 
   In addition, some people would say: Well, you have a lot of corporate agriculture. You might have a lot of corporate agriculture in America, but I do not see a lot of corporate agriculture, at least in grain farming in my State of Iowa--mainly because most corporate people who want to invest their money do not get the return on land and labor through grain production that they normally want for a return on their money. Of course, that strengthens the opportunity to family farm. But at least when I talk about the family farmer, that is the definition that I use. 
   In my State, the average family farm is about 340 acres. We have about 92,000 farming units in my State. By the way, if we do not get this agricultural economy turned around, we are going to have a lot less than 92,000 in a few months, as well. 
   Nationwide, there are about 2 million family farming operations with an average acreage of about 500 acres. So the average family farm size nationally is bigger than in my State. But remember, whether you farm 10,000 acres as a cattle farmer in 
   Wyoming or 2,000 or 3,000 acres as a wheat farmer in Kansas or 350 as a corn, soybean, or livestock operation in my State of Iowa, it still is one job or maybe two jobs being created with all that capital investment. 
   Let me tell you, it takes a tremendous amount of capital--both machinery as well as land--to create one job in agriculture compared to a factory, and many times more than for a service job. So those are the family farmers I am talking about whom I want to protect. 
   Earlier in this debate there was some hinting about the problems of the farmers being related directly to the situation with the 1996 farm bill. I am not going to ever say that a farm bill is perfectly written and should never be looked at, but I think when you have a 7-year program, to make a judgment after 3 1/2 years that it ought to be changed, then what was the point in having a 7-year program in the first place? 
   It was that we wanted to bring some certainty for the family farmer without politics meddling in their business. A 7-year program was better than a 4- or 5- or 6-year program. So we wanted to bring some certainty to agriculture.  Obviously, a 7-year program does that more so than a shorter program. So a family farm manager would not have to always be wondering, as he was making decisions for the long term: Well, is Washington going to mess this up for me as so many times decisions made by bureaucrats in Washington have the ability to do? 
   So I am saying some people here are hinting at the 1996 farm bill being that way. Others of us are saying that the trade situation is the problem because farmers have to sell about a third of their product in export if they are going to have a financially profitable situation. 
   I want to quote from Wallaces Farmer, January 1998, in which there were tremendous prospects, even just 18 months ago, before the Southeast Asia financial crisis was fully known, for opportunities for exports to Southeast Asia. That situation for the farmer was further exacerbated by the problems in Latin America. So I want to quote, then, a short statement by a person by the name of John Otte: ``World financial worries rock grains.''  
   ``Expanding world demand, particularly in Asia, is the cornerstone of the case for continued strength in corn, wheat and soybean prices,'' points out Darrel Good, University of Illinois economist.  
   Quoting further from the article:  
   Asian customers bought 57% of our 1995-96 corn exports, 66% of our 1996-97 corn exports and almost 50% of our wheat exports in both years. They [meaning Asian markets] are important markets. No wonder Asian currency and stock market problems bring grain market jitters. 
   ``Signs of stability in Asian financial markets as central banks intervened to support currency values brought a sigh of relief to U.S. commodity markets,'' says Good. 
   ``Whether late fall problems represent an economic hiccup or the beginning of more serious problems is still unknown. However, the developments underscore the importance of Asian markets for U.S. crops.''  
   We know the end of that story. The end of that story is that we did have that collapse of markets. And it very dramatically hurt our prosperity in grains in the United States last year, and more so this year. 
   Now, just to put in perspective the debate today, because there is so much crepe-hanging going on, particularly from the other side of the aisle, there is a quote here by Michael Barone of the August 28, 1995, U.S. News and World Report. One sentence that will remind everybody about the greatness of our country and our ability to overcome some of the problems we face comes from an article called ``A Century of Renewal.'' It is a review of the 1900s. He says:  
   There is something about America that makes things almost always work out very much better than the cleverest doomsayers predict.  
   So for my colleagues, particularly those on the other side of the aisle who want to hang crepe and want to talk about the disastrous situation we are in right now, I do not want to find fault with their bringing to the attention of our colleagues the seriousness of that problem. But they should not leave the impression that there is no hope because this is America. We have gone through tough times before. All you have to do is remember 1985 and 1986 in agriculture and the 1930s in agriculture. Yet the American family farm that was the institution then--probably on average back in those days of only about 150 acres nationwide; today that is 500 acres nationwide--was a smaller operation, but remember, it was still run by the family farmer, the family making the management decisions, the family controlling the capital, and the family doing the labor. 
   Please remember that, even the most cleverest of doomsayers here today: Don't give up on America. Don't give up on American agriculture. Don't give up on the family farmer. We are in a partnership during the period of time of this farm bill. We have to meet our obligations, and that is what this debate is about. But this debate ought to be about hope for the family farmer as well. 
   I rise in support of our family farmers. Agriculture producers are in desperate need of immediate assistance. We need to find the best options available in these trying times. The Democrat proposal attempts to address the problems confronting our family farmers but, I think, falls short of our most important goal, which is providing assistance as quickly as possible. 
   I realize this disaster affects farmers all across the Nation, but at this moment I am most concerned about my friends and neighbors back home. I am concerned that the Democrat alternative, by tying revenue relief to the LDP payments, will delay the efficiency of delivering the payment, unlike the transition payment which is more efficient. 
   The Democratic alternative offers provisions that would have a long-term effect upon agriculture. I don't want anyone to misunderstand me on that point. There are many things we can do to improve the agricultural economy, but the task before us today is to develop and to pass a short-term relief package that we can get out to those in need as quickly as possible. 
   According to the Farm Service Agency's estimate, the transition payments provided to corn growers this year will pay out at a rate of 36 cents per bushel. The supplemental transition payment Republicans are offering will equal an additional 36-cent increase on every bushel of corn produced this year. That is 76 cents in assistance for Iowa family farmers, before you figure in any income through the loan deficiency payment. 
   As a Senator from my State of Iowa, I believe it is also particularly important to include language providing relief for soybean growers who are not eligible for the transition payments. That is why our proposal also contains $475 million in direct payments to soybean and other oilseed producers. I am proud to say that Iowa is No. 1 in the Nation in the production of soybeans, but our growers have been hard hit by devastatingly low prices. Prices for soybeans are the lowest they have been in nearly a quarter of a century, down from the $7-a-bushel range just a couple of years 
   ago to less than $4 today, which is way, way below the cost of production. That is why I and other Senators representing soybean-producing States wanted to make sure that soybean growers were not left out of any relief package. 
   Finally, the Democrat proposal falls short in another very important area. I think it undermines our U.S. negotiating objectives in the new multilateral trade negotiations that the United States will launch later this year. It will sharply weaken, and perhaps destroy, our country's efforts to limit the enormously expensive European Union production subsidies that make it impossible for our farmers to sell to the 540 million European consumers. 
   I will say a brief word on that point. First, the United States just presented four papers to the World Trade Organization in Geneva outlining U.S. objectives for the new agriculture negotiations starting this fall. The first of these papers deals with domestic support. It states that the United States negotiating objective with regard to domestic support is a negotiation that results in ``substantial reductions in trade-distorting support and stronger rules that ensure all production-related support is subject to discipline.'' 
   Production-related payments are by definition trade distorting. They are exactly the kind of payments that we want the European Union to get rid of. I don't know how we can enter into tough negotiations with Europeans, with their production payments our No. 1 negotiating target, while we boost our production-related payments at the same time, which is what is done with part of the money under the Democrat proposal. This would undermine our negotiators and give the Europeans plenty of reason to hang tough and to not give an inch. 
   My second point is closely related to the first. We will measure success at the new world trade talks based on how well we do at creating an open global trading system. The European Union's common agricultural policy nearly torpedoed world trade negotiations as early as 1990. The European Union later said it was reforming its common agriculture policy, but farm handouts this year in the European Union will reach $47 billion, nearly half of the entire European Union budget. Moreover, the largely production-based European Union subsidies still help those who least need help. Twenty percent of the European Union's richest farmers receive 80 percent of the common agriculture policy handout. 
   World farming is sliding deeper into recession with prices of some commodities at historic lows. Now is not the  time to give up on pressing the European Union hard to truly reform this vastly wasteful subsidy program in their continent. But that is exactly what we would end up doing if we go down the same road of tying part of these payments to production, as the Democrat alternative would do. 
   There are many enemies of agriculture market reform in the European Union who are just looking for any circumstance to justify their special pleading and to combat and counteract United States negotiators in order for the European Union to keep their production subsidies going. I am afraid that is exactly what the Democrat plan would do. I think as chairman of the International Trade Subcommittee, I have a responsibility to tell my colleagues this. 
   We should not hand the European Union an excuse to back away from real reform that opens the European Union's huge agricultural markets to American farmers. 
   The proposal that we pass today should be the fastest and most efficient option available to help our family farmers. The most important thing we can do today is to work towards providing emergency revenue relief to our farmers as quickly as possible. 
   It is for that reason I urge my colleagues to vote for our Republican alternative, to provide ample and immediate relief for hard-hit farmers, assuming we are not able to work out some sort of bipartisan agreement between now and that final vote. 
   I only ask, in closing, for people on the other side of the aisle who are criticizing the 1996 farm bill to remember that what we call the 1996 farm bill relates mostly to agricultural programs and totally to the subject of agriculture. We need to look beyond that basic legislation and realize there were a lot of things promised in conjunction with that farm bill through public policy that we have not given the American farmer, which makes it difficult to say we have fully given the American farmer--the family farmer--the tools he or she needs to manage their operation in the way they should. 
   Yes, we have given them the flexibility to plant what they want to plant without waiting for some Washington bureaucrat to do that. We have given them the certainty of a certain transition payment every year, from 1996 through the year 2002. We have told them, with the 7-year farm program, that they have 7 years where we are going to have some certainty, political certainty, in Washington of what our policies are. But we also promised them more trading opportunities. 
   We have not made the maximum use of the Export Enhancement Program so that we have a level playing field for our farmers. We have not given the President fast track trading authority so that in the 24 agreements that have been reached around the world among other countries we could have been at the table, and haven't been at the table, and that there is no President of the United States looking out for U.S. interests in those negotiations; and for the sake of the American farmer, we should be at some of those tables--at least those tables where agriculture is being talked about. 
   We have not given the farmer the regulatory reform that has been promised. And from the standpoint of taxes, we haven't given the farmer the opportunity, through the farmers savings account, to level out the peaks and valleys of his income by being able to retain 20 percent of his income to tax in a low-income year, so that he is not paying high taxes one year and no taxes another year. We haven't given him the ability to do income averaging without running into the alternative minimum tax. We haven't reduced the capital gains tax enough. And we still have the death tax, the estate tax, which makes a lot of family farmers who want to keep the farm in the family sometimes have to sell the farm to pay the inheritance tax, instead of keeping the family farm and passing it down from one generation to another. Sometimes, if they can't afford to do that, they either make their operation so inefficient that they close down business or else they have a terrific tax burden over them as well. 
   So here we have an opportunity to--in the spirit of the 1996 farm bill, when we told the farmers of America we were going to have a smooth transition over the next 7 years, we said to them we are going to set aside $43 billion for each of those next 7 years--not for each, but cumulative for those 7 years. This year, it is $5.6 billion. Well, we look back now, and in 1996 we did not anticipate the dramatic drop-off in exports because we could not have predicted the Southeast Asian financial crisis and the contagion that caught on in Latin America. So we are going back now, unapologetically, on keeping a promise to the family farmers that we are going to keep this smooth transition we promised them, and that is what the amount of money we are talking about here on the floor is all about.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, I had the good fortune of working with my esteemed colleague, the senior senator from Nevada, on an amendment restoring the exclusion for the receipt of contributions in aid of construction (CIAC) for water and sewage disposal property repealed by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. 
   I rise today to voice my concern about the possible direction of the Department of the Treasury's regulations interpreting the definition of CIAC under Internal Revenue Code section 118(b). Specifically, I am troubled by an effort to narrow the definition to exclude service laterals. 
   The Senator from Nevada and I, along with many of our colleagues here in the Chamber worked hard over the course of a number of years to restore the pre-1986 Act exclusion for the receipt of CIACs for water and sewage. As part of our efforts, we developed a revenue raiser in cooperation with the industry to make up any revenue loss due to our legislation. This revenue raiser extended the life, and changed the method, for depreciating water utility property from 20 year accelerated to 25 year straight line depreciation. As a consequence of this cooperation with the industry, our CIAC change made a net $274 million contribution toward deficit reduction. 
   In addition to these efforts, we made a number of changes to the pre-1986 language. The most important of these was a change to clarify that service laterals should be included in the definition of CIAC. 
   These lines typically run from a larger water distribution line to the property line of one or more customers. The utility is responsible for all maintenance and liability associated with service laterals. Additionally, state public utility commissions treat contributions for service laterals (or any other capital component of the water supply system) as a CIAC and, therefore, do not allow a utility company to include them in its rate base. 
   It is important to distinguish that service laterals are not fees charged to customers for the right to start and stop service. Such fees would be treated as taxable income. However, as elements of utility plant, the service laterals should be treated as CIAC. 
   Additionally, it is my sense that the final revenue estimate done by the Joint Committee on Taxation on the restoration of CIAC included service  laterals. In an October 11, 1995 letter to me the Joint Committee on Taxation provided revenue estimates for the CIAC legislation. A footnote in this letter states, ``These estimates have been revisited to reflect more recent data.'' The industry had only recently supplied the committee with comprehensive data, which reflected total CIAC in the industry including service laterals. 
   It is my sincere hope that the Department of the Treasury drafts the regulations on this important matter clearly reflecting the intent of Congress to include service laterals in the definition of CIAC.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have a Democrat alternative tax cut that is the weakest, least adventuresome effort to reduce taxes that you could ever expect which will do little good for anybody. 
   I call upon my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to be bold in trusting the American people with their money, to be bold in letting people keep money in their own pockets to spend. I ask the other side of the aisle to be as bold in tax policy, and to be as bold in reducing taxes as they are bold in wanting to spend the taxpayers' money. I would like to have them be as bold in reducing taxes as they are bold in their budget of this year to increase practically every program that has ever been thought of, and even establishing a lot of new programs to have Washington bureaucrats spend the additional money coming into the Federal Treasury. 
   They are not very bold when it comes to giving the taxpayers back their money, but they are very bold in saying how Washington can spend that money better than the taxpayers. They are very bold in increasing new programs and very bold, without using the words, but saying, in effect, that we in Washington know better how to spend the taxpayers' money than the taxpayers do. 
   How they like to quote Chairman Greenspan because of his respect, but also they only like to tell half of what Chairman Greenspan says. We have had an opportunity, as Senators, to hear Chairman Greenspan in so many different forums this year, just since the first of the year, talk about a surplus and what should be done with it. They would like to have you believe the only thing that Chairman Greenspan says is that he is against any tax cuts. 
   But what he does is give Congress several alternatives. Admittedly, he says that his first choice is to retire debt held by the public; 
   Next, to give tax reductions, because tax reductions are better than spending the money as the third alternative. 
   And particularly, Chairman Greenspan says, top priority ought to be given to cutting marginal tax rates. 
   Appearing just last week before the House Budget Committee, Chairman Greenspan reiterated his position by making clear, and I will give you this quote:  
   Only if Congress believes that the surplus will be spent rather than saved is a tax cut wise.  
   I think given the President's, and his party's, past and present propensity to want to spend all of the surplus--the President's budget not only spends all the surplus, the President's budget would take $30 billion from Social Security, and they have a $100 billion tax increase as well--with their propensity to spend all of it, and more than the surplus, it should be obvious that the congressional budget plan that is before us by the people on this side of the aisle is aligned very much with Chairman Greenspan's position. 
   I wish our friends on the other side of the aisle would speak in the same way when they say that this money is not in the bank, that it is only projected income--when they use that as an excuse that you can't give people a tax cut--they ought to not project the expenditure of that money as well. 
   Yet they are willing to be radical. They are willing to be risky when projecting expenditure of this money. But somehow it is wrong to give this money back to the people to spend because if the people keep this money in the first place, they don't send it to Washington, and it is going to create more jobs. It is going to turn many times over in the economy than would  otherwise be turned over in the economy if it were spent by Washington bureaucrats--creating jobs and creating wealth, if the taxpayers spend it, and just being poured down the black, bottomless pit if it is spent in Washington, DC. 
   We had a chart from the other side of the aisle that said what a great deal has happened since 1993 on reducing the deficit. But what is left out of that equation and that presentation is one of the greatest political revolutions that has come from the grassroots of America in an off-year election in the last 60 years. And that was that the people of this country for the first time in 40 years turned both Houses of Congress over to a Republican majority. 
   It was only after that Republican majority was elected that there were dramatic changes in budgeting with the caps, and even with a reduction of taxes in 1997 that brought the changes and the discipline to the Hill--even to the White House as well--that brought us to the place where we are today of talking about surpluses, because in the first 2 years of this administration their own budgets were projecting in the outyear deficits for a long, long time. But all of that was turned around when Republicans took over Congress, and started down the road of bringing surpluses and balancing the budget. 
   We are here to say that the Democrat tax decrease of $300 billion compared to our $792 billion is too puny to do the economic good that ought to be done. It is too puny to return political and economic freedom to the taxpayers of this country because the taxpayers will spend that money more wisely than if it is sent to Washington. 
   But we are also here to declare victory in the debate over whether we should give tax relief to the American people because they want us to believe with their amendment that they are for a tax cut. They are for a tax cut--a very small, puny tax cut. The President says now he is for a tax cut. 
   We have won somewhat of a victory in this year's debate. The 
   question now is not whether there should be tax relief, but what kind and how much? 
   As a Member of the majority party, I can't think of a better problem with which to be confronted. With a tax cut plan before us, we are proposing to finally start sending hard-earned dollars out of Washington and back to the taxpayers. 
   Most of the provisions of this bill are what the people from the grassroots of America have been telling their Congressmen and Senators they want done--and really want done--because we include those things in our bill: addressing the marriage penalty; providing health care tax relief; more help for education, pensions and savings; long-term care; child care; estate tax relief; and, most importantly, general relief for middle-income taxpayers. 
   Nearly all of the provisions that I and Senator FEINSTEIN introduced in S. 1160 are included in some form in the bill before us. I commend the chairman for taking the initiative and pushing major tax relief that people really want. And, by the way, even some Democrats supported it out of the Finance Committee. The President has only offered modest tax cuts. 
   This amendment is an example of it. Of course, in the process, as I indicated, he wants to raise taxes $100 billion in other ways in the process of giving a tax cut, because the President of the United States wants it both ways. He wants to be able to take credit for a tax cut on the one hand while he is raising taxes on the other hand. 
   Of course, he is sending out all of these frantic, hysterical veto threats. He attacked the House bill, playing the class warfare card that he plays so well, saying that it benefited the rich. Of course, he can't do that with a Senate bill. We saw that was not challenged on this point by people on the other side of the aisle, since 60 percent of the bill before the Senate helps families who are middle class and earning $75,000 or less. 
   Now the President and his minions are saying $792 billion in tax relief to the American people is too much. He is saying that either they don't need it--meaning they don't need the tax decrease--or he might even be saying they don't deserve it. He says this while asking for billions of dollars in new taxes to pay for even more spending while raiding the Social Security trust fund of $30 billion. 
   That is right. This President and his budget team raids Social Security to pay for more spending. He does this when taxes as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product are at an all-time high of around 21 percent. Historically, taxes have been around 18 to 19 percent of the Gross Domestic Product over the last 30- to 40-year-period of time. We restore that historical level. 
   The public at the grassroots has pretty much consented to pay--not every American would agree with that--but over 30 to 40 years, it has been about 18 to 19 percent. But now it is up to 21 percent. We propose that it be more like that historical rate of taxation, as it has been for a long time. 
   By contrast, the administration, in addition to providing puny tax relief, would have a debt of $200 billion more than what we will have if our budget is adopted. 
   We also protect Social Security and Medicare. 
   The congressional budget plan before the Senate provides a blueprint for savings. We are projecting a cumulative surplus of $3.4 trillion. This includes the surplus in the Social Security trust fund as well as the on-budget general fund surplus. Of the estimated $3.4 trillion surplus, Republicans are advocating in this budget saving $1.9 trillion to save Social Security. These are the funds which are estimated to come into the Social Security trust fund from the payroll tax. 
   Of course, the President of the United States in attacking our budget is dead wrong in saying we put tax cuts before Social Security, because we plan for Social Security very thoroughly. We have been trying to set up a lockbox so no one will be able to get at that money and spend it. However, we have not met with much cooperation from the other side of the aisle on saving Social Security. I have lost track of the number of times since the first of the year we have had cloture votes on our Republican lockbox proposal. This is truly unfortunate. If we don't create a Social Security lockbox, we are going to end up spending the money for everything else but Social Security. Even the President has said he is in favor of a lockbox, but his actions fall far short of his rhetoric. 
   The tax cut we are talking about today is $792 billion. This is less than 25 percent of the total cumulative surplus of $3.4 trillion. A lot of our taxpayers say even $792 is not a bold enough tax cut. It is even less than the $1 trillion that will accumulate on the on-budget surplus. There is money left over, $505 billion to be exact, to take care of problems with the Medicare system and provide additional funds for discretionary spending. 
   In our budget resolution, we provide $180 billion for increased discretionary spending after the budget caps expire in the year 2002. That still leaves $325 billion to help solve Medicare problems and spending for domestic priorities. 
   Over the next 10 years the Federal Government will take in nearly $23 trillion in all taxes. That is a lot of money. This bill gives $792 billion back to the American taxpayers. That still leaves $22 trillion in revenue that the Government will spend. The tax cut we are talking about is only 3.5 percent, 3.5 pennies out of every $1 coming into the Federal Treasury over the next 10 years. I am a little embarrassed to tell the taxpayers we are only giving a tax cut of 3.5 percent from all the money the Federal Government will take in over the next 10 years. That is three times what the other side of the aisle would return to the taxpayers. 
   The congressional budget plan will save 75 percent of the surplus projected by the CBO over the next 10 years. In contrast, the President saves only 67 percent. The President is proposing a $95 billion tax increase. 
   We continually ask the American taxpayers to trust us as legislators. There isn't a day that goes by without us asking for that support from our constituents. Now it seems to me it is time to return trust to the American taxpayers. It is time to trust the American taxpayers with a little bit of their own money--3.5 percent of all the money coming in over the next 10 years. 
   The latest challenge from the other side of the aisle is reflected in the Democrat substitute before the Senate. I suppose it could be called a tax ``scratch'' instead of calling it a tax cut because it is that puny. Even a number of Democrats are scoffing at  such a weak effort. It is less than $300 billion over 10 years. It does not even have a rate cut for middle-income taxpayers. It does not even get rid of the unfair marriage penalty that affects millions of taxpayers. Compared to our tax bill, it delays the 100-percent deductibility for self-employed health insurance and in the process hurts small business and farmers. 
   The Democrat plan only provides half of the assistance the Republican plan provides for people who need to purchase their own 
   health insurance. The Clinton-Gore team and their lockstep followers in Congress do not think that the tax rate the average American pays is too much. We all know what their record has been. We all know the Clinton-Gore tax increase of 1993 was the largest ever in the history of the United States. I have heard some Members, in defense of their support of this massive tax increase, try to argue that this is what brought about the current surpluses. 
   This is a revisionist history that has risen to some sort of art form on the floor of the Senate today. First, the Clinton-Gore tax increase was supposed to raise $240 billion. Of course, this is less than the $290 billion they now say they want to give back in this substitute amendment. 
   However, the Clinton-Gore tax increase never raised the money it was supposed to raise. The revenue increase that did come in is due to the private sector economic engine and did so despite all of the shackles this administration has placed on business through both tax increases and unprecedented regulation. 
   In addition, $40 billion of this new revenue can be attributed to the capital gains tax reduction that the Republican Congress passed in 1997. The administration argued this tax reduction would cost revenue, but the Wall Street Journal has said this has brought in $40 billion more. So most of the arguments on the other side of the aisle are just plain wrong. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senator BURNS introducing legislation to expand the student loan interest deduction. Specifically, my bill will repeal the sixty-month payment limitation and increase the income levels qualifying students for the tax deduction for student loan interest. I previously presented the elimination of the sixty-month student loan deductibility restriction in a bill in February. As a member of the Finance Committee, I have asked that both it and the income limit expansion I now propose be included in the Reconciliation bill that will be before the Senate this week. I am happy to report that both are in the committee reported bill. 
   In a move detrimental to the education of our nation's students, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated the tax deduction for student loan interest. Deeply troubled that this important relief was no longer available to young women and men trying to start their careers, since 1987 my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and I have sought to ease the heavy burden of paying back student loans by reinstating the tax deduction. In 1992, we succeeded in passing legislation to restore the deduction for student loan interest, only to be stymied by a veto as part of a larger bill with tax increases. After ten arduous years, our persistent work on behalf of America's students finally came to fruition when we succeeded in reinstating the deduction under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. Our victory demonstrated Congress' sincere commitment to making educational opportunities available to all students and families across the nation, and confirmed our willingness to assist young Americans in acquiring the best education possible by easing the financial hardship they face. 
   While our endeavors in 1997 were progressive, we were unable to go as far as we wanted to go due to financial constraints. Because the nation was still in a fiscal crisis at that time, we were compelled to limit the deductibility of student loan interest to sixty payments, and to only those taxpayers with an adjusted gross income of between $40,000 and $55,000 filing individually or between $60,000 and $75,000 for married couples. Additionally, the deduction itself was phased in at $1000, and will cap out at $2500 in 2002. 
   In keeping the income limits for the deduction at such low income levels, we are letting a great opportunity to assist more young Americans pass us by. Setting the income cap at the current low mark does a disservice to some of our nation's most needy collegiate borrowers. A great number of students are forced to borrow heavily to acquire an education that will allow them to stay competitive in our global economy. The present income restriction punishes resourceful students who land jobs which pay salaries slightly above the meager cap, even though they may have been forced to borrow heavily to obtain their education due to limited means. 
   Currently, the deductibility of student loan interest is limited to a mere sixty loan payments, equivalent to five years plus time spent in forbearance or deferment. This payment limitation, like the income restriction, was put in place during our fiscal difficulties of 1997. Since we are now experiencing a great budget surplus with our booming economy, Congress now has the ability to expand on both of these areas where previously we were forced to scale back. As mentioned, I already introduced a bill, S. 471, that would eliminate the 60-month limit on student loan interest reductions. 
   Fortunately, our situation today is quite different than when we made our original improvements in 1997. Now, with our robust economy and budget surplus, we have a splendid opportunity to do what we were unable to do before. As the price of going to college has continued to spiral upward, student debt has risen to appalling levels. We must not shrink from our responsibility to provide additional relief to our students. We should repeal the sixty-month payment limitation. We should increase the income levels from $40,000 to $50,000 for single students, and, eliminating any marriage penalty, increase from $60,000 to $100,000 for married couples. The amount of the deduction would then be gradually phased out for taxpayers with incomes between $50,000 and $65,000 filing individually and between $100,000 and $115,000 for married couples. Let our actions clearly demonstrate that the United States Congress stands behind  all of our nation's students in their efforts to better their lives. 
   By expanding the student loan interest deduction, we will bring vital relief to some of our most deserving borrowers seeking the American dream. Rather than penalizing resourceful students who find jobs with incomes above the present cap, we will be rewarding the hard work and ingenuity of our students. We must continue to support young Americans who land jobs with salaries slightly above our current threshold yet still needing financial assistance. 
   Excessive student debt is a major problem for many students. As people in a position to help them, Congress must seek out more ways to be of service to our young people. In this time of economic plenty, it is our duty to invest in our students' education, for to do so is an investment in America's future. A well-deducted workforce is vital to maintain competitiveness in an ever-changing global economy. By broadening the income limits to receive the tax deduction for student loan interest, we demonstrate our commitment to education and maintaining the position of the United States at the pinnacle of the free world. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to relieve the excessive burdens on those trying to better themselves and their families through education by loosening the income limits to quality for the tax deduction for student loan interest payments and eliminating the sixty-month payment limitation.

   I say to Senators STEVENS and GREGG that Senators KYLE, DEWINE, KOHL, HAGEL, and I have offered a bill, the Rural Methamphetamine Use Response Act of 1999, that would provide additional funding to combat methamphetamine production and abuse, and for other purposes.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. I appreciate their efforts. I know that the subcommittee has allotted the Drug Enforcement Agency the tools it needs to properly wage the war on illegal drugs. I also know that the subcommittee has added personnel and resources to the western and central regions of the United States to focus primarily on the methamphetamine problems in those geographic regions of the country. However, as you may know, methamphetamine abuse and production across the United States has forced law enforcement agencies to address challenges that exceed the many years of experience of the State and local law enforcement personnel within such agencies. Methamphetamine affects smaller communities and rural areas disproportionately. In many cases, these communities lack the investigative and technical skills, and resources to confront major criminal gangs or the environmental hazards caused by meth product.

Since the Senator from New Hampshire is aware of the training challenges of state and local law enforcement agencies, the financial burden of meth cleanup, and the volatile properties of meth, from the funding provided to DEA for methamphetamine initiatives, I hope, where possible, that funding be set aside within the final bill directing DEA to establish a select cadre of Special Agents with Spanish language capabilities to work with local law enforcement agencies across the United States on matters relating to combating methamphetamine-related drug trafficking. I also ask within the funding allotment for methamphetamine training initiatives, funding for DEA staffing at appropriate training facilities for purposes of providing coherent, essential, and sustained clandestine laboratory training to State and local law enforcement personnel, and if possible, funding for DEA to provide these personnel with the skills necessary for clandestine laboratory recertification.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senator BREAUX in introducing the Health Care Fraud Control Act of 1999. This bill is an effective, efficient and economical way to fight fraud, waste and abuse in publicly funded health care programs. It takes a system that is successful in combating Medicaid fraud and expands its authority to pursue investigations in other federal programs when investigators uncover or suspect fraudulent or abusive activities. This bill is common sense. 
   State Medicaid Fraud Control Units have long been at the forefront of health care fraud enforcement. The Health Care Fraud Control Act would give these units the authority needed to investigate other fraud and abuse cases, including Medicare cases, at the same time as Medicaid cases. This bill, which will be introduced by Rep. RICK LAZIO (R-N.Y.) in the House, would streamline the enforcement process for anti-fraud agents, cutting down on bureaucracy and allowing investigators to pursue anti-fraud cases more efficiently. This bill is an important weapon in the war against health care fraud in the Medicaid and Medicare programs. 
   The streamlined effort would be especially effective in fighting nursing home fraud and neglect. Many times seniors are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid payments. Combined, these two programs cover the bulk of the cost of nursing home care in our country. When a nursing home receives both Medicare and Medicaid payments, the potential for fraud is much too high. As the law stands, even if a fraud control unit establishes a strong case showing Medicaid fraud and uncovers Medicare fraud at the same time, it must wait while various federal agencies investigate the Medicare side before the case can be prosecuted. 
   Any effort to combat fraud is critical. Medicaid's annual budget is $178 billion, and fraud cases can involve significant amounts of money. Meanwhile, improper payments through Medicare were $12.6 billion in Fiscal Year 1998. 
   Expanding the Medicaid anti-fraud units' jurisdiction will help us erode health care fraud. With billions of tax dollars wasted each year, we need every weapon we can find in the anti-fraud arsenal. We can't afford to waste a single health care dollar.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are all aware that drug use has decreased overall in the last 15 years. One of the principal reasons for this is that we were successful in slowing the rate of experimentation and use among our young people. However, drug use is up dramatically among the young in the general population. Children as young as eight and nine are being confronted with the decision of whether or not to try drugs. This raises the possibility of a new epidemic of use and addiction. As you know, much is already being done to help children make the right decision. Prevention education is provided by various anti-drug groups, but these groups can't be effective in their teachings if prevention education does not begin at home. It is vitally important that parents make the time to school their children on the dangers of drug use and abuse. 
   Throughtout the years, research has been done on whether or not kids listen to their parents. The fact is kids do listen. It is clear that parents have influence in the choices their children make. The problem is, when it comes to drugs and alcohol, not all parents see a need to influence their child's decision or are aware of how serious the problem is. Some are ambivalent about their own past use. Some are in denial about what's happening. And why is that? A survey by the Partnership for a Drug Free America shows that less than a quarter of the parents questioned even acknowledge the possibility that their child may have tried marijuana. Unfortunately, of those parents surveyed, 44 percent of their children actually did experiment with marijuana. If parents aren't aware of the reality of the situation, how can they prepare the 6 out of every 10 teenagers who are offered drugs each year. 
   The problem isn't that the parents don't care. It is that they don't know. Parents underestimate the reality of drugs. As a result, they seldom if every talk to their kids about drugs. According to a recent PRIDE survey, only 30 percent of students reported that their parents talked to them often or a lot about drugs. This seems unfortunate when we look at evidence that shows drug use 32 percent lower among kids who said their parents talked with them a lot about drugs. The harsh reality is that 94 percent of parents say they talked to their teens about drugs, yet only 67 percent of teens remembered those discussions. Even more disturbing is a public opinion poll by the American Medical Association that illustrates that 43 percent of parents believe children using drugs is a serious national crisis, yet only 8 percent believe it is a crisis in their local schools, and 6 percent in their local communities. 
   Today, on behalf of Senators DEWINE, SESSIONS, and COVERDELL, I am introducing legislation that would bridge the gap between parents and the realities of youth drug use and abuse. The Drug Free Families Act would promote prevention education for parents. The goal is to promote cooperation among current national parent efforts. The kind of parent collaboration that the Drug Free Families Act proposes would unite parents at the national level to work with community anti-drug coalitions in the fight against drugs. It would not only help to educate parents, but help them convey a clear, consistent, no-use message. Through the Drug Free Families Act, we can give parents the resources necessary to educate our youth on the dangers of drugs. 
   It is clear that parents need assistance in educating kids on drug use and abuse. Parents, not Government, are the key to addressing the drug problem. We need to help them. I urge my fellow Members to support the Drug Free Families Act. 
   From my own experience in my State of Iowa, holding, as I did in 1998, more than 30 town meetings on the issue of drugs, one of the things I learned from the young people--junior high and high school young people who came to my meeting--was, in their own words, a statement on their part of somewhat frustration with their own families, that their families were not telling them about the dangers of drugs. There was even the suggestion from some young people that what we need is a parent education project so parents would be better at setting boundaries for kids, the necessity of listening to kids, but most importantly on the issue of drugs: As a parent, get the message out to young people about the dangers of drugs. 
   I got the feeling very definitely from young people of my State that they knew more about drugs, even more about the dangers of drugs and the availability of those drugs, than their parents do. I think the surveys I have pointed out today to justify the Drug Free Families Act justify and back up what the young people of my State of Iowa told me in those hearings last year.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in introducing the Bipartisan Social Security Reform Act of 1999. 
   We have crafted a responsible plan to save Social Security for generations to come. By making incremental, steady changes to the Social Security system, we will be able to ensure the long-term solvency of the program without taking Draconian measures. 
   Not only have we designed a responsible plan, but a bipartisan plan as well. No change to the Social Security system can be made without support from both sides of the aisle. Our bill represents a true bipartisan effort to save Social Security. The Bipartisan Social Security Reform Act is co-sponsored by four Republicans and three Democrats. Similar legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressmen KOLBE and STENHOLM. This bipartisan, bicameral support is an excellent foundation on which to build, ensuring that the basis of the American retirement system remains financially sound for future generations. 
   The bipartisan plan would maintain a basic floor of protection through a traditional Social Security benefit, but two percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax would be redirected to individual accounts. Individuals could invest their personal accounts in any combination of the funds offered through the Social Security system. An individual who invested his or her personal account in a bond fund would receive a guaranteed interest rate. However, individuals who wish to pursue a higher rate of return through investment in a fund including equities could do so. 
   Our proposal would eliminate the need for future payroll tax increases by advance funding a portion of future benefits through personal accounts. With individual accounts, we provide Americans with the tools necessary to build financial independence in retirement--especially to those who previously had limited opportunities to create wealth. Under our plan, they will be able to save for retirement and benefit from economic growth. 
   In putting together this legislation, this group has been conscious of how changes to Social Security would affect different populations. One group that I have been particularly concerned about is women. Let me explain how our bill addresses women's needs: 
   Women are more likely to move in and out of the workforce to care for children or elderly parents. They should not be punished for the time that they dedicate to dependents. Our proposal provides five ``drop-out'' years to the spouse with lower earnings in every two-earner couple. 
   Women, on average, earn less than men. The Bipartisan Social Security Reform Act would ensure that workers with wages below the national average would receive an additional $100 contribution annually to their personal accounts when they make a contribution of at least $1. Any subsequent contributions would receive a dollar-for-dollar match so that all workers would be guaranteed a minimum contribution of one percent of the taxable wage base. For this year, that contribution would be $726. Furthermore, all wage-earners would be permitted to save up to an additional $2,000 annually through voluntary contributions to personal accounts. 
   In addition, our proposal creates an additional bend point to the benefit formula to boost the replacement rate for low-income workers, many of whom are women. 
   Women live longer than men. At age 65, men are expected to live 15 more years, whereas women are expected to live almost 20 more. Our proposal addresses that reality by allowing money accumulated in individual accounts to be passed on to surviving spouses and children. Furthermore, our proposal would increase the widow's benefit to 75 percent of the combined benefits that a husband and wife would be entitled to based on their own earnings. 
   Congressional Republicans and Democrats and the administration all have established saving Social Security as a top priority. Now we must move ahead with the process and provide leadership. Each year that we wait to enact legislation to save Social Security, the changes must be more pronounced to make up for the lost time. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Bipartisan Social Security Reform Act.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is a Democratic leadership war on health insurance coverage. This is their proposal to subject employer-sponsored health plans, and thus employers, to lawsuits. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have worked for tort reform throughout my tenure in Washington. I believe our tort system is badly broken, so it will come as no surprise that I have grave reservations about sending more disputes into it. 
   First, the big picture: The proliferation of lawsuits has damaged the efficiency, effectiveness and integrity of America's civil justice system. Almost as bad, it is injuring the nation's economy. Now, our Democratic colleagues propose to declare a ``new gold rush'' for the legal industry, this time in the area of health insurer liability. And the harm that results from doing so will not be limited to our judiciary or our economy--it will harm our health. It's downright unhealthy for America. Is that an overstatement, Mr. President? Well, people with health insurance are likely to have better health than those without it. If the Democrats are now saying that insurance coverage doesn't affect health status, then they'll have to explain why they keep coming up with all kinds of ideas on how to insure people. Five years ago, they thought insurance coverage was important--so much so that they wanted the government to insure everyone. Of course, even with a Democratic President and Democratic control of both Houses of Congress, they didn't manage to do it. It's funny how we don't hear about that effort anymore, but it's certainly not because we solved the problem. 
   The President acknowledged the problem of the uninsured again when he proposed to allow people under age 65 to buy their way into the Medicare program. By the way, with a hefty subsidy from other Americans under age 65 who pay payroll taxes. Why does the President propose this unless he thinks insurance coverage will improve peoples' health status. Health insurance coverage is not an end unto itself, but a means to an end, and the end is better health. So when the Democrats propose things that will lessen health insurance coverage, and thus harm the health of the American people, we need to ask why. 
   Some argue that liability laws are a good way to guarantee quality of care. We're certainly not hearing much from the other side in this debate about quality, but objective people think that ensuring quality of care should be the point of patient protection. I care a great deal about health care quality, let me tell you about research that has been done in the context of medical malpractice. These studies, particularly the well-known Harvard study, tell us that the medical liability system is simply not an effective way to ensure quality. There is a tremendous mismatch between incidents of malpractice, on one hand, and the lawsuits that are brought, on the other. For many reasons, instances of substandard medical care often do not give rise to lawsuits, while many lawsuits that are brought are groundless. In the malpractice context, it is not feasible to have immediate appeals of physicians' decisions when they make them, so we're stuck with the tort system. 
   But when we talk about insurance coverage decisions, we do have an alternative to lawsuits. We can have immediate, independent, external reviews of these decisions. We can do better than lawsuits after-the-fact. That's what our Republican Patients' Bill of Rights will do. It will get patients' claims decided when the patient needs the care. Isn't that the best thing for the patient? Yes--but it's not the best thing for the lawyers, and that's why we're here today. 
   Mr. President, the other day, I heard a Senator note that only a handful of medical malpractice cases have ever been tried to a jury in his state. His point, apparently, was the lawyers don't really bring lawsuits: just a myth. Well, I am certain that the former trial lawyers in this body understand that defendants in cases sometimes pay out money in settlement of a claim, whether the claim was well-founded or not. Where do my colleagues believe that the money comes from? It comes out of the pockets of the people who buy tht good or service, obviously. 
   In medical malpractice cases, the cost of medical settlements, just like the cost of jury verdicts, is paid for by you and me. We pay in two ways: higher prices for medical services, and higher insurance premiums. When my friends on the other side say that creating a right to sue health plans somehow will not bring about more lawsuits, they should pay more attention to what their trial lawyer allies are up to. Who knows, maybe if they took a look at what trial lawyers are doing to our economy, they'd have second thoughts about supporting them all the time. 
   Let's see what an objective source says. The Congressional Budget Office has noted that the lawsuit provision of the Democrat proposal is, by far, the most expensive single item in their bill. More than anything else they are proposing, this liability piece is what will drive people out of their insurance  coverage into the ranks of the uninsured. That's a high price to pay to keep the lawyers happy. 
   Employers are not required by law to offer health insurance coverage to their employees. There are tax advantages for employers to do so, but we're finding that those aren't enough. More and more employees are dropping coverage for their employees. That's not an opinion, that's a fact. My friends across the aisle have repeatedly noted that many liberal advocacy groups support their version of patient protections. Those groups have every right to get involved in this debate, and I'm glad that they are. But my point is that most Americans don't work for liberal advocacy groups. In fact, very few do. I'll also note that most Americans don't work for plaintiffs' law firms. 
   Even if you're anti-business, you have to admit that businesses provide health insurance coverage to most Americans, and businesses are in a position to discontinue that coverage. The businesses that most Americans do work for, both large and small, are telling us that the Democratic bill will force many of them to drop coverage for employees; hence adopt the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights instead. 
   Let's keep our eye on the ball. There are two goals that we should be trying to achieve. One is to ensure that people get the appropriate health care to which they are entitled under their insurance coverage. But the 2nd goal is to avoid taking that very insurance coverage away. There are many times in politics when it's impossible to achieve two goals at the same time, but we can this time. We have a Republican approach that achieves both goals. I call on my colleagues to support this approach, and to resist the temptation to join the other side's war on health insurance coverage.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to support this amendment with my colleagues, Senator COLLINS, Senator SESSIONS, and others. This amendment will offer freedom of choice to millions of Americans and will ensure they have access to a wide range of providers. 
   Our amendment would provide individuals with the option of choosing a point-of-service plan when no such option exits. I support this because I want to give people choice and the ability to go out of network if they need to. They may have to pay more for this freedom, but they should at least have this protection if they want it. 
   I have been a long-standing supporter of the point-of-service option. This provision was part of my Medicare patients' bill of rights in 1997. I also supported a similar amendment offered by Senator HELMS on the Senate floor several years ago. 
   I believe people should have this option when they are willing to pay for it. Point-of-service provides people with the security of insurance coverage to see providers outside the plan if they need to. Many people are will to pay for this extra security. But for people who don't want to pay for this, they won't have to. They can choose another plan that better suits their needs. 
   In addition, this amendment ensures that managed care plans do not discriminate against any class of providers, such as chiropractors or optometrists. This is important to patients because it ensures they have access to certain providers or services they prefer who may be left out of the network. Classes of providers, who are not medical doctors, are sometimes excluded from participating in managed care plans to restrict patients' access to their services. Our amendment would ensure this does not happen by prohibiting plans from discriminating against any class of providers who are licensed to practice in their state. 
   This amendment is about choice, freedom, and security. It is about allowing patients to choose a plan or provider that best meets their health care needs. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will vote in favor of these very important patient protections.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. I commend the leadership, Senator LOTT and Senator NICKLES, and the minority leader, Senator DASCHLE, for coming to an agreement to bring this very important legislation, the Patients' Bill of Rights, to the Senate floor for debate. I know this is a politically charged issue, but I believe there is enough in common on both sides of the aisle to pass a good, strong, bipartisan bill. At the end of the day, we can have legislation that will provide patients with the necessary protections they want, and deserve, without driving up the cost of insurance so high that we add to the number of uninsured. 
   Many of the provisions in the bills that have been introduced during this Congress and last Congress are similar to provisions I put forth in my Medicare patient bill of rights bill or S. 701, which was adopted as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The cornerstone of my Medicare legislation was an expedited appeals process with a strong independent external review procedure and user-friendly, comparative consumer information so Medicare enrollees could make informed choices about their health plan options. Although the Medicare program already had an external review process, there were problems with the timeliness of reviews, particularly in urgent situations where a patient's health was in jeopardy. My bill codified the appeals process to ensure that these situations would be rectified. Independent reviews would be completed in 72 hours when considered urgent and 30 days for non-urgent situations. 
   My legislation also addressed another problem with the Medicare program. The program did not offer enrollees clear, concise, and detailed information about health plan choices and beneficiary rights in managed care. As more and more plans entered the Medicare market, it became increasingly clear that beneficiaries needed access to detailed, objective information about their options and about the protections they have under the Medicare program. S. 701 included new requirements for the program to provide enrollees comparative and user-friendly consumer information that became the foundation for the National Medicare Beneficiary Education program that is in existence today. 
   In addition to the expedited appeals process and the consumer information program, S. 701 contained other items like prohibiting gag clauses in Medicare managed care contracts, offering a point-of-service option, and assuring access to specialists when medically necessary. Not all of these provisions were included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, but I am proud to say most were and, as a result, Medicare beneficiaries enjoy these rights today. 
   Senator JEFFORDS' bill reported out of committee, and the Republican leadership bill, S. 300, also share many of the patient protections I advanced for Medicare for individuals currently insured under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). While there have been some who have criticized the Republican bill for not covering all insured individuals, the reality is most individuals are covered under state consumer protections. However, for the 48 million people who are solely covered under ERISA, our bill would provide them similar protections to what most individuals enjoy today under their state laws. Furthermore, our bill would extend the two most fundamental and important protections to all employer-sponsored plans--an appeals process with a strong external review mechanism, and detailed, user-friendly consumer information so that individuals can make the best health plan choice possible for their needs. Our bill would not duplicate state regulation, thus avoiding unnecessary costs and regulatory burdens for employers. These costs ultimately get passed on in the form of lower wages, reduced health benefits, and fewer jobs. 
   To argue that the cost of this additional regulatory burden, and I might add this unnecessary cost, is worth it because everyone should have the same federal protections is short-sighted and just plain wrong. Health insurance coverage is a benefit that Americans want and desperately need. It is a benefit that employers voluntarily provide. If we require that all plans, even those already regulated by the state, be subjected to any new federal law, we will increase the cost of providing health insurance coverage. There is no dispute here. We have the figures from the Congressional Budget Office. In fact, the CBO provided us with a breakdown of the cost of each new patient protection. And guess what? The costs go up as we mandate more government regulation. This is not rocket science, this is common sense. 
   We need to ask ourselves as members of the Senate if we want to jeopardize the health insurance coverage of hard-working Americans for our own political and personal gain. We have guaranteed health insurance, so we don't need to worry about losing our coverage. But what about the voters, the people we are supposedly trying to help with this bill: 
   Should we pass this bill without regard to the cost or the impact it will have on people's coverage? 
   Should we be telling our constituents who are content with their health plan that the cost doesn't matter because what matters most is helping people who were harmed by their managed care plan? 
   Should our response be to folks back home that they should be willing to pay more for protections they already have under state law so that the federal government can step in to do what the states are already doing? 
   In addition to the rise in premiums patient protections will most certainly cause, the private sector is now predicting health care costs will increase even further than anticipated. A recent survey released by a human resources consulting firm indicates health insurers and health plan administrators expect HMO costs to increase 6 percent. Point-of-service plans are expected 
   to rise 7.7 percent. According to a General Accounting Office (GAO) report, a 6 percent premium increase will result in approximately 1.8 million Americans losing their health insurance. This is without Congress taking any action. If the Democrats had their way, we would  be adding another 5 to 6 percent on top of the 6 percent increase already projected. What good are patient protections when you don't have any health insurance? And the costs of higher insurance premiums are not only measured by the loss of coverage. Families will have to make choices between a better education for their children; preparing for retirement; starting a business; or simply affording to each out on occasion just to pay their higher premiums to keep their health care coverage. 
   The survey goes on to cite reasons for these higher than expected premium increases. At the top of the list of reported reasons is new state and federal mandates. Do not be mistaken. The impact of increased regulation is real. And the cost is far greater than some monetary figure or percentage increase can possibly demonstrate. We are talking about peoples' health insurance coverage, and ultimately their health. For research has shown there is a direct correlation between a person's health and whether that person has insurance. 
   The Republican bill attempts to target protections where no state protections exist under ERISA. It provides two fundamental federal protections to all employer-sponsored plans. One of these provisions, which will offer patients the ability to solve disputes with managed care plans, is the appeals process. This provision, in my estimation, would solve many of the problems people experience with their managed care plans. This approach, unlike the Democratic approach, would provide assistance to the patient when they need it the most--at the time when care is needed. What good is it to know you can sue your health plan when your health has already been harmed or worse yet, you are dead? What good is to sue when most of the money ends up in the hands of trial lawyers? 
   Our bill would allow for any dispute regarding medical necessity decisions or a treatment determined to be experimental by the plan to be appealed to an external independent review board. This board would be made up of medical experts in the area of dispute. The appeals process would be timely, independent, and binding on the health plan. Patients would get health care when they need it, not a lawsuit after its too late. 
   The other new Federal protection that is fundamental to consumer choice is the availability of consumer information. The Republican bill would establish new disclosure and detailed plan information requirements for all employer-sponsored plans. This information would be available to people to ensure they understand what their plan covers, how it defines medical necessity, what they should do when a dispute arises, and much, much more. This provision will enable patients to make decisions about their health care and will create greater competition among health plans to provide quality care and service. 
   Throughout this debate we must remember what the purpose of this legislation is. We must not let rhetoric cloud our judgment about what will truly benefit patients and not special interest groups. We must remember this debate is about patients; not trial lawyers; not doctors; and not bureaucrats in Washington. We need to act responsibly to pass a bill that will provide meaningful patient protections while preserving the health insurance coverage of millions of hard-working Americans. Again, I ask the fundamental question we must consider. What good is a patient bill of rights when you don't have insurance? 
   Republicans and Democrats agree on a number of issues that really matter to our constituents. We should be able to pass a bipartisan bill with those provisions we all support. Both sides may have to compromise. But that is part of making the legislative process work. I ask my colleagues to remember on whom this debate should focus on. Let us not forget, it is the patients' bill of rights.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to support Senator COLLINS' amendment that addresses several important areas. In particular, I am glad to support the provision to allow a 100% above the line tax deduction for the long-term care insurance. 
   As chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, addressing the challenges of long-term care have been high on my list of priorities. During the past two years, I've heard first-hand from individuals and family members about the financial challenges that go along with managing long-term care needs, such as those associated with Alzheimer's Disease. 
   In too many cases, families experience financial devastation when faced with long-term care needs. Unfortunately, many families do not plan for costs associated with long-term care. And many families are mis-informed about what Medicare and Medicaid cover in respect to long-term care. 
   Today's average cost of nursing home care is about $40,000 a year. When individuals are faced with a chronic or disabling condition in retirement, they often quickly exhaust their resources. As a result, they turn to Medicaid for help. 
   In fact, the care for nearly 2 out of every 3 nursing home residents is paid for by Medicaid. As many seniors realize too late, Medicare does not cover long-term care costs. 
   I introduced legislation last Congress and again this Congress to provide an incentive for individuals to plan and prepare for long-term care cost. Like the provision in Senator COLLINS' amendment, my bill will allow Americans--who do not currently have access to employer subsidized long-term care plans--to deduct the amount of such a plan from their taxable income. 
   This encourages planning and personal responsibility by helping to make long-term care insurance more affordable for middle class taxpayers. 
   Longer and healthier lives are a blessing and a testament to the progress and advances made by our society. But Americans must be alert and prepare for long-term care needs. The role of private long-term care insurance is critical in meeting this challenge. Over the past ten years, the  long-term care insurance market has grown significantly. The products that are available today are affordable and of high quality. 
   As policy makers, our job is to develop policies for public programs that can deliver efficient and cost-effective services. Yet, equally important is the role of private long-term care financing. We must take steps to inform Americans about the importance of planning for potential long-term care needs. And, in turn, we should provide incentives now for the families to prepare financially for their retirement.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, on behalf of myself and my colleague, Senator TORRICELLI, I am introducing legislation, the Medical Savings Account Improvement Act of 1999, which would make it possible for any individual to purchase a medical savings account and which would liberalize existing law authorizing medical savings accounts in a number of other respects. 
   Medical savings accounts are a good idea, Mr. President. They are basically IRAs--an idea everybody understands--which must be used for payment of medical expenses. 
   The widespread use of medical savings accounts should have several beneficial consequences. 
   They should reduce health care costs. Administrative costs should be lower. Consumers with MSAs should use health care services in a more discriminating manner. Consumers with MSAs should be more selective in choosing providers. This should cause those providers to lower their prices to attract medical savings account holders as patients. 
   Medical savings accounts can also help to put the patient back into the health care equation. Patients should make more cost-conscious choices about routine health care. Patients with MSAs would have complete choice of provider. 
   Medical savings accounts should make health care coverage more dependable. MSAs are completely portable. MSAs are still the property of the individual even if they change jobs. Hence, for those with MSAs, job changes do not threaten them with the loss of health insurance. 
   Medical savings accounts should increase health care coverage. Perhaps as many as half of the more than 40 million Americans who are uninsured at  any point in time are without health insurance only for four months or less. A substantial number of these people are uninsured because they are between jobs. Use of medical savings accounts should reduce the number of the uninsured by equipping people to pay their own health expenses while unemployed. 
   Medical savings accounts should promote personal savings. Since pre-tax monies are deposited in them, there should be a strong tax incentive to use them. 
   Mr. President, our bill would do several things: 
   First, it would repeal the limitations on the number of MSAs that can be established. 
   Second, it stipulates that the availability of these accounts is not limited to employees of small employers and self-employed individuals. 
   Third, it increases the amount of the deduction allowed for contributions to medical savings accounts to 100 percent of the deduction. 
   Fourth, it permits both employees and employers to contribute to medical savings accounts. 
   Fifth, it reduces the permitted deductibles under high deductible plans from $1,500 in the case of individuals to $1,000 and from $3,000 in the case of couples to $2,000. 
   Finally, the bill would permit medical savings accounts to be offered under cafeteria plans.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the unfortunate expiration of the section 45 tax credit on June 30 for electricity produced from alternative energy sources. In response, I am introducing legislation to extend and expand the credit to help sustain the public benefits derived from these sources. As many of my colleagues know, I authored the section 45 credit in the Senate and it was included in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. I am being joined in this bipartisan effort today by Senator MURKOWSKI and Senator HARKIN. 
   Earlier this year, I introduced S. 414 to extend the wind energy portion of section 45, which has been extremely successful. The purpose of today's bill is to extend and expand the biomass portion of section 45 to include technologies such as biomass combustion and cofiring biomass with coal-fired facilities. Formerly, section 45 only allowed the use of closed-loop biomass, which has proven to be unworkable. Consequently, the biomass aspect of section 45 has never been utilized. The clean, controlled combustion of biomass, which in layman's terms consists of woodchips, agricultural byproducts, and untreated construction debris, is another proven, effective technology that currently generates numerous pollution avoidance and waste management public benefits across the nation.  
   Unfortunately, the 1992 bill restrictively defined qualifying biomass processes by requiring taxpayers to grow the biomass solely for the purposes of combustion. This then-untested theory has since proven to be singularly uneconomic, and taxpayers have never claimed one single cent of tax credits. My bill retains this dormant ``closed-loop'' biomass provision in the hopes that some day it may be found feasible. 
   In order to retain the environmental, waste management, and the rural employment benefits that we currently receive from the existing ``open-loop'' biomass facilities, by bill rewrites section 45 to allow tax credits for clean combustion of wood waste and similar residues in these unique facilities. These valuable, yet economically vulnerable, facilities that convert 20 million tons of waste into clean electricity annually, and which have never received section 45 tax credits, would be eligible for the same ten years of tax credits per facility, beginning at date of enactment. 
   Importantly, we have gone to great lengths to ensure that the definition of qualifying biomass materials is limited to organic, nonhazardous materials that are clearly proven to burn cleanly without any pollution risk. Also, to allay any concern that biomass plants might burn paper and thus possibly jeopardize the amount of paper that is available to be recycled, I have specifically excluded paper that is commonly recycled from the list of materials that would qualify for the credit. 
   One promising technology that does not yet operate here in the U.S., but has now been proven to be feasible and practical, involves the cofiring of biomass with coal. A partial tax credit for cofiring would stimulate economic growth in rural areas by creating new markets for forage crops. The environmental benefits from reduced coal plant emissions would also be substantial. 
   Finally, my bill acknowledges the potential that biomass combustion has to solve the nation's pressing poultry waste problem by making electricity produced from the combustion of poultry litter eligible for the sec. 45 tax credit. As Chairman ROTH has recently pointed out, the increased growth of our domestic chicken and turkey industry has created the need to find a new, creative means for disposing of the waste of some 600 million chickens in the Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia peninsula alone. 
   Today, much of the waste from these operations (deposited upon biomass materials) is spread on farmland, resulting in a nutrient runoff that has contaminated streams, rivers and bays, with devastating effect on the local environment. Fortunately, scientists in the United Kingdom have developed a combustion technology that cleanly disposes of the waste and produces clean electricity. While no such plants are currently operating in the U.S., state and local authorities in the affected jurisdictions assure us that, with the enactment of this critical tax credit legislation, action would be taken to build these plants immediately. 
   With regard to wind energy, and my involvement in supporting this technology which goes back to my authorship of the Wind Energy Incentives Act of 1992, I am proud to say that this credit is one of the success stories of section 45. The public policy benefits of wind energy are indisputable: it is clean, safe and abundant within the United States. I understand that every 10,000 megawatts of wind energy produced in the U.S. can reduce carbon monoxide emissions by 33 million metric tons by replacing the combustion of fossil fuels. 
   Mr. President, I believe this bill provides a common sense combination of current and new technologies to help maintain the economic, environmental and waste management benefits derived from wind and biomass power. This bill has strong support from both the biomass industry and environmental groups including the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Natural Resources Defense Council. I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this legislation.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman and committee for their willingness to work with Senators KYL, HUTCHISON, me, and others to include in the Treasury appropriations bill to hire 500 more inspectors and agents, along with appropriate intelligence support and equipment. It is my understanding, in addition, that if there is a difference between the House and Senate bills in this regard that the Committee will do what it can in conference to ensure that the funding for these increases will be found outside of the Customs budget.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am concerned about a $257,000,000 decrease in appropriated funding for the United States Customs Service. Last year, Congress aided this agency through the Omnibus and Emergency Supplemental  Appropriations, that devotes a large percentage of its aggregate budget to preventing the smuggling of Narcotics into the United States, with an additional $265,000,000. The Appropriations committee, this year, also recognizing the need of the Customs Service to react to changing smuggling modes and complex money laundering schemes increased the Customs Service total funding by $315,000,000. This is $315,000,000 over the President's budget estimate and Congress needs to maintain this effort. Drug trafficking is a never-ending battle. The demand for illegal drugs in the United States remains strong. The U.S. Customs Service is one of our front line drug enforcement agencies that protects America's borders every day from professional drug traffickers and money launders. Congress needs to fully and adequately fund the salaries and expenses and needed modernization for one of our major first line counter-drug agencies. 
   I am aware of the hard choices the Committee had to make in coming up with the current funding level for Customs. But I strongly feel that we must do more. Not only has legal trade expanded dramatically but so has illegal drug trafficking and alien smuggling. We have not supported the modernization or expansion of Customs to keep pace. We cannot maintain our commitment to fighting the smuggling of illegal drugs without more and better.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation along with Senator SESSIONS and Senator KYL to help in sending our young people a no-use message on drugs. This parallels efforts in the House by Congressman MATT SALMON and it is supported by NASA. 
   The average age of our young people who first use illegal drugs is 16 and the age of first use is dropping. We need to reverse this trend and prevent drug use among young people. An easy way of contacting them is at our finger tips. NASA's web sites are among the most visited government sites. Thousands of schools have programs that include NASA's web sites in their curriculum. I believe it is important to reach out to those young people. Here is a chance to reach millions of young people at no added expense to the taxpayer. 
   In this bill the NASA administration must work with the Office of National Drug Control Policy to add anti-drug messages on NASA's web sites. With our young people being bombarded by images of violence and drugs from films and TV, this is a way to get the anti-drug message to our children at a young age through a location that we know a large number will see. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort and support this bill.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am announcing, today, my intention to place a hold on the nomination of Mr. Richard Holbrooke to be the next U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. I would like to explain for the benefit of my colleagues why I have done so. 
   First, let me explain that I have nothing against Mr. Holbrooke. He is simply caught in the middle. The issue can be cleared up very, very quickly, if reasonable heads come together. 
   At issue is the outrageous treatment by the State Department of one of its employees. Her name is Linda Shenwick. She is Counselor for Resources Management at the United States U.N. Mission. She is the Mission's expert on financial and management matters. 
   Ms. Shenwick has been instrumental in bringing to light many of the waste and mismanagement issues associated with the U.N. She's been an invaluable source of information and insight for the people's branch of government. Some people in the State Department, apparently all the way to the top, don't much care for Ms. Shenwick's candor with Congress. And so they painted a big, ol' target on Ms. Shenwick, and have come after her, relentlessly. 
   You see, Ms. Shenwick is guilty of committing the crime of telling the truth. And when you commit truth, you're history in the State Department. 
   Here is how the State Department has treated Ms. Shenwick. I'd like my colleagues to know this, so they can judge for themselves whether this is conduct befitting such a grand institution as the State Department. 
   Ms. Shenwick has been ``Felix Bloched.'' You remember Felix Bloch. He was investigated while under suspicion for espionage. He was put on non-duty status while he was investigated. That's now what they've done to Ms. Shenwick, effective last Friday at 5:30 pm. 
   That's not all. Before kicking her out of her office last week, she was not allowed to talk to other employees. They could not talk to her. She had to keep her door closed at all times. She could  not access the main computer in the office. They forced her to fly to Washington, with little or no notice, for meetings that didn't occur. 
   At the end of this month, Ms. Shenwick must report to a new job in Washington, in an area in which she has no background. They know that she wants to stay in New York. They seem determined to break this woman down. So far, they have not succeeded. 
   Mr. President, I have a long-standing practice of taking up the cause of witnesses before the Congress who have done the right thing at great risk to their careers. Before I do this, I must make sure the individual has sufficient credibility, and is being retaliated against for their disclosures in the public interest. I have spoken with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and on both sides of Capitol Hill. They all agree she has credibility, and has provided solid, accurate information to Congress. It is information that has led to management reforms and more effective controls of the U.N. budget. No one has ever successfully challenged her information. Instead, the Department has attacked her. 
   In all the whistleblower cases I have worked over the years, this one stands out. I have never seen such a blatant, raw attempt to harass and silence a whistleblower who simply told the truth. Can the truth be that offensive to the State Department? 
   My action to put a hold on the Holbrooke nomination is a contest over which message will prevail. By its actions, the message the State Department wants to send is fear. Every other employee of the USUN Mission has their eyes firmly fixed on this case. The State Department wants them to know, if they commit truth like Ms. Shenwick did, that they, too, will get the ``Felix Bloch Treatment.'' I guess committing truth is just as bad as committing espionage. 
   Mr. President, It's my hope that we in this body will intercept that message, and send one of our own. The people's right to know the truth is what we care about. And those who help Congress know the truth will be protected, not punished. 
   Until this month, Ms. Shenwick and her attorney had been negotiating with the State Department to find her a new job in New York. There was some progress, but the Department started negotiating in bad faith. The talks broke down, and Ms. Shenwick is being transferred to Washington at the end of the month, to a job for which she has no background. 
   I am willing to release my hold of the nomination of Mr. Holbrooke forthwith. But before that happens, fairness and civility must prevail. Good faith negotiations must re-start, and an agreement must be reached by both parties. This could happen within 24 hours, if desired. 
   In 1997, another member of this body put a similar hold on a nominee until the Department resolved Ms. Shenwick's situation. The Secretary agreed to resolve the issues and keep Ms. Shenwick at the USUN Mission. The hold was lifted. But instead of resolving the matter, the harassment continued. And it continues to this day. 
   That will not happen again. The hold gets lifted when there's an agreement in writing. 
   Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues appreciate the reasonableness of my position, and the importance of the message that I am asking this body to send. I hope I can count on their support in the public's best interest. And we can then allow Mr. Holbrooke to get on with his important work in New York.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill co-sponsored by Senator BAUCUS to preserve hundreds of community health centers and rural health clinics across the country. Our bill, The Safety Net Preservation Act of 1999, would remedy a phase-out of the payment system that covers the clinics' cost of caring for Medicaid patients. Congress approved the phase-out of cost-based reimbursement during the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 
   The phase-out was meant to save Medicaid money and respond to those who felt cost-based reimbursement imposed an expensive mandate on states. Scheduled to begin on October 1, the phase-out will force the clinics to use scarce federal grants intended to provide care for the uninsured to prop up Medicaid under-payments. The change could force health centers to lose as much as $1.1 billion over the next five years. 
   Our bill would establish a prospective payment system to ensure that health centers and clinics receive sufficient Medicaid funding. The bill would protect the federal investment in health centers while giving states the flexibility to design their own payment systems for health centers and clinics. 
   There's no doubt that community health centers and rural health clinics serve a unique and essential role in getting high-quality health care services to those in need. They are the backbone of America's health care infrastructure for millions of medically under-served rural and urban communities, where access to health care is often limited. I've seen first hand the valuable services provided by these centers and the obstacles the providers overcome to do so. Last year, I visited a center in Des Moines. They serve patients who speak nine different languages. In many cases, these clinics are often the difference between seeing a doctor and forgoing treatment. We can't allow money shortfalls to force them to shut down. We have to preserve this safety net for millions of Americans. 
   I am pleased for the support of Senators MURKOWSKI, ROCKEFELLER, CONRAD, ROBB and HARKIN as original co-sponsors of The Safety Net Preservation Act of 1999. I look forward to passage of this important legislation in the 106th Congress.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to help clarify for the administration certain aspects of drug policy that seem to have caused confusion. The confusion seems to lie in how to think about our friends and enemies when it comes to drug policy. There seems to be a willingness to overlook the actions and activities of certain rogue states when it comes to their involvement in drug production and trafficking. 
   The purpose of our international drug policy is to establish a framework for achieving results that sustain the national interest. As part of that, the goal is to identify countries that are major producers or transit zones for drugs. It is also to determine whether those countries are committed to cooperate with the United States, with other countries, or are taking steps on their own to stop illegal drug production and transit. This goal is clearly in the national interest. 
   Most illegal drugs used in this country are produced overseas and smuggled to this country. In accomplishing this, international drug thugs violate our laws, international laws, and, in most cases, the laws in the source and transit countries. Those drugs kill and maim more Americans every year than have all international terrorists in the last 10 years. In addition, they have made many of our schools, workplaces, our streets and our homes unsafe and dangerous. 
   There are few threats more direct, more immediate, and more telling in our everyday lives than drug use and the activities of those who push them on our young people. We pay the costs in our hospitals, in our jails, and in our families. It is a devastation that we share with other countries. And the problem overseas is growing worse. Not only is drug production up but so is use. The source and transit countries are now facing growing drug use problems. Thus, in addition to attacks on the underpinnings of decent government from criminal gangs, many countries now face epidemic drug use among young people. 
   What other countries do or do not do to confront this threat is of interest to  us. The nature of the drug trade, production as well as transit, is an interconnected enterprise with international reach. Many drug trafficking gangs have contacts with each other. They share markets, expertise, and facilities. In some cases, they can count on the complicity of foreign governments or of significant individuals in those governments. This means that a serious policy to get at the trade and its connections must be international, coherent, and integrated. It cannot be piecemeal, episodic, and disjointed. But that is what we have today. 
   Congress has over the years repeatedly pushed for an integrated, coherent approach, often over the reluctance of administrations. Dealing with the drug issue is often messy and uncomfortable. It disturbs the pleasantries of diplomatic exchanges. Progress is hard to achieve and difficult to document. And sometimes taking drug policy serious upsets other plans. 
   This seems to be the case in this administration's dealings with several major drug producing or transit countries. It seems the administration would rather not know what these countries are up to on drugs, lest knowing make it difficult to pursue other goals. In several of these cases, the countries involved are not friends of the United States. One, Iran, is a sworn enemy. It has used terrorism and other tactics to attack U.S. interests and to kill Americans. it is also a drug producing and transit country. 
   For many years, the lack of cooperation or reliable information of Iranian counter drug efforts placed them squarely on the list of countries decertified by the United States. Last year, however, the administration removed Iran from the list. it did so on feeble pretexts, with limited information, and in a less than forthright manner. The administration used lawyerly interpretation of statute to drop Iran from the so-called Majors' List. Doing this meant the administration could then duck the question of whether to certify Iran as cooperating on drugs or not. 
   To accomplish this little sleight of hand, the administration had to ignore the interconnectedness of drug trafficking, congressional intent, and the national interest. So far as I can determine, it did this in the vague hope that a unilateral gesture towards Iran on drugs would see a reciprocal gesture leading to detente. It is hard to account for the change otherwise. And even so it is hard to comprehend. Never mind Iran's continuing hostility, its past and current support of terrorism aimed at the U.S. and American citizens. Never mind the facts. Never mind drug production and transit. Never mind the national interest. This is another case of the triumph of hope over experience that seems to be the lodestar of this Administration's foreign policy. 
   What makes the case even more disturbing is the apparent subterfuge the administration resorted to in order to evade explaining this major shift in policy. I say major because Iran had been on every drug list since its inception and Iran has been decertified for that whole history. I say subterfuge because of the pettifoggery the administration resorted to. 
   Given the facts of Iran's past, what is reasonable to assume would be a responsible way of dealing with the issue? It is the clear intent of the law on these matters that the administration would consult with Congress before making a major change in policy. But what did it, in fact, do? Not only did the administration not consult, it nitpicked. The law requires the administration to submit the Majors List by November 1. Instead of complying with this known statutory requirement, the administration delayed by over a week the submission of the list, conveniently waiting until after Congress had adjourned. Mere coincidence? Well, the administration did precisely the same stalling routine the year before when Syria was similarly spirited off the list. Without any prior notice to Congress. Once is accidental, twice is beginning to look like a pattern. 
   Weeks after this move, the administration finally provided an explanation. It deserves a full retelling to appreciate. First, some basic facts. Iran has a long history of drug production, most opium. It is a major transit country for opium and heroin from Afghanistan and Pakistan. Major Iranian criminal gangs have been involved in the drug trade for years. 
   Since the Iranian revolution, it has been difficult for any outsiders to determine what, if anything, the Islamic Government is doing to stop this trade. It is also important to understand that Iran was on the Majors List as a producing country. The law requires that any country that grows more than 1,000 hectares of opium poppy be put on the list. Iran met this qualification. The standard for classifying a transit country is not so precise and it is this imprecision that the administration exploited. 
   Here, in brief, is the administration's explanation for dropping Iran from the list: Iran no longer grows more than 1,000 hectares, and the transited heroin does not come to the United States, so it does not qualify for the list. 
   This latter rationalization is based on the administration's own favored way of reading the law. In this reading, a major transit country does not qualify for the list if current intelligence information does not show a direct flow to the United States. Since the underground nature and fungibility of the international drug trade is hard to quantify precisely, this leaves a lot of room for interpreting the facts to reach a politically correct conclusion. This, of course, leaves aside the question of whether such an exception was ever part of congressional intent or is consistent with the law or the national interest. The reasoning is shaky on both policy and information. It also ignores the nature of international drug trade and criminal organizations and what must be done to get at them. And it relies on how little we know about what goes on inside Iran. 
   In reality, the administration's approach is a resort to technicalities and convenient interpretations to dodge the real issues. But as we have been instructed, it all depends upon what the meaning of ``is'' is. But let's remind ourselves that what is being done here is to base a weighty policy decision involving serious issues of national security and well being on lawyerly gamesmanship. And this on the unanchored hope that the gesture, and that's all it is, might get a friendly reaction in Iran. What did Iran actually do in response? What you would expect. It thumbed its nose in our direction. But let me illustrate a little further the way facts have been employed. 
   Recall that Iran used to be on the Majors List for producing over 1,000 hectares of opium. Drop below this number, in the administration's reasoning, and you automatically fall off the list. In this very careful parsing of meaning, I would suppose that if a country produced 999 hectares, no matter what other facts applied, it wouldn't qualify. But is this the case in Iran? The administration's explanation is that they could not find opium production in Iran in 1998, ergo, they do not qualify on this criteria. But this so-called objective assessment needs a little closer look. 
   In most cases, we base our estimates of illicit crop production on overhead imagery and photo interpretation. While we are pretty good at it, this is not a precise science, whether we're talking vegetables or missiles. And it is, by the way, even more difficult when it comes to counting vegetables. Good analysis is dependent of weather, adequate overhead coverage, information from corroborating sources, and a track record of surveying that builds up a reliable picture over time. What was the case in Iran? Before the so-called objective, imagery-based assessment in 1998, the last overhead coverage of Iran had been in the early 1990s. 
   The 1998 decision was therefore based on a one-time shot after years of no informaiton. Corroborating information is also scant. But the situation is even more dubious. 
   Based on the past estimates, Iran cultivated nearly 4,000 hectares of opium in various growing regions across the country. The 1998 survey concentrated in only one of those traditional growing areas. Although in the early 1990s it was the major one, it still only accounted for some 80 percent of total cultivation. The 1998 survey could find no significant growing areas in these areas. But if we are to believe Iranian authorities, they have specifically attacked this cultivation with vigorous eradication efforts. The imagery would seem to support this claim. But we also know that growers  adjust to enforcement. It is not unreasonable, therefore, to assume that drug producers might shift the locus of cultivation to less accessible areas and resort to measures to disguise production. The 1998 survey did not examine other areas. 
   We cannot, of course, prove a negative, but that should not lead us to jump to conclusions, especially when those conclusions are what we want. Let me illustrate the point. If 20 percent of Iranian opium production--a number based on earlier assessments--was in areas other than those checked, that figure alone gives us close to 800 hectares. Since those other areas--which cover an immense amount of countryside--were not checked, we cannot know if there was any production for sure. But, it would only require a little effort on the part of growers to shift a small amount of production to get us to our 1,000 hectare threshold. Also remember that opium is an annual plant. In some areas it has more than one growing season. Thus, a region that only had 500 hectares of opium at any one time but had two growing seasons, would have an actual total of 1,000 productive hectares per year. I do not know that this was the case in Iran, but neither does the administration. It doesn't know because it didn't look. It didn't look because it was not convenient. 
   I would suggest, even if you agree with the assumptions the administration is making about the intent of the law, that there are enough uncertainties in estimating Iranian opium production to counsel caution in reinterpreting the data. And even more caution in using this to revise policy. All the more so, given the nature of Iran's past actions and attitudes towards the United States. But even if you buy all the rationalizations leading to a decision to drop Iran from the Majors List, we are left with this: Is it responsible or creditable to make such a major shift in policy without even the pretense of consultation with Congress? Without an effort to explain the decision and shift to the public? 
   If there are grounds for reconsidering Iran's counter narcotics efforts, why was it necessary to resort to gimmicks? Is there something wrong with presenting the facts publicly and reaching a reasonable consensus consistent with the national interest? Not to mention that in this decision on Iran and the earlier one on Syria that we did not consult with Israel, our most consistent ally in the region? Was it necessary? Was it wise? 
   Is this the way we conduct serious counter drug policy as part of our international efforts? But this is not the only disturbing case. 
   I earlier alluded to a similar situation with regard to Syria. I will not review the details of that case. Suffice it to say, they are in keeping with what was done about Iran. The case I would like to look at more closely is that of North Korea. Here we have another rogue state and enemy of the United States that seems to get favored treatment when it comes to drugs. 
   There is credible and mounting evidence that North Korea is a major producing country of opium and processor of heroin. Stories of these activities have circulated for years, including details provided by defectors. Information that is further supported by the arrests of North Korean diplomats in numerous countries for drug smuggling using the diplomatic pouch. Defectors have indicated that illegal opium production and heroin sales have been used to fund North Korea's overseas activities and its nuclear program. 
   These reports also indicate that opium cultivation in North Korea far exceed the 1,000 hectare level, ranging from 3,000 to 7,000 hectares depending on the climate and growing conditions. In a country plagued by famine, precious arable land has been turned to illicit opium production by the government to fund terrorism and the development of nuclear weapons. Until this year, however, the administration did not report on these activities. It was not until Congress required such a report that we have even a hint of all of this in official reporting. When I asked the administration two years ago to supply data on opium cultivation in North Korea, it responded by saying they did not have any detailed information. Why? Because the administration was not looking for it. Under pressure, it is now beginning to look. While I welcome this, I am concerned that this search for information will be handled in the same manner as was used in the case of Iran. Information will be collected, but it will be carefully scripted and narrowly interpreted. 
   I find it puzzling that we should be willing to cut such corners. What is it about nations that are declared enemies of this country and many of our allies that we look the other way when it comes to drugs? What do we gain from empty gestures? And why do we make these gestures on an issue as basic to the national interest and well being of U.S. citizens as drug policy? I am at a loss to explain it. So, rather than trying to guess at motives, I am offering legislation to clarify the situation and to require more overt explanations. I therefore send to the desk the Most Favored Rogue States Act of 1999 and ask my colleagues to join me in supporting it. It addresses a serious issue that needs our immediate attention.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are about to vote on a very major and very dangerous revision of U.S. trade policy, and we are going to do it without the benefit of a hearing and, quite frankly, we are doing it under great political pressure. That is not a very good environment. 
   If we give in to pressure to enact quota legislation, we will do great harm. I believe the proponents are all acting, of course, with the best of intentions. Yet we must not allow our desire to help a troubled industry in the short term do long-term damage to our economy. 
   Sixty-nine years ago, Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, and they did it with the best of good intentions. Its aim was to help the American farmer, with a limited upward revision of tariffs on foreign produce. 
   But it had the opposite effect. It strangled foreign trade. It deepened and widened the severity of the Great Depression. 
   Other countries faced with deficits and exports had to pay for their imports, and they responded by applying quotas and embargoes on American goods. 
   I think the history of the depth and the severity of the retaliation against U.S. agricultural products from that period is shocking, because our foreign buyers stopped buying our agricultural products in retaliation. 
   In 1930, the United States exported just over $1 billion worth of agricultural goods. By 1932 that amount had been cut in half. Almost every American export sector was hit by foreign retaliation but particularly agriculture. 
   As the United States agricultural exports fell in the face of foreign retaliation, farm prices fell sharply, weakening the solvency of our rural banks. Their weakened condition undermined deposit confidence leading to the runs on the banks and bank failures, and ultimately the contraction of money supply. 
   Farm prices for many agricultural products are already at rock bottom levels. Can we in good conscience put so much of our economy at risk with this legislation? 
   In 1998, the United States exported agricultural products worth $53 billion, accounting for one-third of America's total agricultural products, and nearly 1 million jobs. Agriculture is perhaps the most vulnerable sector of our economy to foreign retaliation, and our trading partners know it. 
   Retaliation is not a thing of the past. It is a hardball tactic that is frequently used as an instrument of national policy. Just look at the recent history. Japan threatened to retaliate when we took some action against them. In 1983, China temporarily stopped buying U.S. wheat in retaliation of another President's protectionist policies. 
   We have to learn from the past, and we have to say if it is bad for agriculture, it is bad for America.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to both cloture on the steel quota bill, and to the bill itself. 
   I oppose this dangerous and misguided legislation for three reasons. 
   First, the steel quota bill is really a phony bill of goods. It does not do what it promises. It will not restore the vitality of troubled elements of the U.S. steel industry. That's because foreign imports have little to do with the problems facing the American steel industry. 
   Why? Because the American steel industry is much more efficient than at almost any time in our past history. Fewer steel workers are producing more steel today than they were 10 years ago. In 1987, when the domestic industry produced 77 million short tons, 163,000 workers were employed in the steel industry. In 1997, 10 years later, when the domestic industry produced 106 million tons, employment was 112,000 workers. During that 10 year span, our steel mills made 29 million more tons with 51,000 fewer workers. 
   Using the logic behind this quota legislation, the more efficient our steel industry becomes, the more it requires protection from foreign imports. But in fact, the opposite is true. The more protection an industry gets, the more inefficient it becomes. That is not good for our economy, or for American consumers. During the next few years, we may see steel employment fall even further, perhaps by as much of 5,000 workers per year, as inefficient integrated mills are closed. New, more efficient minimills will take up any slack. All of this will happen whether or not steel quotas are imposed. 
   Who will really benefit from the quota bill? 
   According to the Institute For International Economics, one of this country's most distinguished and highly regarded think tanks, few steel workers will benefit. But steel importers and profitable, efficient steel makers will win big. 
   The Institute's report states:  
   The annual costs to American households for each steel job saved would exceed $800,000. But steel workers would receive less than 20 percent of this huge sum; lucky firms would collect more than 80 percent of the jackpot. ..... Quotas will enrich lucky steel importers (often those with the best political connections) and efficient steel producers (they are doing well enough already--11 of the 13 largest mills earned more than $1 billion in 1998). .....  
   The United States Senate should not help enrich a few lucky importers. It should not give windfalls to companies earning a billion dollars a year. 
   I have the deepest concern for any American who loses his or her job for any reason. It is a terrible, wrenching thing to lose a job. It affects families as well as communities. We must help where we can, through programs like trade adjustment assistance, that help displaced workers through job retraining and placement assistance. But the one thing we must not do is react in haste, in a way that will kill far more jobs than it will ever save, and in a way that will reward healthy companies with windfall profits. 
   The second reason I oppose the steel quota bill is that it flat-out violates our WTO international trade obligations. 
   There are some who claim this is not the case. But, I want to read the exact words of Article 11 of the GATT. This rule is part of the WTO rules that we and 133 other nations are committed to observe:  
   No prohibitions or restrictions other than duties, taxes, or other charges, whether made effective through quotas, import or export licenses or other measures, shall be instituted or maintained by any contracting party on the importation of any product of the territory of any other contracting party or on the exportation or sale for export of any product destined for the territory of any other contracting party.  
   We helped write that law. We demand that our trading partners observe it. We defend it when other countries try to keep our goods out of their markets. And most of the time, we win these cases. 
   Now, I'm not a lawyer. Maybe that's my problem. Perhaps I'm not clever enough to figure out where Article 11 says that quotas are OK. It seems pretty clear to me. It says that you can't have restrictions other than duties, taxes, or other charges. But Article 11 goes even farther than banning quotas. It says that you can't have any type of government measure that leads to the imposition of a quota. 
   One important panel decision, the GATT panel on Semiconductors, affirmed this broad interpretation in 1988. It said that Article 11, unlike other GATT provisions, does not refer solely to laws or regulations. It has an even broader application, and refers to all ``measures'' that restrict exports. 
   There are some exceptions to Article 11's broad ban on any measures restricting exports. But the most relevant of these exceptions, the so-called Safeguard exception, does not apply because there is no proof that our domestic steel industry has suffered serious injury from import competition. Moreover, safeguard actions usually involve imposing increased customs duties, rather than quotas. Yes, there has been illegal dumping of steel by some countries into the United States. But the surge of that dumped steel has largely been stopped. And even during the highest point last year of the so-called steel crisis, 11 of the 13 largest steel mills were profitable, earning collective profits of more than $1 billion. So much for serious injury.  
   The final reason I oppose the quote bill--and the most important reason--is that it will invite retaliation and perhaps spark a trade war that no one would win, and in which everyone would lose. 
   We are approaching the 69th anniversary of the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act of 1930. This legislation, which was enacted in July 1930, was one of the major mistakes of the Hoover Administration and the Seventy-first Congress. 
   The Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act also started out with good intentions. Its aim was to help the American farmer with a limited, upward revision of tariffs on foreign produce. But it had the opposite result. It strangled foreign trade. It deepened and widened the severity of the Depression. Other countries faced with a deficit of exports to pay for their imports responded by applying quotas and embargoes on American goods. 
   I went back to the historical record to see what happened to United States agricultural exports when other countries stopped buying our agricultural products after we enacted that tariff. I was shocked by the depth and the severity of the retaliation. 
   In 1930, the United States exported just over $1 billion worth of agricultural goods. By 1932, that amount had been cut almost in half, to $589 million. Barley exports dropped by half. So did exports of soybean oil. Pork exports fell 15 percent. Almost every American export sector was hit by foreign retaliation, but particularly agriculture. As United States agricultural exports fell in the face of foreign retaliation, farm prices fell sharply, weakening the solvency of many rural banks. Their weakened condition undermined depositor confidence, leading to depositor runs, bank failures, and ultimately, a contraction in the money supply. 
   Farm prices for many agricultural products are already at rock-bottom levels. Can we in good conscience put so much of our economy at risk? 
   In 1998 the United States exported agricultural products worth more than $53 billion dollars, accounting for one-third of America's total agricultural production, and nearly one million jobs. Agriculture is perhaps the most vulnerable sector of our economy to foreign retaliation, and our trading partners know it. 
   If you think the Depression is ancient history, and that retaliation against agriculture is a thing of the past, just look at our recent history. 
   In 1995, when the United States threatened to impose 100% tariffs on imports of Japanese luxury cars, Japan appealed the case to the WTO and stated that it might retaliate imposing duties on U.S. exports of agriculture products. 
   In 1983, China temporarily stopped buying U.S. wheat in retaliation for the Reagan Administration's unilateral imposition of quotas on its textile and apparel exports after negotiations to renew a bilateral agreement under the Multi-Fiber Arrangement broke down. 
   In 1985, the European Community raised tariffs on U.S. lemons and walnuts in response to U.S. retaliation against subsidized EC pasta exports. 
   Even though we have made vast progress in managing our trade relationships since the passage of the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act, in many ways the world is still just one trade war away from a global economic crisis. 
   In 1930, 1,000 of the nation's leading economists signed a letter urging the President and the Congress to not enact the infamous legislation we now know as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff. They were ignored. Politics carried the day. American paid a steep price. Let us not repeat the mistakes of the Seventy-first Congress. The quota bill is bad trade policy. It is bad for agriculture. It is bad for America.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation sponsored by Senators JEFFORDS, KENNEDY, ROTH and MOYNIHAN. I commend my colleagues for their dedication to improving the way federal programs serve persons with disabilities. Continuing my support for this effort from last Congress, I became an original co-sponsor this year of S. 331, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. 
   This bill addresses one of the great tragedies of our disability system. The tragedy is forcing many people with disabilities to choose between working and maintaining access to health care. The intent of our system was never to demoralize Americans who are ready, willing and able to work. It is critical that we overturn today's policies of disincentives toward work and replace them with thoughtful, targeted incentives that will enable many individuals with disabilities to return to work. 
   By removing barriers to necessary health care, the Work Incentives Improvement Act gives the disabled population the green light to join the work force. It is smart public policy that will help alleviate the tight labor market, increase the tax base for the Social Security trust fund and address employer concerns. Many employers are wary of adding a high-cost employee to their company's insurance pool. 
   Most of all, this bill is the right thing to do. By providing disabled workers a better opportunity to earn a living, this bill reinforces our nation's strong work ethic. Earning one's own way in the world helps foster personal responsibility and self-esteem. 
   Over the years I have heard from Iowans who have been forced to leave the work force because of a disability. More than 40,000 Iowans receive federal disability benefits, but fewer than 20 percent of these Iowans hold a job. Most are discouraged form seeking employment because of the fear of losing critical health benefits covered by Medicare and Medicaid. 
   For example, Tim Clancy of Iowa City has his Bachelor of Arts from the University of Iowa. He is an active individual and participates in a number of city and county government activities. Tim lives with cerebral palsy and relies on personal assistants for morning and evening help. Recently, he became employed by Target in Coralville, Iowa, but does not have health insurance through his employer. After he completes his trial work period and extended period of eligibility, he will lose his health insurance. The Work Incentives Act would allow Tim--and many others--to continue receiving the same health coverage as he has now. 
   I look forward to the passage of this legislation. It will unlock the doors to  employment for thousands of invaluable citizens.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the Social Security ``lock box.'' This legislation is vital to the future of the Social Security program. I commend my colleagues, Senators DOMENICI, ABRAHAM, and ASHCROFT on their leadership and dedication to the fiscal year 2000 budget resolution which establishes goals  for the next ten years by setting aside projected Social Security surpluses of $1.8 trillion. 
   The unified budget system created during President Lyndon Johnson's administration allows the government to account for non-Social Security programs using Social Security funds. For years it masked the size of the federal deficit. When it comes to Social Security, this accounting method has fanned unfavorable public sentiment. According to a survey conducted by the National Public Radio, the Kaiser Foundation, and the Kennedy School of Government, Americans believe that the Social Security trust fund is somehow being misused. Asked why the system is in trouble, more people (65%) selected ``money in the Social Security trust fund is being spent on programs other than Social Security'' than any other reason. It's time to change the system. The lock box legislation would help restore the public's trust in the system and ensure Congress and the President don't squander the surpluses accumulating in the Social Security trust fund. 
   The surplus could be very tempting to the President and Congress to spend. The Social Security ``lock box'' would institute a 60-vote budget point of order in the Senate which would limit Congress's ability to pass a budget resolution which uses a portion of the Social Security trust fund for non-Social Security purposes. In addition, this legislation would institute a limit on the debt held by the public. 
   Passing this legislation demonstrates Congress's ability and discipline to save money. Taxpayers and beneficiaries believe ``reform'' will translate into higher taxes and lower benefits. One way to quell public concern is by starting out on the right foot. We can protect the Social Security trust fund from being drained for non-Social Security purposes. As Members of Congress, we owe this to the future generations of America. As Senators, we should understand the dynamics of saving the Social Security trust funds because we all have constituents in our home states who have doubts about Social Security money being there for them when they retire. That is why this legislation is so important: it will help restore the confidence of the American people in their government. Locking away the Social Security trust fund is a key way to secure the public's peace of mind. Wage earners who contribute a sizable percentage of their paycheck every week to the public retirement system have grown leery about the Federal Government using their Social Security taxes for other purposes. 
   President Clinton, pledged in his 1998 State of the Union Address, to ``save every cent of the Social Security Surplus.'' Some Members of Congress including myself along with Senators GREGG, BREAUX, and KERREY have put forth proposals to save Social Security. However, if Congress and the White House reach a Social Security stalemate this year, the lock box legislation offers a bonus economic benefit. It would ensure the public debt is reduced. That's because the Social Security lock box effectively would limit the amount of public debt, which would prevent Social Security revenue from being used for other programs. 
   Some have expressed concern that passing this legislation would stifle Congress's ability to address emergency situations such as economic recession or war. Those situations were anticipated in the development of the lock box legislation. This bill would allow the flexibility necessary to address such situations by suspending the public debt limit in specific instances such as recession or a declaration of war. 
   We are at a point in time where talk is cheap and execution is everything. At one time or another we all learned the steps of first aid and the first step that is taken is to stop the bleeding. We need to stop the bleeding of the trust fund dollars from the Social Security trust fund. 
   I ask my colleagues to demonstrate the courage necessary to pass this bill and preserve the future of our great Nation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation on behalf of myself, Senators KYL, DEWINE, HAGEL, and KOHL, a bill referred to as the Rural Methamphetamine Use Response Act of 1999. 
   I do this in my capacity not only as a Senator from Iowa but as chairman of the International Narcotics Control Caucus of the Senate--a caucus that has had a tradition of working in a very bipartisan way on legislation and oversight hearings. 
   Methamphetamine is emerging as a new major drug problem across the entire country. It is one of the most dangerous drugs currently available. Its use destroys individuals and its production harms the environment. It is a problem that disproportionately affects rural America, even in our most urban States. 
   Methamphetamine is not a new drug in this country, but its growing use is very much a new problem. As the chart shows, meth has been around our country since the early 1980s, but its use then was largely confined to biker gangs and with a very limited market. Even then, much of the meth was produced in homemade labs in this country. Very little of it came out of Mexico and not so much in rural America. 
   The chart shows the city of Philadelphia with lots of examples of use of meth and meth laboratories. The numbers were few then and medical cases of meth-related problems were limited. 
   In San Francisco, for example, there were only 65 medical cases of meth-related problems, even in the year 1984. Let me assure Members that very low level activity situation for methamphetamine was not going to last very long because it began to change in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
   During that period of time, Mexican criminal gangs began to become more  involved, taking over production and marketing from the biker gangs in America. In doing so, they began to rapidly expand the availability of drugs and at the same time lowering the costs. Use began to grow, as it will, when drugs became widely available at affordable prices. It will also grow if there is a perception of low risk with that drug. 
   Somehow--and wrongly so--meth got a reputation for being harmless. It is simple. Most new drugs start that way. They are pushed on particularly young people as safe and OK. Of course, it is a lie. But it is common enough. Thus, it should come as no surprise that as meth use increased and spread beyond the Western States, along with this, so did reports of meth-related medical problems. 
   In 1989, medical cases in San Francisco reached 1,125, or 17 times the 1984 level of 65 which I already mentioned. The number of lab seizures increased, as well. 
   Remember, on this chart, the previous chart, and the next chart I will show, the red lines show an expanding importation of methamphetamine into our country with some from outside of Mexico, but most of the lines coming from Mexico and spreading all across our country--it is now beginning to reach the West and the Midwest--not so much in the East where it was when it started with biker gangs, but all over the United States. 
   While most of the drug is produced in Mexico by Mexican criminal gangs, there is a growing domestic production, much of this in rural areas. It is devastating. 
   Looking again at the chart previously shown, from 1982 to 1985, we had very little meth coming from Mexico into the United States. 
   Most of what we had was domestic production. The numbers here in green illustrate the dimension of medical-related meth problems that are reported in the media. It also relates, to some extent, to the lab busts in that particular case. But from 1982 to 1985, it was very much limited to biker gangs being involved in that, very little out of Mexico. 
   Then you go to the period of the late 1980s, early 1990s. You see more red lines, meaning quantity and diverse distribution coming out of Mexico, some from Korea, probably some from other countries we will not show on this particular map but still, relatively little. Then after 1994, you see a very dramatic acceptance of meth use, but also most of it coming from Mexico and most of it from that source just finding itself spread all across the United States, so very much a growing problem, very much a problem of Mexican sources and cartels being the source of our problem in this country. 
   In 1998 we had 321 methamphetamine labs found in my State of Iowa. This was more than double the year before. As of the first quarter this year, over 170 labs have been found in my State. If you multiply that by 4, you are going to see Iowa doubling the trouble of meth again in local production. That is what we know about. It does not account for the flow of meth from Mexico. 
   I know many other States in the West and the Midwest can tell a very similar story. We know this is a problem that is moving eastward. We are becoming a producing country for this dangerous drug. You can get the formula for producing meth off the Internet, and many of the chemicals to produce it can be found in local hardware stores and pharmacies. One of the common chemicals used in production is increasingly being stolen from farms. 
   The problem of production and use is growing worse. As it does so, it leaves in its wake broken homes and ruined lives. It is known on the street as crank, ice, speed, or meth. However it is named, the drug hooks users from all socioeconomic backgrounds. What is worse, medical experts and law enforcement officials point to younger and younger users. This is one of the most dangerous drugs we have ever seen. It is highly addictive, and it is a brain toxin. It attacks important functions of the brain, and, over time, prolonged use poisons these functions, in some cases permanently. The word on the street is that meth is a safe drug, but in fact it is a very vicious drug. 
   The physiological side effects of meth include brain damage, heart attacks, and seizures. It can cause insomnia and lead to paranoia as well as violent, erratic behavior. It has made routine police encounters with motorists more dangerous, and it has made investigating lab sites a risky undertaking. This highly dangerous, addictive stimulant disrupts homes, schools, workplaces, hospital emergency rooms, and even our courts. Worse yet, the production creates toxic waste dumps that endanger the environment and public safety. 
   Much of this problem disproportionately affects rural communities. Even in our most urban States, the threat is just overwhelming to local resources that have to bear the brunt of fighting the methamphetamine problem, because few small communities such as we have in rural America can cope with the explosion of users, pushers, and labs. 
   So those of us introducing this legislation--as I said, Senators KYL, DEWINE, HAGEL, and KOHL, and I--are then 
   introducing this Rural Methamphetamine Use Response Act of 1999 today because we cannot turn a blind eye to this threat anymore. Passage of this legislation will move us forward in our efforts to protect our children and our future from the ravages of meth. 
   There are several key areas where this legislation will improve our ability to respond to the threat. 
   First, we need to get a handle on what the problem is. This legislation requires that the Secretary of Health and Human Services report to Congress on how drug use, and particularly methamphetamine use, is different in rural versus urban settings. Today we can break drug use down into patterns by sex, by age, region of the country, education, and the type of drug use. We have some idea when kids--and they are kids--first try drugs. I believe there is a more serious problem in rural America today than there has ever been. Meth production and use disproportionately affect rural areas, even in large urban States such as California. 
   Meth is often called the poor man's cocaine, because it is most widely used in blue-collar communities, rural areas, and small to mid-sized cities. Yet our resources and focus tend to go to large urban areas, because that is where we can more easily document the problem. 
   After getting a better handle on the problem with better statistics on a national basis from our Secretary of HHS, we, second, suggest the Attorney General, through this legislation, provide the Congress with an annual strategy on how to deal with the problem systematically and coherently. This will establish a benchmark to guide future research and action. As part of this problem, this strategy is meant as a mechanism for tracking both use and the proliferation of meth labs. We do establish, then, this mechanism to do it. This will require the administration to relate resources to action. We do not see that connection today in a coherent way. 
   In addition, the legislation will support the creation of rapid response teams at the Federal level to provide language and intelligence-collection expertise to communities that must deal with foreign-based meth gangs. 
   Next, the legislation will increase resources to provide training in meth lab cleanup as well as increased funding to the Drug Enforcement Agency so it can improve assistance for lab cleanup and disposal. That is not something a lot of States are waiting for the Federal Government to do, but it is being done on an ad hoc basis, State by State. In my particular case, the State of Iowa has set up two teams with the resources to help in this cleanup, because it is such a dangerous environment. 
   One of the problems with meth is we have this proliferation of home meth labs, large and small. They are toxic waste dumps filled with dangerous chemicals. Handling these labs requires special training and equipment. My legislation will create a number of regional training centers to help struggling communities deal with the explosion in meth production. 
   The legislation would enhance the ability to provide training to local police and sheriffs to meet this challenge. 
   Finally, this legislation will increase penalties for trafficking anhydrous ammonia, one of the major components in one method of producing meth, across State lines and would provide assistance for research methods for making  anhydrous ammonia useless in meth production. 
   The intent of this legislation is to address a problem that is growing and spreading across the country, one that disproportionately affects small and mid-sized cities and rural areas. 
   I urge my colleagues in this body to join in supporting the Methamphetamine Use Response Act of 1999 and respond now to this challenge before it grows worse and before it spreads any further if, in fact, it can spread much further. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, on Tuesday, the Senate will convene at 11 a.m., and by previous consent immediately begin 2 hours of debate on S. 96, the Y2K legislation. Following that debate, the Senate will stand in recess for the weekly party conferences to meet. At 2:15 p.m., when the Senate reconvenes, a series of stacked votes will occur. The first votes in order will be to complete the Y2K legislation. Following disposition of that bill, a cloture vote on the Social Security lockbox issue will occur. If cloture is not invoked on the lockbox legislation, a cloture vote on H.R. 1664, regarding steel, oil, and gas appropriations, will be in order; further, if cloture is not invoked on H.R. 1664, it is the intention of the leader to resume debate on the energy and water appropriations bill. It is hoped that this appropriations bill can be completed by tomorrow evening. 
   As a reminder, a cloture motion to the House-passed Social Security lockbox legislation was filed today. Therefore, that cloture vote will take place on Wednesday, 1 hour after the Senate convenes, unless there is a unanimous consent agreement to change that time.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. I will not use all of that time for my amendment. 
   First of all, as to the amendment that is pending, authored by the Senator from Iowa, I thank the Senator from Alaska for offering my amendment yesterday, and I thank the Senator from Alaska for asking for a rollcall vote on my amendment, although this amendment has been offered 5 previous years and adopted 5 previous years without a rollcall. So, personally, I do not think it is necessary to have a rollcall vote. But if the chairman of the committee and the ranking member of the committee want such a rollcall vote, that is OK with me. So I will take then just a few minutes to speak about my amendment on matching disbursements with obligations. 
   The American taxpayers would take for granted, they would expect, the nurturing of their tax dollars to be so well done at the Federal level that Congress would not have to pass a special amendment which would say that the Department of Defense cannot pay out $1 of taxpayers' money without being able to match it with an invoice and contract that specified what goods or services they were buying. I hope in most of Government that is the case, but it has not been so with the Defense Department. In fact, I have been speaking for years on the subject of the tens of billions of dollars that have actually been spent, and at the time of payment, the department failed to match the particular service or goods that are being paid for with their corresponding contract. 
   I have had the support of the chairman of the Appropriations Committee in setting in place policies that would gradually reduce the amount of money that could be paid out without an invoice and contract to match. This policy has been incorporated in the last  five appropriations bills--fiscal years 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999. We are now working on the fiscal year 2000 appropriations bill. It is my understanding that the committee supports the amendment again this year. 
   Under current law, the matching threshold is set at $1 million effective this month. This means that the Department of Defense disbursing officials must match each payment of $1 million or more with a corresponding obligation or contract before the payment is made. My pending amendment would continue the process of ratcheting down the threshold began 5 years ago. It would lower the threshold then from the $1 million in present law to $500,000. Reports of the General Accounting Office and inspectors general consistently show that this policy is helping to reduce DOD's unmatched disbursement problems. As I understand it, the DOD has lowered the threshold to zero in most disbursing centers. 
   I thank the Department of Defense for having adopted a policy that every taxpayer would assume is a principle of good Government management, and that is that they would not pay out one penny without being able to show what they ordered and received for that penny. That has become a policy at some of the disbursing centers but not at all the centers. So we want to see the threshold lowered to zero at all locations because we think it is just sound business management that not one penny of the taxpayers' dollars should be paid out if there is not an invoice and contract for what has been bought and received, either goods or services, for that amount of money. 
   So we are not quite at zero all over the country with all of the centers. Some Department of Defense disbursing centers still have problems. This amendment will help keep the pressure on and hopefully in time will help the Department of Defense eliminate in the future all unmatched disbursements, so that the Senator from Iowa will never have to come to the Senate floor again and say we have these billions of dollars that the Pentagon paid out and they have never been able to show exactly what they ordered and received. 
   If the threshold specified in this amendment is unworkable, then I have asked the chairman to adjust the dollar level in conference, but I hope it is so obvious that we will be able to tell the taxpayers of this country that we know what they are buying; that at least for the next year we should keep the pressure on for the still fantastically high level of $500,000 that could be paid out under certain circumstances without the invoice and contract immediately available. 
   I do not want to stand before the Senate and be embarrassed by saying that we can somehow justify even a $500,000 check being written without knowing what goods and services were, in fact, ordered and received and being paid for. 
   I thank the chairman of the committee, Senator STEVENS, and I thank the ranking minority member, Senator INOUYE, for their continuing support of this amendment. Every year for the last 5 years I have offered this amendment, and every year for the last 5 years they have put the amendment in the bill, kept it there and protected it in conference. This effort, particularly with their respected leadership in the area of defense, is very positive toward the Department of Defense changing their attitude about unmatched disbursements and leading us to a point where we are reducing the amount of unmatched disbursements. 
   I thank the chairman and ranking member for their unwavering support, and I hope all my colleagues will support this simple but important amendment. I yield the floor. 
   I have time left over, and if the Senator from Alaska wants some of my time, he can have it.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly on the Grassley-Domenici amendment on financial management reforms at the Department of Defense. 
   The bill before us today provides the first major increase in defense spending since 1985. 
   The increase in defense spending authorized in this bill was initially approved by the Budget Committee back in March. 
   As a Member of the Budget Committee, I voted for the extra 8 billion dollars for national defense. 
   That may come as a surprise to some of my colleagues. 
   In the past, I have opposed increases in the defense budget. Now, I don't. My colleagues must be wondering why. 
   I would like to explain my position. 
   I support this year's increase in defense spending for one reason and one reason only. 
   The Budget Committee--and now the Armed Services Committee--are calling for financial management reforms at DOD. 
   The Committees are telling DOD to bring its accounting practices up to accepted standards, so it can produce ``auditable'' financial statements--as required by the Chief Financial Officers Act. 
   This is music to my ears. 
   We should not pump up the DOD budget without a solid commitment to financial management reform. 
   The Committees are telling DOD to do what DOD is already required to do--under the law. 
   The Budget Committee's report on the Concurrent Resolution for FY 2000 contained strong language on the need for financial management reform at the Pentagon. 
   While the Budget Committee's language is not binding, it sends a clear, unambiguous message to the Pentagon: clean up your books--now! 
   The Armed Services Committee reached the same conclusions--independently. 
   The Armed Services Committee has cranked up the pressure a notch. The Committee has taken the next logical step. 
   The bill before us today contains much more than a strong message. 
   It mandates financial management reform. 
   If adopted in conference, the language in this bill would become the law of the land. 
   And with it, I hope we are able to generate more pressure for financial reform at the Pentagon. 
   The legislative language on financial management reform is reflected in several provisions in Title X [ten] of the bill. 
   Mr. President, if financial reforms were not in the bill, I would be standing here with a different kind of amendment in my hand. 
   I would be asking my colleagues to support an amendment to cut the DOD budget. 
   Fortunately, that's not necessary. 
   It's not necessary because the Armed Services Committee has seen the light and seized the initiative. 
   The Armed Services Committee is demanding financial management reforms at the Pentagon. 
   First, I would like to thank my friend from Virginia, Senator WARNER--the Committee Chairman--for recognizing and accepting the need for financial management reform at the Pentagon. 
   I would also like to thank my friend from Oklahoma, Senator INHOFE--Chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee--for putting some horsepower behind DOD financial management reform. 
   His hearing on DOD Financial Management on April 14th helped to highlight the need for reform and set the stage for the corrective measures in the bill. 
   But above all, I would like to thank the entire Armed Services Committee for taking time to listen to my concerns and for addressing them in the bill in a meaningful way. 
   I hope the Committee's efforts to strengthen internal controls--when combined with mine--will improve DOD's ability to detect and prevent fraud and better protect the peoples' money. 
   Mr. President, this bill does not contain all the new financial management controls that I wanted. There had to be give-and-take along the way. 
   I remain especially concerned about the need for restrictions on the use of credit cards for making large payments on R&D and procurement contracts. 
   The Committee has assured me that there will be a good faith effort to examine this issue before the conference on this bill is concluded. 
   Based on information to be provided by the Department and the General Accounting Office and Inspector General, the final version of the bill may include: (1) a dollar ceiling on credit card transactions; and (2) strict limits on using credit cards to make large contract payments. 
   I hope that is possible. 
   There will be no improvement in the dismal DOD financial management picture without reform--and some pressure from this Committee and the other committees of Congress. 
   We need to lean on the Pentagon bureaucrats to make it happen. 
   Without reform, the vast effort dedicated to auditing the annual financial statements will be a wasted effort. 
   The bill before us will hopefully establish a solid foundation--and create a new environment--where financial management reform can begin to happen. 
   In doing what we are doing, I hope we are providing the Pentagon with the wherewithal to get the job done. 
   The reforms in the bill are not new or dramatic. 
   In my mind, it's basic accounting 101 stuff: DOD needs to record financial transactions in the books of account as they occur. Now, that's not complicated or difficult, but it's the essential first step. And it's not being done today. 
   The Committee is telling DOD to get on the stick and do what it's already supposed to be doing--under the law. And it calls for some accountability to help get the job done. 
   The language in this bill--I hope--will get DOD moving toward a ``clean'' audit opinion. 
   I hope that's where we are headed. 
   And there is another important reason why DOD financial reform is needed today. 
   As I stated right up front, we are looking at the first big increase in defense spending since 1985. 
   I think this Committee needs to be on the record, telling the Pentagon to get its financial house in order. 
   If the Pentagon wants all this extra money, then the Pentagon needs to fulfill its Constitutional responsibility to the taxpayers of this country. 
   First, it needs to regain control of the taxpayers' money it's spending right now. 
   And second, it needs to be able to provide a full and accurate accounting of how all the money gets spent. 
   DOD must be able to present an accurate and complete accounting of all financial transactions--including all receipts and expenditures. It needs to be able to do this once a year--accurately and completely. 
   The GAO and IG auditors should be able to examine the department's books and its financial statements and render a ``clean'' audit opinion. 
   That's the goal. 
   I want to see us reach that goal reached in my lifetime. 
   Mr. President, I would like to extend a special word of thanks to the entire Armed Service Committee for helping me with my DOD financial management reform initiative. 
   I would like to thank the committee for helping to push the Pentagon in the right direction--toward sound financial management practices. 
   I would like to thank the Committee Chairman, Senator WARNER, and his Subcommittee Chairman, Senator INHOFE, for throwing their weight behind the effort. 
   I would like to thank them for working with me and helping me craft an acceptable piece of legislation. 
   Mr. President, in my mind, DOD financial management reform is mandatory as we move to larger DOD budgets. 
   Higher defense budgets need to be hooked up to financial reforms--just  like a horse and buggy--one behind the other. They need to move together.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. 
   Mr. President, today I am being joined by Senator FEINSTEIN in introducing the ``Tax Relief for Working Americans Act of 1999''. Congresswoman NANCY JOHNSON is introducing companion legislation in the House. We're here today to declare victory in the debate over whether or not we should have significant tax relief for the American people. The President and most congressional Democrats have now joined Republicans in support of cutting taxes. The question now is not whether there should be tax cuts, but what kind, and how much. I can't think of a better problem to have. 
   With our core tax cut plan, we're proposing a major first step in sending hard-earned dollars out of Washington and back to the taxpayer. I support an across the board tax cut. But, I'm afraid that if we do that first, we won't have any money left over to pay for tax cuts that people are telling me they really want, like addressing the marriage penalty, providing health care tax relief, and more help for education. They want these problems in the tax code fixed first. An across the board cut won't fix these problems, it'll only compound them. That isn't fair. And we're saying fairness should come first. 
   The President only offered modest tax cuts, along with a new retirement savings proposal that nobody understands, and many question whether it will work. And then, he wants to raise other taxes to pay for it. The President wants it both ways. He wants to be able to take credit for a tax cut on the one hand, while he's raising taxes on the other. We deserve what we get, if we let him get away with the double talk we all know so well. 
   We have two alternatives. One is to push for an across the board tax cut first, and let the President and some in Congress play the class warfare card they play so well. And in the end, we probably end up with no tax relief. Senator FEINSTEIN and I are saying that we should take the initiative and push for major tax relief that people really want and both Republicans and Democrats support. Our package will provide close to $300 billion in tax relief over ten years. I, for one, view this as a very strong starting point in determining how the coming on-budget surplus will be used. 
   Among other things, our bill will provide tax relief for senior citizens, those who are married, those who need to buy their own health insurance, and those who purchase long-term care insurance. Moreover, it will include provisions to ensure that parents who make use of education or child care tax credits are not hurt by the Alternative Minimum Tax. We also hope to improve the living standards of Americans through tax relief for urban revitalization, rural preservation, rental housing, and economic growth. We also provide needed tax assistance to farmers by shielding them from the Alternative Minimum Tax, and allowing them to set up special tax-deferred savings accounts to help them weather the ups and downs of farming. And, we help improve the environment by extending the production tax credit for wind energy and expanding the credit for biomass. I've strongly supported both of these alternative energies since taking the lead on them back in 1992. 
   We think this package is a good start in the process of delivering tax relief to the American people, and I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there is a saying that success is the repetition of meaningful acts day after day. The most successful individuals identify a single purpose and work toward that cause in any capacity they can find. 
   An Iowan named Ed Johnston perfectly fits this definition of success. Mr. Johnston, of Humboldt, Iowa, tirelessly devotes his days to helping people with disabilities. He serves on the Governor's Developmental Disabilities Council, a position he earned after immersing himself in learning about the agencies that serve those with disabilities. 
   Several days a week, he volunteers at the Humboldt County Courthouse to help people with special needs in five  surrounding counties. He interacts with legislators about the importance of providing proper job training to persons with disabilities. He offers his expertise when someone seeks a wheelchair ramp or assistive technology to accommodate a physical need. 
   Mr. Johnston brings the invaluable insight to his work of someone who has lived the life of the people he seeks to help. He himself has a physical disability, although no one would consider him limited in any way. 
   Those familiar with his work admire his compassion and persistence. He is able to navigate the layers of government agencies that sometimes appear impenetrable to those who need services. 
   Another impressive element of Mr. Johnston's advocacy work is that it is his second career. In the early 1990s, he retired after 38 years of running his own shoe repair business and devoted himself to his current vocation. 
   The Humboldt Independent newspaper called Mr. Johnston ``a man on the move.'' The description is accurate. He moves government agencies, legislators and his community to respond to the needs of persons with disabilities. At age 64, Mr. Johnston is the youngest of the Iowans I have honored during Older Americans Month. I wish him many more years of his priceless work.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Fairfield Ledger of Fairfield, IA, printed a photo of a newly married couple earlier this month. The groom is wearing a stylish suit and a wide smile. The equally resplendent bride has eyes only for her new husband. 
   The couple is picture-perfect, just like any other couple starting a new life together. Unlike any other couple, the groom in this case is age 102. 
   The Rev. Fred Robb of Washington, Iowa, married Fern Claxton, 25 years younger, at the Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Iowa, on April 9, 1999. The couple renewed an old friendship at the Rev. Robb's 100th birthday celebration in 1996. Among other meetings, they shared in the 100th birthday celebration of the minister's brother, Milt Robb, in January. 
   The Rev. Robb is one of more than 750 centenarians in Iowa. I don't know for a fact, but I'd bet many of them approach aging with the same positive spirit as the Rev. Robb. 
   I run into a lot of older Iowans who don't impose unnatural limits on themselves because of their age. They don't stop doing what's important to them just because the calendar reflects a certain milestone. These individuals are ageless, not due to the years they have lived but in their approach to life. One of my favorite examples of an ageless Iowan is a 92-year-old woman who was in a hurry because she said she had to deliver meals to the ``old people.'' 
   During Older Americans Month, I want to congratulate Fred and Fern Robb on their ageless spirit and wish them a happy life together. By defying the conventional wisdom that newlyweds must be young, the Robbs advance the theme of Older Americans Month: ``Honor the Past, Imagine the Future: Toward a Society for All Ages.''

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to draw the Senate's attention to a growing embarrassment in our efforts to support counter-drug programs in Mexico. The story would be funny if it weren't so serious and had not been going on for so long. 
   In 1996, the Department of Defense began the process of giving 73 surplus UH-1H helicopters--Hueys--to Mexico to assist in counter smuggling operations. The President approved this transfer in September and the helicopters began arriving in December. 
   The main justification at the time for this contribution was to stop major air smuggling into Mexico. The Colombian and Mexican drug cartels were flying large quantities of drugs into Mexico in private airplanes. Sometimes these were multiple flights, sometimes single ones. Usually they were twin-engine propeller-driven aircraft, but occasionally they were larger, commercial-sized cargo jets. Earlier in the 1990's, the U.S. State Department had instituted a program with Mexico's Attorney General of developing a helicopter-based interdiction force. One can only assume that DoD sought to engage Mexico's military in a similar way. Somewhere along the way, however, something went wrong. 
   Here's one for the books. We have a civilian State Department program with the civilian Attorney General's office in Mexico operating an air force that works. And we have the U.S. military operating a program with the Mexican military to operate an air force that doesn't work. 
   It not only doesn't work, it does not have a purpose, so far as I can tell. I have asked the GAO to look at this issue twice, and they have had a problem in identifying a purpose or results. 
   I have asked the Defense Department and it seems to be stumped as well. The Mexican Government is puzzled. We ought to be dumbfounded. 
   Today, none of the 70-plus helicopters is flying. No one can tell me when they might be flying. No one seems to know how many might fly if they ever do. No one seems to know what they are to do if they do fly. It is unclear how they will be maintained. Or how much it will cost. Or who is going to pay. Since no one knows the answer to any of these questions, no one can tell me how many helicopters might be needed. Is 70 too many? No one knows. Is this any way to run a airline? 
   I cannot seem to get a straightforward answer from the Administration about what the plan for these helicopters is. As one U.S. embassy official noted to my staff last year, what to do with and about the helicopters is a muddle. It is a muddle all right; but it is one of our making. 
   When plans were first announced about putting these helicopters in Mexico, I began asking about the need for radars. Mexico lacks any sustained radar coverage of its southern approaches. If you are planning an air interdiction program, it would seem logical to include a plan for developing the eyes needed to make the program work. The response I got from both U.S. and Mexican officials to questions about radars was a deafening silence. Or vague promises. I kept asking. Finally, after about six months, the U.S. and Mexican Administrations informed me that no radars were necessary. And why? Because there was no longer a major air trafficking threat; it was mostly maritime. And when did we know there was no longer a major air threat? In 1995. And when did we give Mexico the helicopters? In 1996. So far as I can tell, we gave Mexico a capability to deal with a problem that both countries knew we no longer faced. Today the threat is mostly maritime. So why helicopters? 
   Well, having taken that on board, the next question is, what are we going to have the helicopters do? It turns out that the best idea is to have them ferry troops around to chop poppies or marijuana. But this is mostly in the mountains and the helos aren't very capable in the mountains. And how many helos are needed? It turns out there is no very clear answer. But before we got very far down that road, a problem was discovered that grounded all Hueys in 1998. This necessitated a worldwide assessment of the air worthiness of the equipment. Although this was eventually done, the Mexican military refused to fly the helicopters until they had more assurances that there were no air safety questions. They also wanted more resources to fly the equipment. So nothing was done and the helos sit. 
   As it happens, Hueys are old, Vietnam War-vintage aircraft. They are still serviceable, but they are aging and need a lot of care and feeding. It is also harder to get spare parts for them. 
   And being old, they are sometimes cranky. We gave Mexico 73 of these birds in the spirit of cooperation. So, today, the helos in Mexico have been on the ground becoming very expensive museum-quality memorials to the United States-Mexican partnership. While they sit, the air crews' qualifications for flying the equipment is in doubt. So even if we could get the birds up tomorrow, it is not clear that the air crews are qualified to fly them. And we still aren't sure what they are supposed to do if we did. We are not even sure at this point if the Mexicans still want the helos. 
   It is in this environment that I have asked the Department of Defense to provide me and Congress with a plan. Since no one in the past two to three years seems to have a clue about what we are doing, I think it is reasonable and prudent to have a plan on the  record. This is not rocket science. But so far, I have not had much luck. Now, you would think that there would already be a plan. 
   Given the importance of our drug cooperation with Mexico it would not be unreasonable to expect one. We have bilateral agreements. We have binational strategies. We have joint measures of effectiveness. We have had ``high-level contact group'' meetings at great public expense to both countries. But apparently we have no plan. We have had recently several Administration visits to Mexico and more discussions. But there is no plan. The administration cannot seem to tell the difference between ``talking'' and a ``plan.'' 
   I, for one, do not think that this is a situation we can accept any longer. After three years of asking, one has to begin to wonder just what it is we think we are doing. I have not mentioned the C-26 airplanes that we gave to Mexico and other countries for which there appears to be just as much lack of thinking. That is for another time. But there is one more piece to the helicopter story. 
   As of last week, a new problem has developed and all Hueys are grounded again. This doesn't affect the helicopters in Mexico since they weren't flying anyway, but it leaves us even more in doubt. The result is an embarrassment for both countries. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, May happens to be Older Americans Month. I believe we should honor older Americans through this month, not only because my State of Iowa has many fine senior citizens whom I am very willing and happy to talk about because of their contributions to our State and our society, but also because I am chairman of the Aging Committee. 
   It may be human nature to overlook the hardships of previous generations. We do not think about suffering that we do not have to endure, and that is the way it should be. That is the way  we hope it is and it is the hope of American innovators who work to ease the misfortunes for our children and grandchildren. 
   One of those innovators is a 101-year-old woman from Sioux City, IA. Louise Humphrey was a leading light in the battle against polio, one of the most terrifying illnesses of our century. Because of her work and the work of others devoted to finding a cure, polio is almost nonexistent in our country. 
   It is hard for anyone who did not live through the forties and fifties to understand fully the fear and hysteria which accompanied the polio epidemic during any particular summer. The disease was highly contagious and sometimes fatal. It attacked the lungs and limbs. It immobilized its victims. It made them struggle for breath and often forced them to breathe through mechanical iron lungs. Parents would not allow their children to go swimming or to drink out of public fountains for fear of contagion. 
   Those children fortunate enough to escape the illness saw their classmates return to school in the fall in leg braces and watched newsreels of people in iron lungs. 
   At the height of the epidemic in the 1940s and early 1950s, polio struck between 20,000 to 50,000 Americans each year. In 1 year, 1952, 58,000 people caught the disease. Most of these people were children.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am joining my colleagues, Senators CONRAD, HATCH, and HARKIN in support of a concurrent resolution establishing the Sense of Congress regarding Medicare beneficiaries access to chiropractic services under the Medicare+Choice program. In 1997, Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) which established the Medicare+Choice program. The BBA required that all benefits covered under traditional Medicare be guaranteed under Medicare+Choice. However, it has come to our attention that chiropractic coverage is not being ensured under the regulations. 
   Under traditional Medicare, beneficiaries can go to a chiropractor for manual manipulation to the spine which is a covered benefit under Part B. Under the regulations for Medicare+Choice plans, this benefit is covered. However, access to chiropractors for this benefit is not guaranteed. Unfortunately, some Medicare+Choice plans have interpreted this omission to mean they no longer need to cover chiropractic services for this benefit, which is most commonly provided by chiropractors. The result is that beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare+Choice are losing access to chiropractic services, a situation clearly not intended by Congress. 
   The concurrent resolution I am cosponsoring today would clarify congressional intent regarding guaranteed coverage to chiropractic services under the Medicare+Choice program. Medicare beneficiaries should have the same benefits required by law under traditional fee-for-service as they do under Medicare+Choice. If beneficiaries can receive care for manual manipulation by a chiropractor under Part B, then they should have this same right under Medicare+Choice. 
   I urge you to join me and my colleagues in support of this resolution.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday, Senator CONRAD, and Representatives NUSSLE and BOSWELL helped me stand up for American agriculture. 
   Agriculture is capital intensive. As a family farmer myself, I know you can't put your love of the land to work if you don't have the resources to get started. 
   My colleagues and I introduced a bipartisan bicameral bill that will expand opportunities for beginning farmers who are in need of low interest loans for capital purchases of farmland and equipment. This legislation is called the ``Agricultural Bond Enhancement Act.'' 
   Back in the early 1980s, I realize the federal government needed to do more to provide young farmers an opportunity to start farming. In 1981, I pushed for pilot projects to establish the Aggie Bond program. After temporarily reauthorizing the program many times I succeeded in making the Beginning Farmer Loan Program permanent in the 103rd Congress. 
   Current law permits state authorities to issue tax exempt bonds and to loan the proceeds from the sale of the bonds to beginning farmers and ranchers to finance the cost of acquiring land, buildings and equipment used in a farm or ranch operation. The tax-exempt nature of the Aggie Bonds provides a below-market interest rate on the loan made to the farmer or rancher. 
   The program has been very successful, especially in my home state of Iowa. Since the beginning of the program in 1981, more than 2,600 Iowans have taken advantage of this opportunity. Iowa's program has provided over $260 million in qualified beginning loans and the default rate has only been 1.5% of the total number of loans. I believe most ag lenders would agree those are very good numbers. 
   We have an opportunity to make the Beginning Farmer Loan Program even better. Currently, Aggie Bonds are subjected to a volume cap. That puts them in competition with industrial projects for bond allocation. This is the problem we would like to remedy. 
   Aggie Bonds share few similarities to Industrial Revenue Bonds and should not be subjected to the same volume cap. Insufficient funding due to the volume cap limits the effectiveness of this program. 
   The solution: amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt small issue bonds for agriculture from the State volume cap. 
   During the past three years the Iowa Agricultural Development Authority has consistently used all of the $24 million bond allocation it was allowed. Some beginning farmers had to sit idle until the next year to close their loan, or pay a higher interest rate if they closed their loan without the bond. 
   We cannot afford to stand by and allow the next generation of family farmers to lose out on an opportunity to start farming. The average age of America's family farmers continues to climb. 
   Deserving young farmers should not be forced to compete against industry for reduced interest loans. 
   The ``Agricultural Bond Enhancement Act'' will open the door to more young farmers and help cultivate the next crop of family farmers in the 21st century.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to allow Regine Beatie Edwards, an 18 year old German-born legal resident of the United States, to realize her lifelong dream of becoming a United States citizen. 
   Miss Edwards is the adopted daughter of Mr. Stan Edwards, a U.S. citizen who married Regine's mother while engaged in military service in Germany. Regine moved to the United States with her mother on October 16th, 1994. In 1997, Mr. Edwards contacted the INS on several occasions, attempting to obtain the proper form to apply for Regine's naturalization. The INS sent Mr. Edwards form N-643, Application for Certificate in Behalf of an Adopted Child. The INS informed Mr. Edwards that the adoption had to be completed by the time Regine turned 18. The adoption was completed on January 13th, 1997, when Regine was 16 1/2 years of age. Mr. Edwards delivered Regine's application to the INS office in Omaha, Nebraska on March 27, 1998. 
   The INS reported in January of 1998 that the application was to be denied since the adoption of Ms. Edwards had not been completed prior to her 16th birthday, and therefore form N-643 was the incorrect form for application. Previously, the INS had told Mr. Edwards that the adoption need only be completed by Regine's 18th birthday. The INS then refunded to Mr. Edwards the application fee and informed him that, because of her age, Regine met only three of four qualifications to apply for citizenship. Had the INS told the Edwards that Regine needed to be adopted by the age of 16 in order to qualify for citizenship, the Edwards would have expedited the adoption process, and Regine would be closer to her dream of citizenship. 
   This bill, passed during the last Congress by the Senate but not acted on by the House, would reclassify Regine as a child pursuant to section 101(b)(1) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, thereby allowing the processing of her citizenship application. 
   Regine has stated that it has always been a goal of hers to live in the United States, and to become a citizen of, as she puts it, ``a land of freedom and individual opportunity to seek out your dreams and realize them.'' It would be tragic if we were to let a simple mistake on the part of the INS prevent such a promising young woman from becoming a U.S. citizen. I urge my fellow colleagues to support Regine by allowing her to make her dream of U.S. citizenship a reality.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, along with my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator FEINGOLD, I am introducing the Motor Vehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration Fairness Act. 
   Over the years, I have been in the forefront of promoting alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms to encourage alternatives to litigation when disputes arise. Such legislation includes the permanent use of ADR by federal agencies. Last year we also passed legislation to authorize federal court-annexed arbitration. These statutes are based, in part, on the premise that arbitration should be voluntary rather than mandatory. 
   While arbitration often serves an important function as an efficient alternative to court some trade offs must be considered by both parties, such as limited judicial review and less formal procedures regarding discovery and rules of evidence. When mandatory binding arbitration is forced upon a party, for example when it is placed in a boiler-plate agreement, it deprives the weaker party the opportunity to elect any other forum. As a proponent of arbitration I believe it is critical to ensure that the selection of arbitration is voluntary and fair. 
   Unequal bargaining power exists in contracts between automobile and truck dealers and their manufacturers. The manufacturer drafts the contract and presents it to dealers with no opportunity to negotiate. Increasingly these manufacturers are including compulsory binding arbitration in their agreements, and dealers are finding themselves with no choice but to accept it. If they refuse to sign the contract they have no franchise. This clause then binds the dealer to arbitration as the exclusive procedure for resolving any dispute. The purpose of arbitration is to reduce costly, time-consuming litigation, not to force a party to an adhesion contract to waive access to judicial or administrative forums for the pursuit of rights under state law. 
   I am extremely concerned with this industry practice that conditions the granting or keeping of motor vehicle franchises on the acceptance of mandatory and binding arbitration. While several states have enacted statutes to protect weaker parties in ``take it or leave it'' contracts and attempted to prevent this type of inequitable practice, these state laws have been held to conflict with the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). 
   In 1925, when the FAA was enacted to make arbitration agreements enforceable in federal courts, it did not expressly provide for preemption of state law. Nor is there any legislative history to indicate Congress intended to occupy the entire field of arbitration. However, in 1984 the Supreme Court interpreted the FAA to preempt state law in Southland Corporation versus Keating. Thus, state laws that protect weaker parties from being forced to accept arbitration and to waive state rights (such as Iowa's law prohibiting manufacturers from requiring dealers to submit to mandatory binding arbitration) are preempted by the FAA. 
   With mandatory binding arbitration agreements becoming increasingly common in motor vehicle franchise agreements, now is the time to eliminate the ambiguity in the FAA statute. The purpose of the legislation Senator FEINGOLD and I are introducing is to ensure that in disputes between manufacturers and dealers, both parties must voluntarily elect binding arbitration. This approach would continue to recognize arbitration as a valuable alternative to court--but would provide an option to pursue other forums such as administrative bodies that have been established in a majority of states, including Iowa, to handle dealer/manufacturer disputes. 
   This legislation will go a long way toward ensuring that parties will not be forced into binding arbitration and thereby lose important statutory rights. I am confident that given its many advantages arbitration will often be elected. But it is essential for public policy reasons and basic fairness that both parties to this type of contract have the freedom to make their own decisions based on the circumstances of the case. 
   I urge my colleagues to join Senator FEINGOLD and myself in supporting this legislation to address this unfair franchise practice. 
   .Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with my distinguished colleague from Iowa, Senator GRASSLEY, the ``Motor Vehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration Fairness Act of 1999.'' 
   While alternative methods of dispute resolution such as arbitration can serve a useful purpose in resolving disputes between parties, I am extremely concerned by the increasing trend of stronger parties to a contract forcing weaker parties to waive their rights and agree to arbitrate any future disputes that may arise. Earlier this Congress, I introduced S. 121, the Civil Rights Procedures Protection Act, to amend certain civil rights statutes to prevent the involuntary imposition of arbitration to claims that arise from unlawful employment discrimination and sexual harassment. 
   It has come to my attention that the automobile and truck manufacturers, which often present dealers with ``take it or leave it'' contracts, are increasingly including mandatory and binding arbitration clauses as a condition of entering into or maintaining an auto or truck franchise. This practice forces dealers to submit their disputes with manufacturers to arbitration. As a result, dealers are required to waive access to judicial or administrative forums, substantive contract rights, and statutorily provided protection. In short, this practice clearly violates the dealers' fundamental due process rights  and runs directly counter to basic principles of fairness. 
   Franchise agreements for auto and truck dealerships are typically not negotiable between the manufacturer and the dealer. The dealer accepts the terms offered by the manufacturer, or it loses the dealership. Plain and simple. Dealers, therefore, have been forced to rely on the states to pass laws designed to balance the manufacturers' far greater bargaining power and to safeguard the rights of dealers. The first state automobile statute was enacted in my home state of Wisconsin in 1937 to protect citizens from injury caused when a manufacturer or distributor induced a Wisconsin citizen to invest considerable sums of money in dealership facilities, and then canceled the dealership without cause. Since then, all states except Alaska have enacted substantive law to balance the enormous bargaining power enjoyed by manufacturers over dealers and to safeguard small business dealers from unfair automobile and truck manufacturer practices. 
   A little known fact is that under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), arbitrators are not required to apply the particular federal or state law that would be applied by a court. That enables the stronger party--in this case the auto or truck manufacturer--to use arbitration to circumvent laws specifically enacted to regulate the dealer/manufacturer relationship. Not only is the circumvention of these laws inequitable, it also eliminates the deterrent to prohibited acts that state law provides. 
   The majority of states have created their own alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and forums with access to auto industry expertise that provide inexpensive, efficient, and non-judicial resolution of disputes. For example, in Wisconsin mandatory mediation is required before the start of an administrative hearing or court action. Arbitration is also an option if both parties agree. These state dispute resolution forums, with years of experience and precedent, are greatly responsible for the small number of manufacture-dealer lawsuits. When mandatory binding arbitration is included in dealer agreements, these specific state laws and forums established to resolve auto dealer and manufacturer disputes are effectively rendered null and void with respect to dealer agreements. 
   Besides losing the protection of federal and state law and the ability to use state forums, there are numerous reasons why a dealer may not want to agree to binding arbitration. Arbitration lacks some of the important safeguards and due process offered by administrative procedures and the judicial system: (1) arbitration lacks the formal court supervised discovery process often necessary to learn facts and gain documents; (2) an arbitrator need not follow the rules of evidence; (3) arbitrators generally have no obligation to provide factual or legal discussion of the decision in a written opinion: and (4) arbitration often does not allow for judicial review. 
   The most troubling problem with this sort of mandatory binding arbitration is the absence of judicial review. Take for instance a dispute over a dealership termination. To that dealer--that small business person--this decision is of commercial life or death importance. Even under this scenario, the dealer would not have recourse to substantive judicial review of the arbitrators' ruling. Let me be very clear on this point; in most circumstances an arbitration award cannot be vacated, even if the arbitration panel disregarded state law that likely would have produced a different result. 
   The use of mandatory binding arbitration is increasing in many industries, but nowhere is it growing more steadily than the auto/truck industry. Currently, at least 11 auto and truck manufacturers require some form of such arbitration in their dealer contracts. 
   In recognition of this problem, many states have enacted laws to prohibit the inclusion of mandatory binding arbitration clauses in certain agreements. The Supreme Court, however, held in Southland Corp. v. Keating, 104 S. Ct. 852 (1984), that the FAA by implication preempts these state laws. This has the effect of nullifying many state arbitration laws that were designed to protect weaker parties in unequal bargaining positions from involuntarily signing away their rights. 
   The legislative history of the FAA indicates that Congress never intended to have the Act used by a stronger party to force a weaker party into binding arbitration. Congress certainly did not intend the FAA to be used as a tool to coerce parties to relinquish important protections and rights that would have been afforded them by the judicial system. Unfortunately, this is precisely the current situation. 
   Although contract law is generally the province of the states, the Supreme Court's decision in Southland Corp. has in effect made any state action on this issue moot. Therefore, along with Senator GRASSLEY, I am introducing this bill today to ensure that dealers are not coerced into waiving their rights. Our bill, the Motor Vehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration Fairness Act of 1999 would simply provide that each party to an auto or truck franchise contract would have the choice to select arbitration. The bill would not prohibit arbitration. On the contrary, the bill would encourage arbitration by making it a fair choice that both parties to a franchise contract may willingly and knowingly select. In short, this bill would ensure that the decision to arbitrate is truly voluntary and that the rights and remedies provided for by our judicial system are not waived under coercion. 
   In effect, if small business owners today want to obtain or keep their auto or truck franchise, they may be able to do so only by relinquishing their statutory rights and foreclosing the opportunity to use the courts or administrative forums. Mr. President, I cannot say this more strongly--this is unacceptable; this is wrong. It is at great odds with our tradition of fair play. I therefore urge my colleagues to join in this bipartisan effort to put an end to this invidious practice.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I serve as chairman of the Senate Aging Subcommittee and I feel a necessity to inform my colleagues about the issue of rumors about the pending bankruptcy of some nursing home chains in the United States. 
   There are reports in the press, and in discussions with my colleagues I have received information, indicating that one and possibly two large nursing home chains may be facing bankruptcy in the near future. That has an economic side and it has a human side. I will speak first about the human side. 
   Should one or both of these nursing home chains go bankrupt, we would have an immediate challenge to ensure the continued care of somewhere between 35,000 residents, on the one hand, and 70,000, on the other, in these respective homes where they are currently under care. This would be a significant task. Nursing home residents are frail and are not easily moved. Moving them runs the risk of causing ``transfer trauma,'' a condition that can result in death. Therefore, it is critical that we keep focused on preventing avoidable harm and take precautions to prevent this from happening. 
   I have introduced legislation to ensure that the quality of patient care is monitored if there would be bankruptcy. My legislation requires the appointment of an ombudsman to act as an advocate for the patient. This change will ensure that bankruptcy judges are fully aware of all the facts when they guide a health care provider through the process of bankruptcy. Prior to a chapter 11 filing, or immediately thereafter, the debtor employs a health care crisis consultant to help it in its reorganization effort. The first step is usually cutting costs. Sometimes this step may result in a lower quality of care for the patients who live there. The appointment, then, of an ombudsman, should balance the interests between the creditor and the patient. These interests need balancing because the court-appointed officials owe fiduciary duties to creditors and the estate but not necessarily to the patients. 
   There will be occasions which illustrate that what may be in the best interest of creditors may not always be consistent with the patients' best interest. The trustee's interest, for example, is to maximize the amount of the estate to pay off the creditors. The more assets the trustee disburses, the more his payment will be. On the other hand, the ombudsman for the patient is designed to ensure continued quality of care at least above some minimum standards. Such quality of care standards currently exist throughout the health care environment, from the health care facility itself to State standards and even Federal standards that were adopted in 1987. 
   I would like to have my colleagues consider the following excerpt from the Los Angeles Times on September 28, 1997, which describes the unconscionable, pathetic, and traumatizing consequences of a sudden nursing home closing because of bankruptcy:  
   It could not be determined Saturday how many more elderly or chronically ill patients may be affected by the health care company's financial problems. Those at the Reseda Care Center in the San Fernando Valley, including a 106-year-old woman, were rolled into the streets late Friday in wheelchairs and on hospital beds, bundled in blankets as relatives scurried to gather up clothes and other personal belongings. 
   The presence of an ombudsman should help prevent a recurrence of instances similar to what I just described, where trustees quickly close health care facilities without notifying appropriate state and federal agencies and without notifying the bankruptcy court. 
   I began discussions with the Health Care Financing Administration at the beginning of April to urge them to take seriously the rumors we were hearing about possible nursing home bankruptcies and to encourage them to make preparations. I called for contingency plans that would prepare, well in advance, for the daunting challenges bankruptcies would pose to various federal and state agencies. HCFA briefed the staff of the Aging Committee, as well as staff from the Finance Committee and Budget Committee. While the HCFA staff appreciated the severity and size of the problem of ensuring resident safety in the event of a bankruptcy, they did not have a plan--or even a plan for a plan. 
   I wrote to the HCFA Administrator urging her to take the effort very seriously, to keep at the planning and to stay in touch with my office. Only on April 28th did I hear from her office  that we could expect to see the plan in the next two weeks. That is why I wrote to her again on April 29, to tell her to get on with the effort and to let me and interested Members know of the plan to ensure that the people in the affected nursing homes will be protected. 
   Once we are assured that residents will be safe we can turn to the financial part of the bankruptcies. Now I will address these financial issues. 
   Before we take any action involving the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars, we should ask, and get solid answers to, some critical questions. 
   The first is this: if the rumors of financial distress are true, how is it that some providers are in such distress while others seem not to be? What factors have put certain companies at particular risk? The answer to that question will go a long way to help us know what kind of response their situation demands. 
   At this point, I'd like to make an observation about the Medicare element of this situation. 
   This is in response to the one excuse you are going to find from some of these changes why something ought to be done in the balanced budget amendment of 1997.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to achieve one of my primary objectives as chairman of the Special Committee on Aging: to help workers and retirees achieve a secure retirement. 
   As with any discussion about retirement planning, it is the norm to point to the ``three-legged stool'' of retirement--Social Security, personal savings, and a pension. Unfortunately, the legs of the stool may be getting warped. 
   This legislation is the result of a hearing held by the Aging Committee in the 105th Congress. The Aging Committee confronted an issue that is affecting hundreds of thousands of workers and retirees--miscalculation of their hard-earned pensions. This hearing was intended to raise consumer awareness about the need to be pro-active about policing your pension. As one of our witnesses said, ``never assume your pension is error-free.'' 
   While it is impossible to know how many pension payments and lump sum distributions may be miscalculated, we know the number is on the rise. An audit conducted last Congress by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation--focused on plans that were voluntarily terminated--showed that the number of people underpaid has increased from 2.8 to 8.2 percent. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the number of people receiving lump sum distributions who end up getting shortchanged could be 15 to 20 percent. Those numbers are very disturbing. The practical impact is that retirees, and young and old workers alike, are losing dollars that they have earned. 
   Workers and retirees need to be aware that they are at risk. They can help themselves by knowing how their benefits are calculated, that they should keep all the documents their employer gives them, and to start asking questions at a young age--don't wait until the eve of retirement. 
   Unfortunately, policing your pension is not easy. Employers are trying to do a good job but they are confronted with one of the most complex regulatory schemes in the Federal Government. Pensions operate in a complex universe of laws, rules, and regulations. Over the last 20 years, 16 laws have been enacted that require employers to amend their pension plans and then notify their workers of changes. It is not a simple task. If employers have problems trying to comply with Federal requirements, it is understandable that workers and retirees are having trouble getting a grasp on how their pension works. 
   Trying to educate yourself about pensions implies that someone is out there providing information to those who need it. That is where the legislation that I am introducing today comes in. People who are concerned about their pensions--whether it's an unintentional mistake or outright fraud--often don't have anywhere to go for expert advice. 
   Fortunately, there is an answer. Already authorized by the Older Americans Act, seven pension counseling projects have assisted thousands of people around this country with their pension problems. These projects provide information and counseling to retirees, and young and old workers in a very cost-effective manner. 
   Each project received $75,000 of Federal assistance over a 17-month period. As is normal for other programs under the Older Americans Act, these dollars were supplemented by money raised from private sources. During their operation, the projects recovered nearly $2 million in pension benefits and payments. That is a return of $4 for every $1 spent. 
   My legislation contains three key provisions: first, it updates the Older Americans Act to encourage the creation of more pension counseling projects. While 10 projects in 15 states currently exist, they are not enough to reach the 80 million people who are covered by pensions in this country. Hopefully, more counseling projects can be established to provide more regionally comprehensive assistance. 
   Second, the legislation would create an 800 number that people could call for one-stop advice on where to get assistance. Jurisdiction over pension issues is spread across three government agencies--none of which are focused on helping individuals with individual problems--especially if the problem does not seem to be a clear fiduciary breach or indicate that there may be criminal wrongdoing. An 800 number linking people to assistance will help close that gap. 
   Finally, the legislation would transfer authority for the demonstration  projects to Title VII of the Older Americans Act in order to make them permanent in nature. They provide a much needed service to workers and retirees. These demonstration projects have existed since 1992 and have proven to be very successful. However, they have outgrown their pilot-project beginnings and should become a permanent fixture. 
   I want to thank Senator BREAUX for his support of this legislation. Furthermore, I encourage all of my colleagues to support these projects and show their support by co-sponsoring this legislation.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, since 1963, May has traditionally been designated Older Americans Month. I would like to take this opportunity to thank these valuable citizens and share an article that was recently printed in the Des Moines Register. The author reminds us of the many contributions older Americans make to our communities. 
   As we prepare for one of the largest demographic shifts in the history of our nation, we as policy makers often focus on the challenges presented by a graying nation. However, as suggested by Francis Keith in his article, ``Celebrate the Old Folks, Iowa's Assets,'' it would be a shame not to take the time to recognize and appreciate the vital role that seniors play in our communities. 
   Today more than ever, seniors are continuing to play active roles in their communities. In my home state of Iowa, I know many seniors who perform both paid and volunteer work well into their later years. Their wisdom and experience are a valuable resource that we should not allow to go to waste. 
   Mr. Marion Tierney, of Des Moines, Iowa recently spoke at an Aging Committee event. He is a perfect example of an older American who continues to be an active participant in his community. He made a career change half a lifetime ago because he was looking for a new challenge in sales and increased earning potential. Today, at the age of eighty, he serves nearly 100 customers of Iowa Machinery and Supply. 
   In a highly competitive business, Mr. Tierney says hard work is the key to success. He brings know-how, experience, relationships, and trust to customers as he assists them in developing solutions to improve their productivity through the use of his company's industrial products. He stays on top of new technology and products and retrains frequently to effectively meet customer needs. In turn, his field experience helps the company decide which new product lines to acquire. 
   His employer cites Mr. Tierney's willingness to share knowledge and experience with younger salesmen as a major contribution to the business. 
   Mr. Tierney is just one example of the many contributions older Americans make to their communities. I hope you will join me in honoring Mr. Tierney and all Older Americans for their many contributions. Not just during the month of May, but all year long.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today with deep concern over the Clinton Administration's policy regarding Yugoslavia and Kosovo. 
   I have observed, over the past year, an Administration policy characterized by a lack of vision regarding events in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In recent months, the American public has seen the conflict in Kosovo explode onto the front pages of newspapers and dominate primetime television news. This conflict, however, is not new. It stems from centuries of tension and a decade of deteriorating relations between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo, made worse because of Slobodan Milosevic's rule over the country. 
   I do not want to downplay the seriousness of Milosevic's action in Kosovo. Milosevic has treated the Kosovar Alabnians in a barbarous manner. But, have NATO airstrikes solved this problem? No. And the sad fact is: United States policy has--if nothing else--unfortunately speeded up Milosevic's campaign of terror in Kosovo. 
   And now, with our men and women risking their lives over the skies and on the ground in the Balkan region--we must take time to evaluate past policy and determine how best to move forward toward peace while making wise use of limited military resources. 
   Military intervention should be the method of last resort in any conflict. Once all efforts have been made to resolve a conflict peaceably--the only way to conduct military operations is with a clear vision of goals to be achieved--goals backed up by sound military advice, common-sense wisdom with maximum objectivity based upon factual evidence. 
   I follow the Colin Powell doctrine on military operations--you should not get into a military situation you don't know how to exit. In other words, have plans on how you're going to get out of the situation. And, if you do initiate a military operation--you should go in at the beginning with enough force to ensure victory. 
   A critical miscalculation in Clinton's Kosovo policy was the president's outright statement that ground troops would not be introduced into the region. It was an impassioned, emphatic statement. And it signaled to the world that--right out of the gate--the United States was not serious about this mission. Not only were the military goals vague, but the means to achieve those goals were laid out clearly for Slobodan Milosevic to see. Milosevic knew he had time to further his own twisted goals in Kosovo and has succeeded in wreaking havoc on the region while dodging NATO missiles. 
   Therefore, we are in a situation where ``gradualism'' is being practiced. This was Clinton's only way of his misstatement regarding ground troops. I say ``gradualism'' because the Administration has already set the stage for troops to be on the ground--regardless of what Congress says about it. First, United States ground forces were sent to surrounding countries to aid in humanitarian efforts. They were followed up by support troops for air divisions--troops to support the Apache helicopter division--troops to support artillery to support the Apache helicopters. Soon, we will need troops on  the ground to protect troops already on the ground. I think it's fair to say we are in a ground war even though we don't have United States military forces on the ground within the geographical confines of Kosovo. 
   Today we are debating a resolution to give President Clinton the authority to use ``all necessary force'' to achieve Clinton Administration goals in Kosovo. I understand this resolution inadvertently triggered the War Powers Act, which requires a vote. But, the president not only hasn't asked for this broad-ranging authority, he still maintains it isn't needed. Some of my colleagues wish to affirm the president's authority regarding our involvement in Kosovo. I cannot support such a resolution. 
   I cannot support a policy lacking common sense. I cannot--with a clear conscience--provide limitless authority to an Administration which has failed to demonstrate an understanding of the consequences of its policies. We must have a defined goal--and I'm talking more defined than the United States diminishing Slobodan Milosevic's ``capacity to maintain his grip and impose his control on Kosovo.'' 
   What is our goal? To destroy all Yugoslav military forces and control the entire Federal Republic of Yugoslavia? To occupy Belgrade? To expel Milosevic's forces from Kosovo? 
   This resolution will not move us closer to a clear goal--a clear strategy. 
   I support our men and women who are risking their lives--even at this moment--for the sake of NATO's reputation and Clinton's military policy. I condemn Slobodan Milosevic's reprehensible actions in the Kosovo region. 
   I seek clear military goals and concise, appropriate communication from our nation's commander-in-chief. Congress and the people of the United States are waiting.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today we are taking a critical step toward saving Social Security. However, in considering this measure we are seeking to reaffirm provisions in the current law stating that money earmarked for Social Security should not be considered for purposes of the Federal budget. Furthermore, this measure would make it very difficult for this Congress and Administration, or future Congresses and Administrations, to use Social Security surpluses to achieve a balanced budget. 
   In his 1998 State of the Union address, the President pledged to save every penny of the Social Security surplus for Social Security. Many of us supported his pledge and worked not to spend Social Security surplus money. However, his fiscal year 2000 budget request would require the use of $158 billion in Social Security surplus money over the next five years. 
   The ``lockbox'' measure we are considering today would prohibit Congress or the President from spending Social Security trust fund money but would still allow Congress the flexibility needed in case unforeseen emergencies, such as a war or a recession, develop. It is vital that we take steps to exercise fiscal restraint so that we don't squander the surpluses necessary to enact improvements to the Social Security program which would enhance the retirement security of our children and grandchildren. 
   I believe that this is of critical importance in the path toward saving Social Security, so much so that I am missing a field hearing by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation back home in Iowa that Senator MCCAIN was gracious enough to hold on the difficulties Iowa faces with competition in the airline industry. Unfortunately, I can't be there right now, but I hope my being here to cast this vote supporting this proposal is a testament to the importance of taking steps to bring us closer to saving Social Security.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would modify our bankruptcy laws to deal with bankruptcies in the health care sector. According to testimony I received in the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, almost one-third of our hospitals could face foreclosure because they are not financially sound. And a number of nursing homes are in terrible financial trouble. I believe that chapter 11 and chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code could be vitally important in keeping troubled hospitals in business. The bill we are proposing will ensure that chapter 11 will work fairly and efficiently in the unfortunate event that we face a rash of health care bankruptcies. The bill will also make sure the health care businesses which liquidate under Chapter 7 don't just throw patients by the wayside in a rush to sell assets and pay creditors. 
   Currently, the Bankruptcy Code does an adequate job of helping debtors reorganize and helping creditors recover losses. However, the code does not provide protection for the interests of patients. This bill contains several important reforms to protect patients when health care providers declare bankruptcy. Specifically, the bill addresses the disposal of patient records, the costs associated with closing a health care business, the duty to transfer patients upon the closing of a health care facility and the appointment of an ombudsman to protect patient rights. 
   Section 102 covers the disposal of patient records. The legislation provides clear and specific guidance to trustees who may not be aware of state law requirements for maintaining the patient records or the confidentiality issues associated with patient records. Section 102 is necessary given the patient's need for the records and the apparent lack of clear instruction, whether statutory or otherwise, describing a proper procedure in dealing with patient records when closing a facility. 
   Section 103 brings the costs associated with closing a health care business, including any expenses incurred by disposing of patient records and transferring patients to another health care facility, within the administrative expense umbrella of the Bankruptcy Act. 
   Section 104 provides for an ombudsman to act as an advocate for the patient. This change will ensure that judges are fully aware of all the facts when they guide a health care provider through bankruptcy. Prior to a chapter 11 filing or immediately thereafter, the debtor employs a health care crisis consultant to help it in its reorganization effort. The first step is usually cutting costs. Sometimes, this step may result in a lower quality of patient care. The appointment of an ombudsman should balance the interests between the creditor and the patient. These interests need balancing because the court appointed professionals owe fiduciary duties to creditors and the estate but not necessarily to the patients. There will be occasions which illustrate that what may be in the best interest of creditors may not always be consistent with the patients' best interest. The trustee's interest, for example, is to maximize the amount of the estate to pay off the creditors. The more assets the trustees disburses, the more his payment will be. On the other hand, the ombudsman is designed to insure continued quality of care at least above some minimum standard. Such quality of care standards currently exist throughout the health care environment, from the health care facility itself to State standards and Federal standards. 
   Consider the following excerpt from the Los Angeles Times on September 28, 1997 which describes the unconscionable, pathetic, and traumatizing consequences of sudden nursing home closings:  
   It could not be determined Saturday how many more elderly and chronically ill patients may be affected by the health care company's financial problems. Those at the Reseda Care Center in the San Fernando Valley, including a 106-year-old woman, were rolled into the street late Friday in wheelchairs and on hospital beds, bundled in blankets as relatives scurried to gather up clothes and other personal belongings.  
   The presence of an ombudsman probably would result in fewer instances similar to what I just described, where trustees quickly close health care facilities without notifying appropriate state and federal agencies and without notifying the bankruptcy court. 
   Section 1105 requires a trustee to use reasonable and best efforts to transfer patients in the face of a health care business closing. This provision is both useful and necessary in that it outlines a trustee's duty with respect to a transfer of vulnerable patients. 
   For all these reasons, I urge you to join me and my colleagues in supporting this bill which will protect the interests of patients in health care bankruptcies.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I speak often about the threat that illegal drugs pose to our young people. Today, I want to address a serious problem from substances common in virtually every home in the country. There are several trends in substance abuse among young people that are happening literally under our noses. I want to address two substances that receive little attention but cause much pain and suffering. Most people are not familiar with the harms of either of these substances. However, our familiarity with and attention to these lethal substances is well overdue. The subject is: inhalants and GHB. 
   Inhalants are among the scariest substance being abused by teenagers today. Why? Because, kids have to go no further than their own kitchen cabinets to find them. Inhalants are everyday household products such as hair spray, cleaning fluids, air-fresheners, and whipped cream. More than 1,000 common household products have the potential to be abused. Kids are sniffing these easily obtainable household products to get a cheap high. In many cases, inhalants are used as an alternative to alcohol, clearly because young people don't have to break any laws to get them. Some see abuse of inhalants as a childish phase or youthful experimenting, but let me assure you ``inhalant abuse'' is deadly serious. 
   Inhalants kill hundreds of children each year. Since July of 1996, over 250 children have died from intentionally ingesting toxic fumes. Inhalants rank fourth among the substances abused by teens ages twelve to seventeen. Only alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana rank higher. In fact, inhalant abuse has gotten so bad that it is now considered a gateway drug. Like other gateway drugs, about one in five teens will try ``sniffing'' before they graduate. What is even more astounding is that inhalant abuse is a problem with children as young as eight; those in second grade. 
   Unfortunately, many do not acknowledge the severity of inhalant abuse until it is too late. A recent tragedy in a Philadelphia suburb demonstrated the lethal effects of inhalants when five sixteen-year-old girls were killed in a car accident. The coroner found that four of the five, including the driver, had ingested significant amounts of computer keyboard cleaner. Sadly, the girls were out shopping for dresses for a prom they will never attend. 
   The problem is that too many of us are unaware of the dangers of inhalants. According to a 1997 National Household Survey on Drugs, nine out of ten parents don't believe their children have ever abused inhalants. But surveys indicate that almost a half-a-million teens abuse inhalants every  month. In fact, of those parents who do talk to their kids about drugs, less than half address inhalant abuse. Why aren't we talking about a substance that starves the brain of oxygen to the point of suffocation? Why aren't we warning our kids that these household products can cause damage to the brain and nervous system? We can't expect a teenager to know the severity of sniffing unless we tell them. 
   We need to alert parents and kids to the dangers of inhalants. This is the reason Congress named the week of March 21 through March 27 as ``National Inhalants and Poisons Awareness Week''. It is evident to me that this kind of recognition is imperative to reducing inhalant abuse. We cannot lock up our kids. We cannot keep many items with the potential for abuse out of the world our young people inhabit. What we can and must do is to exercise more responsibility and pay closer attention. 
   Another substance that is consuming our youth is GHB. If you aren't familiar with this drug, it may be because there is little information available on its fatal effects. In fact, GHB was sold over the counter as a dietary supplement in health food stores until 1990. Today, advocates of GHB believe the drug is harmless and should continue to be sold over the counter. Unfortunately, a person doing research on the drug will find more information supporting the use of GHB rather than reporting the realistic effects of the drug. For this reason, GHB continues to be sold as a recreational drug and perceived as harmless. These perceptions have proved deadly for many. 
   GHB has become popular at parties known as ``Raves''. These all-night parties glamorize the use of drugs and alcohol. ``Ravers'' are taking GHB to feel relaxed, to loose their inhibitions, and to increase their sexual libidos. However, the truth is that too much GHB or GHB mixed with other drugs can cause seizures, comas, severe vomiting, and respiratory arrests. In addition, GHB causes amnesia. For this reason, it has been frequently used as a date rape drug. Unknowing victims are slipped GHB and can't remember their attacker the next day. 
   Since GHB is a newly abused drug, there have been few studies done to illustrate it's effects. However, the Drug Abuse Warning Network reports an increase in GHB-related emergency department episodes from 20 in 1992 to 629 in 1996. Among these episodes, 91 percent reported that their reason for using GHB was for recreational purposes. Of that 91 percent, 33 percent claimed they had no idea what GHB would do to them. 
   Based on what we know, there are no safe levels of use. There are no known ways to predict side effects. And there are no ways to anticipate how GHB will react with other substances. Yet, young people are being told this drug is okay. Well, it isn't. And I don't believe parents want their children self-prescribing any drugs, much less one so dangerous. We have to let kids know that GHB is a serious drug with serious consequences. If we know so little about GHB, we can assume kids know even less. It is imperative that we warn kids of the dangers involved in these substances. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have left?

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to address a family farm issue and I want to take this opportunity to send a clear message to other portions of agriculture that I sense are not supporting the family farmers of America the way they should be, when in reality, the organizations I'm finding fault with are in the very same boat as any family farmer in America. What's even more disturbing to me, some of these really big megapork producers in America refer to themselves as family farms. It's in the title of their organization. 
   The fact is, Mr. President, family farmers are facing the lowest soybean prices in 23 years. Farmers are currently storing more soybeans on the farm than at any other point in the 1990's. In addition, the American Soybean Association forecasts this year the United States will have a larger number of carry-out stocks than at any other point this decade. Due to the excessive available supply, family farmers marketing soybeans are in a very difficult situation. 
   Soybean prices will not improve until U.S. reserves are diminished. But, believe it or not, the cooperative that I've referred to, composed of some of the largest livestock integrators in the Nation, are planning to import soybean meal from Brazil. And, of course, this is going to have a very significant negative impact on American soybean producers. But, more important, it is demoralizing to the family farmers of America who are producing soybeans to read reports about other so-called family farmers importing soybean meal from another country. 
   The cooperative located in the Southeast United States will bring in three foreign shipments totaling 75,000 metric tons of soybean meal. And, by the way, for those of you who don't know agriculture, soybean meal is used as a protein supplement in feed, which when combined with corn and other feed grains helps to prepare the hogs for slaughter and domestic consumption. 
   I reported to you that they will be bringing in 75,000 metric tons of soybean meal on three different foreign shipments. It takes approximately 52 bushels of soybeans to produce one metric ton of soybean meal. This means that U.S. soybean producers are losing an opportunity to market nearly 4 million bushels of soybeans to these six producers of hogs who are part of this cooperative. 
   With the current crisis in the agriculture community, it's an understatement to say that this purchase has not been well-received by soybean producers. It has already been my impression that when times are tough on the farm, the agriculture community, both farm and non-farm, pitches in to help each other. From individual barn raisings to emergency hay lifts, family farmers stick together to help each other. Now, with soybeans under $5 a bushel, and that's a 23-year low, I would hope that this was one of those times when the ag community would come together in the face of adversity. 
   Maybe I'm wrong, or maybe the livestock integrators which make up the cooperative in question don't understand the impact of their actions. One of the entities involved in the cooperative holds itself out to be a family farm organization. Well, if it's really a family farm, this is the perfect time to show its true colors and support American family farmers. 
   Mr. President, if the entities within this cooperative buying group want to be considered as family farmers, they should support the family farmers, and I'm speaking specifically about Murphys' Family Farms, Carroll Foods, Prestage, Smithfield Foods, Goldsboro Farms, and Nashjohnson and Sons Farms. These are the members of this cooperative that are buying soybean meal from Brazil when we have this oversupply in our own country. 
   Now, as I indicated to you, family farmers generally help family farmers. And I have never once complained in America as a matter of public policy about something being too big. These are obviously very big producers of pork in the United States. I have no resentment that they are successful. But some of these operations feed some of their livestock in my State of Iowa. We are the number-one soybean-producing State. It seems to me that whether the feed in question that's coming from Brazil is used in North Carolina or used in Iowa, it still is wrong to do this to the people that you consider your neighbors in each of these States. I would like to have all these farmers get their heart into American family farm agriculture or get their rear-end out. 
   I urge this cooperative to reassess its position and consider the plight of the family farmer. Place American farmers' long-term interests above what may only be a short-term gain and obviously a very bad public relations stunt for each of you. I yield the floor. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Enzi, Grassley, Thomas, Conrad amendment. Livestock producers have few viable risk management tools available to deal with drought, excessive rain and snow, flood, or disease. Dismal profits for cattlemen and the collapse of hog market in the Fall of 1998 are two of the predominate factors which have spurred a renewed interest in livestock insurance. I feel it is important that any consideration of reform for federal crop insurance and/or federal risk management programs should include the needs of livestock producers. 
   Since the introduction of revenue insurance programs in 1996 farmers raising crops have been provided risk management tools which better mediate the unavoidable risks farmers experience. Programs such as Crop Revenue Coverage (CRC), Income Protection (IP), and Revenue Assurance (RA) are available for crops, but currently a statutory prohibition bans the development of federally supported livestock insurance. 
   It is my opinion that we have a responsibility to provide risk management tools to all farmers, whether they raise crops or livestock. Iowa State University's Center for Agricultural and Rural Development (CARD) has studied the possible benefits of Whole-Farm Revenue Insurance for crop and livestock producers. The center has developed data which lends credibility to those who advocate adding a livestock net revenue guarantee to existing whole-farm crop revenue guarantees. 
   CARD determined Whole-Farm Revenue insurance programs could supplement existing risk management tools offered through the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade for livestock. CARD also ascertained that the addition of livestock to whole-farm revenue guarantees could dramatically reduce both insurance rates and insurance premiums. Lower rates could lead to expanded coverage and less risk exposure for farmers. 
   Mr. President, risk management tools are necessary for the success of the agriculture community. Congress must work together and focus on expanded risk management to better mediate the unavoidable risks farmers experience. It's time for Congress to take an active role in providing these tools to all farmers. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support livestock producers by supporting the Enzi, Grassley, Thomas, Conrad amendment.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the budget resolution before us today provides the first major increase in defense spending since 1985. 
   And I voted for it. I support the increase for National defense. In the past, I have opposed increases in the defense budget. Now, I don't. My colleagues must be wondering why. My colleagues may be thinking that the Senator from Iowa has flip-flopped on defense. 
   I would like to explain my position. 
   I support this year's defense increase for one reason and one reason only. 
   The Budget Committee is calling for financial management reforms at the Department of Defense (DOD). The committee is telling DOD to bring its accounting practices up to accepted standards, so it can produce ``auditable'' financial statements within two years. 
   In a nutshell, the Committee is telling DOD to do what DOD is already required to do under the law. 
   If those words were not in the Committee report, I would be standing here with an amendment in my hand to cut the DOD budget. 
   Fortunately, that's not necessary. 
   I would like to thank my friend from New Mexico, Senator DOMENICI--the Committee Chairman--for placing those important words in the report.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take moment to tell my colleagues why the language on DOD Financial Reforms is so important. 
   I want to help them understand why I am so concerned about the breakdown of discipline and control in financial management at the Pentagon. 
   I have been investigating the problem for six years, now. 
   I have come here to the floor of the Senate and spoken about it many times. 
   I have offered amendments. 
   I raised these same concerns during hearings before the Budget Committee earlier this year--on February 24 and again on March 2nd. 
   My Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight held a hearing last September on the lack of effective internal financial controls at DOD. 
   I am planning another hearing later this year. 
   The General Accounting Office (GAO) and the Inspector General (IG) have issued report after report after report exposing these problems. 
   Every single shred of evidence points to the breakdown of financial controls at the Pentagon. 
   IG and GAO reports consistently demonstrate that DOD accounts and assets are vulnerable to theft and abuse. 
   They show that internal controls are weak or nonexistent. 
   They show that financial transactions are not recorded in the books of accounts--as they occur--promptly and accurately. 
   They show that payments are deliberately posted to the wrong accounts. Sometimes transactions are not recorded in the books for months or even years--and sometimes maybe never. 
   DOD has no effective capability for tracking the quantity, value and locations of assets and inventory. 
   DOD has lost control of the money at the transaction level. 
   With no control at the transaction level, it is physically impossible to roll up all the numbers into a top-line financial statement that can stand up to scrutiny and audit. 
   Sloppy accounting procedures generate billions of dollars of unreconciled transactions--mismatches between official accounting records and inventory and disbursing records. 
   Billions and billions of dollars of unreconciled mismatches make it impossible to audit DOD's books. 
   As a result, DOD gets a failing grade on its annual financial statements that are required by law. Each year, the IG has to issue a disclaimer of opinion. 
   Unfortunately, there is nothing on the drawing board to suggest that a ``clean'' audit opinion is feasible in the foreseeable future. DOD just doesn't have the accounting tools to get the job done. 
   There will be no improvement in this dismal picture without reform--and some pressure from the Budget Committee and other committees. 
   Without reform, the vast effort dedicated to auditing the annual financial statements will be wasted effort. 
   The report language lays out a general framework for reform. 
   These reforms are not new or dramatic. 
   The Committee report language just tells DOD to get on the stick and do what it is already supposed to be doing--under the law. And it calls for some accountability to help get the job done. 
   This report language should help to move DOD toward a ``clean'' audit opinion within two years. 
   And there is another important reason why this language is needed today. 
   As I stated a moment ago, we are looking at the first big increase in defense spending since 1985.  
   I think the Committee needs to be on the record, telling the Pentagon to get its financial house in order. 
   If the Pentagon wants all this extra money, then the Pentagon needs to fulfill its Constitutional responsibility to the taxpayers of this country. 
   First, it needs to regain control of the taxpayers' money it's spending right now. 
   And second, it needs to provide a full and accurate accounting of how all the money gets spent. 
   DOD must be able to present an accurate and complete accounting of all financial transactions--including all receipts and expenditures. It needs to be able to do this once a year. 
   The GAO and IG auditors should be able to examine the Department's books and its financial statements and render a ``clean'' audit opinion. 
   That's the goal. 
   Mr. President, I would like to extend a special word of thanks to the Committee Chairman, my friend from New Mexico, Senator DOMENICI, for including this important language in the report. 
   I would like to thank him for understanding and accepting the urgent need for financial management reform at the Pentagon. 
   I would like to thank him for working with me in urging the Pentagon to move in the direction of sound financial management. 
   Mr. President, in my mind, DOD financial management reform is mandatory as we move to larger DOD budgets. 
   I understand that the language is not binding. 
   It's simply the first step in the effort to bring about financial reform and accountability at DOD through legislation later this year. 
   In the months ahead, I look forward to working with the Armed Services and Appropriations Committees to make it happen. 
   The Chairman of the Committee has agreed to help me do it. 
   He made a commitment to ``work closely'' with the Armed Services Committee to develop a legislative reform package that addresses the issues raised in the report. 
   I hope the Armed Services Committee will cooperate and find a way to address the need for financial reforms in tandem with more defense money. 
   Higher defense budgets need to be hooked up to financial reforms--just like a horse and buggy--one behind the other. They need to move together. 
   And I hope other members of the Budget Committee will join me in that effort. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, along with Senator SCHUMER and others, today I am introducing legislation that would make it easier for every American taxpayer to see what goes on in the federal courts that they fund. The bill, which would allow the photographing, electronic recording, broadcasting, and televising of Federal court proceedings, is needed to address the growing public cynicism over this branch of government. 
   Fostering a public that is well-informed about the law, including penalties and offenses, will, in turn, foster a healthy judiciary. As Thomas Jefferson said, ``[t]he execution of the laws is more important than the making of them.'' Because federal court decisions are far-reaching and often final, it is critical that judges operate in a manner that invites broad observation. 
   In addition, allowing cameras in the federal courtrooms is consistent with the founding fathers' intent that trials be held before as many people as choose to attend. Also, the First Amendment requires that court proceedings be open to the public, and by extension, the news media. The public's right to observe them first-hand is hardly less important. Put differently, the Supreme Court has said, ``what transpires in the courtroom is public property.''  
   In 1994 The Federal Judicial Center conducted a pilot program that studied the effect of cameras in a select number of federal courts. Their findings supported the use of electronic media coverage and found, ``small or no effects of camera presence on participants in the proceedings, courtroom decorum, or the administration of justice.'' In addition to this three year study in the federal courts, we are fortunate to be able to draw upon the experience of state courts. A committee in New York established to study the effect of cameras in courtrooms concluded, ``Audio-visual coverage of court proceedings serves an important educational function, and promotes public scrutiny of the judicial system. The program had minimal, if any, adverse effects.'' 15 states specifically studied the educational benefits deriving from camera access and all of them determined that camera coverage contributed to greater public understanding of the judicial system. 
   The use of state courts as a testing ground for this legislation as well as the Federal pilot program make this very well trod ground. We can be extremely confident that this is the next logical step and the well documented benefits far outweigh the ``minimal or no detrimental effects''. Yet, despite the strong evidence of the successful use of cameras in state courtrooms, we are going the extra mile to make sure this works in federal courtrooms by adding a 3 year sunset provision to our bill. This will give us a reasonable amount of time to determine how the process is working and whether it should be permanent. 
   The two leading arguments against cameras in federal courtrooms are easily countered. First, there is a fear that courtrooms will deteriorate into the carnival-like atmosphere of the O.J. Simpson trial. However, the O.J. Simpson case is obviously an exceptional and isolated instance. Not every court case is or need be like the Simpson case. It is this image of court proceedings that this bill is designed to dispel. Furthermore, even the minimal effects of a camera in a trial setting do not apply to an appellate hearing that has no jury and rarely requires witnesses. 
   The second argument against greater public access to court proceedings is the legitimate concern for the witnesses' safety when they are required to testify. This concern has merit and is therefore addressed in our bill. Technological advances make it possible to disguise the face and voice of witnesses upon request, thus not compromising their safety. 
   Allowing greater public access to federal court proceedings will help Americans fulfill their duty as citizens of a democratic nation to educate themselves on the workings of their government, and their right to observe and oversee the fundamental and critical role of the judiciary. The evidence compiled by 48 states and a federal study clearly supports this bill, the Constitution demands this bill, and the American people deserve this bill. 
   For all these reasons, I urge others to join me and my colleagues in supporting our attempt to provide greater public access and accountability of our federal courts.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, Senator GRAHAM, to introduce bipartisan pension reform legislation. This legislation, the Pension Coverage and Portability Act, will go a long way toward improving the pension system in this country. 
   Ideally, pension benefits should compromise about a third of a retired worker's income. But pension benefits make up only about one-fifth of the income in elderly households. Obviously, workers are reaching retirement with too little income from an employer pension. Workers who are planning for their retirement will need more pension income to make up for a lower Social Security benefit and to fit with longer life expectancies. While we have seen a small increase in the number of workers who are expected to receive a pension in retirement, only one half of our workforce is covered by a pension plan. 
   There is a tremendous gap in pension coverage between small employers and  large employers. Eighty-five percent of the companies with at least 100 workers offer pension coverage. Companies with less than 100 workers are much less likely to offer pension coverage. Only about 50 percent of the companies with less than 100 workers offer pension coverage. In order to close the gap in coverage between small and large employers, we need to understand the reasons small employers do not offer pension plans. Last year, the Employee Benefit Institute released to Small Employer Retirement Survey which was very instructive for legislators. 
   The survey identified the three main reasons employers gave for not offering a plan. The first reason is that small employer believe that employees prefer increased wages or other types of benefits. The second reason employers don't offer plans is the administrative cost. And the third most important reason for not offering a plan: uncertain revenue, which makes it difficult to commit to a plan. 
   Combine these barriers with the responsibilities of a small employer, and we can understand why coverage among small employers has not increased. Small employers who may just be starting out in business are already squeezing every penny. These employers are also people who open up to the business in the morning, talk to customers, do the marketing, pay the bills, and just do not know how they can take on the additional duties, responsibilies, and liabilities of sponsoring a pension plan. 
   I firmly believe that an increase in the number of people covered by pension plans will occur only when small employers have more substantial incentives to establish pension plans. The Pension Coverage and Portability Act contains provisions which will provide more flexibility for small employees, relief from burdensome rules and regulations, and a tax incentive to start new plans for their employees. One of the new top heavy provisions we have endorsed is an exemption from top heavy rules for employers who adopt the 401(k) safe harbor. This safe harbor takes effect this year. When the Treasury Department wrote the regulations and considered whether safe harbor plans should also have to satisfy the top heavy rules, they answered in the affirmative. As a result, a small employer would have to make a contribution of 7 percent of pay for each employee, a very costly proposition. 
   My colleagues and I also have included a provision which repeals user fees for new plan sponsors seeking determination letters from IRS. These fees can run from $100 to more than $1,000 depending on the type of plan. Given the need to promote retirement plan formation, we believe this ``rob Peter to pay Paul'' approach needs to be eliminated. 
   We have also looked at the lack of success of SIMPLE 401(k) plans. A survey by the Investment Company Institute found that SIMPLE IRAs have proven successful, with almost 340,000 workers participating in a plan. However, SIMPLE 401(k)s haven't enjoyed the same success. One reason may be that the limits on SIMPLE 401(k)s are tighter than for the IRAs. Our bill equalizes the compensation limits for these plan; in addition, we have increased the annual limit on SIMPLE to $8,000. 
   One of the more revolutionary proposals is the creation of a Salary Reduction SIMPLE with a limit of $4,000. Unlike other SIMPLEs, the employer makes no match or automatic contributions. The employer match is usually a strong incentive for a low-income employee to participate in a savings plan. We hope that small employers will look at this SIMPLE as a transition plan, in place for just a couple of year during the initial stage of business operation-- 
   then adopt a more expansive plan when the business is profitable. 
   A provision that was included in last year's legislation, the negative election trust or ``NET'' has been modified to address some practical administrative issues. What is the NET? Basically, it is a new type of safe harbor that would allow employers to automatically enroll employees in pension plans. Often, employees do not join the pension plan as soon as they begin employment with a new employer. If employees are left to their own devices, they may delay participating in the pension plan or even worse, never participate. This new safe harbor eases the nondiscrimination rules for employers who establish the NET if they achieve a participation rate of 70 percent. 
   The other targeted areas in the legislation include enhancing pension coverage for women. Women are more at risk of living in poverty as they age. They need more ways to save because of periodic departures from the workforce. To increase their saving capacity, we have included a proposal similar to legislation I sponsored earlier this year, S. 60, the Enhanced Savings Opportunities Act. Like S. 60, the proposal repeals the 25 percent of salary contribution limit on defined contribution plans. This limit has seriously impeded savings by women, as well as low- and mid-salary employees. Repealing the 25 percent cap in 415(c) is a simplifier, and will allow anyone covered by a defined contribution plan to benefit. 
   The bill also contains proposals which promote new opportunities to roll over accounts from an old employer to a new employer. The lack of portability among plans is one of the weak links in our current pension system. This new bill contains technical improvements which will help ease the implementation of portability among the different types of defined contribution plans. 
   Finally, I would like to point out a couple of other provisions in the bill. The first is the new requirement that plan sponsors automatically provide benefit statements to their participants on a periodic basis. For defined contribution plans, the statement would be required annually. For defined benefit plans, a statement would be required every three years. However, employers who provide an annual notice to employees of the availability of a benefit statement would not be required to provide automatic benefit statements to all employees. 
   Providing clear and understandable benefit statements to pension plan participants would encourage people to think about how much money they can expect to receive in retirement. Further, a benefit statement will help people ensure that the information their employer maintains about them is accurate. 
   This provision joins other proposals in a section targeted at encouraging retirement education. Education can make a difference to workers. In fact, in companies which provide investment education, we know workers benefitted because many of them changed their investment allocations to more accurately reflect their investment horizons. 
   The bill also looks to simplify and repeal some of the legal requirements which threaten plan security and increase costs for employers who sponsor pension plans. For example, the legislation seeks to repeal the full-funding limit. This limit prevents employers from pre-funding their defined benefit plans based on projected benefits. Instead, employers are limited to an amount that would allow them to pay the accrued benefits if the plan terminated. This lower funding level threatens the ability of employers to pay benefits, especially as the Baby Boom begins to retire. 
   To reduce the burdens of plan compliance, the legislation includes a number of proposals intended to peel away at the layers of laws and regulations that add costs to plan administration but don't add many benefits. 
   This legislation joins other strong proposals now pending in the House and here in the Senate. This legislation includes provisions which reflect some of those same proposals. I want to commend the sponsors of those bills. Our legislation has a lot in common with these other pension bills and we need to push for fast and favorable consideration of this legislation. 
   We have a window of opportunity to act. The Baby Boomers are coming. The letters from AARP are starting to arrive in their mailboxes. The Social Security Administration is starting to stagger the delivery of benefit checks in preparation for their retirement. It is likely that future retirees will not be able to rely on all of the benefits now provided by Social Security. We can look to the pension system to pick up where Social Security leaves off, but we need to act. 
   I thank the other co-sponsors of this legislation for all of their work, and I encourage our colleagues to give strong  consideration to co-sponsoring this bill. We already have a substantial number of Senate Finance Committee members, including BAUCUS, BREAUX, JEFFORDS, HATCH, KERREY, THOMPSON, MACK, CHAFEE, ROBB, and MURKOWSKI. I am also very pleased to have Senator BOND come aboard as a co-sponsor. As Chairman of the Small Business Committee, he is very aware of the problems we are trying to address in this legislation. We also have added Senator JEFF BINGAMAN as a co-sponsor. 
   I also want to recognize the groups that have worked with us over the last three years to develop this legislation. These organizations include: the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council, the Association of Private Pension & Welfare Plans, the ERISA Industry Council, and the Retirement Security Network which includes a large number of organizations who have all been important to our work. 
   With concerted, bipartisan action, we can improve the pension system. Pensions for today's workers will substantially improve the retirement outlook for millions of Americans. But we have some work to do if pensions are going to fulfill their promise.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, hearings on agricultural trade issues with the People's Republic of China that I chaired on March 15, 1999 in the International Trade Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Finance highlighted the enormous significance to the United States of China's possible accession to the World Trade Organization. 
   As President Gerald Ford stated in a letter that I released during the hearing, ``The terms of any deal that we reach now with China about access to its markets may well determine the course of Sino-American economic relations for decades to come. If economic relations are not resolved constructively, there will be adverse developments diplomatically and politically between our two nations.'' 
   We have just one opportunity to make sure that any market access agreement that we reach with China in the context of WTO accession talks gives the United States unrestricted entry to China's markets. That opportunity is now. And we can do that only if Congress asserts its constitutional responsibility to regulate foreign commerce and reviews any deal negotiated by the administration before China is admitted to the WTO. 
   It is for this reason that today I introduce legislation to clarify the requirements for the accession to the World Trade Organization of the People's Republic of China. 
   This legislation will do three things. 
   First, it clarifies the requirement in current law that the United States Trade Representative must consult with the Congress prior to casting a vote in favor of China's admission to the WTO. Under current law, the Administration could conceivably ``consult'' with the Congress minutes before casting a vote in the WTO Ministerial Conference or the WTO General Council to admit China. This bill says that Congress shall have at least 60 days to review all the relevant documents related to China's possible accession before a vote is taken. 
   Second, this legislation specifies the exact documents that the Administration must give to Congress for its review. 
   Finally, Congress shall have the opportunity to vote on China's admission to the WTO before China can be admitted. 
   This is an issue of historic importance, and enormous consequence. But unless the law is changed, I won't even have the chance to vote on whether the agreement negotiated for China's accession is good for Iowa, and good for America. My job in Congress is to make these tough decisions, not avoid them. 
   Mr. President, I believe that it would be the right thing for China to join the world trade community's official forum, and be subject to the discipline of multilateral trade rules. For fifty years, the WTO, and its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, has eliminated literally tens of thousands of tariff and non-tariff trade barriers. The result has been a dramatic increase in our collective prosperity, and a strengthening of world peace. 
   But China--or any other nation--should not be admitted to the WTO for political reasons. If the terms that we negotiate for China's accession are good terms, then China's accession will stand on its own merits. If the terms are not acceptable, if they don't guarantee unrestricted market access, then China should not be admitted. It's that simple. 
   I encourage all my colleagues to join me in this effort.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, earlier this week, Senator GRAHAM of Forida and I introduced a bill to revitalize and modernize our efforts to defend U.S. borders from drug traffickers. This bill, the ``Comprehensive Border Protection Act'', S. 689, is part of a bi-partisan effort by Congress to provide the resources for this critical effort. Its goal is to stop dangerous drugs and other contraband from reaching our streets. Last year, we took an important step in this direction with increased funding for our counter-drug efforts in the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. As needed as that funding was, we left something undone. 
   One of the critical frontline agencies in our counter-drug efforts in the U.S. Customs Service. Despite the fact that trade has increased exponentially in the last several years, we have not provided the resources to expand the ability of Customs to manage this increased volume. Every year, more than the total population of the United States crosses our borders. In practice, that means more than 400 million people annually coming into our airports, across our land borders, and into our seaports. Nearly 15 million containers enter our ports. Some 125 million privately owned vehicles come into the country. That is every year. To deal with this volume, Customs has fewer than 20,000 employees and equipment that is outdated. 
   Most of this traffic is legal. But criminal gangs, terrorists, and drug traffickers willfully and cynically seek to hide their illegal acts in this flow. They use every means that vast resources and ruthless intent puts into their hands to commit their crimes. And they have increasingly sophisticated means to conceal their illegal activities. Short of sealing our borders to all trade and financial transactions, we must depend upon agencies like Customs to secure our borders We must, however, do this while facilitating the flow of people and legitimate trade. It is a daunting task. 
   Recognizing that our borders were under intense pressure from illegal alien smuggling, the Congress increased the resources to the Immigration Service. We almost doubled that agency's capacity. The challenge facing Customs is far greater. Yet, we have not provided the resources, the technological improvements, or the support that is needed to get the job done. 
   We have not given our men and women who do this job the support that the task requires. And it is a demanding and dangerous job. It's not glamorous to spend hours a day at a major U.S. port of entry watching tens of thousands of vehicles and people cross the border. It's a lonely and risky livelihood to patrol long stretches of our border. The long hours spent in undercover investigations and in analyzing reams of information go largely unnoticed. But being out of sight should not put their efforts or why they are undertaken out of mind. 
   That is what the legislation that we are offering today aims to do--to remind us of what we must be doing and to give the tools and support needed to do the job to those we ask to do it. I have for the passed several years urged the Administration to provide Congress with a comprehensive plan. We know that drug thugs have no respect for national sovereignty, for the rule of law, or for international borders. These criminal gangs are ruthless and shrewd. And they are flexible. We have to be flexible also. 
   I have repeatedly noted that we need to develop a capacity to guard our borders with flexibility and forethought. Too often we simply react. We respond to a threat in one area only to find the traffickers have switched tactics. We need a comprehensive approach and a sustainable plan. Such a plan, however, has not been forthcoming. For too long, we have been merely reactive to the initiative of traffickers, moving resources around to meet their latest tactic. We need to be anticipating their efforts and we need to be comprehensive. That is why this legislation addresses both our northern and southern borders, our ports and airports and our coastlines. We need the intelligence and investigative resources to focus our efforts. And we need that consistency of purpose and sustained effort that characterizes resolve. We cannot affort to be less committed in our purpose than drug traffickers are in theirs. We must not be any less comprehensive. 
   While this bill is not the whole solution to our quest for a coherent and comprehensive approach, it is an important step. I urge my colleagues in the Senate and the House to join us in making this effort a reality.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday the Special Committee on Aging, which I chair, held a hearing on the government's oversight role in ensuring quality care in our Nation's nursing homes. The committee has been investigating systemic flaws in nursing home care for two years. A series of reports by the General Accounting Office and the HHS inspector general have now shown this to be a national problem. 
   The Aging Committee investigates in a bi-partisan manner. The rules of the committee require it. The committee's  ranking member, Senator BREAUX, has very ably assisted the committee's work. His insightfulness and interest in issues affecting the elderly population has brought greater credibility to our work. 
   At yesterday's hearing, we learned much about the breakdown in the complaints process. In other words, when someone makes a formal complaint about the treatment of a loved-one in a nursing home. The various states operate the process. But the federal government has the ultimate responsibility to oversee it to make sure complaints are being addressed. 
   Yesterday we heard from two citizen witnesses who experienced firsthand a broken-down complaints process. Their stories were tragic, yet real. The committee, the government, and the public learned much from their testimony. 
   We also heard from the GAO and from the HHS IG. 
   The committee did not hear from the Health Care Financing Administration, or HCFA. HCFA is the federal agency charged by law to protect nursing home residents. HCFA must ensure that the enforcement of federal care requirements for nursing homes protects the health, safety, welfare, and rights of nursing home residents. Yet, HCFA was a no-show. 
   There is a very specific reason for yesterday's hearing, and this series of hearings. It's because the health, safety, welfare, and rights of nursing home residents are at great risk. Yet, the agency responsible was not here. 
   The committee invited the two private citizens in the public interest. Through their eyes, we saw a complaint process turned upside-down. It's a process that has put some nursing home residents at risk. Their testimony could help correct the process so others don't have to suffer the same wrongful treatment. 
   The reason HCFA wasn't here is puzzling, given the committee's focus on listening to citizen complaints. HCFA is an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services--HHS. HHS determined that HCFA should not show up because HHS witnesses do not follow citizen witnesses. That's their so-called policy. 
   In other words, HCFA--the organization that is supposed to serve our elderly citizens by protecting the health, safety, welfare, and rights of nursing home residents--was not here because its protocol prevents them from testifying after citizen witnesses. 
   Last Friday, when discussing this matter with HHS officials, my staff was told the following: ``Our policy is that we testify before citizen witnesses.'' 
   Now, I have four comments on this. First, how serious is the Department about the problems we're uncovering in nursing homes when a protocol issue is more important than listening to how their complaints process might be flawed? 
   Second, I have conducted hearings, in which citizen witnesses go first, since 1983. Other committees have done the same. I don't recall any department at any hearing I conducted since 1983 that became a no-show, even when private citizens testified first. Especially for an issue as important as this. 
   Third, the Department may be trying to convince the public it cares. But this no-show doesn't help that cause. The public might confuse this with arrogance. 
   Finally, this situation yesterday could not possibly have illustrated better the main point of the hearing; namely, that citizens' complaints are falling on deaf ears. These witnesses traveled many miles yesterday. They were hoping that government officials--the very officials responsible--would hear their plea. Instead, what did they get? A bureaucratic response. Their agency-protectors were no-shows because of a protocol. Because of arrogance, perhaps. 
   So, we'll move forward with yesterday's testimony, learning how the nursing home complaint system is in shambles. And the agency responsible for fixing it wasn't here to listen. Of course, they can read about it once it's in writing--a process they are comfortable with. 
   Since I have been in the Congress, I have never taken partisan shots at an administration. I believe only in accountability. My heaviest shots were against administrations of my own party. The record reflects that very clearly. 
   The easy thing to do would be to take partisan pot shots over this. It's much harder to redouble our efforts, in a bipartisan way on the committee--which I intend to do--until HHS and HCFA get the message. When will HHS and HCFA hear what's going on out there in our nation's nursing homes? Perhaps when they learn to listen to the citizens we--all of us in government--serve. Until they get the message, these problems will get worse before they get better. 
   One key reason why HCFA's presence was important, yesterday, was to nail down just who is in charge. At our hearing last July, Mr. Mike Hash, HCFA's deputy administrator, told the committee that HCFA is responsible for enforcement for nursing homes. Yet in yesterday's written testimony submitted for the record, Mr. Hash says the states have the responsibility. 
   This needs to be clarified. Who's in charge, here? Is this why we're seeing all these problems in nursing homes? Because no one's in charge? 
   In my opinion, this matter has to get cleared up at once. Every day that passes means more and more nursing home residents may be at risk. The Department of HHS has to restore public confidence that it truly cares, that it's doing something about it, and that improving nursing home care is a higher priority than protocols for witnesses at a hearing.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator KERRY in introducing the ``Aviation Safety Protection Act of 1999.'' This legislation will grant whistleblower protection to aviation workers, thus helping to increase the safety of the aviation industry and the traveling public. 
   I have long been a supporter of whistleblower protection for government workers. This act will extend that protection to aviation workers. Airline employees play a vital role in the protection of the traveling public. They are the first line of defense when it comes to recognizing hazards and other violations which can threaten airline safety. These dedicated employees should not have to choose between saving the public or saving their own jobs. The extension of whistleblower protection will eliminate that unfair choice and will allow them to do what is right. What is right is to be able to tell airline management of aviation safety problems without fear of retaliation or losing their job. 
   I have been working with Senator KERRY and flight attendants on this vital legislation for the past several years. It was included in the last Congress in the FAA reauthorization bill. Unfortunately that bill was not passed into law. We are looking forward to working closely with Senator MCCAIN and Congressman SHUSTER this year as the FAA reauthorization legislation moves through the Congress. 
   The traveling public expects and deserves the safest air travel system possible. Granting aviation employees whistleblower protection will fill a gap in the air travel system. 
   I join with Senator KERRY in urging my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to the amendment offered by Senators SPECTER and HARKIN that is based on a ``Washington Knows Best'' policy. Under this amendment, every Governor--each year--for the next 25 years would be required to submit a plan to Washington asking for permission on how to spend fifty percent of the state's own money. I'm voting ``no'' to this ``Washington Knows Best'' amendment. 
   My state of Iowa stands ready to receive $1.7 billion over the next 25 years for its share of this landmark settlement. Iowa began a thoughtful process years ago to establish a framework to guide the state on how to utilize these new resources should the state succeed with its case against the tobacco industry. Two years ago, after much state and local deliberation, the Iowa Legislature passed laws establishing a governing framework. Now that success has come for Iowa, it is prepared. Among top priorities for the use of these new funds are increased medical assistance and programs to reduce teen smoking. Furthermore, Iowa's Governor Vilsack enthusiastically advocates a number of new initiatives for combating teen smoking, including an initiative to spend $17.7 million of its settlement money on tobacco prevention and control programs. I am confident in the leadership of our Governor and State Legislature in deciding how to best spend its resources for the well-being of Iowans. 
   The states are entitled to the full amount of their settlement. Years ago, the states began to organize their case against the tobacco industry. They sought assistance from the federal government in their efforts, but received none. The states took on all the risk, and invested all of the time, money and energy. They have been rewarded for their commitment to the case with a landmark settlement. It is unfair for Congress, at this very late stage, to dip into the state's multi-billion dollar settlement. What's more, last year Congress made attempts at a federal settlement but failed. Congress is in no position to interfere with what the states have independently accomplished.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment to speed up adjudication, by the appeals board of the Department of Health and Human Services, of appeals from nursing facilities of civil monetary penalties levied by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) for violations of standards established pursuant to the Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987. Currently, there is a substantial backlog of some 701 such cases. Delay in final adjudication of such cases subverts the purpose and effect of civil monetary penalties, delaying corrective action, and improvements in the quality of care offered by nursing facilities. Delays in adjudication of these cases also burdens nursing facilities through additional legal fees and the perpetuation of uncertainty caused by unresolved disputes. 
   The number of such cases filed each year by nursing facilities has increased each year since 1995, the year when regulations for the Nursing Home Reform Act's enforcement standards went into effect. Currently, as I noted earlier in my statement, there are 701 such cases pending. 
   Mr. President, the steady increase in appeals of civil monetary penalties since 1995 shows the effect of increased use, by the States and HCFA, of the enforcement regulations which went into effect in 1995. Nevertheless, in hearings I held in the Special Committee on Aging last July, the General Accounting Office reported that nursing facilities providing poor quality of care regularly escaped sanctions which could cause care to be improved. The pattern seemed to be that a facility would be sanctioned for poor quality of care, be required to attest in writing through a plan of correction that steps had been taken to improve care, and then be found deficient on the next visit from State officials. This pattern often continued for long periods of time. And when sanctions such as civil monetary penalties were levied by HCFA, the sanctioned facilities would appeal, causing lengthy delays in final resolution of the case. 
   One week before my July hearings, President Clinton launched a variety of new initiatives designed to improve the quality of care in nursing facilities. Among those new initiatives was one designed 
   to eliminate paper compliance with quality standards and to proceed more quickly to sanctions for those homes with a history of poor care. 
   The upshot of oversight by the Special Committee on Aging and the Presidential initiatives is that there has been a substantial increase thus far in 1999 of appeals of civil monetary penalties by nursing facilities. 
   Certainly, facilities have the right to appeal sanctions levied by HCFA. But it is also important that appeals be heard and resolved in a reasonable amount of time. Delay subverts improvement in the quality of care in nursing facilities as real deficiencies go uncorrected. Delay also slows the development of precedents which would clarify outstanding issues. Slow development of such precedents encourages facilities and their legal representatives to file appeals because guidance as to the worthiness of an appeal is lacking. And, as the body of precedents becomes more complete, adjudication of cases becomes speedier. 
   The root problem has been that the departmental appeals board does not have sufficient resources to keep up with the increase in new cases, to say nothing of working off the current backlog of cases. I am given to understand that, at the present time about 25 new cases are filed with the appeals board each week. As will be clear from the table I am attaching to my statement, the number of cases decided each year has averaged around 23 for the last 3 years. Clearly, the board is swamped and needs help. 
   The President's budget for fiscal year 2000 proposes $2.8 million for the board. Were the Congress to provide those funds, it will certainly take time for the appeals board to gear up and begin to speed up adjudication of appeals.We can't wait to begin addressing this problem, Mr. President. The amendment I offer would provide $1.4 million to be made available through the supplemental appropriation we are now considering. I have not proposed to provide the full $2.8 million the President's budget proposes for the next fiscal year because the appeals board could not effectively spend that amount in what remains of the fiscal year. Therefore, I have essentially prorated that amount over the time remaining in this fiscal year.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, here we go again. It seems that around this time every year we launch into certification follies. The occasion is the annual requirement that the administration report to Congress on the progress or lack of progress that countries are making in cooperating on combating drugs. This debate more recently gets personalized around the issue of the certification of Mexico. 
   There seems to be two basic elements in this affair: The acceptance by some in Congress that the administration only lies on certification therefore we should do away with the process and quit the pretense. And those who argue that it is unfair to judge the behavior of others and to force the President to make such judgments. 
   I do not think that either of these views is accurate or does justice to the seriousness of the issues we are dealing with. They are also not consonant with the actual requirements in certification.  
   On the first point. The annual certification process does not require the administration to lie. If an administration chooses to do so, it is not the fault of the certification process. And the fix is not to change the law to enable a lie. The fix is to insist on greater honesty in the process and compliance with the legal requirements. 
   Now, the Congress is no stranger to elaborate misrepresentations from administrations. Given that fact, this does mean that differences in judgment necessarily mean that one party to the difference is lying. In the past, I have not accepted all the arguments by the administration in certifying Mexico. 
   Indeed, self-evident facts make such an acceptance impossible and the administration's insistence upon obvious daydreams embarrassing. But I have, despite this, supported the overall decision on Mexico. I have done this for several reasons. 
   Before I explain, let me summarize several passages from the law that requires the President to report to Congress. There seems to be some considerable misunderstanding about what it says. The requirement is neither unusual nor burdensome. The President must inform Congress if during the previous year any given major drug producing or transit country cooperated fully with the United States or international efforts to stop production or transit. These efforts can be part of a bilateral agreement with the United States. They can be unilateral efforts. Or they can be efforts undertaken in cooperation with other countries, or in conformity with international law. 
   In making this determination, the President is asked to consider several things: the extent to which the country has met the goals and objectives of the 1988 U.N. Convention on illicit drugs; the extent to which similar efforts are being made to combat money laundering and the flow of precursor chemicals; and the efforts being made to combat corruption. 
   The purpose for these requirements is also quite simple. It is a recognition by Congress, in response to public demand, that the U.S. Government take international illegal drug production and trafficking seriously. That it make this concern a matter of national interest. And that, in conjunction with our efforts here and abroad, other countries do their part in stopping production and transit. Imagine that. A requirement that we and others should take illicit drug production and transit seriously. That we should do something concrete about it. And that, from time to time, we should get an accounting of what was done and whether it was effective. 
   I do not read in this requirement the problem that many seem to see. This requirement is in keeping with the reality of the threat that illegal drugs pose to the domestic well-being of U.S. citizens. Illegal drugs smuggled into this country by criminal gangs resident overseas kill more Americans annually than all the terrorist attacks on U.S. citizens in the past 10 years. It is consistent with international law. And it is not unusually burdensome on the administration--apart from holding it to some realistic standard of accountability. 
   I know that administrations, here and abroad, are uncomfortable with such standards. But that shilly shally should not be our guide. Congress has a constitutional foreign policy responsibility every bit as fundamental as the President's. Part of that responsibility is to expect accountability. The certification process is a key element in that with respect to drugs. 
   To seek to retreat from the responsibility because an administration does not like to be accountable is hardly sufficient ground for a change. To do so because another country does not like explaining how it is doing in cooperating to deal with a serious threat to U.S. national interests is equally unacceptable. To argue that we should cease judging others because we have yet to do enough at home is a logic that borders on the absurd. To believe that claims of sovereignty by some country trumps external judgment on its behavior is to argue for a dangerous standard in international law. To argue that we should bury our independent judgment on this matter of national interest in some vague multilateralized process is a confidence trick. 
   Try putting this argument into a different context. Imagine for a moment making these arguments with respect to terrorism. Think about the consequences of ignoring violations of human rights because a country claims it is unfair to meddle in internal matters. 
   When it comes to drugs, however, some seem prepared to carve out an exception. It offends Mexico, so let's not hold them accountable. The administration will not be honest, so let's stop making the judgment. 
   The administration, we are informed, does not want to offend an important ally. Really? Well, it seems the administration likes to pick and choose. At the moment, the administration is considering and threatening sanctions against the whole European Union--that is some of our oldest allies. And over what issue? Bananas. To my knowledge, not a single banana has killed an American. However serious the trade issue is that is involved, major international criminal gangs are not targeting Americans with banana peels. They are not smuggling tons of bananas into this country illegally. They are not corrupting whole governments. 
   So, what we are being asked to accept is that sanctions are an important national interest when it comes to bananas but not for drugs. That it is okay to judge allies on cooperation on tropical fruit but not on dangerous drugs. This strikes me as odd. Do not get me wrong. I am not against bananas. I believe there are serious trade issues involved in this dispute over bananas. What strikes me as odd is that the administration is prepared to deploy serious actions against allies over this issue but finds it unacceptable to defend U.S. interests when it comes to drugs with similar dedication and seriousness. 
   But let me come back to Mexico and certification. I have two observations. The first concerns the requirements for certification. I refer again to the law. That is a good place to start. The requirement in the law is to determine whether a country is fully cooperating. It is not to judge whether a country is fully successful. 
   Frankly, that is an impossible standard to meet. One that we would fail. I agree, that deciding what full cooperation looks like is a matter of judgment. But to those who argue that certification limits the President's flexibility, on the contrary, it gives scope to just that in reaching such a decision. It is a judgment call. Sometimes a very vexed judgment. 
   Nevertheless, one can meet a standard of cooperation that is not bringing success. In such a case, an over-reliance upon purely material standards of evaluation cannot be our only guide. How many extraditions, how many new laws, how many arrests, how many drugs seized are not our only measures for judgment. There are others. And in the case of Mexico there is a major question that must be part of our thinking. 
   Unless the United States can and is prepared unilaterally to stop drug production and trafficking in Mexico, then we have two choices. To seek some level of cooperation with legitimate authority in Mexico to give us some chance of addressing the problem. Or, to decide no cooperation is possible and to seal the border. The latter course, would involve an immense undertaking and is uncertain of success. It would also mean abandoning Mexico at a time of crisis to the very criminal gangs that threaten both countries. In my view, we cannot decertify Mexico until we can honestly and dispassionately answer this question: Is what we are getting in the way of cooperation from Mexico so unacceptable on this single issue that our only option is to tear up our rich and varied bilateral relationship altogether? 
   However frustrating our level of cooperation may be, I continue to think that we have not reached the point of hopelessness. And there are encouraging signs along with the disappointments. Having said this, I do not believe that we can or should forego judgment on the continuing nature of cooperation. With Mexico or with any country. To those who would change the certification process I would say, let's give the process a chance not a change. Let's actually apply it. This does not mean in some rote way. But wisely. With understanding. With due regard to both the nuance of particular situations and a sense of responsibility.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, along with Senator BAUCUS and others, I am introducing the Farm and Ranch Risk Management Act of 1999. This bill gives farmers a necessary tool to manage the risk of price and income fluctuations inherent in agriculture. It does this by encouraging farmers to save some of their income during good years and allowing the funds to supplement income during bad years. This new tool will more fully equip family farmers to deal with the vagaries of the marketplace. 
   Farming is a unique sector of the American economy. Agriculture represents one-sixth of our Gross Domestic Product. It consists of hundreds of thousands of farmers across the nation, many of whom operate small, family farms. These farms often support entire families, and even several generations of a family. They work hard every day to produce the food consumed by this country and by much of the world. 
   Yet, farming remains one of the most perilous ways to make a living. The income of a farm family depends, in large part, on factors outside its control. Weather is one of those factors. In 1997, for instance, the income of North Dakota farmers dropped 98% due to flooding. Weather can completely wipe out a farmer. At best, weather can cause a farmer's income to fluctuate wildly. 
   Another factor is the uncertainty of international markets. Iowa farmers now export 40% of all they produce. But what happens, for example, when European countries impose trade barriers on beef, pork and genetically-modified feed grain? And what happens when Asian governments devalue their currencies? Exports fall and farm income declines through no fault of the farmer, but because of decisions made in foreign countries. 
   Today, farm families face their most severe crisis since the 1980's. Forces beyond the control of the individual farmer have led to record low prices for grain and livestock. The outlook for these families is dismal. Above normal production in 1998 led to nearly unprecedented grain surpluses. In fact, the USDA predicts soybean carry-over stocks will be 95% higher for the 1998-  99 marketing season than for the same period last year--the largest since 1986. With this much grain in the bins, a quick recovery in grain prices is highly unlikely. 
   At present, the only help for these farmers is a reactionary policy of government intervention. The USDA recently committed $50 million in direct aid to hog producers to help them combat the current crisis. In his State of the Union Address, the President pledged additional support for farmers. While we must do all we can to help farmers pull through the current crisis, we must also realize that this aid is merely a short-term solution. Why must farm families wait for a crisis before getting the help they need? 
   Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today is a proactive measure that will help farmers prevent future crises on their own. It equips them with the ability to offset cyclical downturns that are inherent in their profession without government intervention. In that way, this bill is complementary with the philosophy of the new farm program. Many farmers I have talked to are pleased with the new program, which returned business decisions to the farmers, not bureaucrats at the Department of Agriculture, and not elected officials. Under the new program, farmers determine for themselves what to plant according to the demands of the market. Likewise, the Farm and Ranch Risk Management Act allows the farmer to decide whether to defer his income for later years and when to withdraw funds to supplement his operation. 
   The volatile nature of commodity markets can make it difficult for family farmers to survive even a normal business cycle. When prices are high, farmers often pay so much of their income in taxes that they are unable to save anything. When prices drop again, farmers can be faced with liquidity problems. This bill allows farmers to manage their income, to smooth out the highs and lows of the commodity markets. 
   Mr. President, I will take just a moment to explain how the bill works. Eligible farmers are allowed to make contributions to tax-deferred accounts, also known as FARRM accounts. The contributions are tax-deductible and limited to 20% of the farmer's taxable income for the year. The contributions are invested in cash or other interest-bearing obligations. The interest is taxed during the year it is earned. 
   The funds can stay in the account for up to five years. Upon withdrawal, the funds are taxed as regular income. If the funds are not withdrawn five years after they were invested, they are taxed as income and subject to an additional 10% penalty. 
   Essentially, the farmer is given a five-year window to manage his money in a way that is best for his own operation. The farmer can contribute to the account in good years and withdraw from the account when his income is low. 
   This bill helps the farmer help himself. It is not a new government subsidy for agriculture. It will not create a new bureaucracy purporting to help farmers. The bill simply provides farmers with a fighting chance to survive the down times and an opportunity to succeed when prices eventually increase.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce ``The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999'' with Senators TORRICELLI and BIDEN. This bill builds on the conference report which the Senate and House produced at the end of the 105th Congress, which melded together good legislation from both the Senate and the House to create a final product that combined the best aspects of both bills. 
   The bill I'm introducing today makes important changes to the conference report from last year to accommodate concerns raised by some Senators. 
   The need for real bankruptcy reform is pretty obvious. You don't need an army of so-called scientists, law professors and academics to tell us that we have a serious bankruptcy problem. 
   These are good times in America. Thanks to the hard work of a Republican Congress, we have the first balanced budget in a generation. Unemployment is low, we have a solid stock market and most Americans are optimistic about the future. 
   Despite the prosperity we are experiencing now, About one and a half million Americans will declare bankruptcy this year if previous trends continue. Since 1990, the rate of personal bankruptcy filings are up an amazing 94.7 percent. That's almost a 100 percent increase in bankruptcies since 1990. 
   Clearly something is amiss, and to paraphrase, ``it's not the economy stupid.'' The problem with the explosion in bankruptcies lies elsewhere. While many Americans who declare bankruptcy undoubtedly need a fresh start, it defies common sense to think that all of the million and a half Americans in bankruptcy court can't repay at least some of their debts. The point of bankruptcy reform is to limit chapter 7--which provides for a no-questions asked complete discharge of debts--to people who don't have the ability to repay any of their debts. People who can repay some or all of their debts should be required to do so in a chapter 13 repayment plan. 
   An important aspect to remember about bankruptcies is that we all have to pick up the tab for bankrupts who walk away from their debts. Businesses have to raise prices on products and services to offset bankruptcy losses. When you realize this, it becomes very apparent that allowing unfettered access to chapter 7 bankruptcy for high income people is a lot like a special interest tax loophole. Over 30 years ago, Senator Albert Gore, Sr. recognized this in a speech on the Senate floor. According to Senator Gore, like tax loopholes, chapter 7 allows someone to get out of paying his fair share and to shift the cost to hardworking Americans who play by the rules. 
   I think that Senator Gore had it exactly right. Bankruptcy reform is all about closing loopholes so higher income can't get out of paying their fair share. 
   As I indicated earlier, the bill I'm introducing now contains significant modifications to accommodate the concerns raised by some Senators. At the outset, I want to make it clear that, as was the case with the original Senate bill from last Congress, under this bill, a person in financial trouble can file in any chapter of the bankruptcy code he or she chooses. And before a debtor can be transferred from chapter 7 to chapter 13 or kicked out of bankruptcy, a judge will have the chance to review the merits of each and every case. I want to repeat this: Each and every chapter 7 debtor who meets the means-test will receive an individual hearing to press his or her own unique case before anything happens. In other words, this bill maintains much of the judicial scrutiny and discretion that was the distinguishing factor of the Senate bill's means-test in the 105th Congress. In the bill Senator TORRICELLI and I are introducing today, there is more flexibility given to the bankruptcy judge. 
   Under the Grassley-Torricelli bill, there are even greater 
   consumer protections than were in last year's conference report. For instance, in order to protect consumers from deceptive and coercive collection Practices, the Justice Department and the FBI are directed to appoint one agent and one prosecutor to investigate abusive or deceptive reaffirmation practices. Sears recently plead guilty in Massachusetts to bankruptcy fraud in connection with its business practices in seeking reaffirmations, and agreed to pay 60 million dollars in fines. 
   I think this shows that we already have tough laws on the books regarding reaffirmations. What we need is better law enforcement, not new laws. That's why we require the Justice Department and the FBI to designate a person to investigate reaffirmation practices. Under the Grassley-Torricelli bill, State attorney generals may enforce State criminal statutes similar to those under which Sears was prosecuted, and the State attorney generals are given the express authority to enforce consumer protections already in the bankruptcy code. Taken together, these provisions amount to a massive infusion of Federal and State law enforcment resources for the purpose of protecting consumers in bankruptcy court from abusive collection tactics. 
   The Grassley-Torricelli bill retains all the protections for child support in last year's conference report, with important new additions. Now, bankruptcy trustees would be required to notify State enforcment agencies of a bankrupt's address and telephone number if the bankrupt owes child support. This means that the bankruptcy court will now help to track down dead-beat parents. 
   Also, the bill I'm introducing today also provides that debts incurred prior to bankruptcy to pay off non-dischargeable debts will still be dischargeable if the bankrupt owes child support. This means that child support will never have to compete with this new category of non-dischargeable debt after bankruptcy. Taken together, these provisions will provide key new protections for child support claimants. 
   Mr. President, in addition to the consumer provisions, the Grassley-  Torricelli bill also contains numerous changes to improve the bankruptcy code for businesses. The bill makes numerous changes to the treatment of tax claims in bankruptcy, and I expect that these provision will be refined on the floor as the Finance Committee makes some suggestions. 
   The bill also creates a new chapter 15 to address the growing problem on transnational bankruptcies. 
   The bill contains provisions to make chapter 12 permanent and to expand access to chapter 12. 
   The bill contains an entire title dedicated to expediting chapter 11 proceedings for small businesses. 
   One business-related provision I want to high-light relates to protecting patients when hospitals and health-care businesses declare bankruptcy. I chaired a hearing on this topic last year and I was shocked to realize that the bankruptcy code doesn't require bankruptcy trustees and creditor committees to consider the welfare of patients when closing down or re-organizing a hospital or nursing home. So, under the Grassley-Torricelli bill, whenever a hospital or nursing home declares bankruptcy a patient ombudsman will be appointed to represent the interests of patients during bankruptcy proceedings. And bankruptcy trustees are required to safeguard the privacy of medical records when closing a health care business. These provisions will provide significant protections for patients in bankruptcy proceedings. 
   Mr. President, this bill contains many much-needed reforms. This bill is fair, balanced and should receive strong bi-partisan support. I ask unanimous consent to print the bill in the RECORD as there is much public interest in bankruptcy reform and I want to get as much information out as possible. I also ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a summary of the major differences between this bill and the conference report from last year.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, along with Senators CONRAD and GRAMS of Minnesota, I am introducing a bill to exempt certain farm rental income from the self-employment tax. 
   The self-employment tax has been applied equally to farmers and other business people for the last 40 years. Our bill would ensure equality in the future. It states that farm landlords should be treated the same as small business people and other commercial landlords, and they should not have to pay self-employment tax on cash rent income. 
   The current law is drafted to ensure that self-employment tax applies to income from labor or employment. Farm landlords were only taxed when they participated in the operation of the farm. Income from cash rent represents the value of ownership or equity in land, not labor or employment. Therefore, the self-employment tax should not apply to income from cash rent. Yet, this is not they way that the Internal Revenue Service drafted its technical advice memorandum on this matter. This has resulted in farmers and retired farmers now paying a 15.3 percent self-employment tax on cash rent. 
   The IRS has gone too far. The law should be what people have counted on for 40 years. Unless there is an act of Congress, history should be respected. The test of time will prove that the taxpayer was right and that the IRS was wrong, particularly now that there is a difference between the farm and city sector. Therefore, we are introducing this bill so that farmers and retired farmers will not be singled out unfairly by the IRS. 
   Specifically, this legislation would remove the code's ambiguity and recapture its original intent. The legislation would clarify that when the IRS is applying the self-employment tax to cash rent farm leases, it would limit its applicability to the lease agreement. This is not an expansion of the law of taxpayers. Rather, it would limit the anti taxpayer expansion initiated by the Internal Revenue Service. The tax law does not require cash rent landlords in cities to pay the self-employment tax. Indeed cash rent farm landlords are the only ones required to pay the tax. This is due to a 40-year-old exception that allowed the retired farmers of the late 1950's to become vested in the Social Security system. 
   The law originally imposed the tax on farm landlords only when their lease agreements with the renters required them to participate in the operation of the farm and in the farming of the land. 
   Forty years later, the IRS has expanded the application of self-employment tax for farmland owners. The tax court told the IRS that in one particular instant they could look beyond the lease agreement. On this very limited authority, the IRS has expanded one tax court case into national tax policy. 
   Our legislation will bring fairness between farmer landlords and urban landlords. It will clarify that the IRS should examine only the lease agreement. It would preserve the pre-1996 status quo. It would preserve the historical self-employment tax treatment of farm rental agreements, equating them with landlords in small businesses and commercial properties. The 1957 tax law was designed to benefit retired farmers of that generation so they would qualify for Social Security. 
   Congress does not intend that farm owners be treated differently from other real estate owners, other than they have been historically. We need clarity provided in our legislation in order to turn back an improper, unilateral, and targeted IRS expansion of settled tax law. 
   I urge my colleagues to join us in addressing this unfair position taken by the Internal Revenue Service.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last Friday, on behalf of Senator BOB KERREY and myself, I introduced legislation that will chart a new United States approach to the terrible problem of child exploitation in overseas labor markets. 
   This legislation, S. 553, the International Child Welfare Protection Act, will target new, additional trade benefits to countries that comply with the provisions of the International Labor Organization's Convention No. 138 concerning the minimum age for admission to employment, also known as the Minimum Age Convention. 
   The aim of the Minimum Age Convention is to abolish child labor throughout the world by establishing a minimum age at which children may be employed. 
   Our legislation will do two things: 
   It will give the President the authority to grant a country that complies with the Minimum Age Convention up to a 50-percent tariff rate cut on items produced in that country that would not otherwise be eligible for preferential tariff rates. 
   It will also permit the President to waive current limitations on the amounts of additional goods that countries complying with the Minimum Age Convention may export to the United States. 
   In the unlikely event the President finds that domestic industries are hurt because of these special, targeted trade benefits, the President also has the authority to suspend, limit, or withdraw the benefits. 
   This legislation is important for three reasons. 
   First, it is a tragic fact that child labor is rampant in many places in the world, despite more laws aimed at stopping this inhumane practice. International Labor Organization statistics show that between 100 and 200 million children worldwide are engaged in providing goods and services. Ninety-five percent of these children, according to the ILO, work in developing countries. Why are children pressed into service as low-paid or unpaid workers? Because, according to the ILO, children are ``generally less demanding, more obedient, and less likely to object to their treatment or conditions of work.'' It is very obvious that we must all do what we can to stop this unconscionable practice. 
   The second reason we need this legislation is because it is clear that regulation and enforcement alone will not work. Incentives are needed as well. The reason that it is so tough to enforce child labor standards is that it is often very difficult to trace specific products to specific plants in specific countries. The Department of Labor's Bureau of International Labor Affairs says that quantifying the extent of child labor in a particular country's export industry ``can seldom be done with specificity.'' If you can't even trace the goods or services with certainty, you can't expect enforcement alone to be the answer. Hence the incentives that are in our legislation. 
   Finally, we need this legislation because even though the ILO Minimum Age Convention was adopted in 1973, only 21 developing country member states out of 173 ILO member states have ratified the Convention to stop child labor. Out of the 21 developing country member states that have ratified the Convention, none is from Asia, where over half of all working children are to be found. If even one additional ILO member state ratifies the Convention because of the trade incentives this legislation offers, we will have achieved a great deal. 
   I am on the floor today stating again what is obvious but also to remind my colleagues, with the introduction of this bill by Senator KERREY of Nebraska and myself on Friday, you have an opportunity to cosponsor this bill, and I hope you will do so. I hope then that we have results from legislation which we have already on the books to enforce regulation, but we also have results from these efforts that are presented in our legislation for a more market-oriented approach to helping solve this bad economic situation of very young child labor.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I am joining my colleague from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, in introducing the School Construction Financing Improvement Act of 1999. 
   The single most important source of funding for investment in public school construction and rehabilitation is the tax-exempt bond market. Tax-exempt bonds finance approximately 90 percent of the nation's investment in public schools. In my home state of Iowa over $625 million in tax-exempt bonds were issued to school districts in 1998 alone. 
   There is a well-recongized need throughout the country for billions of additional new dollars in school construction and rehabilitation. A report from the General Accounting Office says urban schools alone need $112 billion in repairs over three years to bring their buildings back into working order. That same study says about 14 million children attend U.S. schools in need of extensive repairs, and about 7 million attend schools with life threatening safety code violations. 
   American schoolchildren attending schools with leaky roofs, inadequate bathrooms, poor air quality, and unreliable fire protection equipment is an unacceptable state of affairs. We need to step up to the plate and address this issue, not only promptly, but also properly. The administration's proposed use of tax credit bonds is inherently unworkable and inefficient. The school districts in states all across this land need greater flexibility not more federal regulations and controls. 
   Tax-exempt bonds have proven to be an effective financial instrument to fund school rehabilitation and construction. Therefore, it is appropriate and necessary to examine tax code limitations on the use of tax-exempt bonds for schools and to consider ways to amend the code to give school districts even greater access to the capital they earnestly need and deserve. Let's expand on something that works. 
   The administration has proposed policy initiatives to enhance and expand the use of tax credit bonds called ``Qualified Zone Academy Bonds'' or QZABs. However the QZAB program has proven incapable of attracting investors due to inherent flaws in tax credit bonds that make them extremely illiquid and unpredictable investments, and specific limitations on the use of these bonds imposed by the federal government on the states. These significant and crippling limitations include the exclusion of individual investors from purchasing QZABs,  the requirement that school districts secure hard to come by ``private business contributions'', and prohibitions on the use of QZABs to fund new school construction projects. 
   Experience and study has shown that tax exempt bonds are a more workable, more efficient, and more popular alternative to QZABs. This bill reflects my belief that the wisest course to achieving the goal of providing schools with necessary capital to build and rehabilitate our nation's schools is to continue refining tax code limitations on the use of tax-exempt bonds. 
   The legislation Senator GRAHAM and I are introducing today is designed to narrowly target the use of tax-exempt bonds to school construction alone and do not change any tax code provisions designed to prevent abuse of bond issuance authority. 
   The first provision would allow school districts to make use of public-private partnerships in issuing tax-exempt bonds for public school construction or rehabilitation. The bonds would be exempt from the annual state volume caps. This will allow schools to leverage private investment in school facilities and would encourage school districts to partner with private investors in new and creative ways. 
   The second provision addresses the current two year construction spend-down exemption in arbitrage rebate regulations. This policy allows the exemption of bonds from arbitrage rebate if the issuer spends virtually all its bond proceeds within two years of the time these bonds for construction projects are issued. We recommend an extension of this exemption from two years to four years for school bonds. Often the two year limit is insufficient to cover major construction projects, especially when multiple projects are funded from a single bond issue. The extension of time limit on the exemption provision will also improve the flexibility of school districts that use bonds and relive the school bond issuer from superfluous and burdensome tax compliance costs. 
   The second provision would also raise from $10 million to $15 million the volume of school construction bonds a small school district could issue each year and still qualify for the small-issuer arbitrage rebate exemption. This provision expands the benefits of the small-issuer rebate exemption to a much broader universe of small school bond issuers. 
   The third provision of the bill would permit banks to invest in certain qualified tax-exempt school construction bonds without penalty. Before the Tax Reform Act of 1986 that imposed a tax penalty on banks that earn tax-exempt interest, commercial banks were one of the most active groups of investors in the municipal bond market. This provision would directly reduce the cost of borrowing for new school construction and would result in more investment in public schools. 
   I urge my colleagues to join Senator GRAHAM and myself in trying to help schools receive the crucial funds necessary to build and repair America's schools.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senators GRAHAM, ROTH, and MOYNIHAN in introducing legislation that will be an important step in safeguarding our most vulnerable citizens. The Nursing Home Residential Security Act of 1999 will protect nursing home residents who are covered by Medicaid from being thrown out of a facility to make room for a more lucrative, private-pay patient. 
   It is hard to believe that a facility would uproot a frail individual for the sole purpose of a few extra dollars. However, in the past year there have been documented cases of Medicaid beneficiaries who have been at risk of being forced to leave a facility based solely on reimbursement status. The result is often severe trauma and a mortality rate that is two to three times higher than other nursing home residents. This is no way to treat our elderly. 
   I want to make it clear that these situations are rare. The vast majority of nursing homes are compassionate and decent facilities. My state of Iowa has been privileged to have many nursing homes that stand as models of quality care. Unfortunately, a few bad apples can damage the reputation of an entire industry. That is why I am pleased that this bipartisan legislation has the support of the nursing home industry as well as senior citizens' advocates. 
   This commonsense proposal would prevent nursing homes who have already accepted a Medicaid patient from evicting or transferring the patient based solely on payment status. Nursing homes would still be entitled to decide who gains access to their facilities, however, they would be required to inform new residents that if they spend down to Medicaid, they are entitled to discharge or transfer them to another facility. 
   This legislation is an important step in protecting these frail individuals. People move into nursing homes for around-the-clock health care in a safe environment. The last thing they expect is to be put out on the street. That's also the last thing they deserve. This bill prevents residents from getting hurt if their nursing home pulls out of Medicaid and ensures that people know their rights up front, before they enter a facility. 
   This commonsense proposal has also been introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman BILIRAKIS where it has received strong bipartisan support. I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to cosponsor this worthwhile proposal. And, I look forward to the passage of this resolution this year.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to expand the tax deduction for student loan interest. Senators BAUCUS, JEFFORDS, COLLINS, COCHRAN and ABRAHAM are joining me in introducing this legislation. 
   Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the tax deduction for student loan interest was eliminated. This action, done in the name of fiscal responsibility, blatantly disregarded the duty we have to the education of our nation's students. This struck me and many of my colleagues as wrong. Since 1987, I have spearheaded the bipartisan effort to reinstate the tax deduction for student loan interest. In 1992, we succeeded in passing the legislation to reinstate the deduction, only to have it vetoed as part of a larger bill with tax increases. Finally, after ten long years, our determination and perseverance paid off. Under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, we succeeded in reinstating the deduction. In our success, we sent a clear message to students and their families across the country that the Congress of the United States understands the financial hardships they face, and that we are willing to assist them in easing those hardships so they can receive the education they need. 
   In 1997 we took steps in the right direction, and did what had to be done. Regrettably, due to fiscal constraints, we were not able to go as far as we wanted to go. The nation was still in a fiscal crisis at that time. In order to control costs, we were forced to limit the deductibility of student loan interest to only sixty loan payments, which is equivalent to five years plus time spent in forbearance or deferment. 
   This restriction hurts some of the most needy borrowers. Many of these borrowers are students who, due to limited means, have borrowed most heavily. The restriction discriminates against those who have the highest debt loads and lowest incomes. It makes the American dream harder to achieve for those struggling to pull themselves up--for those who started with less. It is unjust. 
   Today, our situation is vastly different. In these times of economic vitality and budget surplus, we have a responsibility to do what we were unable to do before. Student debt is rising to alarming levels, and additional relief must be provided. We must eliminate the sixty month restriction on the deductibility of student loan interest and show that the United States Congress stands behind all of our nation's students in their endeavors to better themselves. 
   Eliminating the sixty payment restriction will bring needed relief to some of the most deserving borrowers. The restriction weighs heavily on those who, despite lower pay, have decided to dedicate themselves to a career in public service. We will be rewarding civic virtue as we provide relief to these admirable citizens. 
   Additionally, eliminating this restriction will eliminate difficult and costly reporting requirements that are currently required for both borrowers and lenders. In supporting our nation's students, we will also be cutting costly bureaucracy. 
   Currently, to claim the deduction, the taxpayer must have an adjusted gross income of $40,000 or less, or $60,000 for married couples. The amount of the deduction is gradually phased out for those with incomes between $40,000 and $55,000, or $60,000 and $75,000 for married couples. Additionally, the deduction itself was phased in at $1000, and will cap out at $2500 in 2002. 
   Many in our country are suffering from excessive student debt. More can and must be done to help them. In this time of economic plenty, it is our duty to invest in our students' education. Doing so is an investment in America's future. To maintain competitiveness in the global marketplace, America must have a well-educated workforce. By eliminating the sixty payment restriction on the deductibility of student loan interest we recommit ourselves to education and to maintaining the position of this country at the pinnacle of the free world. 
   The administration supports this direction as well. In his 2000 budget, President Clinton has proposed to eliminate the sixty payment restriction on the deductibility of student loan interest, starting after 1999. Our legislation takes a more fair and inclusive approach by including payments between 1997 and 1999, which the administration leaves out. 
   I urge members to join us in this effort to relieve the excessive burdens on those trying to better themselves and their families through education by expanding the tax deduction for student loan interest payments.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Improvement Act of  1999 with my colleague, Senator REID. This legislation will enable seniors to receive medically necessary rehabilitative services based on their condition and health and not on arbitrary payment limits. We introduced similar legislation last Congress. 
   The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 is a very important accomplishment and one that I am proud to say I supported. However, in our rush to save the Medicare Trust Fund from bankruptcy, Congress neglected to thoroughly evaluate the impact the new payment limits on rehabilitative services would have on Medicare beneficiaries. 
   The BBA included a $1500 cap on occupational, physical and speech-language pathology therapy services received outside a hospital setting. This provision became effective January 1, 1999, and after just 31 days of implementation, an estimated one in four beneficiaries had exhausted half of their yearly benefit. According to a recent study, these limitations on services will harm almost 13 percent or 750,000 of Medicare beneficiaries because these individuals will exceed the cap. While many seniors will not need services that would cause them to exceed the $1500 cap, others, like stroke victims and patients with Parkinson's disease, will likely need services beyond what the arbitrary caps will cover. Unfortunately, it is those beneficiaries who need rehabilitative care the most who will be penalized by being forced to pay the entire cost for these services outside of a hospital setting. 
   The bill I am introducing would establish certain exceptions to the $1500 cap, for beneficiaries who have medical needs that require more intensive treatment than this benefit limit would allow. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services would be required to implement the exceptions, and providers would be required to demonstrate medical necessity based on the criteria outlined in the bill. In essence, the bill attempts to accomplish the primary goal of the $1500 cap, budgetary savings, but without harming the Medicare beneficiary. Payment is based on the patient's condition and not on an arbitrary monetary amount. Help us provide access to services for those beneficiaries who will need these services or risk further complications, establish a system that makes sense, and still achieve the budget savings sought from the BBA without reducing Medicare benefits. 
   Please join me and my colleagues in passing this legislation.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. Chief Justice, my fellow Senators, as this trial nears the end, we have to ask the question how we got here with a tragedy like this. There are many losers. There are no winners. There are surely no heroes. There are lots of lessons to be learned, and I think all of our prayers ought to go out to those who were ensnared in the web of controversy. 
   In reflecting on this case and my role in it under the Constitution, the word ``sad'' comes to mind. I have not relished sitting in judgment of a twice-elected, popular President. I would prefer to make history in other ways. I also regret the nature of the subject of this case. It is not easy having our entire society suddenly thrust into an open, nonstop debate about things that ought to make all of us blush.  
   Some say that this impeachment effort is part of a right-wing conspiracy, it is a Republican plot to get a Democratic President. Let's look at how we got here and see if that argument holds up. 
   We are here because the President did wrongful acts and he admits to that. We are here because of the independent counsel law. The President himself led the charge to reauthorize the Independent Counsel Act. Thirty-three of my colleagues on this side of the aisle were in the Senate at that particular time. All but one of you voted for reauthorization. 
   On June 30, 1994, the President signed that reauthorization bill. He issued a statement and here is what he said:  
   This law, originally passed in 1978, is a foundation stone for the trust between Government and our citizens.....  
   He says,  
   Opponents called it a tool of partisan attack against Republican Presidents and a waste of taxpayer funds. It was neither. In fact, the independent counsel statute has been in the past and is today a force for Government integrity and public confidence.  
   Those were the words of President Clinton, June 30, 1994. 
   Before reauthorization, it was the President himself who advocated the appointment of a special prosecutor. That appointment was made by the President's own Attorney General. After reauthorization, the Attorney General supported the appointment of an independent counsel. The independent counsel was then appointed by a special three-judge panel, as required by law. 
   Also under the law, the Attorney General can initiate the dismissal of an independent counsel if he oversteps his bounds or acts improperly. Not only was this never done by the President's Attorney General but, in contrast, she even agreed several times to expand his jurisdiction, including to cover the Monica Lewinsky matter. 
   Also under the law, the independent counsel is obliged to send to the House any evidences of crimes that might be impeachable. 
   In short, this case came about through a legitimate, legal process. It is a process that historically was vigorously defended by this side of the aisle. There are various checks and balances built into the process. They are designed to prevent abuse by the independent counsel, but they were never triggered, even though the President's own Attorney General could move for dismissal. 
   No, this President is in this predicament because of his own private wrongdoing and because of public policy he pursued. There is no conspiracy. 
   The President's actions are having a profound impact, of course, upon our society. His misdeeds have caused many to mistrust elected officials. Cynicism is swelling among the grassroots. His breach of trust has eroded the public's faith in the office of the Presidency. The President's wrongdoing has painted all of us in Washington with a very broad brush. 
   In the past 12 months, thousands of Iowans have registered their opinions with me. One letter from a middle school principal speaks volumes. 
   At an assembly to mark the new school year, a video entitled ``Attitude is Everything'' was presented to the student body. The video was all about American heroes--college athletes, Olympic medalists, astronauts and world leaders. 
   Logically, the video also included President Clinton. The school principal wrote to me the following. He said, when the President's picture appeared, the entire student body--ages 11 to 14--snickered. He said their spontaneous reaction struck a chord. He wrote:  
   Although they may not fully understand the adult connotations and political ramifications.....they do know that if you want to be trusted and [if you want to be] respected, you must tell the truth......[A]s an educator in Iowa's public schools for the past 16 years.....our students' reaction to President Clinton's picture is one of the saddest moments I can recall. In that instant, I realized how deeply his conduct has affected our country.  
   Mr. Chief Justice, there is that word ``sad'' again. It seems to come to the fore in people's minds over this case, over this President's conduct, and over the impact it has had on our country. 
   The true tragedy in this case is the collapse of the President's moral authority. He undermined himself when he wagged his finger and lied to our people on national television, denying that relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. That did more damage to his credibility than any other single act. 
   There was no better reason than that for the resignation of the President. I did not personally call for his resignation in August. That is something the President should decide on his own. But once you lose your moral authority to lead, you are a failure as a leader. FDR once spoke of the Presidency in this way:  
   The Presidency is not merely an administrative office......It is preeminently a place of moral leadership.  
   Mr. Clinton should take note. 
   Next, there is the issue of the abuse of power and authority. The President used his position to enter into an improper relationship with a subordinate--not just a subordinate, a young intern. He later used his power to find her a job. 
   Another abuse of power: The full powers of the White House were on lease to stonewall the process and to attack the credibility of those who investigated him. 
   This White House has perfected the art of stonewalling around the truth. I fear that future White Houses will learn much from these experts and will refine and improve their own truth-fighting arsenals. Truth and openness will be casualties. 
   Last, there is the issue of the poor example the President's actions serve for the Nation, especially for our youth. Is it now OK to lie because the President does it? And in the same manner, by wordsmithing, by trying to figure out what the meaning is of the word ``is''? 
   I received a call recently from a mother of a teenage son in Des Moines. All last year, she thought the investigation of the President was a wasteful, partisan witch hunt. She was totally against the investigation and impeachment. 
   And then her son got into some serious trouble, and it involved lying. She confronted him with the wrong. Her son responded: ``What I told you is the truth as I understood it at the time.'' 
   The mother grew furious, and she said at that moment she knew that we couldn't have a President like Bill Clinton. She knew firsthand the damage that his conduct had done to her family and to our country. At that point, she said she changed her position in favor of impeachment. 
   These are all questions and issues that emerge from the broader contours of this case, outside the narrow charges in the articles. 
   With respect to the impeachment charges, many of the President's arguments are based on contorted interpretations of the facts. These interpretations aren't credible. They represent lawyering at its best or, as some would say, at its worst. 
   It is clear to me that the President committed serious crimes when he coached his secretary, Betty Currie, and when he misled his aides, Sidney Blumenthal and John Podesta. Each of these aides ended up being a witness in official court proceedings. I believe, based on the evidence before the Senate, that the President lied to these witnesses so they would repeat those lies before official court proceedings. That is obstruction of justice. 
   In addition, I find it very interesting that a power lawyer like Vernon Jordan would be so active in the job hunt for Ms. Lewinsky. Regardless of what she felt or thought, I believe the President was arranging to get her a job. That way, she wouldn't provide harmful testimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit. Again, obstruction of justice. 
   Mr. Chief Justice, these actions weren't just outrageous, and, more important, morally wrong, but they were also illegal. They were a direct assault on the integrity of the judicial process. The President is guilty of the offenses charged under article II. 
   The first article charges that the President committed perjury on several occasions. While I am not convinced he committed perjury on each occasion charged, I believe he did commit perjury when he lied about his efforts to obstruct justice. That is the fourth count. 
   I don't believe the President's statement that he was merely trying to refresh his memory when he spoke with Betty Currie about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, and I don't believe  the President's statement that he was only trying to protect himself from embarrassment when he concocted elaborate lies about Ms. Lewinsky and then conveyed those lies to his aides. 
   The President was not forthright when he testified before the grand jury. Time and time again, he gave answers that were misleading and sometimes deliberately false. The American people have a right to expect their President to be completely truthful, as they can expect you and me to be completely truthful. And the American people have a right to expect their President to be truthful, especially when placed under oath. I will vote guilty on article I as well. 
   Mr. Chief Justice, these were not easy decisions. They are the product of soul-searching, as it is for all of you. So they leave me with a good conscience. I believe my votes reflect the truth of what happened in this case. 
   The Senate is about to close this chapter in American history. It may or may not be the final chapter in this story. Nonetheless, our decision in this impeachment trial will stand against the test of time. You only truly understand the present when it is past. In that respect, future generations will serve as our jury and, in the end, history will serve as the final judge. Thank you.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to lament the too early death on December 19, after a four-year long battle with breast cancer, of a former staff member and friend, Linda Nersesian, and to offer my heartfelt sympathy to her husband Robert Rae Gordon; her two children, nine year old George Raeburn Gordon, and six year old Louise Grace Gordon; her parents, Elsie Louise Nazarian and Serop S. Nersesian; her brother Robert S. Nersesian; and the many, many friends and associates in the Congress and in Washington who will miss her greatly. 
   Linda served in the Senate for six and one-half years, from August 4, 1980 to January 5, 1987. She began her Senate career in the office of Senator Dole where she worked on energy and environmental issues. Linda left Senator Dole's office in April of 1981 to join my staff as a staff attorney on the Subcommittee on Agency Administration of the Judiciary Committee, which I then chaired. On the Subcommittee, Linda worked on a number of my highest legislative priorities. She consistently demonstrated initiative, intelligence, and savvy. 
   When I became Chairman of the Subcommittee on Aging of the Labor and Human Resources Committee at the beginning of the 98th Congress in 1983, the strong leadership qualities that Linda consistently demonstrated in her work on the Administrative Practices Subcommittee made her the perfect choice to serve as chief counsel and staff director of the Subcommittee on Aging. In that capacity, she organized the office, recruited a staff, and oversaw the work of the Subcommittee through 1983. She was also responsible for advising me on major bills relating to pharmaceutical drugs which were then under consideration by the Committee. 
   In late 1983, Linda once again seemed the perfect choice for a position of major responsibility, this time as the chief counsel and staff director of the Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure. In that capacity, she was responsible for the child Pornography Act. She also worked on what became the 1986 amendments to the False Claims Act and the Equal Access to Justice Act. And she worked on defense procurement fraud. These were among my highest legislative and oversight priorities at that time. 
   After serving as chief counsel of the Subcommittee until January 21, 185, Senator Dole asked Linda to be the assistant secretary of the Senate. She  served in that capacity until January 5, 1987, when she left the Senate to become legislative counsel to the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association. In due course, Linda again assumed greater responsibility, becoming the Association's vice president for government relations, a position she held until she left to build her own consulting firm, the Columbia Consulting Group. 
   Mr. President, Linda Nersesian was a unique and remarkable individual. Her personal qualities of drive, decisiveness, intelligence, common sense, persistence, and good humor were evident to all who came in contact with her. It was easy to have confidence in Linda; she always knew what to do. Her manifest talents invariably led her to be entrusted with positions of responsibility. She contributed much in the time given to her. She will be greatly missed.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important tax legislation for myself and Senators JEFFORDS, CONRAD, MURKOWSKI, LEAHY, WELLSTONE, CHAFEE, SMITH of Oregon, BREAUX, GRAHAM, MACK, DASCHLE, and DORGAN. 
   Our legislation extends the production tax credit for energy generated by wind. This proposed bill resembles bi-partisan legislation introduced in November of 1998 that, unfortunately, was not enacted. 
   As original author of the Wind Energy Incentives Act of 1993, I strongly believe that the expansion and development of wind energy must be facilitated by this production tax credit. 
   The Senate has previously supported wind energy production tax credit legislation. I would therefore like to request that Senators again consider this valuable initiative that would help secure this untapped potential for clean power. 
   Wind, unlike most energy sources, is an efficient and environmentally safe form of energy use. Wind is renewable and does not obligate the United States to rely on unstable foreign states for sources of energy. 
   This legislation extends the production tax credit through the month of June, 2004. We all know the damaging effects fossil fuels have on our environment. Wind energy, by contrast, is clean, safe, and abundant within the United States. 
   Every 10,000 megawatts of wind energy can reduce carbon monoxide emissions by 33 million metric tons. Today, the United States produces only 1,700  megawatts of wind energy. However, experts estimate that American wind capacity can produce up to 30,000 megawatts by the year 2010--that is enough energy to meet the demands of over 10 million homes, while reducing pollution in every state. 
   The production tax credit has brought wind power generation costs almost down to the same as coal and gas energy levels. In order to continue this investment in America's energy future, we must extend the production tax credit. 
   Currently, my own state of Iowa has 5 new wind power projects ready to go online just this year. These 5 projects, with the megawatt capacity of over 240, join the already existing 6 facilities in Iowa. Even large petroleum producing states like Texas, ranked 2nd in the nation in wind energy potential, recognize the growing significance of wind power. 
   Renewing the wind tax credit would allow for greater expansion into the wind energy field. These projects take a long time to develop and assured tax breaks would help facilitate more wind power construction contracts. Withhold the tax credit and investment will surely decline for new wind projects. This is because it takes as much as 3 years to obtain financing and permitting to build a new facility. 
   Wind is a domestic natural resource, found abundant in almost every state. Wind is homegrown energy, that cannot be controlled by any foreign state or power. American lives need not be put at risk to protect overseas sources of wind energy. 
   Wind energy can be harnessed without the detrimental effects of fossil fuel pollution. Wind is a stable and reliable form of power that is renewable and inextinguishable. This legislation ensures that wind energy does not fall by the wayside as a productive alternative energy source. The Senate needs to extend this important legislation and I encourage all my colleagues to join us in this effort.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree with my colleagues from Montana and Mississippi about this very important issue. The development and use of alternative fuels are important to this nation, and we must encourage their use and development. 
   Wind energy has long been recognized as an abundant potential source of electric power. A detailed analysis by the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest Laboratory in 1991 estimated the energy potential of the U.S. wind resource at 10.8 trillion kilowatt hours annually, or more than three times total current U.S. electricity consumption. Wind energy is a clean resource that produces electricity with virtually no carbon dioxide emissions. There is nothing limited or controversial about this source of energy. Americans need only to make the necessary investments in order to capture it for power. 
   The Production Tax Credit, section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code was enacted as part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. This tax credit is a sound low-cost investment in an emerging sector of the energy industry. I introduced the first bill that contained this tax credit, so you can be sure that I am sincere in my belief in the need to develop this resource. This tax credit currently provides a 1.5 cent per kilowatt hour credit for energy produced from a new facility brought on-line after December 31, 1993 and before July 1, 1999 for the first ten years of the facility's existence. Last Fall, I introduced a bill to extend this tax credit for five years. My legislation, S. 1459, currently has 22 cosponsors, including half of the Finance Committee. The House companion legislation, introduced by Congressman Thomas, currently has 90 cosponsors, including over half of the Ways and Means Committee. These numbers are a strong testament to the importance of the section 45, and renewable fuels in general. 
   In addition, I plan to work to expand this tax credit to allow use of the closed-loop biomass portion of this tax credit. Switchgrass from my state and other Midwestern states, eucalyptus from the South, and other biomass, can be grown for the exclusive purpose of producting energy. This is a productive use of our land, and will be an important step in our use and development of alternative and renewable fuels. 
   I was very pleased to see that Congress expressed its understanding of the importance of alternative and renewable fuels by extending the ethanol tax credit in this year's T-2 legislation. These tax credits are a successful way of promoting alternative sources of energy. These tax credits are a cheap investment with high returns for ourselves, our children, our grandchildren and even their grandchildren. Congress needs to again pass this important legislation to ensure that these energy tax credits are extended into the century.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with Senators KOHL and THURMOND, the Class Action Fairness Act of 1999, a bill that will help curb class action lawsuit abuse. Last year, Senator KOHL and I introduced the Class Action Fairness Act of 1998, S. 2083. That bill was marked up in the Administrative Oversight and the Courts Subcommittee on September 10, 1998, and we favorably voted out of subcommittee a substitute amendment to the bill. Unfortunately, this legislation was not considered further by the Senate because of the press of other legislative business scheduled before the full Judiciary Committee. 
   We are now reintroducing the substitute amendment to last year's class action bill, with minor modifications, as the Class Action Fairness Act of 1999. This modest bill will go a long way toward ending class action lawsuit abuses where the plaintiffs receive very little and their lawyers receive a whole lot. This bill will preserve class action lawsuits as an important tool that brings representation to the unrepresented and result in important discrimination and consumer decisions. 
   In October 1997, my Judiciary Subcommittee held a hearing on the problem of certain class action lawsuit settlements. I found one example of class action lawsuit abuse to be particularly disturbing. In an antitrust case settled in the Northern District of Illinois in 1993, the plaintiff class alleged that multiple domestic airlines participated in price-fixing, which resulted in plaintiffs paying more for airline tickets than they otherwise would have had to pay. 
   In the settlement, all of the class plaintiffs were awarded a book of coupons which could be used toward the purchase of future airline tickets. These coupons varied in amount and number, based on how many plane tickets a particular plaintiff had purchased. The catch was that the plaintiff still had to pay for most of any new airline ticket out of his or her own pocket. This meant that only $10 worth of coupons could be used toward the purchase of a $100 ticket; up to $25 worth of coupons for a $250 ticket; up to $50 worth of coupons for a $500 ticket, and so on. In addition, these coupons could not be used on certain blackout dates, which appeared to include all holidays and peak travel times. 
   Interestingly enough, the attorneys did not get paid with these coupon books. Rather, the attorneys were paid cash--$16 million in cash. Now, if the coupons were good enough for their clients--the people that actually got ripped off--I wonder why those same coupons were not good enough for their lawyers. 
   Another example of an egregious class action lawsuit settlement was highlighted at the subcommittee hearing. Mrs. Martha Preston was a member of the plaintiff class in 
   the case Hoffman versus Banc Boston, where some plaintiffs received under $10 each in compensation for their injuries, yet were docked from $75 to $90 for attorneys' fees. This means that attorneys who were supposed to be representing these people's best interests, agreed to a settlement that cost some of the plaintiffs more money than they received in compensation for being wronged. 
   These class action lawsuit abuses happen for a number of reasons. One reasons is that plaintiffs' lawyers negotiate their own fees as part of the settlement. This can result in distracting lawyers from focusing on their client's needs, and settling or refusing to settle based on the amount of their own compensation. 
   During our hearing, evidence was presented that at least one group of plaintiffs' lawyers meets on a regular basis to discuss initiating class action lawsuits. They scan the Federal Register and other publications to get ideas for lawsuits, and only after they have identified a wrong, do they find clients for their lawsuits. Instead of having clients who complain of harms going to hire attorneys, these attorneys find the harms first and then recruit potential clients with the promise of compensation. 
   On the other hand, the defendants do not always have clean hands. Plaintiffs' lawyers say that they are approached by lawyers from large corporations who urge them to find a class and sue the corporation. The corporations may use the class action lawsuit as a tool to limit their liability. Once a lawsuit is initiated and settled, no member of the class may sue based on that claim. In other words, if a corporation settle a class action lawsuit by paying all class members $10 as compensation for a faulty product, the plaintiffs can no longer sue for any harm caused by the faulty product. This is one way of buying immunity for liability.

    Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation introduced last week by Senators JEFFORDS, KENNEDY, ROTH, and MOYNIHAN. I commend my colleagues for their dedication to improving the way federal programs serve persons with disabilities. Continuing my support for this effort from last Congress, I am glad to announce that I joined my colleagues as an original co-sponsor this year of S. 331, The Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. 
   This bill addresses one of the great tragedies of our current disability system, a system that forces many people with disabilities to choose between working and maintaining access to necessary health benefits. This was never the intention of these programs. It is critical that we act now to overturn today's policies of disincentives towards work and replace them with thoughtful, targeted incentives that will enable many individuals with disabilities to return to work. 
   Over the years I have heard from Iowans who have been forced to leave the work force because of a disability. While they remain disabled and still require ongoing health benefits, they are eager to return to work. However, because of the risk of losing critical health benefits covered by Medicare and Medicaid, too many capable individuals are deterred from entering or re-entering the work force. 
   It is essential that our public disability programs encourage, not discourage, employment. This legislation tackles the risks and uncertainties disabled individuals face when trying to return to work. For individuals eligible for the Supplemental Security Income  (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) programs, this legislation provides for continued coverage of critical benefits under the Medicaid program, such as personal assistance and prescription drugs. These services are vital to many people with disabilities. Furthermore, this proposal would provide beneficiaries with unprecedented access to private rehabilitation services. Currently, the Social Security Administration is unable to refer many beneficiaries for rehabilitation. This legislation would create opportunities for beneficiaries of both the SSI and SSDI programs to access rehabilitation services from either the public or private sector, increasing choice, access and quality of these valuable services. 
   The most encouraging component of this legislative proposal is that which eliminates work disincentives and facilitates self-sufficiency among those with disabilities. This legislation prohibits using work activity as the only basis for triggering a continuing disability review. What's more, the proposal would expedite the process of eligibility determinations for individuals who have been on disability insurance but who lost it because they were working. 
   The risk of losing health care benefits provided through the Medicare and Medicaid programs is a major disincentive for millions of beneficiaries who want to be a part of our nation's dynamic workforce. The intent of these programs was never to demoralize or dishearten Americans who are ready, willing and able to work. I look forward to the passage of this legislation which will unlock the doors to employment for these invaluable citizens.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, earlier today, I introduced the Home Health Integrity Preservation Act of 1999. I am pleased that Senator BREAUX cosponsored this bill, as he did when we introduced it in the 105th Congress. This legislation will be an important tool in combating the waste, fraud and abuse that has threatened the integrity of the Medicare home health benefit. 
   Although the majority of home health agencies are honest, legitimate, businesses, it is clear that there have been unscrupulous providers. In July 1997, the Senate Special Committee on Aging, which I chair, held a hearing on this topic. The hearing exposed serious rip-offs of the Medicare trust fund, and highlighted areas that need more stringent oversight. 
   In response to the hearing, Senator BREAUX and I followed up with a roundtable discussion on home health fraud. The roundtable brought together key players with a variety of perspectives. Participants included law enforcement, the Administration, and the home health industry. 
   The roundtable yielded a number of proposals which were shaped into draft legislation and circulated to a wide variety of stakeholders. In response to comments, the draft was changed to address legitimate concerns that were raised. The result is a balanced piece of legislation that includes important safeguards against fraud and abuse of the system, but does not stifle the growth of legitimate providers. 
   The Home Health Integrity Preservation Act of 1999 would do the following: 
   It would heighten scrutiny of new home health agencies before they enter the Medicare program, and during their early years of Medicare participation. 
   It would improve standards and screening for home health agencies, administrators and employees. 
   It would require audits of home health agencies whose claims exhibit unusual features that may indicate problems, and improve HCFA's ability to identify such features. 
   It would require agencies to adopt and implement fraud and abuse compliance programs. 
   It would increase scrutiny of branch offices, business entities related to home health agencies, and changes in operations. 
   It would make more information on particular home health agencies available to beneficiaries. 
   It would create an interagency Home Health Integrity Task Force, led by the Office of the Inspector General of Health and Human Services. 
   It would reform bankruptcy rules to make it harder for all Medicare providers, not just home health agencies, to avoid penalties and repayment obligations by declaring bankruptcy. 
   This legislation is an important step in ensuring that seniors maintain access to high quality home care services rendered by reputable providers. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort by cosponsoring this important legislation.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator BREAUX and myself, I am introducing legislation today to require the use of universal product numbers (UPNs) for all durable medical equipment (DME) Medicare purchases. A similar bipartisan bill was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representatives AMO HOUGHTON and LOUISE SLAUGHTER. The purpose of this legislation is to improve the Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA) ability to track and to appropriately assess the value of the durable medical equipment it pays for under the Medicare program. Very simply, our bill will ensure Medicare gets what it pays for. 
   According to a report by the General Accounting Office (GAO) and the Office of Inspector General's review of billing practices for specific medical supplies, the Medicare program is often paying greater than the market price for durable medical equipment and Medicare beneficiaries are not receiving the quality of care they should. HCFA currently does not require DME suppliers to identify specific products on their Medicare claims. Therefore it does not know for which products it is paying. HCFA's billing codes often cover a broad range of products of various types, qualities and market prices. For example, the GAO found that one Medicare billing code is used by the industry for more than 200 different urological catheters, with many of these products varying significantly in price, use, and quality. 
   Medicare's inability to accurately track and price medical equipment and supplies it purchases could be remedied with the use of product specific codes known as ``bar codes'' or ``universal product numbers'' (UPNs). These codes are similar to the codes you see on products you purchase at the grocery store. Use of such bar codes is already being required by the Department of Defense and several large private sector purchasing groups. The industry strongly supports such an initiative as well. I am submitting several letters of endorsement for the record on behalf of the National Association for Medical Equipment Services, the Health Industry Distributors Association, Premier Inc., and a joint letter from industry groups such as the Health Industry Business Communications Council, Healthcare EDI Coalition, Health Industry Purchasing Association, and Invacare Corporation. 
   This bill represents a common sense approach. It will improve the way Medicare monitors and reimburses suppliers for medical equipment and supplies. Patients will receive better care. And the Federal Government will save money. I ask that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle support this legislation which I am introducing today with my friend and colleague, Senator BREAUX.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce vitally important legislation to promote the well-being of America's family farms by extending chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code. This bill, which is known as ``safety 2000,'' will also make needed changes to chapter 12 which will make it work better for family farmers. I'm pleased that Senator DASCHLE is joining with me in this effort to save family farms. In Iowa, pork prices recently hit an all time low. Pork producers are facing serious hardship, and we must make sure that those farmers who need bankruptcy relief to help save their farming operation have meaningful protections. 
   Last year, again with the distinguished minority leader, I introduced legislation to make chapter 12 permanent. That legislation passed the Senate by unanimous consent. However, the legislation was not enacted into law. On April 1 of this year, chapter 12 will expire. Mr. President, we cannot let this happen. 
   As the only family farmer in the Senate, I feel I have a unique responsibility to make sure that family farming remains a strong and vibrant part of American life. For generations, family farms have fed this country. But farming has always had rough periods. 
   Allowing chapter 12 to expire will repeat a fatal mistake of the past. During the great depression, Congress created special bankruptcy protections for farmers to help them ride out the severe economic conditions of that tragic era. However, Congress allowed these laws to lapse in the 1950s. So, when farmers in Iowa confronted the farm crisis of the mid-1980s, they were left without effective bankruptcy relief. By passing my legislation, we can prevent the mistakes of the past from occurring again. 
   I think it's very important to realize that chapter 12 is not a hand out or a ``get out of debt free'' card. Farmers are hard-working people who want the chance to learn their way. In fact, chapter 12 is modeled on chapter 13, where individuals set up plans to re-pay a portion of their debts. 
   By all accounts, chapter 12 has been wildly successful. So many times in Washington we develop programs and laws with the best of intentions. But when these programs get to the real world, they don't work well. chapter 12, on the other hand, 
   has worked exactly as intended. According to Professor Neil Harl of Iowa State University, 74 percent of family farmers who filed Chapter 12 bankruptcy are still farming and 61 percent of farmers who went through Chapter 12 believe that Chapter 12 was helpful in getting them back on their feet. 
   But Chapter 12 can be made even better. ``Safety 2000'' will make Chapter 12 better. The bill expands the definition of family farmer so that more farmers can use Chapter 12. Under current law, family farmers can't use Chapter 12 to save their farms if a farmer has more than $1.5 million in debt. This is too restrictive, and my bill would let farmers who have up to $3 million in debt use Chapter 12. 
   ``Safety 2000'' also helps farmers to reorganize by keeping the tax collectors at bay. Under current law, farmers often face a crushing tax liability if they need to sell livestock or land in order to reorganize their business affairs. According to Joe Peiffer, a bankruptcy lawyer from Hiawatha, Iowa, who represents many family farmers, high taxes have caused farmers to lose their farms. Under the bankruptcy code, the I.R.S. must be paid in full for any tax liabilities generated during a bankruptcy reorganization. If the farmer can't pay the I.R.S. in full, then he can't keep his farm. This isn't sound policy. Why should the I.R.S. be allowed to veto a farmer's reorganization plan? ``Safety 2000'' takes this power away from the I.R.S. by reducing the priority of taxes during proceedings. This will free up capital for investment in the farm, and help farmers stay in the business of farming. 
   In conclusion, Chapter 12 works well and this legislation will make it work better. Let's make sure that we keep this safety net for family farmers in place. I urge my colleagues to think of this bill as a low-cost insurance policy for an important part of America's economy and America's heritage.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the most recent High School survey of teen drug use tells us something. After years of dramatic increases in drug use among 12-18 years old, we may have a leveling off. The numbers are down, but only barely. At this rate of decline, we will reach the modest goals for drug reduction set by the present Administration in the year 2050. The Administration seems to find this good news. At least, they find the present leveling off something to crow about. Frankly, I think these numbers are the occasion for a little more modesty and whole lot more work. 
   That's what the Congress has been doing. The 105th Congress passed major legislation to fight drugs. It put more money and more muscle into efforts that the Administration has ignored or downgraded. We did this because we saw the consequences--more teen drug use. Today, we continue that effort. Our goal is not to claim bragging rights about statistically minor changes but to make real changes through serious efforts. Today, we introduced the ``Drug Free Century Act.'' This is a comprehensive bill that will be one of the main agenda items for the 106th Congress. It gives us the means to build on what we did last Congress. It gives us the beef that the Administration has left out to put in the sandwich. 
   More important, this bill provides resources to sustain a comprehensive effort and a coherent policy. In this bill, we provide the means to support our national and international law enforcement efforts. We provide the resources to help families and communities get and remain drug free. We support treatment and education. In short, we build on success and extend our ability to do yet more. 
   This bill represents the kind of comprehensive approach that I have pushed for. It gives us the tools to do the job. More important, it provides the focus and sustained attention that we need to do the job. We have a lot of work ahead of us. It is not going to be easy. But we will be better equipped and more able to do the job.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills that are an important first step in helping Americans prepare for their long-term care needs. The Long Term Care Affordability and Availability Act and the American Worker Long Term Care Affordability Act. I am pleased to have my colleague Senator GRAHAM of Florida join me as a cosponsor of these two bills. 
   Longer and healthier lives are a blessing and a testament to the progress and advances made by our society. However, all Americans must be alert and prepare for long-term care needs. The role of private long-term care insurance is critical in meeting this challenge. 
   The financial challenges of health care in retirement are not new. Indeed, too many family caregivers can tell stories about financial devastation that was brought about by the serious long-term care needs of a family member. Because increasing numbers of Americans are likely to need long term care services, it is especially important to encourage planning today. 
   Most families are not financially prepared when a loved one needs long-term care. When faced with nursing home costs that can run more than $40,000 a year, families often turn to Medicaid for help. In fact, Medicaid pays for nearly 2 of every 3 nursing home residents at a cost of more than $30 billion each year for nursing home costs. With the impending retirement of the Baby Boomers, it is imperative that Congress takes steps now to encourage all Americans to plan ahead for potential long-term care needs. 
   The Long Term Care and Affordability and Availability Act will allow Americans who do not currently have access to employer subsidized long-term care plans to deduct the amount of such a plan from their taxable income. This bill will encourage planning and personal responsibility while helping to make long-term care insurance more affordable for middle class taxpayers. 
   The American Worker Long-Term Care Affordability Act will establish a program under which long-term care insurance may be obtained by current and former employees of the federal government. This legislation will make long-term care insurance affordable to the Federal community by using the purchasing power of the federal government to assure quality, competition and choice. 
   These measures will encourage Americans to be pro-active and prepare for their own long term care needs by making insurance more widely available and affordable. I urge my colleagues to support these bills.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I have introduced the Hospital Transfer Penalty Repeal Act of 1999. This legislation would repeal the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA)'s hospital transfer penalty. This law punishes hospitals that make use of the full continuum of care and discourages them from moving patients to the most appropriate levels of post-acute care. I ask my colleagues to spend a few minutes learning about this issue, because I believe that if they do, they will come to see the need for repeal. 
   The current hospital prospective payment system is based on the average length of stay for a given diagnosis. In some cases, patients stay in the hospital longer than the average and in other cases their stay is shorter. Historically, a hospital has been reimbursed based upon an average length of stay regardless of whether the patient remained in the hospital a day less than the average or a day more than the average. 
   Under the Balanced Budget Act transfer provision, however, this is no longer the case. If a patient in one of ten specified diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) is released earlier than the national average length of stay for that DRG, the hospital does not receive its full prospective payment. Instead, it receives only a smaller per-diem payment. 
   This policy penalizes facilities that transfer patients from the hospital to a more appropriate level of care earlier than the average length of stay. It encourages hospitals to ignore the clinical needs of patients and keep them in the most expensive care setting for a longer period of time. In short, it offers an incentive for hospitals to provide an unnecessary level of care, for an unnecessary length of time. 
   The transfer policy is particularly hard on hospitals in low-cost states like Iowa. Because Iowa's hospitals practice efficient medicine, they have average lengths of stay well below the national average. These hospitals will be hit especially hard. This kind of perverse incentive is part of the problem with Medicare, not part of the solution. 
   In addition to the irrational incentives this policy creates, administering it is simply maddening for providers. As a knowledgeable Iowa constituent, Joe LeValley of North Iowa Mercy Health System, has pointed out, the law creates conflicting incentives that make clinical management of patients a baffling experience. Medicare now expects physicians to move patients to the most cost-effective level of care as quickly as possible--unless those patients have a condition in one of these  ten DRG's, in which case Medicare wants the physician to keep them in the hospital. Is it any wonder that physicians and hospital administrators are frustrated with Medicare? 
   In fact, isn't it physicians, not hospital administrators, who should be making decisions about patient care settings? If we think that doctors should be determining the appropriate location for 
   a patient, it seems absurd to force the hospital into that role. But the transfer penalty does exactly that. 
   In addition, the law holds hospitals accountable for the actions of patients that are no longer under their care. In some cases, patients are not admitted to post-acute care directly from the hospital, and the hospital may not know that the patient is receiving such care, let alone steer the patient to it. The law thus sets hospitals up for accusations of fraud due to events that are beyond their control. 
   I understand that there are valid grounds for concern about hospitals moving patients to lower levels of care sooner than is clinically appropriate, simply in order to game the reimbursement system. That is unacceptable conduct, and we do need to attack it. I am open to discussions on possible alternatives to outright repeal of the transfer penalty, if these bad apples are the ones targeted. But we need to make sure we don't punish all hospitals--especially the most efficient--for the sins of a few. 
   This transfer penalty is a serious roadblock to the provision of appropriate and efficient care. Its repeal will help ensure that logical coordinated care remains a primary goal of the Medicare program.

   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that lifts the unfair limits on how much people can save in their employer's pension plan. I have been an advocate of increasing the amount of public education we provide to people on the importance of saving for retirement. However, we also must take more tangible action that will help workers achieve a more secure retirement. 
   The legislation I am introducing today amends two provisions in the Internal Revenue Code which discourage workers and employers from putting money into pension plans. One of the most burdensome provisions in the Internal Revenue Code is the 25 percent limitation contained within section 415(c). Under 415(c), total contributions by employer and employee into a defined contribution (DC) plan are limited to 25 percent of compensation or $30,000 for each participant, whichever is less. That limitation applies to all employees. If the total additions into a DC plan exceed the lesser of 25 percent or $30,000, the excess money will be subject to income taxes and a penalty in some cases. 
   The second tax code provision affected by this legislation is section 404(a)(3). This section regulates the amount of retirement plan contributions an employer can deduct for tax purposes. We need this change because those deduction limits are impacted by how much the employee puts into the retirement plan. If we are successful in changing 415(c), we run the risk of more employers bumping into the 15% deduction limit--we don't want that to happen. 
   To illustrate the need for elimination of the 25 percent limit let me use an example. Bill works for a medium size company in my home state of Iowa. His employer sponsors a 401(k) plan and a profit sharing plan to help employees save for retirement. Bill makes $25,000 a year and elects to put in 10 percent of his compensation into the 401(k) plan, which amounts to $2,500 per year. His employer will match the first 5 percent of his compensation, which comes out to be $1,250, into the 401(k) plan. Therefore, the total 401(k) contribution into Bill's account in this year is $3,750. In this same year Bill' s employer determines to set aside a sufficient amount of his profits to the profit sharing plan which results in an allocation to Bill's account in the profit sharing plan the sum of $3,205. This brings the total contribution into Bill's retirement plan this year up to $6,955. 
   Unfortunately, because of the 25 percent of compensation limitation only $6,250 can be put into Bill's account for the year. The amount intended for Bill's account exceeds that limitation by $705. Hence, the profit sharing plan administrator must reduce the amount intended for allocation to Bill's account by $705 in order to avoid a penalty. Bill is unlikely to be able to save $705, a significant amount that would otherwise be yielding a tax deferred income which would increase the benefit Bill will receive at retirement. Bill's retirement saving is shortchanged by $705 plus the tax-deferred earnings it would have generated. 
   Now let's look at Irene. Irene works for the same company, but she makes $45,000 a year. She also puts in 10 percent of her compensation into the 401(k) plan, and her employer matches five percent of her salary into the account. That brings the combined contribution of Irene and her employer up to $6,750. She would also receive a contribution of $3,205 from the profit sharing plan. This brings the total contribution into Irene's pension plan for that year to $9,955. She is also subject to the 25 percent limit, but for Irene, her limit would not be reached until  $11,200. She is able to put in her 10 percent, receive the five percent match and receive the full amount from the profit share because her amount doesn't exceed the limit. 
   Despite the fact that Bill and Irene have the same discipline to add to their pension plans and save for their retirements, Bill is penalized by the 25 percent limitation. By lifting the 25 percent limit, we can provide a higher threshold of savings for those who need it most. 
   Permitting additional contributions to DC plans will help those working now, particularly women, to ``catch up'' on their retirement savings goals. Women are more likely to live out the last years of their retirement in poverty for a number of reasons. Women have longer lifespans, they are more likely to leave the workforce to raise children or care for elderly parents, are more likely to have to use assets to pay for long-term care for an ill spouse, and traditionally make less money than their male counterparts. Anyone who has delayed saving for retirement will get a much needed boost to their retirement savings strategy if the 25 percent limit is eliminated for employees. 
   Not only does this proposal help individual employees save for retirement but it also helps the many businesses, both small and large which are affected by 415(c). First, the 25 percent limitation causes equity concerns within businesses. Low and mid-salary workers do not feel as if the Code treats them equitably, when their higher-paid supervisor is permitted to save more in dollar terms in a tax-qualified pension plan. 
   Second, one of the primary reasons businesses offer pension plans is to reduce turnover and retain employees. Employers often supplement their 401(k) plans with generous matches or a profit-sharing plan to keep people on the job. The 415(c) limitation inhibits their ability to do that, particularly for the lower-paid workers who are unfairly affected. 
   Third, this legislation will ease the administrative burdens connected with the 25 percent limitation. Dollar limits are easier to track than percentage limits. 
   Finally, I want to placate any concerns that repealing the 25 percent limit will serve as a windfall for high-paid employees. The Code contains other limitations which provide protection against abuse. First, the Code limits the amount an employee can defer to a 401(k) plan. Under section 402(g) of the Code, workers can only defer up to $10,000 of compensation into a 401(k) plan in 1998. In addition, plans still must meet strict non-discrimination rules that ensure that benefits provided to highly-compensated employees are not overly generous. 
   The value to society of this proposal, if enacted, is undeniable. Increased savings in qualified retirement plans can prevent leakage, meaning the money is less likely to be spent, or cashed out as might happen in a savings account or even an IRA. 
   There will be those out there who recognize that this bill does not address the impact of the 415 limit for all of the plans that are subject to it. I have included language that would provide relief to 401(k) plans and 403(b) plans, for example. Plans authorized by section 457 of the Code--used by state and local governments and non-profit organizations have not been specifically addressed. I want to assure organizations who sponsor 457 plans that I support ultimate conformity for all plans affected by the 415(c) percentage limitation. Over the next couple of weeks, I hope to work with these organizations to identify the changes that are necessary to achieve equity and simplicity for their employees. In the mean time, this is a positive step toward enhancing the retirement savings opportunities of working Americans. 
   We have begun to educate all Americans about the importance of saving for retirement, but if we educate and then do not give them the tools to allow people to practically apply that knowledge, we have failed in our ultimate goal to increase national savings. Let's help Americans succeed in saving for retirement. In helping them achieve their retirement goals, they help us to achieve our goal as policymakers of improving the quality of life for Americans.
