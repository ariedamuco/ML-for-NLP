   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I know others are going to take the floor. 
   While the two leaders are here, I thank each of them for their comments. Nothing is done in the Senate without the concurrence of the leadership. I know full well the help they have given us in the past days and weeks which led to the final solution. I will be speaking about that later. 
   I thank the Senator from Mississippi and also my friend, the Senator from South Dakota, for their help and for the sincere comments they made today. They are very welcome, as far as I am concerned, and I am humbled by them. I thank them very much. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the fiscal year 2001 Labor/HHS Appropriations Conference Report is now before the Senate. 
   This conference report serves to wrap up work on all fiscal year 2001 appropriations bills, as it includes the Treasury-General Government and legislative branch bills. Those two bills were previously passed by the Congress, but were vetoed by the President. 
   The only significant change to the bills previously passed by Congress is the deletion of the telephone tax provision in the Treasury bill. The conference report includes other appropriations matters, which emerged subsequent to the completion of the other fiscal year 2001 bills. 
   Significant items include $150 million for repair of the U.S.S. Cole, $100 million for intelligence activities requested by the White House, $110 million for the new markets initiative, $100 million for volunteer firefighter grants sought by our colleague from Delaware, Senator ROTH, and $100 million for the Library of Congress to enhance the National Digital Library. 
   I want to also thank all my colleagues for their patience as I worked with the White House for a compromise on the Alaskan Fishery/Sea Lion protection issue. Through the hard work of many here in Congress and at the White House, OMB and the Department of Commerce, we achieved a compromise that meets the priorities of all parties--who share the goal of protecting the sea lion population, and the economic well being and viability of the commercial fishing industry in my State. 
   There are many specific issues that I could comment on today, but I had the opportunity to brief members of this side of the aisle at a conference this afternoon, and the bill is available in the Cloakroom for review. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support this conference report, which completes the work of this Congress, during this Congress. Next month, when the 107th Congress convenes, and a new President is inaugurated, they will both start with no carryover from this Congress.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, after protracted negotiations, the Administration and I have reached an agreement that provides the necessary protections for the Steller sea lion while allowing for the needs of fishermen who depend on the robust and healthy groundfish stocks off Alaska. I believe the Senate knows my personal feelings, and the feelings of practically all those who are involved in the harvesting, processing, and subsequent marketing of the millions of tons of seafood that come from the North Pacific and Bering Sea, on this matter. While we recognize that the Steller sea lion deserves protection, we are not convinced  that the Commerce Department has proven, let alone adequately tested, its hypothesis that fishing contributes to the sea lions' decline. A few minutes spent skimming the biological opinion reveals the lack of science underlying the proposed actions it contains. For example, the Commerce Department states in its biological opinion that it does not know if fishing impacts sea lions, or that sea lions would likely continue to decline even if all fishing were halted. 
   Nonetheless, the lives of our fishermen will continue to be affected by this opinion. Our agreement provides a three-step phase-in process for fishery restrictions proposed to be implemented by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in the Alaska groundfish fisheries under Endangered Species Act (ESA) requirements. This section is intended to lessen the negative economic consequences to the fishing community caused by the restrictions and to ensure that any Steller sea lion protective measures do not create negative consequences for the conservation of the fisheries and ecosystem. This is accomplished by requiring the Secretary to rely on the fishery management provisions in the Magnuson-Stevens Act, including the regional council processes, when implementing reasonable and prudent alternatives under the Endangered Species Act.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished chairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations subcommittee in a short discussion on an item which is included on page 171 of the conference report on the recently passed Interior appropriations bill, H.R. 4578. In that bill, there is a reference to utilizing the Alaska ``Job in the Woods'' program for projects ``that enhance the southeast Alaska economy, such as the southeast Alaska intertie.'' May I inquire of the distinguished chairman if that language refers specifically to the currently proposed Swan Lake-Lake Tyee Intertie project for which the Forest Service completed its final environmental impact statement and issued its record of decision on August 29, 1997?

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regret deeply that last concurrent resolution, and at some time in the future I will explain it. 
   I am awaiting some other papers. For the time being, let me say this. I have stood on the Senate floor several times talking about the Steller sea lion problem. I personally thank Mr. John Podesta, the President's assistant, for talking to me for so long and working with our staff and myself for so long, into the early hours this morning and through the day, to bring about a resolution of the problem I have been discussing. 
   I cannot say we won this argument, but I can say we have reached a conclusion that will allow a substantial portion, approximately 90 percent, of the fishermen affected by this issue to return to fishing next January. These are people who live along a stretch of coastline and on islands, as I said, that are the same distance as from this city to the end of the Florida chain. They are people who live in very harsh circumstances and have one basic source of income, and that is fishing. 
   We have been able now to agree on a process by which the fishing season will commence on January 20. Incidentally, it has nothing to do with the Inauguration; it just happens to be the first day of fishing season. We are delighted we have found a way to resolve the conflict. It still means there is a long hard task ahead of not only this Secretary of Commerce and his personnel but the next Secretary of Commerce and personnel to carry out the agreement we have crafted and to see that it works. 
   I am pleased to say we have had a great many people who have assisted us. As I said earlier, the distinguished majority leader and minority leader were personally involved, as were their staffs, along with the staff of the Assistant to the President, and the Office of Management and Budget. I cannot leave out, and would not leave out, the distinguished chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, the Honorable BILL YOUNG, a Representative from Florida, who waited for this resolution. 
   I know it was a harsh task he had, and there are many Members in both the House and Senate who were inconvenienced by this delay. I can only thank them for their cooperation. As I have said before, not one Member of Congress argued with me about the delay. They all understood that we had a substantial problem. 
   It is not easy to represent a State and people who live closer to Tokyo than Washington, DC. These people really have but three spokesmen in Washington compared to the many that other States have. They rely on us to convey their wishes and to convey their dilemmas over potential Federal actions and to seek solutions. 
   I am delighted we have received the cooperation that led to a consensus today that I believe will assist them and will start the resolution of this problem and bring it to a conclusion where we can abide by the Magnuson-Stevens Act that governs the fisheries off our shores and, at the same time, respect the findings that are made under the Endangered Species Act. 
   I thank Sylvia Matthews, Office of Management and Budget; Michael Deitch, Office of Management and Budget; Penny Dalton of NOAA; Mark Childress of Senator DASCHLE's office; Dave Hoppe of Senator LOTT's office; and Lisa Sutherland and David Russell of my office for their hard work on the issue pertaining to Steller sea lions.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am grateful to my friend from New Mexico. I am here once again to talk about the last controversial amendment in the appropriations bills for the fiscal year 2001. We have completed all work on these bills now except for one amendment and that is the amendment that pertains to the Steller sea lions. I am here because there seems to still be a misunderstanding about what we are trying to do. The Congress has passed and the President has signed, as a matter of fact, an extension of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the act that deals with the 200-mile limit off our shores. That act in its original form created the North Pacific Fisheries Council that has jurisdiction under the law for the management plans that apply to fisheries off the shores of my State of Alaska. 
   In its recent action in issuing a biological opinion under the Endangered Species Act, the Department of Commerce saw fit to use the emergency portions of the Magnuson Act to issue a management plan for pollack and for cod off the State of Alaska within what they call the RPAs, the reasonable prudent alternative areas, dealing with the decline of the Steller sea lion. 
   There is no emergency provision in the Endangered Species Act. Under the Magnuson Act, management plans are issued by the regional councils, not by the Department of Commerce. There is an emergency clause, if the Secretary makes findings of problems with the fishery, that could justify the Secretary issuing a plan or a revision of the existing plan. That was not done. Instead, the Department of Commerce saw fit to use the emergency clause of the Magnuson Act to once again seize total control of the pollack and the cod fisheries off our shores within the 
   so-called RPAs. They amount to an area of 20 miles around every sea lion rookery. It is an area that extends from Kodiak, all the way out along the Aleutian chain. 
   The National Marine Fisheries Service has told us there is no data to support the concept that there is a connection between the decline of the sea lion and the harvest of pollack. There is no cause and effect relationship scientifically that exists with regard to this decline. We are appalled by the decline of sea lions off our shores. We also know that sea otters are steadily disappearing, as are fur seals and harbor seals. We believe the reason is the tremendous increase in the killer whales. That is another subject. 
   Very clearly, what the Department has done now is to increase the danger for fishermen who live in Alaska and fish in the areas off our shores. That fishing currently has the highest level of deaths per capita of any industry in the United States. What this order has done, now, is it has foreclosed the fishing by these small boats in the areas where the pollack is located except during the wintertime. This is a particularly dangerous area. Winter storms increase the problems of fishing. What is more, if they follow the order and go beyond the 20 miles, the further from shore they go on these small boats, even a minor injury becomes a life threatening injury, particularly in the stormy season. I have to report to the Senate that the Coast Guard voted against following this biological opinion last Saturday, in my State, for safety reasons. 
   What the administration has done is they have restarted the race for the fish. They have made it almost impossible for the enforcement of this biological opinion. They have not consulted with the people who really know the industry as they have issued this opinion. This opinion will have a $500 million to $800 million impact on the industry, according to figures that came from the Department itself. 
   Just think of this. The largest concentration of fish processors in the United States is on Kodiak Island. I was informed yesterday that, as a result of this opinion, if it is enforced, Kodiak processors will be able to operate for 2 1/2 days. This opinion will create ghost towns in my State along the shore from Kodiak all the way out along the Aleutian chain. Primarily those are native villages. These are not enormous factory trawlers. They fish way offshore. These are people who live in these small villages and harvest this fish--which is a unique fish, as I have told the Senate before. It is unique because it is a biomass constantly growing. Because of the management schemes we have worked out under the Magnuson Act, that biomass has increased almost five times since we started the Magnuson Act. 
   There is more pollack than ever before, but this is going to limit fishing for pollack in specific areas where the small boats fish. 
   There is just no way to justify this. Native Alaskans, as I say, are going to lose their jobs, lose their subsistence. About 1,000 boats that otherwise would have gone to sea will not fish under this order. It is just unconscionable. 
   I am not one who makes threats; I make statements. I have made the statement that I will not sign this conference report if it does not adequately restore this fishery. I will oppose the bill on the floor, and I am hopeful my friends on this floor will understand why. 
   What this means is we cannot resolve this issue. My staff will meet--thanks to the good offices of the Democratic leader--with representatives of the administration in just a few minutes, but if we cannot resolve this, my advice is make different reservations. 
   Understand, I cannot as a Senator allow an action that is not following the law that I helped author put a considerable portion of the people who  have year-round jobs in my State out of work, and not just temporarily. They have purported to create these areas around these rookeries forever without any consultation with the regional council that was created by the Magnuson Act, without any public hearings, based solely upon a lawsuit that was filed in a Federal court in Seattle and a friendly suit to use that as a justification for taking back into the Federal Government the management of these two magnificent fisheries--pollack and cod--off our State. 
   In my opinion, it is unconstitutional, but I know one thing--it is not going to be approved by this Senate. 
   I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend from New Mexico.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have come to the floor because, as we are considering the final wrapup of the appropriations bills, I face the problem of having to modify a provision that was in a bill as we were ready to send it to the President before the election dealing with Steller sea lions. 
   It is sort of a long story, but let me start from the beginning. 
   In 1969, as a new Senator, I flew from Kodiak to the Pribilof Islands in a Navy plane. I observed hundreds--hundreds--of foreign fishing vessels--factory trawlers--between those two islands off our coast. They were catching Alaska's seafood. As a matter of fact, they were beyond the 3-mile limit. They were in international waters at that time. 
   Subsequently, I asked the Coast Guard, and I think the Fish and Wildlife Service then, to take some photographs of those vessels. We found, after examining photographs, that on the top of the vessels, on the decks, there were pens, literally, where they would toss a fur seal here and a harbor seal there, and a baby sea lion there. And then there was what we called a ``glory hole'' in the center, and they just shoved all of the fish into that hole. And it was ground up and sent back into the world's economy as protein. None of it came ashore in the United States or Alaska. 
   That appalled me. I came back and we worked with people in the House. We devised a bill and introduced it to claim the 200 miles off our shore for the protection of the marine resources. That did not pass that year. 
   The next year, I asked my good friend, Senator Warren Magnuson of Washington, and he introduced the bill as chairman of the Commerce Committee. I was cosponsor. But we worked to get that bill passed. 
   By 1976, that bill was passed. We obtained control over the 200 miles off our shore. In that process we started the concept of Americanizing the 200 mile zone so we could get better control over the vessels that harvested our fish. 
   The grand story of the whole continuum since 1976 is the pollock and cod of the North Pacific. Pollock and cod were at that time a fairly insignificant fishery. They were taking probably 10-20 million pounds a year--a little bit more--and would bring it ashore here into our country. 
   But the difficulty with pollock is, it must be fleshed and boned soon after it is caught. It turns into a wonderful, white protein. The Japanese use it as surimi. We use pollock and cod as fillets and in fish sticks. If you go to Long John Silver's or McDonald's, any one of those entities today to buy a fish sandwich, there is a 9 out of 10  chance you are going to be eating Alaska pollock. 
   But here is the beauty of the control mechanism we set up over the 200-mile limit. Pollock in the North Pacific is cannibalistic. I have said that on the floor before. As they mature, they get lazy, do not want to forage for food, and they eat their young. We found that if you harvest the mature fish--take them to market--the biomass expands. 
   The biomass of Alaskan pollock is about five times the size it was when we created the 200-mile limit. It now sustains the most enormous fishery in the world. It is a vital necessity to the economy of the Pacific Northwest and an absolute necessity to our State. 
   By virtue of an action taken just recently, the administration has now denied access to Alaskan pollock and cod, to the extent that about 1,000 boats will not fish in January who would otherwise go out and start fishing. 
   The Department of Commerce released, last Friday, a biological opinion on the relationship between the Steller sea lion and the Alaskan groundfish fleet. This 588-page document contains a massive rewrite of the fishery management plan for the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska groundfish fisheries. 
   Mind you, under the Magnuson Act--it is now called the Magnuson-Stevens Act--but under that Act that commenced in 1976, the duty to create fishery management plans for the areas off our shore lies in the regional councils. Alaska is the only State that has its own council--because of the massive area of our State; more than half the coastline of the United States is in Alaska--we have a regional council. 
   As I mentioned, the duty to prepare fishery management plans under Federal law is in the regional councils. This is a magnificent experiment in terms of government. The councils are created by appointments from the Secretary of Commerce from a list submitted by the Governors of the coastal States. The Federal Government and the States have each delegated some authority to those councils to manage fisheries in those areas. 
   But this document, filed last Friday, was prepared in secrecy. No one in my State knew what was in it. 
   It impacts areas inside Alaska state waters. It covers areas in the jurisdiction of other departments. And it was not unveiled until the very last minute. In fact, the National Marine Fisheries Service had an appointment to brief me on it on Thursday, and they asked to put it off until Friday. I changed that appointment for them. The reason was, they wanted to file it in court before they met with me. They had already delivered the document to the Federal judge involved when we met Friday. They prepared this because a Federal judge in Washington had enjoined all fishing because they lacked sound science under their prior biological opinion, prepared under the Endangered Species Act. 
   I am trying to start a line of reasoning here so people understand what has happened. The way that that biological opinion under the Endangered Species Act has been handled is a direct assault on the 1976 Magnuson Act because it has taken over the jurisdiction of the regional councils to prepare these fishery management plans. In fact, the Magnuson Act contains an emergency clause. The Secretary of Commerce is enabled, under certain circumstances, to issue emergency orders that change or even promulgate a management plan. But this management plan is promulgated in a biological opinion issued under the Endangered Species Act. There is no emergency clause in the Endangered Species Act. 
   What we did in 1976 was to provide the tools to each region to manage the fisheries in their area. There has never been a more successful effort in terms of Federal-State cooperation, in my opinion. Now, because of a lawsuit filed by Greenpeace in a Federal court, the National Marine Fisheries Service is trying to change the total management of the North Pacific as far as the Steller sea lion and Alaska groundfish are concerned. This is the real emergency here for us, but it is something every coastal State should look at. Because by using the authority of the Magnuson Act emergency clause and taking it into a process under the Endangered Species Act and issuing a management plan that is only outlined by the Magnuson Act, but by issuing it in a biological opinion, what they have done is they have seized from the States, they have seized from the regional councils any management authority over the areas off our shores that the Magnuson Act covered. 
   I cannot stand by and see this happen. In the first place, as I said, this is a terrible blow to the people of my State who work hard harvesting and processing this fish. The value of the lost harvest alone will be at least $191 million under the biological opinion. But if you look at that stream of economic activity it creates in the national economy, there is over $1 billion a year that comes from groundfish. It is turned into a marketable, salable product and develops these retail entities that are world renowned in terms of providing quality fish and fish products for consumption by our consumers. 
   The opinion that was filed is an interesting thing. The first five times the National Marine Fisheries Service explored the relationship between pollock and the decline of the Steller sea lion, the opinion said there was no relationship. Dissatisfied with that, the administration dismissed from the area of research the people who had written those first opinions and turned to a new researcher who had done some research off Atka Island, which is about 1,500 miles west of Anchorage, on the relationship of mackerel out there to the fishing efforts. 
   One man developed what is known as a localized depletion theory. He opined that the reason there was a decline around Atka Island was that factory trawlers were coming and fishing. In the period after they were fishing, there was a localized depletion of the fishery resource. That is not a scientific conclusion. That is a theory. But they brought him in to write the biological opinion on Steller sea lions in relationship to pollock and cod, and he used his new concept of localized depletion. He has now 
   brought forward in this biological opinion, through the Department of Commerce--I wish I had the map to show the Senate--a process which denies access to the groundfish fleet to areas within a 20-mile radius of most Steller sea lion rookeries. The concept of the connection between those rookeries and the pollock is localized depletion. It is not science. It is an assumption. And it has not been accepted by the scientific community. 
   Their own scientists admit they have no data to support this theory, and that is a direct violation of both the Magnuson-Stevens Act and the Endangered Species Act, which require a sound scientific basis. The difficulty is that the biological opinion, if it becomes operative, will limit the areas and limit the seasons in which fishermen can fish for pollock and cod. That is a limitation that is only authorized under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and it cannot be promulgated except in response to a plan presented by the regional council. 
   Our regional council denounces this current biological opinion. Our State opposes it violently. As I said, no one knew anything that was in it. It was totally in camera. Nobody had access to it, unless it was the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Greenpeace. The Commerce Department denied me access to it and demanded I wait 12 hours. And in that 12 hours, they filed it in opinion in court without giving us a chance to examine it. 
   The Magnuson Act was designed to promote safety at sea. I don't know how many people know about it, but the worst death ratio in any industry in our country is in commercial fishing off our State. As the father of a son who has been out there fishing for 10, 12, 15 years, I can tell the Senate, there is no greater worry for a father than to have a son on one of those boats because the death toll is horrendous. It will be worse because of Government regulations that require closures and require actions that aren't based on common sense. In this biological opinion, they are now going to force our small boats to fish in the dangerous offshore areas in the winter storm season. They say: Fish in the winter storm season. We passed the act so we could enact regulations so we could get out of the winter storm season. I can't understand why they would do that. It is a direct violation of Federal law to do that. They should have at least consulted the regional council and allowed  the regional council to have hearings. They have not done so. 
   Yesterday in Anchorage the advisory panel to the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council voted unanimously to reject this biological opinion. They want to restore the regulations that were in effect prior to its issuance until we can have public hearings and public review and we get the National Academy of Sciences and other qualified scientists to review this theory that has been presented by the National Marine Fisheries Service under the cloak of sound science. 
   I do have a provision I am going to offer to this bill again. It is a modification of the amendment that is already there. It would allow the fishery to go forward under both the Endangered Species Act and the Magnuson-Stevens Act regulations that were in place before this opinion was issued. People are saying we are emasculating the Endangered Species Act. Nothing is further from the truth. The Endangered Species Act was part of the plan that was followed and was in effect before this new plan was filed in the lawsuit in Seattle. Earlier this year, the Department of Commerce argued in court that these regulations were sufficient under the Endangered Species Act. 
   Again, I am here to ask the Senators from New England, from the Atlantic area, from the South Atlantic area, from the Gulf coast, from the Pacific council area, to look at what has happened. This is a federalization of fisheries off our shores under the guise of the Endangered Species Act based upon a theory that has not been tested anywhere. 
   In my opinion, the current act that is before us to close out the Government should not pass and will not have my signature on the final conference report unless something is in there that deals with this very odd biological opinion and restores the capability of our people to continue to fish in a safe and sound way off our shores.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I was in a meeting with the joint leadership discussing the current problems regarding the last appropriations bills and was not able to be here during the time set for comments about our good friend and my southern neighbor, Senator GORTON. 
   It is with deep sadness that I come to join in the comments concerning Senator SLADE GORTON. I think he has been an exemplary Member of our Senate and has provided enormous contributions to the well-being of the country in his efforts as a Senator. 
   It is and has been a matter of great pride for me to call SLADE and Sally Gorton personal friends. I have visited with them. We have traveled together to other places in the world. It is highly necessary for Members of the Senate to travel and try to learn firsthand the problems of other continents, such as Antarctica, Australia. I remember we went to eastern Russia, and we have traveled many times into the NATO countries together. It is on those trips that we really get to know one another even better than we do in the Senate in Washington. 
   Of course, my friend and I have been able to meet as I have gone through his State. Alaskans go through either Utah, Illinois, or Washington to get home from Washington, D.C. Quite often, I have spent time in Washington State and have visited with SLADE GORTON and Sally about the problems of our area. He has been a fierce protector of the interests of the State of Washington in the Senate. As a westerner, he and I have shared many issues and faced the problem of finding solutions to some of these difficulties that we face in the Pacific Northwest together. We have worked with our friend, Senator MURRAY, on these issues. I think we have had a good working team together. 
   We have often, as members of the Pacific Northwest group in the Senate, had to go head to head with almost every Member of the Senate and the administration to try to protect the interests of the Pacific Northwest. We are an area that many people do not understand. It is an area that requires an enormous amount of personal contact with our constituents in order to make certain we are on the right track. 
   Senator GORTON has been to my State quite often, along with me and my colleague, Senator MURKOWSKI, to try and make certain we are reflecting the concerns of our people as we address the concerns of the people of the State of Washington at the same time. 
   When I came to the Senate, an elderly Senator told me that there were two types of Senators: the workhorses and the show horses. You have to decide which one you are going to be. 
   It is obvious that an Alaskan has only one choice. We are one-fifth the size of the United States. We have more than half the coastline in the United States. And we have about the same number of people as the smaller States in the lower 48, in terms of geography, that are much tinier compared to our State. 
   Senator GORTON, with his background, as we heard, coming from the east coast originally, very well educated, very well read, and probably one of the most well-read younger Senators in the Senate, has had the problem of trying to decide what to do. He, too, decided to become a Senator and is one whom I would call a workhorse. He has worked doggedly on issues pertaining to his State. His staff is probably one of the best staffs I have seen work on issues pertaining to the Pacific Northwest. 
   When we look at the problems of America from the point of view of the Senate, we would have to really take into account the people Senators represent. The State of Washington has given its Senators great flexibility in terms of addressing issues that deal with the Pacific Northwest and our Nation. There is no question that in his three terms in the Senate, Senator GORTON has been one of the pivotal votes in determining the policies of that area. 
   I know they will be going back to Washington. And I think we will hear a great deal of SLADE GORTON and Sally. They have concerns about the country and concerns about our area that are unique. I believe they are going to continue to contribute to the solutions to the problems that I mentioned before. 
   I am really here to thank him for his friendship and for the dignity he has brought to the office of United States Senator. I really believe he showed great compassion as he spent 2 years out of the Senate when he was not elected after a second term, and he came back again after 2 years and became even a greater Senator because of that. He has been a strong Senator, a thoughtful Senator, a hard-working Senator, and a great personal friend. 
   I don't look forward to making statements such as this. I certainly don't look forward to losing the partnership I have had with the Senator from Washington, SLADE GORTON, in dealing with the problems of the Pacific Northwest. 
   I thank the Senate.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is a continuing resolution to give us until the close of business Thursday to complete the activities of this Congress. That is a large order, but I think it can be done if all Members of the House and Senate will cooperate. 
   We have in conference the major bill, the Health and Human Services bill, which we were prepared to act upon, but there were four basic differences in the conference that we could not resolve with the White House before the election. We are working on that. I can report to the Senate that our majority leader has just given us information about the meeting that he and other leaders had with the President last evening. I can tell you from my perspective, based on the report of the majority leader, I believe it is possible to finish by Thursday night if there is a will in both the House and Senate to do so. 
   It is my judgment--I am sure we are going to hear from the distinguished Senator from West Virginia that he shares this opinion--that the work of this Congress should be finished by this Congress. We put a lot of time and effort into these bills that are still pending in conference. I do believe it is possible for us to finish if all Members will cooperate with us. 
   The President has consented to making some reductions in the amounts proposed in these bills before the election. We are working on that with the staff of the House now in the appropriations process. I believe we will be able to report back sometime before the close of business today if the progress has led us to the point where we could file, or ask the House to file, a conference report tonight so it could be taken up by the House tomorrow.  
   Again, I will be pleased to report later. For now, it is my urging that Members of the Senate work with us to try to finish the business of this Congress, including the passage of all of the remaining appropriations bills, by the time given in this continuing resolution, which is the close of business Thursday. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a quorum, the time not to be charged until the Senator from West Virginia claims his time.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I join with Senator BYRD on most of the comments he made. I am constrained to point out that I did argue with the White House at length not to put us through the process of having 1-day CRs. It is true this is the 17th one, but the bulk of them were for 1 or 2 days. And it takes us 2 days to pass one resolution, 1 day in the House and 1 day over here. As a consequence, we haven't been able to get anything done because we have been busy passing continuing resolutions, so we work the next day on another continuing resolution. 
   I share the frustration of the Senator from West Virginia with this process. The Senator is absolutely right; we are going into another year in just a matter of days, a time when this body will be split, 50 votes on each side of the aisle. In our Appropriations Committee, we work basically on a bipartisan basis. What we are asking is for the Senate and the House to work together now in these next 2 days and let us wind up this business. The State-Justice-Commerce bill is finished, for all intents and purposes. The Treasury-Postal and legislative bill, that was ready to be signed--and it wasn't signed because of a disagreement over the Health and Human Services bill--we were told would have been signed. So as a practical matter, we have one bill that is really in controversy, and that is the Health and Human Services bill. 
   As I reported to the Senate before the Senator returned, I tell my good friend, Senator BYRD, our leaders reported that the President has indicated a willingness to agree to some changes in that bill to meet the objections that were raised to the version of the bill prior to the election. I think we can do that today. 
   Unfortunately, once again we are in a situation where both Houses are involved in elections for the coming Congress. We will be involved tomorrow in indoctrination of new Senators for the next Congress. I am told that if we don't finish by Thursday, we will have to finish by Saturday, which means we will have to spend all day Thursday working on another continuing resolution to be able to stay until Saturday. This foolishness has to stop, if we are going to wind down this Congress and finish the business of this Congress in this calendar year. I think we can. 
   We are waiting now, Senator BYRD and I, to get together with Members of the House. Both Houses are involved in meetings for organization of the next Congress. I plead with Members to help us wind this down. We are within literally just two or three issues to be resolved on the Health and Human Services bill, and I think we can put them  all together. I hope we will bring one resolution before the House and the Senate to approve all three bills. That can be done by Thursday night if there is goodwill here and the comity Senator BYRD has asked the Senate to show at this time. 
   For myself, I look forward to the challenge of working with a 50-50 balance in the Senate. It is going to be a great challenge for all of us, and it is going to be an opportunity for us to demonstrate to the American public that the Senate is still the basic portion of our Government that deals with resolution of conflicts. This is supposed to be a debating society, a debating body. I think it will be for 2 years to come. We are going to be doing our business right here on the floor, to a great extent. With the help of the Senate, we will 
   finish this bill. 
   Does the Senator wish any more time?

    Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, after my remarks yesterday on the Steller sea lion decline, members of the press corps asked me for proof. This article provides a good summary of the research behind the sea lions' decline. I would also point out that the burden should be on the plaintiffs and the agency to prove that fishing has caused the sea lions' decline.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have been criticized in the national media and many of the local media here about the Steller sea lion rider that is on the Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill. Riders are really  emergency items of legislation that are necessary because of the time of year. We are about ready to end our deliberations and this is the only piece of legislation to which we could attach this provision. 
   I want to take time now to explain why this is necessary. The Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill still contains this provision. 
   The difficulty is that the National Marine Fisheries Service has shut down the Nation's largest fishery, and it does not even know why. In response to a lawsuit filed by extreme environmental groups, the National Marine Fisheries Service has failed to show any relationship between fishing and the Steller sea lion, which it considers to be endangered. 
   These procedural failures have led a Federal judge to shut down all fishing in the 100,000 square miles which encompass the prime fishing grounds for pollock off Alaska. This is an area larger than the State of Oregon and twice the size of New York. It is a coastline which would stretch from the District of Columbia to Florida. 
   The National Marine Fisheries Service continues to blame fishermen for the sea lion decline. Right now, Alaska fishermen and Alaska coastal communities are losing $1 million a day. If fishing does not resume in January, Alaska coastal communities will be ghost towns by the end of the year. 
   The Alaska groundfish fishery accounts for 40 percent of America's commercial fish harvest. Alaskan cod, pollock, and other species are sold in grocery stores and restaurants throughout our Nation. 
   Besides fishermen, the injunction that is in place impacts airlines, shipping companies, regional ports, and transportation labor. Alaska seafood exports contribute almost $1 billion towards our annual trade deficit. Most of that is exports to Asia. Incidentally, that is where we get most of our imports. 
   Alaska's annual seafood processing payroll is about $240 million. That is the processing of this product alone. Seafood exports offset the transportation cost of consumer goods imported by at least 15 percent. Dutch Harbor and Kodiak, two large seaports in my State, are the No. 1 and No. 4 fishing ports of the United States. Fishing in those communities pays the cost of teachers, police, firemen, and other public servants. The fishing industry is the only industry in those areas. 
   This was all brought about because of biological opinions that have been issued by the Fisheries Service. The National Marine Fisheries Service found that fishing did not harm sea lions on five separate occasions in the last decade: Twice in 1991, twice in 1996, and again in March of 1998. In April of 1998, extreme environmental groups filed suit to shut down these fisheries. The National Marine Fisheries Service's next biological opinion reversed the position of that agency 180 degrees. It reversed the prior five decisions and found that fishing had caused jeopardy to these sea lions. 
   There was no scientific breakthrough that led to that decision. In fact, what happened was they changed the person who wrote the decision. The Federal judge rejected the scientific analysis in that biological opinion as inadequate. 
   Today, the agency has still not justified the sea lion mitigation measures it wants to impose. Because of the agency's repeated failure to justify its own proposals, the judge shut down all fishing for pollock in this critical area. The new biological opinion is based upon a concept called ``localized depletion.'' This is the hypothesis of the biologist who put together the last biological opinion that the judge refused to accept. 
   This is based on the idea that fishing vessels take food away from sea lions. There is no science to support that conclusion or that theory. In fact, the trawling that takes place for pollock occurs at depths below which the sea lions forage for food. Pollock schools are much larger than the entire fleet. They cover an area far beyond what a fleet could cover. 
   I have a chart that shows the concentrated fishing efforts of the pollock fleet in a period of 4 weeks in 1995. The total efforts of this fleet failed to disperse the massive school of pollock. Beginning the 26th of January, the pollock was concentrated. The next week it was still concentrated. The third week it was concentrated. The fourth week it was concentrated. Despite the fact the fleet was there on top of that pollock the whole time, the pollock did not move. In fact, the fishing effort did not disperse the pollock. 
   The concept the biologist used was the fishing effort in an area is localized, and it depletes the pollock locally and, therefore, there is no food for the sea lions after the trawling takes place. That is absolutely not true. Pollock move around in natural migration patterns, not as a result of fishing effort. 
   Few people realize this is the largest biological mass of fish in the world. It is an enormous fishery, and it has grown because of our fishing practices--it has not been depleted because of fishing practices. 
   The National Marine Fisheries Service has failed to study the impact of predators on the sea lion population. We now see in Alaska soaring numbers of killer whales and falling numbers of sea lions and other species upon which the killer whale preys. Science shows that killer whales feed on juvenile sea lions, the same age class of sea lions that is causing the overall decline in that species. 
   Recently, a killer whale washed up on a beach in Alaska. When it was examined, there were 14 steller sea lion tags in its stomach. One killer whale had eaten 14 sea lions. 
   In addition, I hope Members have seen video footage of killer whales in our State that take sea lions right off the beach. It is a monstrous video that shows how these enormous killer whales come right up on the beach and take the sea lions off the beach. The National Marine Fisheries Service admits the killer whale is a predator and is a major cause of the declining sea otter population in our State, but it is unwilling to accept the fact that killer whales are involved in the decline of the sea lion. 
   This is hard for us to understand, very frankly. There has been a shift in this decision, as I said, 180 degrees. We fail to understand why this monstrous agency, which I normally support, could be swayed by the decision of one man because of a lawsuit that was filed by extreme environmentalists. 
   Most scientists now believe that sea lions are declining as part of their natural population cycle. I have another chart that shows this cycle. As the temperature and other conditions in the North Pacific have changed, the sea lions have declined and the pollock have increased. One of the things that has happened in the North Pacific is the abundance of high oil content fish, such as herring, has fallen while the low oil content species, such as pollock and cod, have increased. Published research shows that sea lions need to eat high oil content fish to survive. 
   For instance, in southeastern Alaska where high oil content fish are still plentiful, a different subpopulation of steller sea lions is increasing in size while its western cousins are decreasing. We believe it is a problem of diet, as far as the sea lions' decline is concerned, and that those who assert that sea lions can survive on pollock alone are absolutely wrong. 
   Some scientists believe pollock fishing in critical habitats actually helps sea lions. This is because the pollock off my State are highly cannibalistic. Adult pollock eat juveniles in very 
   large numbers. Trawlers target adult pollock which are over 3 years of age, whereas sea lions eat the smaller juvenile fish that would otherwise be eaten by the cannibalistic adult pollock population. 
   The net result of these ocean changes is that as our pollock population has increased, the sea lion population has decreased. Yet the decision of the biologist was that the reason for the sea lion population decline was the lack of availability of pollock. The National Marine Fisheries Service should know better than to shut down the largest private sector employer in Alaska without a good reason. 
   Right now they do not have a reason based upon science. Their conclusion is based entirely upon a lawsuit filed by an extreme environmental group, which also has no science behind it. This is absolutely wrong. That is why I have insisted on keeping this rider in place which will allow the fishery to continue on the basis of the protections that were already in place to protect the sea lions.  
   We have agreed not to invade the sea lion rookeries. In fact, we have set up protection areas around them. Our industry has contributed $1 million toward sea lion research to help find out some of the reasons for their decline. 
   We have appropriated a sizable amount of money to the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Alaska SeaLife Center to continue the research to find out why sea lions are declining. For myself and most of us who have spent our adult lives on the oceans around our State, I believe it is the overabundance of orcas, the killer whale population, that is causing the decline in the sea lions of the western population. 
   I repeat. Under the rider, fishing will continue until July 1, 2001 under all the restrictions that were in effect. These protective measures include restrictions on trawl fishing near sea lion rookeries, haul-outs, and foraging areas. 
   There are no-entry zones for fishing vessels near sea lion rookeries and haul-outs. 
   We have limitations on the harvest levels inside critical habitat. 
   We have split the pollock season into four different seasons to reduce the impact on the areas where the sea lions are. 
   We have reduced the daily catch rate through cooperative fishing. We have a very conservative process for setting the total allowable catch level, which actually is 13 percent lower than what would have been projected in 2001. 
   We require Federal observers to monitor harvest levels, including harvests inside any critical habitat area. 
   And there are additional sea lion mitigation measures that are in effect. 
   We do not, however, believe there should be a complete cessation of this enormous fishery. This is an enormous fishery. Two and a half billion pounds of fish are brought ashore from this massive population every year. Yet as we show, as we take mature pollock, the pollock biomass continues to grow. If we do not take that mature pollock from this biomass, it will once again go back to eating its own young and decrease. 
   So this rider is absolutely necessary to preserve the most massive and valuable fishery off our shores. I do hope those who criticize it will take time to read the opinions I am going to place in the RECORD.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there is no reason to interrupt this fishery. There is great reason to try to find out why the steller sea lion is declining. We have a massive effort to try to determine that. We will cooperate in any way we can to save this population. But we do not want to lose this massive biomass in the process. 
   If this trawl fishery does not continue, it will decline back to where it was before the trawl fishery was started. I think those who criticize us would do well to study the science and talk to people who know something about these steller sea lions and the fisheries, and quit listening to these extremist political people who are involved in this process, as far as the environmental groups are concerned.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have to inform the Senate that if we finish the Health and Human Services bill today--we are in good-faith negotiations, and we expect to be quite late today--that bill could not be finished in terms of its reading out and printing and being available to both sides until Monday afternoon at the earliest. 
   I hope we can get some consideration from the administration and from everyone to understand that. We would have two sessions--one on Saturday and one on Sunday. Some people work on their sabbath and some people do not. We have a staff who will be working, in spite of that, around the clock to read the legislation. There are some 40 pieces of legislation, in addition to the bill itself, that will be in the Health and Human Services 
   bill; at least that will be our recommendation. 
   I urge that somehow or another I be allowed to offer an amendment to this continuing resolution and make it Tuesday night. I have told the White House and OMB that there is no way, even if we finish tonight, that we can take it up tomorrow or take it up Sunday. We will not be able to take it up until Monday night. The White House should know that, OMB should know that, and I hope the minority agrees with us. 
   We cannot vote on this bill, the major wrapup piece of legislation, until, at the earliest in the Senate, Tuesday. The House may be able to vote on it Monday night. To argue over a CR that takes us to tomorrow and to argue over one that takes us to Sunday and one that takes us to Monday, when there is nothing we can do about finishing up this Congress, is just demonstrating our inability to deal with reality. 
   I hope the leader will allow me some time today to offer a motion to amend that CR and make it Tuesday. I have discussed it with the House, and they are in session. They can adopt it and send it to the President. Somehow or another, this idea we can only go day to day and we can produce something tomorrow that we have not finished today, when we have just one bill left which itself cannot be finished until Monday night, I think is foolhardy. I am prepared to challenge the President and all of his people to come to reality. 
   The discussions are being held with his people. If we do not finish them tonight, we will finish them tomorrow. If we do not finish them until tomorrow, it will be Tuesday morning before it is read out. 
   Maybe people do not understand what we do. Each side has a copy of the final provisions. Each reads it through, and we call in the people from the committees involved to be sure the provisions are correct. Then we get together and our staffs read it together, and each makes certain the other has not made any changes in it. And that will not be finished. It will take at least 20 hours of reading to do that. It will not be finished until Monday night.

   Mr. STEVENS. Let me add as chairman of the Committee on Appropriations that we were not in any manner attempting to alter the jurisdiction of the authorizing committees over any programs. As a result of the agreement made on the Interior appropriations bill, we were forced to fund the Coastal Impact Assistance program on the Commerce appropriations measure. To do that, we needed to include authorizing language. We took the language that had been reported by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources with only minor alterations. There was a last minute change to insert a definition of ``Secretary'' for the purposes of the new section 31 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to be the Secretary of Commerce. All that change does, is alter who will disburse the funding to the coastal States. I can assure all my colleagues that there was no intent to alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources over the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act or its exclusive jurisdiction over the Coastal Impact Assistance program that is established as a new section 31 of that act.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I wish to make a statement about the discretionary spending caps that will be coming before the Senate on the foreign assistance appropriations bill. There is a provision on that bill which is required to adjust the spending caps because of the limitations in the 1997 Budget Act. 
   Subsection (a) of the amendment that will be before the Senate increases the discretionary cap for budget authority under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 from $541.1 billion to $637 billion, and increases the discretionary cap for general purpose outlays under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 from $547.3 billion to $612.7 billion. 
   When discretionary highway and mass transit outlays of $32.3 billion--separate cap categories--are added to this amount, we will have allowable discretionary spending of $645 billion under this raised cap. 
   Subsection (b)(1) includes emergency spending already committed during this session under the new cap limits. Emergency spending is usually excluded from cap limits. In this instance, we have included such spending within the cap limits in order to be assured we will not invade the Social Security surplus. 
   We have another subsection, (b)(2), that provides for adjustments under these caps to continue, as permitted by current law, for continuing disability reviews, CDRs: $450 million in budget authority; the earned-income tax compliance initiative, EITC, that is $145 million in budget authority, and adoption assistance of $20 million in budget authority; and for an outlay adjustment of 0.5 percent. 
   Subsection (c) provides for a 0.5-percent adjustment for budget authority to cover the differences between CBO and OMB scoring methods. A similar adjustment was provided last year. 
   These caps assure us that we will have the funds available to deal with the remaining two bills that are very contentious; the State-Justice-Commerce bill and the Labor-Health and Human Services bill. For each of those bills, we allocated portions of the 302(b) authority that was given to our Appropriations Committee under the budget resolution for the year 2001. However, after those bills had passed and gone to conference, we recovered portions of the 302(b) allocation and allocated that to Housing and Urban Development and the energy and water bill. The result is that these two bills that are in conference now do not have the full funding that would be required to bring them back across the floor to the Senate. 
   This adjustment to the 2001 discretionary spending caps, as contained in the foreign assistance bill that will be before the Senate, I hope this afternoon, are necessary in order that those two bills can be reallocated funding sufficient to assure that they will be able to be considered and passed by the Senate. 
   It has been a very difficult year for the Appropriations Committee because of the circumstances, because of the differences between the President's budget and the congressional budget resolution. There is a substantial gap  between those two documents, and we have done our best to work with them. This action that we have taken now to lift the spending caps will give us the opportunity to work out the differences with the administration. I do believe that should and can be completed today. It is my firm hope we will complete action on the other two bills today so the House may commence consideration of them tomorrow and that the Senate will consider them Friday. That, of course, is going to take a lot of understanding and cooperation from all Members of the Senate, and I for one urge that take place. 
   I have not been home since the first week of August. We, on the Appropriations Committee, have been working around the clock on this process since the second week of August. It is time this come to an end. The disputes and conflicts between the bills, and between the administration and the Congress, between the House and Senate, and between Members of each body and within each body, are the most intensive I have ever seen. But it is time we realize that at the end of this week we will be 1 week away from the elections. I do not think Congress ought to be in session in the week before the elections, and I am going to do my utmost to see that we finish these bills by Friday. 
   If that is not possible, the leader will have to decide what we do. I, for one, intend to go home Saturday. 
   I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. STEVENS. Yesterday, this Senator completed 5 days of negotiations and finally got an agreement with the House and with everyone on how to lift the caps of the 1997 act. That did not take place because the Senator's side of the aisle objected at the last minute. We don't have a provision in this bill lifting the 1997 caps; we can't go forward until we do. 
   We don't have the ability to go forward yet this afternoon and tomorrow and the next day. We have to lift those caps. 
   It is enough to take abuse once in a while, but this Senator doesn't take it when it is undeserved. To accuse this side of the aisle for delay now is absolutely wrong. The President of the United States just came here and demanded 100 percent of what he asked for, but we don't know what it is.

If I may answer that, with regard to the bill on which we are about ready to vote, I, as chairman, delegated some of the 302(b) allowance to Health and Human Services to VA-HUD and to the other bill, energy and water. It is because of the limits that were set in the 1997 act, not just the budget resolution. We have not lifted them to the point to have enough money to pass this bill.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, yesterday, as chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress, it was my privilege to join Vice Chairman BILL THOMAS and Dr. James Billington out by our Ohio Clock to announce the largest gift in the history of our Library in 200 years. There has never been a greater gift to the Library of Congress. 
   As the Senator from Connecticut has said, John W. Kluge is a marvelous individual who is renowned in the international corporate community as one of the Library's staunchest supporters and most devoted people to the Madison Council. As a matter of fact, he was the founder of the Madison Council. He has now given the Library a gift of another $60 million. 
   Mr. Kluge's leadership in the Madison Council has enabled the Library to raise a total of $222 million in private donations for the Library over the last 10 years. His contributions alone amount to $73 million. 
   Yesterday's gift of $60 million will establish The John W. Kluge Center and Prize in the Human Sciences which will endow 5 scholarly chairs, and fellows, and will recognize areas of study not currently covered by the Noble prize structure. The Center will endow chairs in areas such as American law and government, American cultures and societies, technology and society, and modern culture. The Librarian will make the appointments in consultation with the Library's Scholars Council, and the first chairs will be awarded in 2001. 
   The Kluge Prize in the Human Sciences will include areas of study not covered by the Nobel Prize, including areas such as history, anthropology, sociology, literary and artistic criticism. Strangely enough, I had been discussing with one of my esteemed friends a similar type of approach to cover areas not covered by our Nobel Prize process. The prize will be a cash award of $1 million. 
   In addition, the award ceremony will recognize a lifetime of achievement in the Intellectual Arts, just as the Kennedy Center Honors recognize lifetime achievement in the performing arts. As Dr. Billington noted, ``the Kluge Center will help bridge the divide between the academic and political worlds, between knowledge and power.'' He summed up the need for the Center best when he said, ``We need broader and deeper exchanges; to make time for greater contemplation, what Milton called `wisdom's best nurse'.'' 
   I speak for all of the Joint Committee members in saying that we are deeply grateful for the support the Library has received from Mr. Kluge, and the private sector under Dr. Billington's leadership. Over this past year, and in celebration of the Library's Bicentennial, the private sector has supported hundreds of activities. With Mr. Kluge's extraordinary gift of $60 million, the total amount of gifts and donations to the Library during its bicentennial year from the private sector, particularly the Madison Council, totals $106 million.

   Mr. STEVENS. One of the interesting things about John Kluge's remarks was when he referred to himself as a young boy who came to this country at the age of 8 as an immigrant and he had one possession. It was a small Dresden figurine; it was a horse. That is all he owned when he came to this country. 
   Today, as Senator DODD has said, through the process of freedom in this country and his basic knowledge as a human being, he is one of the richest men in the world. I think to be in the man's presence is an honor. He is one of the great people of this country. 
   Yesterday, after I attended this ceremony and was going back on the subway, one of the operators of the subway noticed I was smiling. That is strange around this place, as people know. I said: Yes, I've just been to a delightful  ceremony. I told him that this man came to this country as an immigrant boy of 8 with one little possession, that he still has, had amassed this great fortune, and he had just given the Library of Congress $60 million. 
   The driver of the subway said: He came here with nothing? I said: That is right. And he has just given this great gift to the Library? And I said: That is right. And he said: That man is truly blessed. 
   That is my feeling about John Kluge. He is a truly blessed man.

   Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, it is my understanding that there is a process underway right now to see if it is possible to get such an agreement that the Senator from Arizona mentioned. 
   I have inquired, since the last exchange we had on the floor--and I am a person who has voted for this bill in committee, but the problem is there are objections on both sides of the aisle, I am informed, to a unanimous consent agreement which would be necessary to carry out the Senator's current unanimous consent agreement. 
   The difficulty is, there are some Members who are not members of the committee, our Commerce Committee, who have not had time to study that. They have informed the staff on both sides of the Senate, both Democratic and Republican, as I understand, that there are reservations. I cannot call them holds because they have not seen the bill yet; that is, as I understand it, the bill will come over from the House. It will be the House bill we would consider. It is just a very difficult position for me to be in, but as a representative of the leadership in this matter right now, I am constrained to say I am forced to object to the bill I support. I do object to that request. 
   I urge the Senator from Arizona to be part of this process of trying to clear that bill. I will join him. I have been trying to work on that since our last exchange, to see if we can clear bringing up that bill. But there are reservations on both sides of the aisle to that bill, and I am constrained to be in the position, and I am in the position, to say: I object to the request of the Senator.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I wish to make this statement for the leader. Today, the Senate will immediately begin consideration of H. J. Res 109, the continuing resolution. Under the previous agreement, there will be up to 7 hours for debate with a vote scheduled to occur after the use of the time or after the yielding back of the time. After the adoption of the continuing resolution, the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote in regard to the H-1B visa bill. Therefore, Senators can expect at least two votes during this afternoon's session of the Senate. 
   As a reminder, tomorrow evening is the beginning of Rosh Hashanah. Therefore, the Senate will complete its business today and will not reconvene until Monday, October 2, in observance of this religious holiday.

   Mr. STEVENS. As an opening statement on this continuing resolution that is now before the Senate, I want to state that this is a simple 6-day continuing resolution. This bill will fund ongoing Federal programs at the same rate and under the same conditions as currently applied to each agency of our Federal Government. 
   The continuing resolution now pending before the Senate is in the same form as those passed in previous years to bridge Federal spending until the full year's appropriations acts are completed. This committee has made good progress this week in advancing work on the fiscal year 2001 bills. The energy and water bill was filed last night and should be taken up in the House later today. Work is nearly completed on the Interior appropriations bill, and the conference on the Transportation bill will meet later today. I want to assure all of our colleagues of our determination to complete the work of the Appropriations Committee within the next week, to meet the target adjournment date of Friday, October 6. 
   Hopefully, this will be the only CR needed for the remainder of the consideration of the appropriations bills for the fiscal year 2001. 
   A second continuing resolution may, however, be needed to ensure the President has the required period that the Constitution gives him to review the bills that are passed by the House and Senate as conference reports once they are presented to the President. 
   Mr. President, we are in a difficult situation this year because we are adjourning this evening and will not be here through the full period of September. We will miss 2 days of the time we would otherwise have to complete our work. Therefore, it is necessary that the Senate approve this continuing resolution. 
   I urge the Senate to do so and we will strive to complete our work within the next week. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, having been a Senator who served in the minority, in the majority, and then in the minority, and again in the majority, I understand the discussion that has taken place here today full well. I have been a member of the Appropriations Committee for many years--not nearly as long as the Senator from West Virginia but for a long enough time to know that the appropriations process has to fit into the calendar as adjusted by the leadership.  
   We have done our best to do that this year. It does inconvenience many Senators whenever the appropriations process is shortened. I believe in full and long deliberation on appropriations bills. Mainly, I believe in bringing to the floor bills that have such uniform support on both sides of the aisle that there really isn't much to debate. 
   I think if the Members of the Senate will go back and look at the Defense Appropriations Committee bills since I became chairman, or when Senator INOUYE became chairman, we have followed that principle. Unfortunately, issues develop that are not bipartisan on many bills and they lead to long delays. In addition, the closer we get to an election period, the longer people want to talk or offer amendments that have been voted on again and again and again. 
   We have had a process here of trying to accommodate the time that has been consumed on major issues, such as the Patients' Bill of Rights and the PNTR resolution dealing with China, which took a considerable time out of our legislative process. We find ourselves sometimes on Thursday with cloture motions that have to be voted on the following Monday, and then we make it Tuesday and we lose a weekend. We have adjusted to the demands of many Senators. 
   I believe the Senator from West Virginia would agree that we have tried very hard in the Appropriations Committee to get our work done. Most of our bills were out of committee before we left for the recess in July. As a matter of fact, we had our two major bills, from the point of view of Defense--military construction and the Department of Defense appropriations bill--approved in really record time.

   Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator. I wasn't inferring that I received any comments or concern on my activity or the committee's, per se. I believe the process of the Senate, however, is one that involves the leadership adjusting to the demands of the Senate and to the demands of the times. A political year is an extremely difficult time for the leadership. Senator BYRD had leadership in several elections, and I had the same role as the Senator from Nevada--the whip--during one critical election period during which the leader decided to be a candidate and was gone. So I was acting leader during those days. I know the strains that exist. 
   I want to say this. I believe that good will in the Senate now is needed to finish our job. The American people want us to do our job. Our job is to finish these 13 bills that finance the standing agencies of the Federal Government and to do so as quickly as possible. Because of the holiday that starts in a few minutes for some of our colleagues, we will not meet tomorrow, and we cannot meet Saturday. So we will come back in Monday, and that will give us another 7 days to work on our bills. 
   The House has now passed the energy and water bill. We will file the Transportation and Interior bills--I understand those conferences are just about finished now--on Monday. We are working toward completion by the end of this continuing resolution. But let's not fool ourselves. If we got all these bills passed by next Friday, there would still have to be a continuing resolution because the President has a constitutional period within which to review the bills. He has 10 days to review them, not counting Sunday; so we are going to be in session yet for a considerable period of time--those of us involved in appropriations. 
   I urge the Senate to remember that circumstances can change. We could be in the minority next year, God forbid, and the leadership on the other side could be trying to move bills. And if the minority taught us some lessons about how to delay, I think we are fast learners. We have to remember that what comes around will go around. It is comity that keeps this place moving and doing its job. 
   I think all of us have studied under and learned from the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. He has certainly been a mentor to people on both sides of the aisle. He has taught us everything there is to know about the rules and how to use them. He has never abused them. I don't take the criticism that he has made other than to be of a process that we now find ourselves involved in. Our job is to work our way out of this dilemma. I hope we can. I hope we can do it in good grace and satisfy the needs of our President as he finishes his term. We have been working very hard at that since we came back from the August recess. 
   In my judgment, from the conversations I have had with Jack Lew, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, there is a recognition of the tensions of the time and a willingness to try to accommodate the conflicting needs of the two major parties in an election year. That is what we are trying to do. 
   I hope we will vote to adopt this continuing resolution and that Members will enjoy the holiday that is given to us by our Jewish colleagues. We will come back Monday ready to work. 
   I fully intend to do everything I can to get every bill we have to the President by a week from tomorrow. That may not be possible, but that is our goal, and I expect to have the help of every Senator who wants to see us do our constitutional duty, and that is to pass these bills. 
   Does the Senator wish any further time?

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senate will shortly vote on the conference report to accompany H.R. 4516, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act for 2001. 
   As the managers have stated, this conference report also includes the Treasury-general government bill for fiscal year 2001. 
   Many Senators have voiced concern about the inclusion of the Treasury bill, which had not previously passed the Senate, in this conference report. Many Senators have questioned me personally about this. Having served in this body for nearly 32 years, I understand and share that commitment to the procedures of the Senate and want to do my best to preserve the rights of all Senators. 
   I am here to ask Senators in this case to consider the product rather than the process by which this conference report comes before the Senate. This report addresses critical funding priorities for all of the elements of the legislative branch. Senator BENNETT and Senator FEINSTEIN have achieved a very balanced agreement with the House on the underlying bill that merits the support of the Senate. 
   In the Treasury bill, substantial changes were made to the committee-reported bill, the bill that came out of our Appropriations Committee, to accommodate priorities of the Members of the House and of the executive branch, both in terms of funding and of legislation. It would be preferable to have this bill come separately before the Senate, but the Appropriations Committee now finds itself in the stranglehold of the calendar. 
   In all likelihood, we have about 10 voting days remaining in this Congress. We are working to compress weeks of work into a handful of days. There are additional changes that Members and the President seek in the Treasury portion of the conference report. I have extended my personal commitment to Senator DORGAN to work with him and Senator CAMPBELL to try to incorporate those adjustments into another conference report. I also have given my word to Senator REID concerning problems regarding the police section of the legislative bill itself. 
   Adoption of this report now will permit us to redouble our efforts to conclude our work as rapidly as possible on the other bills that still pend before Congress, and we will be able to achieve the changes some sought to make in the current bill. Any other course will set the Senate and the Congress way back in getting our job done. 
   If this conference report is not approved, we will have to find some way to go back to conference with the House. And if it is decided that we must bring the Treasury bill before the Senate, I can assure Senators that we will have a postelection session. 
   It is just not possible to finish these bills before the election and get home in a reasonable amount of time--at least before the election--for the Members of the House and Senate who are up for election to conduct their campaigns. 
   I don't know of any other way to do what we have to do, other than to try to match up some of these bills in conference. There are lots of issues that both sides of the aisle may disagree on and fight over during the days that remain in this Congress. 
   The bill before the Senate, I believe, is a reasonable bill, comprised of two separate bills that meet important national objectives. I have come to the floor to urge the Senate to support this conference report, to accept the commitments that I and others have made concerning the additional concerns expressed on the floor, and let our committee complete its work. 
   I report to the Senate that conferences are scheduled today on the Interior bill and Transportation appropriations bill. But there is one thing Senators should know; our committee will be working every day--not just the 10 days of votes--between now and adjournment to try to finish the bills before the scheduled day of adjournment, October 6. Even when that day comes, it will not be the last day for the Appropriations Committee. We will have to await the outcome of the President's review and determine whether there have to be changes made in the bills following the veto, should that occur. I am not predicting it will occur, but it might. 
   If the Senate votes and approves this bill and sends it to the President, it is going to lend real momentum to concluding the appropriations process in a very responsible way this year. There have been things that held up these bills this year, including many days on the Senate floor with cloture motions and other matters. I am not critical of those. That is very important work for the Senate to do.  
   Now we are in the appropriations process and we are trying to deal with a period that will really end on the 28th, not the 30th, because of the holiday and our recess next week. We have to find a way to complete these bills. 
   The Senators who want to vote against the bill ought to be prepared to come back after the election. We are not going to be able to finish these bills separately this year. We are going to have to find a way to join them together. I, for one, have lived through too many postelection sessions. I don't want to live through another one. I urge Members of the Senate to support this conference report and let us get on about our work. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, at the end of this week the men and women of the United States Olympic Team will march into the Olympic Stadium in Sydney, Australia for the XXVII Olympic games. These athletes who inspire all of us to set high goals and reach those goals deserve our congratulations and support. The American people also deserve praise and thanks for their individual contributions to our athletes and to the United States Olympic Committee. Without those contributions, most of our athletes would never have the chance to compete. 
   American companies have also financially supported the United States Olympic Committee and the Olympic games through official sponsorships. Unfortunately, Mr. President, that Olympic sponsorship is being eroded by an insidious practice known as ``ambush marketing''--advertising that falsely implies an official association with a particular event or organization. In no context is ambush marketing more prevalent or more damaging than with the Olympic games which, because of the reliance on private and corporate funding, are increasingly threatened by a decline in sponsorship interest. 
   Internationally, it is fair to say that corporate sponsorship saved the Olympic movement. In 1976, Montreal was left with a debt of nearly one billion dollars following the summer Olympic games in that city. Los Angeles, however, managed to capitalize on corporate sponsorship, turning a profit and revitalizing international interest in the games. 
   American companies have long been proud to be official sponsors of the Olympic games because of the humanitarian and inspirational values the games present. These companies also recognize the valuable marketing potential of the Olympics, enhancing  their presence and business reputation in an increasingly global marketplace. By encouraging corporate involvement, Olympic organizers have ensured that such companies continue to devote tremendous financial and human resources to be identified as official Olympic sponsors. This sponsorship is particularly important in the United States, because there is no direct government support of our athletes. 
   Congress has recognized the value of corporate sponsorship by adopting the Olympic and Amateur Sports Act, which I authored, to authorize the International Olympic Committee to grant worldwide sponsors of the Olympic games exclusive rights to use 
   certain emblems, trademarks, and designations in the advertising, promotion and sale of products in designated product categories. The act also provides enhanced trademark protections to prevent deceptive practices specifically involving the use of Olympic trademarks or trade names. As a consequence, numerous major corporations have become Olympic sponsors and have contributed millions of dollars to the games and to U.S. athletes. 
   As the popularity of the Olympics has grown, so have the incentives to be associated with the games. Unfortunately, it is too easy for companies to imply an affiliation with the olympics, without becoming official sponsors. Such ambush or parasite marketing is often subtle--frequently depicting olmypic sports, athletes, medals, the host city, a burning torch, or other olympic games indicia--but its effect is proven. Studies have concluded that ambush marketers have been quite successful in their efforts to mislead the American public. 
   As companies begin to perceive only negligible goodwill or favorable publicity resulting from their Olympic sponsor status, their willingness to support the Olympic games and our athletes may wane. That is why I am considering legislation to further clarify the types of unauthorized use of Olympic games imagery and indicia that are actionable under the Amateur Sports Act. Australia, which will host the Olympic games in the next few weeks, has in place an ``Olympic Insignia Protection Act'' to protect against ambush marketing, and we may need additional protection in the U.S. Unfortunately, that legislation cannot be addressed this year. 
   There is a vast difference between freedom of speech and deceptive advertising. I will ask the congress to authorize private suits, similar to private antitrust legislation, to allow those injured by ``ambush marketing'' to recover their losses and financially punish those who try to mislead our people. 
   The USOC has been aggressive in protecting its trademark interests. These additional tools may be needed, however, to ensure the value of Olympic sponsorships and encourage corporate participation in the Olympic movement.

    Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Alaska lost one of its true pioneers when Dr. Milo Fritz died at his home in Anchor Point at the age of 91. 
   One of America's pre-eminent eye, ear, nose, and throat surgeons, Milo treated patients throughout Alaska. Dr. Fritz came to Alaska 60 years ago. With his wife Betsy, a nurse by his side, he began a practice that took him into almost every remote community of our State--to areas where there were no doctors, no clinics, no health care facilities of any kind. 
   The area he served covered almost a quarter of our State's 586,000 square miles, from Anchorage northeast to the Canadian border near Fort Yukon, west to Bettles and Huslia, south to Anvik and Shageluk, and east again over the Chugach Mountains to Anchorage. 
   Dozens of villages in that vast expanse would never have seen a doctor if Milo Fritz had not traveled by dog sled or small boat, or piloted his own single-engine airplane, because in that region there were no health-care facilities. 
   A command surgeon for the 11th Air force in World War II, Milo spent much of his service time in Alaska. After the war, and a brief sojourn in New York, he and Betsy returned to Alaska at the request of our then-territory's commissioner of health to investigate problems of blindness and deafness among children in Alaska Native communities. 
   Sterilizing his surgical instruments in boiling water heated on a portable stove he carried with him, Dr. Fritz performed tonsillectomies and sometimes, in the absence of a dentist, even had to extract infected teeth. 
   He specialized in treating otitis-media, a terrible and common disease among Alaskan rural children. 
   He wrote this brief account of one of his typical visits, this one in the village of Allakaket, which rests on the Arctic Circle in the foothills of the Brooks Range:  
   In Allakaket, we operated in a log community hall and slept in the schoolteacher's quarters. In this village we did 22 T and A's (combined removal of tonsils and adenoids), five tonsillectomies, extracted a few teeth, and prescribed two pairs of glasses. 
   We took one night off and in my airplane went into the wilderness into a heavenly spot called Selby Lake, where we fished for grayling and lake trout amid majestic surroundings that were as simple and beautiful and unspoiled as they must have been on the seventh day (a reference to the biblical account of creation).  
   After our territory of Alaska became the 49th State, Dr. Fritz took advantage of an opportunity to bring the health problems he encountered to the attention of State government, and ran successfully for the Alaska State legislature. in the 1960s and early in the 1970s he represented Anchorage in our State house. In 1982 he represented the Kenai Peninsula. I had the privilege to serve with him from 1966 to 1968. 
   Just as he was a perfectionist in the practice of medicine, Dr. Fritz was a  stickler for fair and thorough legislative practices. I remember Milo came to the Alaska House of Representatives at 5:30 a.m.--so he could read and analyze each bill before the regular session started. Milo had a commitment to the processes of democracy that few people share or understand. 
   At the time of his death, a family member said:  
   He was a skilled practitioner of the healing arts; a patron of the arts; humanitarian; solon; diligent inquirer into the mysteries of jurisprudence and its philosophy; a student of the legislative process; stern foe or hypocrisy and deceit; physician in the true tradition of Hippocrates and Saint Luke; and friend. Milo would want people to know that he tried.  
   Mr. President, Milo Fritz's contributions to Alaska and Alaskans over almost three generations are far more than those of a man who just ``tried.'' He left a legacy of caring and hard work and love of people and of his profession that will be hard to match. 
   He gave his all, over and over again, whether in a distant village or in his office in Anchorage, and Juneau and Anchor Point. I was not only fortunate to serve with him in our legislature, I was also one of his patients. so I know first had of the excellence with which he accomplished whatever task was before him. 
   Flags in Alaska flew at half staff last week to honor the memory of Dr. Milo Fritz, a great Alaska physician, legislator, and pioneer. A great man. 
   To Betsy, his wife of 63 years, and his son Jonathan, we extend our deepest sympathy. I, too, Mr. President, have lost a friend.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am joined by my colleague from Alaska, Senator MURKOWSKI, in thanking the managers of this bill for accepting an amendment important to the residents of Kake, Alaska. 
   The city of Kake is a predominantly Tlingit Indian community of 850 located on Kupreanof Island in a remote section of southeast Alaska. 
   Since the recent collapse of the timber industry in southeast Alaska, Kake's economy has been almost entirely reliant on a local salmon hatchery and a seafood processing plant. 
   The city water was supplied by the Gunnuk Creek Dam, a wooden dam  built in 1946 by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) at a cost of approximately $1.5 million. 
   In late July, after three days of severe storms dumped approximately 24 inches of rain, several logs swept across Kake's water reservoir and gouged an 18-foot by 12-foot hole in the 54 year old dam. The reservoir emptied and within minutes Kake's residents, hatchery, fish processing plant, general store, city offices, school, and fire department were without water. For the next 10 days, residents were forced to boil water before they could drink it. On August 10, the governor of Alaska issued a disaster declaration for Kake. 
   As an interim measure, small pumps have been installed in Gunnuk Creek to pump water to the filtration plant. Those pumps are highly susceptible to storms, and must be monitored 24 hours per day for debris and wear. The city purchased the small pumps with borrowed money, which must be repaid. Because of lack of water, the salmon hatchery has lost $2 million to date, primarily in loss of fish and egg harvests for next year's run. Also because of a lack of water, the cold storage plant--the major employer in Kake--laid off its 70 workers and has lost $500,000 in business. 
   Engineers from the Indian Health Service and a private consulting firm have declared the dam a total loss and estimate that $7 million is needed for a replacement. 
   The amendment included in this bill would provide the needed funding to replace the dam and I thank my colleagues for their support.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of the bill for accepting the amendment on behalf of Senator MURKOWSKI and myself to help find a solution to the problem plaguing Harding Lake. 
   Harding Lake is the largest road accessible lake in the interior of Alaska. It holds significant recreation, fishery, natural resources and economic value for interior Alaska. 
   In a recent Fairbanks Daily News-Miner article, state officials closed Harding Lake to pike fishing due to dried up spawning grounds. 
   Harding Lake is suffering from a dramatic drop in water levels. 
   This drop in water level has impacted the shoreline--in some areas causing a recession of as much as 700 feet. 
   This loss of water could cause problems with water quality, land use, and fishery harvests. 
   Residents of Harding Lake, have asked for help in identifying the source of the water loss problem at the lake. 
   After discussions with the Corps of Engineers and officials at the soil and conservation district, it appears a watershed study and plan is needed to protect the lake from further degradation. 
   My amendment would provide the necessary funding to begin the watershed study and to develop a comprehensive plan to address the problem. 
   I thank the managers of the bill for their understanding and for accepting this provision.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Research into the molecular basis of disease using mouse models of human disease and a miniaturized version of PET (positron emission tomography) called MicroPET currently being conducted at the University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine's Division of Nuclear Medicine offers exciting new possibilities for development of treatments for human disease based on the molecular disorders that cause it. 
   Among the diseases for which mouse models have already been developed are breast, prostate, lung and colorectal cancers, Parkinson's disease and diabetes. New funding will allow for development of mouse models for lymphoma cancers and dementia/Alzheimer's disease and will allow development of extremely precise molecular diagnostics and molecular therapies. 
   Added funding will allow development for the next generation of MicroPET imaging technology. 
   The new technology will combine MicroPET, which measures the biological processes of a body, and MicroCT, which measures a body's anatomical structure into a single device for simultaneous and precise imaging of both biology and structure and will allow for the differential screening of biological, genetic and structural changes caused by disease in living mice. 
   This will allow researchers to see precisely the effect of new molecular, targeted treatments including gene therapies for a wide range of diseases using human disease genes inserted into mouse models. 
   Because the mouse models are developed using human disease genes, the added funding for these new technologies and procedures will lead to new means of treating and tracking human disease using clinical PET technology. 
   The research will lead to the ability to both diagnose disease and track the effect of targeted molecular/genetic therapies on a broad range of serious human diseases.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the conference report to accompany H.R. 4576, the Fiscal Year 2001 Defense Appropriations Act was endorsed by all the Senate conferees, and enjoys the full support of our distinguished ranking member Senator INOUYE. 
   This bill, in combination with the emergency supplemental bill passed last month, provides a true jump start to restore the readiness, quality of life, and modernization of our Armed Forces. 
   The Senate considers this conference report at the earliest point in the year since 1958--which means the Department of Defense can plan now to execute the funds provided by Congress for the full fiscal year. 
   Our adoption of this conference report today would not have been possible without the extraordinary effort and leadership of House Chairman, JERRY LEWIS. 
   In partnership with the former House Chairman, and current ranking member, JACK MURTHA, they reported the bill in early May, and presented it to the Senate in time for us to act prior to the July 4th recess. 
   Both committees set the FY 2001 bill aside to complete work on the FY 2000 supplemental in late June. That bill provided $6.5 billion to repay the Army for operations in Kosovo, and to address critical personnel, medical, and fuel cost increases. 
   This bill extends those initiatives, providing needed funds for new medical benefits for military retirees, real property maintenance, depot maintenance, and environmental restoration. 
   The most significant initiative contained in the conference report is the nearly $1 billion increase for the Army transformation effort. 
   Last October, Gen. Eric Shinseki, the new Chief of Staff of the Army, established a new vision for the Army--a more mobile, lethal and flexible force for the 21st century. 
   In this bill, funding is provided to procure the first two brigade sets of equipment for the new ``transformation'' force. 
   We are determined that this new force be equipped as rapidly as possible, and intend to maintain this pace of funding in fiscal years 2002 and 2003. 
   Meeting our national strategic priorities, the bill establishes a new national defense airlift fund, to procure C-17 aircraft. 
   The centerpiece of how our Nation can maintain its global leadership position is strategic mobility. As our force is as small, to meet our national commitments, we must be able to respond to crises anywhere on the globe--the key to that is the C-17. 
   Finally, this bill accelerates development, and seeks to reduce technical risk, on the full spectrum of our missile defense programs. 
   The conference worked to keep the airborne laser, space-based laser, national missile defense, and Navy theater-wide programs on track, and provide additional funds for the Arrow Joint Development Program with Israel. 
   It is again my privilege this year to join my colleague from Hawaii in presenting this bill to the Senate. We simply could not have completed our work without his leadership, guidance, and partnership. I would now like to yield to Senator INOUYE for his comments.

The conferees were concerned about a large LRIP buy proceeding ahead of the test program.

I will work with you to review the test results and to ensure that the LRIP program is appropriate.

   Mr. STEVENS. I regret to tell my friend from Texas--I have told him informally, but I will tell him formally now--we have a staggering disaster going on in Alaska right now. It is the total collapse of the fish runs in the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers that sustain a substantial number of our native villages. If this is not in this bill now, it might come in in conference, but it is going to come up sometime before this year is out. I just want to put the Senate on notice. I was talking here about the agriculture items that are in this bill now. But I do not feel bound not to represent my State later, in terms of trying to protect these people who live in rural Alaska. 
   I talked today to James Lee Witt who is the Federal Emergency Management Agency Director. He told me the President had asked him to work with all existing agencies to try to find out what could be done under existing law and with existing funds to deal with a disaster that is taking place as we speak. We will not know, probably, until we come back in September, what will be required. But we do expect to have some substantial problems with this disaster within the coming 5 or 6 weeks. 
   I hope my friend understands what I am saying to him. In this agreement we just made, that, to me, does not include the fisheries disaster that is going on now in Alaska.

   I was looking over some of the correspondence I had with Senator COVERDELL. He sent me some Vidalia onions and told me they had a punch. He had a way of writing that was very interesting, in fact. 
   I think Senator COVERDELL grew in stature every year he was here. 
   I remember so well when he came to us. We had known him as part of the Peace Corps group. I believe his wife was a Delta stewardess at the time. He came around to visit each one of us. He came around to visit me and told me a little bit about some of his background. I knew then that we had a person who was going to be outgoing because not many Senators do that. He took time to visit with each one of us as he came to the Senate. 
   I think the skills he developed as a mediator will be missed in this Senate. I remember some of the bills he worked on even just this year--the Health and Human Services bill, for instance--bills with so many amendments, and it took committed work on the floor of the Senate.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished manager of the Interior appropriations bill in a short colloquy regarding a provision of interest to me. My amendment provides an appropriation to recompense an Alaskan community for its inability to receive a municipal land entitlement under the Alaska Statehood Act and Alaska state laws. 
   The city of Craig is a small town located on the southern end of Prince of Wales Island in southeast Alaska. It is the only community in southeast Alaska which was unable to receive a municipal entitlement under Alaska state law. This is a result of a 20-year process in the 1960s and 1970s by which the U.S. Forest Service and State of Alaska could not agree on the process for State selections under the Alaska Statehood Act at Craig. 
   In 1971, Congress passed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. ANCSA authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to work with the State ``for the purpose of effecting land consolidations or to facilitate the management or development of the land. Exchanges shall be on the basis of equal value, and either party to the exchange may pay or accept cash in order to equalize the value of the properties exchanged.'' 
   Despite this authority, the implementation of the act in southeast Alaska simply resulted in Alaska Native land selections completely surrounding Craig. Under ANCSA, these selections are not taxable or subject to condemnation unless the land is developed. As a result, Craig and its residents of about 2,500 people live on only 300 acres of privately and municipally owned land. This is insufficient as a tax base to support the community. My colleague and chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee introduced S. 1797 to solve this problem. That bill which I cosponsored and which has passed the Senate unanimously would provide a land grant to Craig of approximately 4,300 acres. 
   However, I recently have been informed by the administration that it believes a direct monetary grant to Craig is a better way to resolve this situation. The amendment which is to be added to the bill would provide for this payment.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today, we believe the President will sign the first of the 13 appropriations bills we must pass, the military construction bill. I can report to the Senate that we are in conference now on Defense, and we expect to report that bill this evening from conference, or no later than Monday. That could be easily taken up next week sometime. 
   The legislative appropriations bill is waiting for third reading now. It is held up by one amendment, and we are trying to work out an arrangement where we might be able to have that voted on. We are waiting for the House to appoint conferees on the foreign operations bill; the Labor, Health and Human Services Committee; and the Transportation Committee. Those are all the subject of negotiations with the various Departments and the President's advisers, to see if we might find a way to accommodate the desires of the administration regarding those matters. 
   The Interior bill is still on the floor and has a great many amendments. I believe, however, that can be finished easily next week. We have reported to the floor the Agriculture bill, which is a very important bill for us to consider, I believe, before we have the August recess. We have scheduled meetings now with the Appropriations Committee here in the Senate on Tuesday, July 18, for the Commerce-State-Justice bill and the energy and water bill. We believe those bills will be reported to the floor on that day, Tuesday, and could be scheduled sometime before the August recess. We believe we will be able to make the same statement regarding the Treasury and general government bill sometime next week. Hopefully, we will be able to get to that by at least Thursday. 
   What we are saying is that these bills can be acted upon if the Senate decides and commits to getting these bills to conference and, if possible, to the President, before the August recess. I have been speaking out now about the PNTR. I am a firm supporter of the goal there. Maybe there are some amendments that should be considered. But I believe we should get these bills done so that when we come back in September, we can take them from conference and pass them. 
   I call to the attention of the Senate the fact that we will finish our work for September on September 28. September 29 is a holiday, and September 30 comes on the weekend. We have a very short time when we come back to deal with appropriations bills and get them all to the President before the end of the fiscal year. It is my hope that, in the last year of this Presidency, we will avoid the kind of conflicts we have had in the past and try to work together with the President to finish up this term in the spirit of comity, particularly on appropriations bills. 
   That is possible if we can get them up in August. It is not going to be possible if we have to wait until September and try to jam them all in for 2 1/2 weeks in September. 
   I am taking the floor now with great respect for our leader and for our minority leader. I hope they will help us find the time on the floor between now and the August recess to consider these bills and ask for the commitment of the Senators to help us work to get this job done. 
   I think there is a way that we can wind up this period of 8 years of the Clinton administration without the rancor that we have had in the past, but it can only be done if we make up our minds now that we are going to work--and work some long nights, in fact--to get these bills considered and properly reported. I believe we are making progress. 
   It is my hope that at least the Defense bill and the Labor-Health and  Human Services bill will be sent to the President for signature prior to the August recess. 
   I am happy to yield to my good friend from West Virginia. Our committee works on a totally bipartisan basis. I have not done anything without consulting my good friend from West Virginia, the former chairman. I want the Senate to know he has given me good advice all along.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have the floor and I am happy to have that  conversation somewhere else, but I understand what the Senator is saying. 
   Mr. President, I want to finish my comments. I think we have almost used our 10 minutes. I thank my good friend for his comments. I could never claim to be the chairman that Senator BYRD was, but in any event, I do hope the Members are listening to what we are saying. We have had over 100 amendments on the last two appropriations bills. If that continues, we will be on appropriations bills until the day we go off on recess for the conventions. There will be no time for PNTR. Let's get the bills up. I urge the Members to be considerate of what we are doing. If we can finish them, then we take up PNTR. I think we can't keep breaking up the concept of these bills. The synergy of getting a bill working and getting it to pass in the appropriations process is necessary to get these done by the time we go off on August recess. 
   I have every confidence we will get to the PNTR. The Senator from West Virginia is right; despite my support of PNTR, it is not our constitutional duty to finish it by the end of the fiscal year. The appropriations bills are. That is our point. We want to do our job on time. We urge the Senate to work with us to get that done. 
   I think our time has expired.

   Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is very gracious. I have become increasingly concerned about the fines that EPA has been assessing against military reservations or elements of the Department of Defense, and had requested this provision in the bill to curtail that activity. In fact, it would have originally applied to similar fines from State and local agencies also. 
   We have now agreed on a version of this section 342 that will limit the fines that can be assessed against military entities by the EPA to $1.5 million unless the amount in excess of that is approved by Congress. It will be a provision, if accepted, which will be in effect for 3 years. My feeling is that there are many things that go into the operation of the Department of Defense that are subject to review by EPA, and it is my opinion that they have been excessive in terms of applying fines against the military departments. I do believe it results in an alteration of the lands we have for particular installations and it reduces the amount of money available  to operate those installations when they face these fines. 
   This amendment does not prohibit the fines. It only says they cannot assess any and have them paid to the EPA in excess of $1.5 million unless that fine is approved by an act of Congress. 
   I thank the Senator for working this out.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, regarding the Fort Wainwright central heat and powerplant, on March 5, 1999, the EPA Region 10 issued a notice of violation against the U.S. Army Alaska claiming they had violated the Clean Air Act with their central heat and powerplant. 
   After several meetings between regulators and Army officials, the EPA sent them a settlement offer proposing that the Army pay a $16 million penalty to resolve the alleged clean air violations. 
   In the offer, the EPA advised the Army that it would file a formal complaint if the Army failed to make a good-faith counteroffer within one month. The EPA also indicated that the size of fine sought will likely increase if a complaint was filed. 
   This $16 million penalty is the largest single fine ever sought from the Department of the Army or against any installation within the Department of Defense. It also exceeds the combined total of all other fines previously sought from the Army. 
   While U.S. Army Alaska had been aware for some time that the 50-year old central heat and powerplant required numerous upgrades, significant progress had been made toward bringing the plant into compliance. 
   The Army also had been working closely with the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation--which had been delegated Clean Air Act enforcement authority from the EPA--regarding the timetable for compliance. 
   That same year, in fiscal year 1999, the Army sought and received authorization and appropriations from the Congress to build a $16 million baghouse to control emissions from the plant. 
   In addition, an additional $22 million had been budgeted for fiscal year 2000 for plant upgrades. 
   The Army and the Department of Defense were surprised by the basis for the proposed penalty. 
   In EPA's settlement letter, EPA stated that it was seeking to recover the ``economic benefit'' the Army received by not constructing the baghouse sooner. 
   Over $15.8 million of the proposed fine, roughly 98 percent, is directly tied to the ``saved'' cost that U.S. Army Alaska purportedly enjoyed.  
   This is also the first time the EPA proposed a fine whose economic benefit components dwarf the assessed penalty based on the seriousness of the alleged violations. 
   Regarding the EPA visit to Shemya Air Force Base, the Air Force had a 50-year problem of waste and drum accumulation at Shemya Island--complicated by the large quantity generator status at Shemya AFB. This status required processing of accumulated hazardous wastes from the island within 90 days of generation. To meet the 90-day requirement, airlift had to be used as the primary method of disposal of the accumulated hazardous wastes. Also, the airlift crews had to have special qualifications to handle and process hazardous wastes. 
   From 1989 through 1991, 13,781 gallons of hazardous waste were shipped off Shemya Island. Following the 1991 Gulf War, airlift outside of the Middle East was impossible to get. 
   Complicating matters, Elmendorf AFB in Alaska could not handle the amounts of hazardous waste being returned from remote Alaskan defense sites. Movement of hazardous waste from remote sites came to a standstill due to strained airlift requirements and limited hazardous waste storage and processing capabilities. 
   In January of 1993, the Air Force started airlifting and removing 100 waste drums every week vice 100 per month. 
   Two months later, in March, the EPA gave the Air Force a 10-day notice of inspection. During the inspection, the Air Force had 660 barrels on the Shemya airfield processed awaiting air transportation. 
   During the out-briefing with senior Air Force personnel, the inspectors commented that the Air Force was making good progress in reducing the backlog of waste drums. 
   A long period of time ensued between the inspection and the publicly announced result and proposed fine by EPA. 
   EPA assessed the Air Force a fine of $483,000--this was the largest environmental noncompliance fine levied against the Air Force at that point in time.

   The Senate should know this is the largest health services bill in history. It represents a magnificent contribution and commitment to increasing funding for medical research in particular, and so many other things in general. Both of these Senators have done tremendous work in getting this bill where it is and getting it to the House. I think they really deserve our total congratulations for keeping our commitment to doubling the amount of money available for medical research within 5 years.

   Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from New Mexico is not only speaking about the forests, but people forget that the forests contaminate the private lands nearby. 
   We warned the Forest Service about the beetle infestation in Alaska and urged that the areas be sprayed and be thinned to prevent that from spreading. I regret to tell the Senate just yesterday I had to have people come and cut down two of our beautiful spruce trees on the little lot I own because I and my neighbors, who are adjacent to the national forest, are totally infested--the trees are totally invested by beetles. The beetles are killing the trees. 
   All of this could have been prevented. This is the same as wildfires. In fact, beetle kill is worse than wildfires because it totally consumes the future, and it is very difficult to remove these trees. 
   I commend the Senator. I hope he will reinitiate his proposal. He is correct. Because of the basic problem, all the editorial backlash that was built up against his legislation, we were unable to include that in this bill. But I look forward to working with him this year on this subject to try to force this administration to recognize their responsibility in protecting these national forests and, in doing so, to protect the private property owners nearby.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regret deeply that there is a dispute over these items. It is true that there is some money in the bill, and all of the items the Senator from Arizona mentioned, but one, were in the Senate-  passed bill. The Sea Life Center is the only new one. It is a provision to pay a rent for a Sea Life Center, which will close in August unless 
   that can be done. It is a Sea Life Center that has Federal money in it that opened it. If somebody doesn't believe that is an emergency, the right thing is to allow us to vote on it. I am perfectly prepared to muster up 60 votes for that Sea Life Center. I am proud of that Sea Life Center. 
   I say this to the Members of the Senate. There is not one amendment in this bill that was not presented by a Member who is here. I assume the Members are prepared to vote for the items they told us were emergencies. The Senator from Arizona is well known to be the watchdog of the Treasury and I admire that. I believe we should get on with this business and let's test the votes. 
   The Senator is right. If there are not 60 votes to establish the emergency designation on this bill, it will be returned to the Senate. But that is going to be the same, whether it is now or 6 hours from now. 
   I remember so well when one of my former colleagues killed a bill, which we worked on for 7 years, in the last few minutes of a Congress by asking that the bill be read. I have always thought that bills don't have to be read if they are available to Members of the Senate. That used to be the understanding, that they would be read if the bill was not physically on the Members' desks. I will be pleased to put it on every Member's desk now. It has been available since last night. But to have us now go into a reading of the bill--the Senator from Texas says his wife is waiting on the corner. My wife is already in Alaska. I am due there tonight. But the sad thing is that the last plane I could take to make it left at 10 o'clock. I am prepared to stay here all week, if it is necessary. 
   I have put before the Members of the Senate--and I will ask unanimous consent to print this in the RECORD. It is not fake or a manufactured thing. We have been telling the Senate for days and months that this money had been taken from the operation and maintenance account--the President's action employing troops in Kosovo. He has the right to do that under the act. And the money runs out. On July 5, this new order must go into effect that reduces the actions of our people during the period of maximum training in the summertime. It is not fake. I don't know why anyone would question the statements of the Chief of Staff of the Army. 
   The bill may not pass today, but it is going to pass before July 5. That is my commitment. If the Senator wants to make a commitment that it doesn't pass today, I will make a commitment that it passes by July 5. I believe we have the capacity to do that. It is the desire to have this bill passed and to have the people of the armed services know the Senate is behind the people in the armed services. It is still a military construction bill, an emergency bill to replace money spent for the operation and maintenance account. 
   It is a must-pass bill before July 5.

They were mechanisms to make available funds that would be used in the 2001 bill, and we can and we will have to make adjustments in other ways in the future. But these shifts have been objected to, and they will not be used this year. I can't say they won't be available in another year. They will not be used in connection with fiscal year 2001.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, late Thursday, the conference concluded on H.R. 4425, the Fiscal Year 2001 Military Construction Appropriations Act. 
   When the appropriations committee in the Senate reported that bill, we included a second division, Division B, that provided a series of emergency supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard, and other national defense related activities. 
   The conferees on this bill, led by the subcommittee chairman, Senator BURNS, addressed both the underlying military construction bill, and an expanded range of emergency supplementary needs. 
   Upon completing work on the military construction portion, an amendment was offered by myself, Senator BYRD, the House committee chairman, BILL YOUNG, and the House ranking Member, DAVID OBEY. 
   The amendment addressed fiscal year 2000 funding needs for the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard, wildfire fighting, recovery from hurricanes Floyd and Irene, the Cerro Grande fire in New Mexico, Liheap, and Plain Colombia. 
   At several critical points, the personal involvement of the Speaker on the House and the Majority Leader in the Senate were invaluable to breaking through disagreements, and achieving completion of our work. 
   While Senator BURNS will address the military construction portion of the bill, I want to highlight the defense emergency needs addressed in this conference report. 
   Once again, the President mortgaged the readiness of our Armed Forces by committing troops abroad, without the prior authorization and funding from Congress. 
   If this bill did not pass this week, the Army faced a genuine calamity, as training, base operations and other critical functions would have ground to a halt. 
   These funds, provided to sustain the Army through the remainder of this fiscal year, will prevent any interruption or degradation of our Armed Forces. 
   In addition, the conferees, under the leadership of Representative JERRY LEWIS, chairman of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, responded to several vital defense needs. 
   The amendment, offered by the four Members I named, provides a total of $11.23 billion in emergency spending for fiscal year 2000. 
   The amendment also makes several technical changes, pursuant to the budget resolution for fiscal year 2001 adopted earlier this year, concerning changes to pay days, delayed obligations, progress payments, prompt payment, and other matters. 
   In addition, the amendment permits the Senate Appropriations Committee to allocate the full amount provided in the 302(a) allocation for discretionary spending in the budget resolution. This is the same amount now available to the House Committee. 
   The amendment also adjusts the Function 050 outlay firewall included in the budget resolution to reflect the actual outlay levels in the Function 050 related bills reported by the House and Senate committees. 
   I want to especially commend the Chairman of the House Military Construction Subcommittee, Representative HOBSON, and the Chairman of the House Committee, BILL YOUNG, for their cooperation and leadership in presenting this conference report to the House and Senate. 
   Critical funding shortfalls for fuel, medical care, contract liabilities for Tricare, depot maintenance and intelligence were addressed in the House passed version of the supplemental, and included in this conference report. 
   Chairman LEWIS' initiative ensured that the readiness and quality of life for our military personnel will be truly enhanced by these initiatives, and provide the right starting point for our work on the conference for the FY 2001 Defense Appropriations Bill when we return from the July 4th recess. 
   A second important need met in this conference report is for Western wildfire fighting. As we meet here in Washington, fires are burning in several Western States, especially Washington State and my own State of Alaska. 
   The $350 million provided in this conference report will ensure the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service will be able to respond to any challenges we face during what promises to be a dry and hot summer--a truly dangerous situation. 
   Last month, at the request of the senior Senator from New Mexico, I traveled to the Los Alamos National Laboratories during the terrible fire that afflicted that area. 
   I saw firsthand the devastation to that community, and the federal facilities, caused by that fire. 
   Senator DOMENICI has included in this bill a comprehensive authorization bill that provides a claims settlement mechanism for the families and businesses who lost so much in that tragedy. 
   In addition, this conference report provides $661 million to initiate the claims settlement process and restoration of the federal facilities. These provisions brought to the conference by Senator DOMENICI will start the long recovery process, reflecting the Federal Government's liability for this disaster. 
   In this conference report, there are also several matters of great importance to my State. I appreciate the willingness of the conferees to consider these items. 
   Finally, I want to again thank the distinguished Ranking Member of our Committee, Senator BYRD, for his work to complete work on this bill. All the conferees met and worked in a spirit of bipartisan compromise, which is reflected in the conference report before the Senate. 
   I urge the Senate to adopt this conference report today, so that it can go immediately to the President.

   Mr. STEVENS. For the information of all Senators, on Friday the Senate will resume consideration of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education bill at 9:30 a.m. Under the previous order, there will be several votes on the remaining amendments, which include the Wellstone amendment regarding drug pricing, the Helms amendment regarding school facilities, the Harkin amendment regarding IDEA, the Baucus amendment regarding the impact aid, any amendment that is not cleared within the managers' package, disposition of the point of order that is pending, final passage of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill, and possibly a vote on adoption of the conference report to accompany the military construction appropriations bill. 
   Mr. President, I hope that ``possibly'' is not possibly but it is a fact tomorrow. 
   I do want to say on my own behalf that the enactment of this bill that we have just brought out of conference is absolutely essential to the well-being of the men and women of the armed services of this country. If it is not passed tomorrow and signed by the President before the Fourth of July, there will be severe repercussions in the military services of this country. We have worked day and night to get this bill done, and I congratulate the Members of the House in accomplishing passage of it earlier this evening. I do encourage our colleagues to remain in the Chamber during the series of votes that will come about in the morning hours tomorrow.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on behalf of the committee, we are prepared to accept this Wellstone amendment which provides $10 million for loan forgiveness for child care providers. The program was authorized by the Higher Education Amendment of 1998 and has never been funded. 
   The administration did not request funding, I might add. A $10 million offset in administrative expenses will pay for this amendment. 
   If the Senator is agreeable, I will accept the amendment to forgive loans for child care providers who complete a degree in early childhood education and obtain employment in a child care facility located in low-income communities. That is acceptable to us.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am surprised at the comments made by the Senator from Delaware to this extent: The 1997 Budget Act puts limits on the amounts that can be appropriated under the pending bill, the Health and Human Services appropriations bill. 
   In order to have a technical offset against the additions that are in this bill over the 1997 limits, we provided these three technical provisions that give us the right to take the Health and Human Services bill across the floor to conference. We had no intention at all to ever suggest the Congress would enact those provisions. The Finance Committee knew that. All Members knew that. This is a technical situation where, in order to get the bill across the floor until we enact the military construction bill, which contains the waiver of the 1997 provisions with regard to the ceilings for our committee, we had to have this offset. 
   I assure the Senator that the bill will not come out of conference with these provisions in it. They were never intended to be enacted. No one on our committee supports the elimination of these provisions, and Senator SPECTER was very gracious in allowing us these provisions to comply with the 1997 act. 
   I assure the Finance Committee that this bill will not come out of committee with these provisions in it. They were never intended to be in it, as the Finance Committee knows.

   These provisions in the Senator's amendment are in violation of the Budget Act. We have raised a point of order reluctantly, but this bill is at its level under the budget resolution. We must object to the Senator's amendment on the basis that it does violate the Budget Act. I raise that point of order.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, some people have inquired about why I have been so interested in the award of a Congressional Medal of Honor to our distinguished friend from Hawaii, Senator DANIEL INOUYE. I come to the floor to explain that. 
   As a young boy, I attended school in Redondo Beach, CA. That high school was also attended by a substantial number of Japanese students. On December 7 of 1941, we had the terrible attack on the United States. Following that attack, almost half of the young boys, young men of our high school class, did not return to school. They were Japanese young men. 
   Within a few weeks, they and their families were interned and taken to local racetracks and other places and put into internment camps. I never saw those young men again. They were young men with whom I played football and knew very well. Many of them joined the same unit Senator INOUYE was in, the 442nd. 
   It was not until 1996, when Senator AKAKA, Senator INOUYE's colleague, introduced an amendment, that I realized there had been probably one of the greatest mistakes made by the American military in its history. On February 10, 1996, Senator AKAKA offered an amendment that became section 524 of Public Law 104-106. It was for this purpose:  
   Review regarding upgrading of Distinguished-Service Crosses and Navy Crosses awarded to Asian-Americans and Native American Pacific Islanders for World War II service.  
   It required the Secretary of the Army to review the records relating to the awards of the Distinguished-Service Cross and the Secretary of the Navy to review the records relating to the Navy Cross awarded to these people to determine whether or not the people who had received those awards should be upgraded to the Medal of Honor. 
   As a result of that review, as we all know, yesterday we attended, at the White House, the Medal of Honor ceremony that did result in the upgrading of these awards that had been previously made to 21 different individuals. One of them was to my great friend, the Senator from Hawaii. 
   The Senate will have a reception, sponsored by Senator BYRD and myself, for Senator INOUYE this afternoon. At this time, at noon, he is becoming a member of the Medal of Honor Society at the Offices of the Secretary of the Army. We have invited every Member of the Senate, and I do hope they will come by. 
   The ceremony will start at 4:30. The room will be opened at 4 o'clock. It is the Caucus Room in the Russell Building. At my request, Stephen Ambrose, who wrote the D-Day book and other books very well known to our people, will be there to make some remarks concerning Senator INOUYE.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment covers resources in the Department of Defense and it deals with matters with which we are dealing in the supplemental right now. I do not want to mislead the Senate. We are trying to settle this matter in a conference on the military construction bill with the supplemental portions associated with it. I am perfectly happy to see the Senate express its point of view on the Colombia money, but in terms of the item as a place in the Department of Defense portion of the Colombia money, it really has been objected to by the Department of Defense, and as 
   chairman of the Defense Subcommittee, I strenuously object to it. 
   We should be in the position of determining how defense money is spent, how Armed Forces personnel are governed when they are abroad, and we should not take the occasion now to put limitations on the use of defense assets in connection with the war on drugs. 
   I just returned from Key West, Tampa, and Alameda in California. I know some of the defense assets we are using to supplement the activities in the war on drugs. I am very reluctant to see the Senate act on a bill at this time like this to set down rules that apply to the use of defense personnel, defense assets, and defense money in connection with the war on drugs.

   Mr. STEVENS. It is above my pay grade. I will speak for 2 minutes and express my position. If the vote occurs while I am gone, people will see an old bull scratch the ground very hard. 
   As a practical matter, this position that we have taken is the best one for Colombia. We looked at this very seriously. This account is under attack now. Does anyone think year after year after year after year we will be able to declare an emergency on this account? 
   We provided the Hueys. They can have two or more times the number of Hueys for the cost of what the administration wants to do with Blackhawks. The Blackhawks are fighting machines. They will be the tip of a sword going into another Vietnam, if we are not careful. What they need are the Hueys. They need to transport these people. They need to be able to fight against the drug people. They do not need to get these so they can fight against the insurgents. 
   I urge the Senate to realize what we are doing. We are doing our utmost to increase the tremendous pressure upon the drug operations in Colombia. We want to do that in a way that Colombia can sustain the cost without coming back to this Congress year after year after year to ask for money to maintain what we provided. 
   Others have spoken about the costs. The Huey is 
   a good machine. We are upgrading the Huey and providing our own troops for them. There is no reason for anyone to be ashamed of flying a Huey in combat. But it is not the type of situation that calls for Blackhawks to be a part of our operation against the drug lords. What we need to do is provide the assistance they need and to give them the ability, if they want to continue this, to operate these machines. 
   I cannot see why we should start this precedent. I assume Senator MCCONNELL made the same comments. We have similar situations all over the world. We are going to be faced in the next decade with trying to suppress the supply of drugs coming literally from all over the globe. This is no time to take the frontline item that we have for war-fighting machines and provide it as assistance to people trying to suppress drug producers. 
   I wish I had more time to deal with this because I believe very strongly that if we go to the Blackhawks--with the cost of operation per hour, the high maintenance cost, the high cost of continued operation--we will start a trendline that this budget cannot sustain into the future. We have to think about this not only in terms of what we will do now but what it will do in terms of outyear costs to continue this assistance. It is not a 1-year operation. We will not be able to stop this drug operation in Colombia in 1 year. 
   We have done our best. In fact, we have not done it yet. If this account gets overloaded, I seriously question even surviving the Senate. We have been warned about that in terms of the level of support. I believe Senator MCCONNELL and his committee have brought to us a bill that meets the needs, gives them the assistance, and gives them the support to carry out their operations against the drug lords without getting the U.S. in the position of building up a military force in Colombia to deal with the other problems they face internally. 
   I hope the Senate agrees with our position.

   I also am anxious to deal with the problem of adoption of the basic bill that has come to the Senate from the Appropriations Committee. I would like to also have that resolved tomorrow early in the afternoon, if possible. 
   I am constrained to say as chairman of the committee that this year is passing very quickly. We are now well into June. We have to have all of these bills finished by July before we go to the recess and the conventions during the August recess. 
   I urge Members to help us define the amendments that they wish to offer and enter into time agreements once we are certain they are going to offer them. 
   I thank the managers of the bill. I thank my friend, the chairman of the committee, and the ranking member for what they are doing. I am hopeful we can move this bill along. We have other bills that will be ready to go as soon as this one is finished.

   Mr. STEVENS. I hope early in the morning we can get an agreement for a specific time so we can move this bill forward. The other body is working on the Health and Human Services bill. We have already reported that bill out of committee. We were able to take that bill up. We also have the foreign assistance bill that will be ready to be taken up on the floor as soon as the House passes it. I hope we will be able to finish this bill early tomorrow afternoon. 
   I thought we were going to get an agreement to vote on the 
   Voinovich amendment early tomorrow morning. But I hope we will be able to meet early in the morning and get some timeframe on that amendment. I hope my friends on the other side will agree with that. 
   We are coming in at 9:45, and the Voinovich amendment will be the first amendment. But there is no time limit to vote on it. 
   We are hopeful we can finish this bill sometime early in the afternoon, at 1 o'clock or so, go back to the Defense bill, and be ready to take up another appropriations bill on Friday morning, the next day. 
   I hope the parties will consider doing what we did in the Defense bill and set a time limit for when these amendments that were listed in this agreement will be filed tomorrow so we can take a look at them and, hopefully, work many of them out without a vote.

   Mr. STEVENS. For the information of the Members of the Senate, we have a list now of the amendments that have been reviewed by the Parliamentarian and have an indication of those that violate rule XVI. It is our intention to raise rule XVI for those amendments that are in violation of rule XVI. We do have a list that the staff says we may modify so they are not in violation of rule XVI, which we would then be willing to accept, if the sponsors are willing to accept the modification. 
   There are other amendments that have been offered that are not in violation of rule XVI that we intend to oppose. For those, I urge Senators to have their staffs discuss these amendments with the staff of Senator INOUYE and myself. It is my understanding we are in agreement on the position on these amendments that we find unacceptable, even though they are not in violation of rule XVI. 
   I do think we can proceed in a very rapid fashion to determine how many votes we will have today if Members will state whether or not they are going to accept our modification. If they accept the modification, we will put them in a managers' package that we will offer around 11:30 as being acceptable under the unanimous consent request we obtained yesterday, to give the managers the right to modify amendments to make them acceptable under rule XVI. 
   It is my understanding the Senator from California is now going to offer an amendment. Could I inquire of the Senator if she intends to ask for a vote on this amendment?

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regret to say I have a 5-page list and I didn't have 2 pages in front of me. The Senator is right. We are working on those now, to notify Members on our side that we will oppose the amendments as listed on the basis we do not feel we can accept them because of the provisions of the existing bill and because of the availability of funds. 
   We will proceed to do just as the Senator has indicated. If Members, however, will accept our modifications--the Senator is aware of the modifications list? We again repeat, if they accept our modifications, although we oppose the amendments in the present form, we will include them in the managers' package. We hope to get a reply back from Members. Of course, Members have the right to offer their amendments and request a vote of the Senate. We are indicating, regarding those that we have not put on the acceptable list, we will oppose those amendments.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from California is correct in regard to the defense operations. I do note the exemption, where necessary, in the interest of national security. There are situations in which a commander has to know the medical conditions of people whom they might dispatch. That exception makes it acceptable for the Department of Defense. 
   However, I do not think we are going to proceed with having a piece-by-piece amendment to the Privacy Act on the appropriations bills. This is very much acceptable on this bill. With the conditions that are being applied, it is a step in the right direction. 
   I urge the Senator from California not to consider a piece-by-piece amendment to the Privacy Act on these appropriations bills as they come through because this Senator is not going to  support that. It becomes legislation on an appropriations bill on other matters, I can say that. 
   With regard to military records, it is an entirely different circumstance. Military records are part of the Department of Defense operation, and this is a step in the right direction. I am happy to accept the amendment on that basis. 
   I know of no other agency that has access to the medical records of the individuals who are employed by the agency as this one does. The Department of Defense does, and I think the Department of Defense will welcome this guidance. I am pleased to accept it on that basis.

These amendments have now been cleared in a modified form, or in the original form. But I call attention of the Chair to the numbers of the amendments that are included in our package. 
   It is: 3175 by Senator COLLINS; 3284 by Senator BINGAMAN; 3288 and 3289 by Senator SHELBY; 3291 by Senator KYL; 3298 and 3299 by Senator HELMS; 3300 and 3301 by Senator ROBB; 3305 by Senator ABRAHAM; 3312 by Senator LEAHY; 3314, 3315, and 3316 by Senator KENNEDY; 3321 by myself; 3323 by Senator ROBERTS; 3324 and 3325 by Senator SNOWE; 3326 by Senator LANDRIEU; 3329 by Senator GREGG; 3331 and 3332 by Senator FEINSTEIN; 3334 and 3335 by Senator WARNER; 3336 and 3337 by Senator NICKLES; 3338 by Senator ALLARD; 3339 by Senator COVERDELL; 3342 by Senator BINGAMAN; 3343 and 3344 by Senator INHOFE; 3352 by Senator ROTH; 3357 by Senator ROBERTS; 3293, as modified, by Senator LANDRIEU. 
   I send a modification to the desk of the last item, amendment No. 3293, which I just mentioned, of Senator LANDRIEU. 
   Mr. President, I believe all of those amendments are before the desk. To the extent they be modified, they have been agreed to by Senator INOUYE and myself pursuant to the unanimous consent agreement last night.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, last evening I did offer to accept this amendment. It does have some problems, and in conference we will try to work out those problems. 
   I do believe that the use of pesticides approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should be assured so that military children and those on military bases can have the same protections, protecting the food supplies of the commissaries and populated facilities on a military base. I think the preparation of homes, for instance, before they are occupied certainly requires the type of spraying approved by the EPA. 
   We will make certain there is full protection for those in the military. As I understand it, this is an amendment that is designed to prevent the use of the pesticides that would not be subject to approval by the EPA. I intend to support the amendment. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am going to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Kansas and 10 minutes to the Senator from Hawaii. I want to start off by saying we are talking about 
   UC-35 support aircraft under a pilot lease program. I do not know what this business is about someone saying last year--I do not know the straw man. Last year, I said we expected them to lease intercontinental aircraft of a large size, and they did. This time we are telling you we expect them to lease UC-35-type aircraft for operational and support utility purposes. 
   There are nine planes authorized to be leased--three for the Army, three for the Navy, and three for the Marine Corps--to replace planes that are aging, many of them more than 30 years old, older than the pilots who are flying them. 
   It is time we woke up to the fact that it costs so much to operate them, so much to maintain them that it is too expensive. We are trying to modernize without buying so many airplanes. We want to lease them. 
   This is a pilot program, as was the one last year, to see what the cost will be as we have to replace this fleet. It is an aging fleet. As a matter of fact, we bought the first G-3 the first year I was the chairman of the subcommittee in 1981. Those planes are now over 20 years old, the 21s are over 30 years old, and we have to replace them. 
   We have two pilot projects: One is to lease the larger ones and one is to lease these smaller ones. We are going to see what it costs us, what the maintenance costs are. 
   I am getting tired of these GAO reports written by people who do not know what they are talking about, and we are going to do something about that, too. That same person who has been writing these reports has condemned every airplane we have bought in the last 5 years. It is time we stopped listening to the people who do not know what they are talking about.  
   These are pilot programs to lease aircraft, instead of replacing them, to determine what the maintenance costs will be, what will the cost to the Government be if we pursue a leasing program, which most major businesses do now, rather than buying aircraft. I think it will be cost effective. But above all, this is a program to determine the cost, whether there is a choice for us, instead of buying replacements, to lease these aircraft. Until we put the pilot programs in place, we will not know. 
   I think this is the rational thing to do. I have seen a lot of straw people, but you get on the www.gulfstream. com all you want and look at the beautiful airplanes. They are not what we are talking about. We have not bought any of those either. We have not bought planes such as those they will see advertised for commercial purposes. We bought them for military purposes. They are stripped down, and they are functional aircraft. The ones we leased last year are functional now. I invite my colleagues to take a ride on one and look at them. 
   As a practical matter, right now, I yield to my friend--

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the language is exactly the same; the Senator is right. It is for leasing aircraft for operational support and utility airlift purposes, and it specifically says it is a multiyear pilot program. There is not an expanded program as has been represented. It is nine planes total to see what the costs will be of operations under this pilot-type program as compared to the cost of buying such an aircraft and flying it for military purposes. 
   I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Kansas.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator from California 2 minutes and apologize. She did recognize me for a four-line comment. 
   I yield myself what time I use to make this statement: The issue has been raised about large aircraft. That is a different issue. We have gone back and checked what this issue is. This is support aircraft. The Air Force told us today they will have to add $900 million to the budget to maintain and upgrade the existing support aircraft for the next 10 years. Leasing these smaller aircraft to replace them will cost $525 million over the next 10 years. If our pilot program works, these aircraft in what we call the CINC Support Pilot Program will save $275 million. I think that is a good idea. It makes sense to try it for the UC-35s, and I hope the Senate will support that. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the operational support airlift fleet has decreased from 520 in 1995 to 364 today. We are reducing the number of these aircraft. Now we are starting a pilot project of leasing them to see if we can save even more money. But we must go through the concept of replacing these aging aircraft. 
   By the way, one last comment as a pilot: People say: Well, they can land and take off, and they can land and take off, and they can land and take off. I am also a pilot. Every time you let down and land and take off again, you use more fuel than if you fly straight through. These planes are designed to save us money by having ``the legs,'' as we call it, to go the distance and not have to stop and burn more fuel as they land and take off. 
   Does the Senator wish any more time? 
   Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time. I serve notice that I intend to move to table the amendment of the Senator from California.

We have not raised the caps, so this is not the time to make a point of order. But it is the time to point out that the Senator's amendment would move money from defense into education, and it would violate the principle of the wall that we put up between defense and nondefense. 
   I do hope that the Senate will support the committee in voting to table, and I do move to table this amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. STEVENS. The Committee is aware of the new standards, but is concerned that the Air Force is not investing in the proper mix of modernization and new aircraft to meet our strategic airlift needs. 
   We are still waiting to receive the long overdue Mobility Requirements Study 2005 (MRS '05) that will clearly lay-out what our strategic airlift needs will be for the foreseeable future. In addition, once that requirement is clear, we will get the Air Force Analysis of Alternatives for 
   Outsized/Oversized Airlift (AoA). This study will provide a clear understanding of what mix of aircraft will most efficiently and effectively meet the operational requirements of the military. 
   When the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton, testified before our Committee, he expressed reservations about making further investments in the C-5A fleet.

   Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct, I do not believe that the Committee's language endangers any of our aircrews. Instead, it is a delaying mechanism to prevent investing in these planes before we are sure that they will be flying for the next 20 years. If, in fact, these studies suggest that, then we will take another look at the needs of the A-models.

I am willing to re-examine this issue when we go into the Conference with the House.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleague, the senior Senator from Maine, in recognition of the importance of the LPD-17 program and the importance of these ships to the overall modernization program of the Navy and Marine Corps. During consideration of the FY2001 Defense appropriations bill, concern regarding delays in the design and construction of the lead LPD ship at the lead shipyard led to a decision by the Committee to defer funding for the fifth and sixth ship of the class. The Committee did, however, recommend a total of $485 million for this program.

   Mr. STEVENS. I have always been a supporter of the LPD-17 program and the Committee very much appreciates the need for the lift capacity of this ship. In fact, it is my understanding that the San Antonio and her 11 sister ships will be the functional replacement for four classes of older amphibious ships. And in 2008, when the last LPD-17 class ship is scheduled to join the fleet, the amphibious force will consist of 36 ships or 12 three-ship Amphibious Ready Groups (ARGs) consisting of one LHA or LHD, one LPD and one LSD.

   Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from Maine for her work to establish and hold the necessary shipbuilding rate for the nation's defense. I also recognize that the sustained investment of $10 to $12 billion in the shipbuilding account is necessary to maintain a minimum shipbuilding rate of 8.7 ships per year. 
   Specifically, in regard to the LPD-17 program, the committee recognizes that the Navy has never employed such a rigorous new approach for a new class of ships--wherein the goal is to have 95 percent of the design work completed before construction begins, rather than much lower levels in previous designs. This is an important fact, because it means the design work will lead to efficient construction of these ships, and set the standard for the next generation ship designs.

   Mr. STEVENS. Let me state at the outset, unequivocally, that I fully and strongly support the LPD 17 program, a program for which the distinguished junior Senator from Maine has been an effective advocate. As I stated in my opening remarks to this bill, I am committed to seeing the program progress and delivery to the Navy of no fewer than the required twelve ships. The recommendation the committee has made and the language in bill is intended to stabilize the design of the program fiscal year 2001. It does not reflect a lessening of our commitment to the program itself, in its entirety. 
   I agree with my dear friend and colleague that the LPD 17 is a critical program for the Navy and Marine Corps service members and that it continues to provide our marines essential transport to troubled areas around the world.

They have both presented their projected impacts of the appropriations provision and mark on the program. However, the recommendation of the committee is to get the program back on a stable track with a stable design. This bill provides some $200 million in order to ensure that there will be no interruption in work at the affected shipyards.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, may I engage in a colloquy with my good friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Hawaii? 
   As Senator INOUYE  knows, the Manager's amendment currently before the Senate includes an amendment to section 8014. That section addresses the procedures that must be followed by Department of Defense agencies which seek to outsource certain civilian functions to private contractors. Since 1990, this provision has been included in the Defense appropriations bills for each of the last ten years. Throughout that time, section 8014 has provided for certain exceptions to the procedures, including an exception when the private contractor is a Native American-owned entity. This exception has been included in furtherance of the Federal policy of Indian self-determination and the promotion of economic self-sufficiency for the native people of America. 
   The exception for a private contractor that is a Native American-owned entity is an exercise of the authority that has been vested in the Congress by the U.S. Constitution in Article I, Section 8, Clause 3, often referred to as the Indian Commerce Clause. As the senior Senator from Hawaii and vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs knows, this is by no means the only Federal legislation that recognizes the special status of Native Americans in commercial transactions with the Federal Government which is based upon the trust relationship the United States has with its indigenous, aboriginal people. There are, in fact, numerous examples of provisions of Federal law that seek to provide competitive assistance to businesses that are owned by Indian tribes or Alaska Native regional or village corporations. Congress has enacted such laws because they have been found to be the most effective and appropriate means of ensuring and encouraging economic self-sufficiency in furtherance of the Federal policy of self-determination and the United States' trust responsibility. There is considerable judicial precedent recognizing such laws as a valid exercise of Congress' constitutional authority, perhaps the most significant of which is the United State Supreme Court's 1974 ruling in Morton versus Mancari. 
   It has come to my attention that a lawsuit has been filed challenging the Native American exception in section 8014 as a racially-based preference that is 
   unconstitutional. That challenge is simply inconsistent with the well-established body of Federal Indian law and numerous rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court. The Native American exception contained in section 8014 is intended to advance the Federal Government's interest in promoting self-sufficiency and the economic development of Native American communities. It does so not on the basis of race, but rather, based upon the unique political and legal status that the aboriginal, indigenous, native people of the America have had under our Constitution since the founding of this nation. It is a valid exercise of Congress' authority under the Indian commerce clause. While I believe that the provision is clear, we propose adoption of the amendment before us today to further clarify that the exception for Native American-owned entities in section 8014 is based on a political classification, not a racial classification. 
   Because my colleague was Chairman of the Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations in 1990 and involved in the drafting of section 8014, I would like to know whether my understanding of the purpose and intent of section 8014 is consistent with the original purpose and intent, and whether the amendment before us today is consistent with the original intent of section 8014.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I rise to remind Senators that there is an order that requires amendments to this bill be filed by 3 p.m. We have been notified there are about 41 amendments that may be offered. Senator INOUYE and I are prepared to deal with these. 
   If Members have amendments and desire to have a vote sometime tomorrow, please take time this afternoon to initiate that debate. There is no time limit on amendments yet, but we do intend to reach a time limit agreement on amendments later this afternoon. If Members have amendments and desire to have a considerable amount of time to present to the Senate, this is a great time to do that. 
   We will be working up a managers' package of amendments that we believe we can take to conference and work out. Senators may want to identify those amendments and present them. We would be pleased to consider them now and determine if we will put them in the managers' package so we can move the bill forward. 
   It is our hope we will finish this bill tomorrow afternoon. That is complicated a little bit by the fact we have a full Appropriations Committee meeting tomorrow afternoon to report out the Transportation appropriations bill. That may not take very long. It is our intention to keep working on the Defense bill, notwithstanding the fact we will be in committee on the Transportation bill. I urge Senators to introduce and possibly present amendments to the Senate so we can determine whether they should be included in our managers' package, which will be accepted by unanimous consent.

Under the order, there will be up to 10 minutes of debate on the pending Grassley amendment regarding accounting, with the vote to occur at approximately 9:40 on that amendment. 
   Following the vote, the Senate will continue debate on this Appropriations bill, with further amendments expected to be offered. 
   Again, Senator INOUYE and I invite our friends to bring amendments to the floor now so that we might consider adopting them at this time. 
   It is hoped that the consideration of the Defense appropriations bill can be completed early next week. 
   We hope it will be by Tuesday so that we can take up one of the other bills. We will have several bills ready to take up by midweek next week. We hope to be able to get to them and get them to conference before the Fourth of July recess. 
   We thank our colleagues for their cooperation on this bill.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, for the information of Members, we will have opening statements, and then we will have an amendment offered by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. GRASSLEY. 
   On behalf of the leader, I make this statement. We are now on the DOD appropriations bill. After our opening statements, Senator GRASSLEY is prepared to talk about his accounting amendment. We expect to have a vote at 9:30 on that amendment tomorrow morning. There will no more votes for the remainder of the day. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to join my great friend, Senator INOUYE, in presenting the Defense appropriations bill to the Senate. This bill is for the fiscal year 2001. It represents the twelfth bill we have jointly brought before the Senate: Six were presented by my friend from Hawaii during the period of time when he was the chairman of the subcommittee, and now this is the sixth bill presented by me during the second opportunity I have had to chair this subcommittee. 
   First and foremost, the bill reported by our committee, in our opinion, meets all personnel, readiness, training, and quality-of-life priorities for the armed services. 
   We have fully funded the pay raise and new authorized recruiting and retention benefits. All estimated costs of contingency operations for 2001 in Kosovo, Bosnia, and southwest Asia are included in our recommendation. There should not be an emergency supplemental for known contingency operations in the year 2001 for the Department of Defense. 
   The bill before the Senate sustains and augments the efforts to accelerate modernization of our Armed Forces. 
   Significantly, the recommendation provides an additional $250 million for the Army's transformation initiative. 
   I join my friend from Hawaii in commending General Shinseki for his foresight and leadership in moving the Army forward into a more deployable global force. These funds should accelerate the fielding of the initial transformation brigades in 2001. 
   Our committee, consistent with the Defense authorization bill as presented to the Senate, adds funds for several missile defense programs. Mr. President, $139 million is added for the national missile defense research and development, $92.4 million 
   for the airborne laser, and $60 million for the Navy theaterwide missile defense efforts. 
   This is the crossroads year for missile defense. These funds are consistent with the recommendations and priorities of General Kadish, who manages this program, for the fiscal year 2001. 
   A new initiative recommended in this bill is to transfer funding for the C-17 program to a new national defense airlift fund. 
   Several years ago, funding for sealift acquisition was transferred to a central account. Airlift is a key strategic capability. The need for that is shared by all military services. Funding for airlift should not be borne solely by the Air Force, just as funding for sealift is not now borne by the Navy. 
   Full funding is provided in this new account for 12 C-17 aircraft requested for 2001, and the advance procurement and interim contract logistics support submitted in the budget. 
   The bill presented by the subcommittee includes report language that directs the Department to proceed with the current acquisition strategy to select a single design based upon the flight test program. 
   The Joint Strike Fighter might be the single most important defense program this committee will consider in the next 10 years. We must get this one right. Industrial base concerns should only be addressed after we are sure we have selected the best aircraft at the best cost for the mission and not before we even select the winner of the competition. 
   When the committee met to report the bill, several Members raised with me the subcommittee's recommendation to defer full funding on the two LPD-17 class vessels requested in the budget. 
   The bill before us includes $200 million in advance appropriations for the two ships originally planned for fiscal year 2001. Also, it includes $285 million to pay for cost overruns incurred on the first four ships. 
   I want to restate, as I have in both Maine and Louisiana in the past week, my personal commitment to the LPD-17 program. The focus of the adjustment we recommend is to get the program back on track with a stable design and address prior year problems. The funds provided are intended to assure that there will be no interruption in the work at the two shipyards and no additional delay in construction or delivery of the ships. 
   At the markup, language was added by Senator COCHRAN and Senator SNOWE to permit the Navy to sign contracts for both ships using the funds appropriated by this bill. We have approved that recommendation. So there is no reason to say this bill in any way slows up the process of procuring these new ships. 
   Finally, the recommendation provides $137 million for the new medical benefits included in the Senate-reported defense authorization bill. These efforts provide a new pharmacy benefit for military retirees. They are fully consistent with the objectives outlined by General Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, in his testimony before our committee. 
   The new medical benefit package adopted during consideration of the defense bill does not require additional discretionary appropriations for the fiscal year 2001. 
   It is our intention to work closely with the authorizing committees and with the Department of Defense to ensure that any new benefits are fully funded in the years to come. If a commitment is made under our watch, it is going to be kept. 
   These improvements will come at considerable cost and will be an important element of future defense budget planning. This is really what the Senator from Nebraska was talking about, the oncoming important costs we must face. The definition of those costs is the problem so far. 
   I urge all of our colleagues to look at this bill as a whole. It is packaged together. It really is a bill we have worked on. I do commend our staffs, our joint staffs, under Steve Cortese, who is with me, and Charlie Houy is with Senator INOUYE. 
   This bill once again is a bill that I think, as I said in the beginning, will meet our needs with the funds that are available this year. The allocation for defense is roughly $1 billion less than the amount made available by the Senate version of the defense authorization bill. It is about $1 billion below the allocation for the House-passed bill now before the Senate. 
   Some of these issues have to be sorted out in conference with the House. I ask the patience of the Senate as we work to get the best possible package to the conference. 
   I call the attention of the Senate to the fact that we have several issues in the bill that are also pending before the conference on the military construction bill because of the supplemental that was already passed by the House. 
   The committee has closely followed the Senate's actions on the defense authorization bill so far this week. We intend to offer a managers' package of conforming amendments during consideration of this bill to accommodate the Senate's action on the bill. 
   To that concern, I ask all Members of the Senate, if you have amendments to offer, please notify Senator INOUYE or me as soon as possible. We can probably work out most of them. We hope we will be able to do so because our bill closely tracks the defense authorization bill. It tracks the priorities outlined by the military chiefs in their  testimony before the committee, and it certainly tracks fully our understanding of the House version that was passed by the other body just recently. 
   Mr. President, I now recognize our distinguished ranking member, the Senator from Hawaii, and once again call to the attention of the Senate the great honor that will come to him in just a few days; that is, the honor of receiving his Medal of Honor which he should have received a long time ago. It is a privilege to serve with my friend from Hawaii. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am glad to hear the Senator's statement. I inform my friend, I spent a substantial portion of the day discussing how to meet the problems associated with the feelings of so many people in the military that there were, in fact, substantial commitments made that lead on into the future as enormous costs as compared to the costs of the past. 
   We need to have a commission of some kind. I hope after the Senator steps down from this body that he might see fit to be one who will help take on the task of defining the commitments that were made and how we fulfill them. I say that because in the past, many of those benefits were paid out of the Veterans Affairs Department from veterans benefits. They are now coming from the Defense funds, and if they grow at the rate it appears they are going to grow, they are going to seriously hamper our ability to modernize our force and our systems and defend our country as it must be in this century.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we had announced that there would be a vote at 9:30. Because of the request just agreed to, we will have that vote at approximately 9:40 a.m. tomorrow on the Grassley amendment. There will be further amendments considered during the day and additional votes may occur. Senators who have amendments are encouraged, as I have said before, to contact my friend from Hawaii, Senator INOUYE, or myself. We want to try to expedite consideration of this important spending bill. I ask my friend if he has anything further to come before the Senate.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to carry out an obligation I made on Memorial Day at the Arlington National Cemetery services. 
   This statement was presented at the Arlington National Cemetery memorial service by the Flying Tigers of the 14th Air Force Association. It was in the form of a prayer that was entitled, ``Empty Cockpit; To our Departed Comrade.'' 
 His is a place no one can take, The void he leaves cannot be filled, For the mark he made, stays, fresh on us, Although his heart has stilled. 
 Though the years pursue their relentless course, And images are replaced, And memories grow dim and fade, And time obscures that familiar face, And even a name be forgot, And the things he said, and did, And lives more noble may come and go, But what he was cannot be hid. 
 The lessons he unknowingly taught, By being what he was, Have certainly changed the lives he met, As his life touched ours. 
 So that the course which they now take, Points somehow higher than before, A true and gently comrade, Has opened an unknown door. 
 So although his life on Earth is done, His heritage will not rust, For parts of him, that was, remain, And live on as part of us.  
   I thank the Chair. I made a commitment to repeat that here on the floor of the Senate. I appreciate the time.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank Senator FEINSTEIN. I commend Senators BENNETT and FEINSTEIN for managing this bill. It is a significant bill. 
   With regard to the police, this bill increases support for our Capitol Police by 26 percent. In fact, in addition to that, we have in the Agriculture bill, awaiting Senate action, $2.3 million in overtime costs to implement the two-men-per-door policy and $10 million to provide additional facilities to support police functions. The 2001 appropriations bill provides $5.2 million in overtime to continue the two-men-at-each-door policy. 
   I commend Senator MIKULSKI for her amendment. I deem it as a remembrance sense of the Senate, and we should remember these men who lost their lives in guarding this building and the functions of the Congress. 
   I hope we will have the support of all Members for the basic bill. We support Senator MIKULSKI's amendment, as a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, that recognizes what is in the bill, that is, increasing support for the security functions for the Capitol and those who work in it. 
   Mr. President, I believe we have scheduled the time to commence the vote.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today my friend the senior Senator from Hawaii, Senator INOUYE, and I are introducing the Stop TB Now Act. 
   This bill would amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to authorize one hundred million dollars in each of fiscal years 2001 and 2002 to fight tuberculosis. Each year, eight million people develop active tuberculosis. One and one-half million of those that develop active tuberculosis will die from that disease alone. One person can infect 10 to 15 people in a year. 
   The global economy and its mobile work force makes the world a smaller place. No country is immune from the reach of this highly contagious disease. In 1999, the United States had almost 18,000 active TB cases. That comes to 6.4 per 100,000 people. According to the Centers for Disease Control, Alaska was ranked fourth in per capita cases of active tuberculosis in 1999. Hawaii has been number one since at least 1997. 
   This bill has two components. A treatment strategy and the goal of arresting the rise of more dangerous strains of tuberculosis. The World Health Organization has developed directly observed treatment, short-course, referred to by its acronym DOTS. DOTS is a community-based treatment strategy. It uses standardized short course chemotherapy for 6 to 8 months, with direct observation of TB patients. Strict adherence to a drug regime is really the only way to successfully treat TB. Participation at the local level can perpetuate a culture of vigilance against this and other public health threats. Ineffective treatment strategies in the past have led to the emergency of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, known as MDR-TB. 
   MDR-TB are strains that are resistant to one or both of the two most effective existing TB drugs. Drugs to treat MDR-TB are at least 100 times more expensive than traditional TB drugs. 
   This is a staggering cost. Even in our country where the medical community can readily identify and treat MDR-TB, half the patients still die. These are patients using MDR-TB drugs. According to the World Health Organization, in another 3 to 5 years, without a comprehensive prevention and treatment strategy, drug resistant strains of TB will be the dominant form of the disease. Time is of the essence. 
   In my own State of Alaska, we are concerned about the dramatic increase in MDR-TB in the Russian Far East. That region has enormous trade potential for the State. Our native peoples also travel there on cultural exchanges. Tuberculosis has been called the poor man's disease. Perhaps from our perspective it was once considered a poor country's disease. This is not the case and we cannot ignore the global reach of this disease and its new variants. 
   I know many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are concerned about tuberculosis, as well as its association with the AIDS epidemic. I urge my colleagues to join Senator INOUYE and myself in sponsoring this legislation. It is my hope Congress will act to address this threat this year.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Mitch Rose, my chief of staff, who before that was my press secretary, will leave the Senate within the next few days. 
   Mitch has been a great member of our staff, with his understanding of the nuances of legislation, his ability to articulate concerns, and his courage to challenge debate when he believes strongly in an issue. His talents with words, written and spoken, are really legendary. 
   But no matter how tough the argument, or how serious the discussion, Mitch's sense of humor always helps to keep things in perspective. 
   It's safe to say that he's not only famous for that sense of humor, but at times, he's infamous. 
   Born in Alaska, a product of a great family and of Alaska's public schools, Mitch came to Capitol Hill after graduation from the University of Washington, almost 15 years ago. 
   He first went to work for our friend and former colleague Bob Dole, and later toiled for the other members of our Alaska delegation, DON YOUNG in the House and FRANK MURKOWSKI here in the Senate. 
   When Mitch joined our staff, he took on the added responsibility of attending law school at night. His wife, Dale Cabaniss, attended a different law school in the evenings, while she worked for Senator MURKOWSKI. 
   Mitch's work on aviation and telecommunications issues has been particularly important. As chief of staff, he has kept ahead of the curve on all of our concerns, providing insight and guidance to my staff and me. 
   The Alaska Humanities Forum has created a program named after Mitch, based on his experience as a youngster, when his parents made sure he knew how life in a rural Alaska village contrasts with life in urban Alaska. The Rose Urban-Rural Alaska Partnership Program will take urban youth to rural villages to promote better understanding of the very different ways of life in our small communities. It will provide the same type of opportunity his parents, Dave and Fran Rose, provided for Mitch when he was a young Anchorage school boy. 
   Mitch is an example, Mr. President, of the best of his generation. He's worked hard, taken on heavy responsibilities at work and at home, maintained close and good relationships with Alaska and Alaskans, and with those with whom he works. 
   He and Dale, who is now a Commissioner of the Federal Labor Relations Authority, are the parents of Ben 5, and twins Haley and Shelby, eight months. 
   There is no question that we will miss Mitch. But there's also no question that he will be a valuable member of the private sector. 
   My thanks to him for the work he's done, the loyalty he's shown and the friendship he's shared. With so many others who have known him over the years, I wish him well.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as a product of the World War II years, I rushed through my undergraduate education after that war. In the process, my education was of the Yogi Berra variety: If I came to a fork in the road, I took it. 
   Now, having acquired seniority here, I have privileges I never dreamed would be part of my life, and am more and more aware of what I missed by not spending more time in basic educational endeavors. 
   For instance, because of my service on the Senate Rules Committee, it is my honor to be chairman of the Joint committee of the Library. This position opened my eyes and ears and filled my mind with joys totally unexpected. 
   For instance, my increasing visits with Dr. Jim Billington, Librarian of the Library of Congress, a national treasure and our preeminent Russian scholar, have led to meeting more and more of the distinguished academics of our time. 
   One of these persons is Jaroslav Pelikan, Sterling Professor Emeritus at Yale university and Immediate Past President of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Sadly, because of business here in the Senate, I missed Dr. Pelikan's brilliant luncheon address to the Bicentennial of the Library of Congress on April 24 of this  year. Arriving late, I was overwhelmed by the comments about his speech to the ``Library Legends Luncheon'' and requested a copy of it. The title of this address was: ``Hospital for the Soul.'' 
   Now, I realize why we address those who have received Phd's as ``Doctor''. On behalf of all who have continued to support our Library of Congress, I thank Jaroslav Pelikan for all he has done to earn his ``Living Legend'' Award. Because of this address, I shall never again think of libraries as simply depositories for books. Our great Library of Congress is now the ``World's Hospital for the Soul.''

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I do not want this issue to come up tomorrow at the markup on the defense bill, so I am doing this tonight so there is no misunderstanding. 
   Not long after visiting Joint Interagency Task Force East an learning of the lack of readiness in the maritime patrol aircraft fleet, I made a second trip to Joint Interagency Task Force West and Coast Guard Pacific Area to determine whether this was a nationwide problem, or simply a problem of resource allocation. 
   Unfortunately, what I learned is that the Coast Guard is in dire need of additional maritime patrol aircraft to backfill, supplement, and expand the Coast Guard capability to meet the many defense-related, drug interdiction, maritime enforcement and protection, and other aviation related missions. 
   This amendment, which has been cleared on both sides of the aisle, is a first step toward addressing this glaring deficiency in our operational readiness in Coast Guard maritime patrolling capability. 
   This amendment provides for the acquisition of six C-130J aircraft which will provide a unit size capability and allow the better allocation of all Coast Guard maritime patrol aircraft resources nationwide. 
   I send the amendment to the desk and ask that it be considered as part of the managers' package when it is presented.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I join Senators BOND, KERRY, CAMPBELL, MURKOWSKI, DASCHLE, and BAUCUS, in introducing this bill. I want to focus on a few specific portions of this bill that would be beneficial to Alaska. this bill contains a provision to create a pilot program for small businesses in qualified areas of Alaska. The pilot program contained in this bill would alter the requirements for Alaska small Businesses to quality as HUBZone participants. 
   The current HUBZone Program, as designed by the chairman of the Small Business Committee, Senator BOND, is a good tool for getting contracting dollars into distressed geographic areas and neighborhoods. A HUBZone is an area that is (1) located in a qualified census tract, (2) a qualified ``non-metropolitan county'' that is not located in a metropolitan statistical area, and in which the median household income is less than 80 percent of the non-metropolitan state median household income, or an area that has an unemployment rate that is not less than 140 percent of the statewide average unemployment rate for the state in which the county is located, or (3) lands within the external boundaries of an Indian reservation. The current HUBZone program requires a small business to be located in one of these designated areas while also requiring at least 35 percent of the business' employees to live in a HUBZone. This helps get dollars circulating into areas of the community that have not enjoyed the economic growth of the last 10 years. 
   The Alaska Pilot Program contained in this bill will modify the requirements to allow a small business to qualify as a HUBZone participant if they meet only one of the following conditions: Either (1) they have their principle place of business in a HUBZone, or (2) at least 35 percent of their employees live in a HUBZone, or (3) at least 35 percent of the employees working on a qualified contract perform the work in a HUBZone. Rather than requiring a small business to meet all of the requirements for HUBZone contracts, this Alaska Pilot Program will allow small businesses in Alaska to compete for HUBZone contracts by fulfilling only one of the requirements. This should be beneficial for the communities and neighborhoods who have missed out on growth of the 1990's. In addition, it could mean more jobs for Alaskans and more money circulating into the Alaskan economy. 
   The bill also fixes technical problems that kept Alaska native-owned firms from being able to participate in the HUBZone program. This will allow Alaska native-owned small businesses an opportunity to broaden their business activities in the state while also contributing economically to their local communities and shareholders. 
   I would like to note that in providing benefits to native communities, this bill would not change Indian law, nor the State of Alaska's exclusive jurisdiction over lands in Alaska. 
   I thank the members of the Small Business and Indian Affairs Committees who worked on this issue and for their willingness to take into account the unique circumstances in Alaska. I believe this program will help Alaska's economy to move forwarded and will afford hard working small business owners in Alaska new opportunities.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is an amendment that I have introduced with 27 cosponsors, and we invite other Members to join us. It is an amendment to deal with early learning opportunities of our children. 
   Research shows that children's brains are wired--literally wired--between the ages of birth and 6 years of age. The number of synopses that the brain forms, that is, the connections in the brain, depends upon the level of brain stimulation. The capacity to learn and interact successfully in society is determined even before children begin school. Long-term studies looking at data over 30 years show that children who participate in early learning programs are less likely to require special education, less likely to suffer from mental illness and behavior disorders, less likely to become pregnant before they are married, more likely to graduate from high school and college, less likely to be arrested and incarcerated, have lower recidivism rates if they are incarcerated, less likely to be violent and engaged in child or spousal abuse, and they earn higher salaries when they become adults. Both the General Accounting Office and the Rand Corporation made studies which showed that for each dollar invested in early learning programs, taxpayers saved between $4 and $7 in later years. 
   This amendment provides for block grants to States. States will work with local governments, nonprofit corporations, and even faith-based institutions to determine what is needed most at their own local level. Local entities can use the funds to expand Even Start, the program for children from birth to 3 years of age; expand Head Start to more children, expand it to full day or year-round coverage; offer nursery and preschool programs; train parents and child care professionals in child development, and provide parent training and support programs for stay-at-home moms and dads. 
   The amendment provides set-asides for Indian tribes and Native groups and provides for a small State minimum of 0.4 percent. This amendment has been endorsed now by the Christian Schools International, by Parents United, United Way, some 1,400 local organizations, Fight Crime-Invest In Kids, 700 police chiefs, and the National Association for the Education of Young Children, Children's Defense Fund, Child Care Resource Center, National Black Child Development Institute, and the National Education Association. 
   As a father of six children, I come to this amendment late in my life. I only wish I had had the opportunity to have had this type of information available to me and my wife when we, as a very young, newly married couple, decided to have our family very quickly. We had five children in less than 5 years, and there is a lot we had to learn along the way. 
   This is a bill to try to make America think about what we want to be. We have invested heavily in science, and through the decade of the brain that was stimulated by our late departed friend, David Mahoney, and the group of scientists he put together with Dr. Jim Watson, who worked with him, we now know a lot more about the brain than we did a decade ago. Basically, we learned of the fantastic capability of young people to absorb knowledge and to be stimulated to develop the abilities to absorb even more knowledge as they grow older. I think this is one of the most important things I have been involved in during my life. 
   I believe it is a time for change, a time for us to recognize that young children--little babies--can be stimulated in a way that will assure their capability will be improved to learn and to be good citizens and, in particular, to be able to lead the kind of lives their parents dreamed they would lead. I thank every Member who has cosponsored this amendment, and I hope for its early adoption. 
   I yield the floor.

As a matter of fact, he sort of encouraged me to get involved. I am happy to have been able to get involved. I told him it should have been the Jeffords-Stevens amendment. In his typical Vermont reticence--he is a Yankee as far as I am concerned--he said, no, that I should put in the amendment and be the sponsor. I am proud to do that.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, our Nation has lost one of the great and modest men of our time, David Mahoney. A man who will receive posthumously one of the highest awards the medical community can bestow on a layman--the first Mary Woodard Lasker leadership in Philanthropy Award for ``visionary leadership'' from the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation on May 9. 
   David, through his generosity, with both his time and his money, greatly expanded knowledge about the human brain, neuroscience, and the connection between body and brain which is helping people lead longer, healthier lives. 
   He led us through the ``Decade of the Brain'' and used his extraordinary marketing and public relations skills to foster awareness in Congress and our people of the importance of medical research and brain research in particular. 
   From his humble beginnings in the Bronx, my friend served as an infantry captain in World War II and then attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania while working full time in the mail room of an advertising agency. 
   David's talents did not stay hidden for long; by the time he was 25, he had become the youngest vice president of an advertising agency on Madison Avenue. 
   He went on from there to form his own agency in New York and then  began his climb through the corporate world, first running the good Human Ice Cream Co., and rising to chief operating officer of Norton Simon's various corporate holdings. 
   It was during his stewardship of Norton Simon, Inc., that I first met David. My friend Norton Simon retired as president and CEO of Norton Simon, Inc., in 1969 and selected David Mahoney to be the new leader of his company. 
   He chose David because ``David was inspirational, tough, visionary, and dangerous.'' David expanded the company and helped Norton Simon build the world famous Norton Simon art collection, the greatest personal art collection west of the Mississippi. 
   David wrote a book about his own life in business called Confessions of a Street Smart Manager. David was a wonderful combination of street smarts garnered from growing up in the Bronx, an education from the Wharton School, and the Irish charm that could convince people to share a dream and work to realize its value. 
   Just 2 years ago David authored another book, along with Dr. Richard Restak, ``The Longevity Strategy--How To Live To 100 Using the Brain-Body Connection.'' 
   David once said that ``God gave you intelligence so you could build your intuition about what lies ahead.'' 
   David Mahoney's second career and perhaps most lasting legacy was with the Charles A. Dana Foundation where he served as its chairman since 1977. 
   After leaving Norton Simon, he focused the attention of the Dana Foundation on neuroscience research and helped the world's top neuroscientists and researchers explain the importance of their research to the general public and to funding agencies in the executive branch and the Congress. 
   In 1992, he and Nobel Laureate Dr. James Watson launched the ``Decade of the Brain'' with 10 specific objectives they believed might be achievable by the end of the decade. That effort focused attention better than ever before on understanding the basis for diseases of the brain like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and generated an unprecedented level of support for neuroscience research. 
   David has become widely and justifiably credited as our foremost lay advocate for neuroscience. While David had recently expressed some frustration to me that those 10 ambitious goals had not yet been fully achieved, through his efforts remarkable progress has been made in understanding the human brain and the diseases that afflict it. I know those goals will ultimately be met, and David Mahoney will be forever remembered as the driving force behind this effort. 
   My friend David Mahoney and his wife Hillie have been close friends of ours for many years. David and I celebrated our 75th birthdays, which fell in the same year, and shared many memorable times. Catherine and I will miss his wit and his wisdom and his leadership, but I will continue to enjoy personal memories of our friendship and to be grateful for his legacy of exploration into the workings of the human brain.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library, it is my great pleasure to congratulate the Library of Congress, and Dr. Billington, the Librarian on the occasion of the Library's Bicentennial. The Library is America's oldest Federal cultural institution, and was established on April 24, 1800. It houses the largest and most extensive collection in history, and is one of the nation's assets. Congress is very proud of  the Library, and the role it plays in ensuring free public access to information. As we move forward into the new millennium, efforts are underway to enhance public access to the collections of the Library through the National Digital Library. 
   The Library has planned a wonderful day of activities on Monday, April 24, in honor of Thomas Jefferson's birthday. It was Thomas Jefferson's collection of 6,487 books that first began the Library's collections. The events include the issuance of the first bimetallic commemorative coin, and a postage stamp featuring a color photograph of the interior dome and several of the arched windows in the Jefferson building. At noon there will be a birthday party and concert outside on the East Lawn of the Capitol.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment establishes a priority of funding for early education of children. It has broad bipartisan support. It does not make it mandatory. 
   We now know the stimulus children get at a very early age contributes to the development of their brain and increases the ability of children who receive that stimulus to learn readily. 
   This creates a program for stimulation and sets aside funds for grants to the States. It is not a mandatory program. It will be put in the discretionary level. I do hope the Senate will accept this. My understanding is the managers will accept it.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regret to do this, but my colleague from Delaware is wrong. I was there. President Eisenhower set aside an arctic wildlife range that was open to oil and gas exploration. It was not until 1980 that it was designated an area subject to oil and gas exploration. An environmental impact statement was provided by the Congress. It was not set aside by President Eisenhower or anybody as wilderness yet.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is the first of a series of three amendments that deals with points of order in the budget resolution, as it was reported to the Senate. 
   I have the feeling that this is deja vu because every year we face the same kind of concept. In the current budget resolution, for instance, that we are operating on for this fiscal year, there is, in fact, a point of order against emergency spending that requires 60 votes for emergency spending of a nondefense character. The resolution that was reported to the floor extends that to cover defense spending also. 
   It also has what we call a firewall that covers both budget authority and outlays for defense and nondefense. And it has a series of two other points of order that deal with delayed obligations and advance appropriations. Those make the management of the 13 bills our subcommittees work on annually and the supplemental and emergency bills that we face extremely difficult. 
   We have had a long series of conversations. I told someone I sort of feel like Houdini. Every year, I get a different set of chains and the configuration of the box I am put in before I am  put in the water differs, but everybody expects me to get out of it. I must say to the Senate, before this year is over, you might find some new approaches that help me get out of the chains. But these mechanisms, primarily for enforcement, ought to apply to the Senate as a whole, not only to the Appropriations Committee. 
   In fact, if you examine the rules, as I did early this morning when I got up and started thinking about these amendments, I think you will find it very interesting. We have a series of rules that govern the Senate, and if we ever really followed them, we would not have the trouble that we have once in a while here on the floor. The interesting thing is that those rules do not apply to the appropriations process in most instances because the framers of those rules understood the real complexities of the appropriations process and the fact that we do deal with emergencies and with various extraordinary circumstances in the course of each year's consideration of these 13 bills. 
   We were prepared to offer three amendments to delete these three sections: 208, 210, and 211. I have had long discussions with my good friend, Senator DOMENICI, the manager of the bill, chairman of the Budget Committee, and he has made an offer to us, which I am reluctant to agree to, but I have no alternative because no committee needs the budget resolution more than the Appropriations Committee. The points of order that are in the Budget Act apply to the Senate Appropriations Committee. They don't even apply to the House bill because the House controls its access to the floor and amendments through the rules process. 
   We, therefore, have to negotiate with the Budget Committee to obtain the best possible regime under which to present the appropriations bills for the fiscal year 2001. I am going to yield to my friend. It is my understanding that he will offer an amendment and that the amendment will be debated here. It is my intention, if it is what I believe it to be--as I said, I am reluctantly going to agree to support it, primarily because we need this budget resolution, and also because I have great trust and faith in the chairman of the Budget Committee. He is seeking to get his job done, and I am seeking to be able to do the job that has been assigned to our committee. 
   Mr. President, I yield to my friend to carry on the discussions. He will yield to the Senator from Texas and others. How much time do I have on this amendment?

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, many of us worked very hard last year to reauthorize and update the Satellite Home Viewer Act. 
   Our principle accomplishment was to authorize satellite carriers to provide local television stations to their subscribers. This change has already spurred enormous growth in the satellite industry and is providing growing competition to the cable industry. 
   Unfortunately, the satellite providers--Echostar and DirecTV--made it very clear that their business plans did not contemplate serving rural areas. They were very busy, and they were very upfront in telling us that they were focusing their energies on the top 40 television markets. 
   So it was clear to Senators like myself who represent rural States that local-into-local was not going to be a reality unless we took additional action to encourage coverage for the 50 percent of the population that could watch the service being offered in television ads, but couldn't pick up the phone and order it. 
   We still see a lot of ``not available in Alaska and Hawaii'' fine print on advertisements. 
   They plagued us during telephone days, and now they are plaguing us in this period of rapid extension of new technology. 
   That is where the idea was born to provide loan guarantees to help make this service more available to more Americans. 
   All of us owe Senator CONRAD BURNS a debt of gratitude for pushing this issue so hard and for drafting the measure that was included in last year's  satellite bill. That provision was dropped. 
   While it was unfortunate that this provision was removed from the final bill, I am pleased that it is here today, albeit in another form. 
   It is my hope the Senate will move quickly to adopt this measure and will resist accepting amendments that would threaten its ultimate enactment. 
   I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased the amendment I cosponsored was agreed to. 
   That amendment did three important things. First, it made clear that any plan put forward to provide local broadcast signals to rural areas takes into account service to Alaska and Hawaii. Under my amendment these non-contiguous States are elevated from afterthoughts to priority consideration. 
   We also altered another priority in this bill that could have inadvertently penalized the most rural States. Originally the bill mandated that the cost  per household of providing service be a top priority. 
   Such a provision sounds good on its face but the high cost of service to outlying areas is one reason why the incumbent satellite and cable providers are not serving our areas. My amendment doesn't remove cost as a factor, but it ensures that rural states aren't penalized when proposals are made. 
   Finally, this amendment includes language that would allow high-speed internet access to also be supported by the loan guarantees. 
   I thank Senators BURNS, BAUCUS and LEAHY for their help.

   Mr. STEVENS. I do agree. It was never the intention of those who worked on the broad satellite television reforms in the last session to establish any different copyright or communications rules for loan guarantee applicants, but rather that they be governed by the same rules as all others in the market. If special rules were established for loan guarantee applicants, the loan guarantee program would have collateral effects on the market for subscription television services by causing a confusing disparity in the rules applicable to competitors, and possibly skew competition in unforeseen or inappropriate ways. I agree that it is important to clarify the application of law in this way at that time. I would ask the managers of the bill if they agree with us and will commit to work through conference to the end of ensuring that the rules we adopted last year will continue to apply to applicants and non-applicants alike?

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank both leaders for their kind comments about the honor I will receive on Saturday at home. I have been humbled and confused by the decision of those who voted. Having been in our State now for over the last half of the last century, I have known a great many great people who have contributed to our State during the period of the century. For instance, I refer to my first senior partner, E.B. Collins, of Fairbanks, AK, who came to Alaska before the turn of the last century and was a gold miner in Nome. When he was unsuccessful, he walked from Nome to Fairbanks. That is a good 1,500 miles. He read law in an attorney's office, became an attorney, and by 1913 he was named the Speaker of the first territorial House of Representatives. I worked with him and he gave me great advice in the first days when I went to the State. 
   There are so many others who have been so effective and have done so much for the State that I find it hard to accept the honor. 
   I intend to make a speech, of course, about that when I get home on Saturday, and point out the number of people who have done the work for which I get credit. Many of them are right here in this room. 
   We have been, really, very successful in trying to defend the proposition that once Alaska became a State, it should be an equal among equals in our National Government. It has taken many hours on the floor to ask for and receive the support of the Senate to defend the proposition that a new State is entitled to the same benefits, the same prerogatives, as those States that were in the Union ahead of it. I am but the third Senator who has ever served the State of Alaska. My colleague is the fifth. We are unique in the sense we are still a young State. Our State has been a member of the Union only 9 years longer than I have been in the Senate. 
   It is a distinguished privilege to be here. I am certain this award is being given to me because I am a Member of the Senate and because I am alive and others are not. But I do respect those who made the judgment. I question it, but I respect them, and I do thank my colleagues for what they have done today recognizing that.

   I am still humbled by the award I will receive on Saturday night. But I am warmed by the Senator's comments, and thank him for his comments about this honor I will receive.

   Mr. STEVENS. My good friend, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, is correct. The State of Alaska has been managing wild salmon since statehood more than 40 years ago. In fact, one of the driving forces behind our statehood movement was to gain management control over our resources, particularly the salmon fisheries. I see my friend, the Senator from Kansas, may have a question on fisheries management.

   Mr. STEVENS. The chairman of the Agriculture Committee is correct. Fisheries managers try to ensure that salmon returning to spawn reach their escapement goal, which is the number of spawners needed to return a heathly population of juveniles to the streams and oceans. Historically, managers can accurately estimate how many fish are expected to return based on the lifespan of the salmon and the escapement numbers from previous years. Fisheries managers also track historical trends, which are often linked to long term weather cycles, and their relationship to escapement numbers. The State of Alaska in particular uses in-season  management to ensure its pre-season escapement goals. 
   However, occasionally the fish do not return. For example, chum salmon runs in areas of western Alaska were at all time lows in 1997 and 1998. The low chum runs have had a devastating effect on the western Alaska economy. This exactly the type of crisis that could be alleviated by making crop insurance available to salmon fishermen. Fishermen are the farmers of the sea, and they deserve the same protections we afford to our farmers in the inland states.

   Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, it is with deep regret and personal sorrow that I come to the Senate today to report the death of my good friend Marshall Coyne. He died in his sleep on March 16. He was 89 years old. Marshall became my friend years ago. Actually, it was with former Senator and Ambassador Saxbe that I first met Marshall Coyne. He had served on the symphony board with my wife Ann. The two developed a great friendship. Following her death, he continued to be my friend, and has continued now for many years to be a dear and loyal friend to me and my wife Catherine, our daughter Lily, and our whole family. He was a rare man. 
   First, let me state that in all the time I knew him, he never asked me how I voted, suggested how I should vote, or indicated that he had anything he wanted me to do on this floor. He did ask me for some information once in a while about various things going on in the city, the District, that is. But he was a very different person. 
   We developed such a close friendship that as I chaired Senate delegations going overseas, he would ask me where I was going, and he would show up there. He showed up in Geneva when we were there for the Senate arms control talks with the Soviets--going back that far. He showed up in London when we had the British parliamentary talks with Members of the Senate. And he showed up in Paris when we were there for the Paris Air Show. Marshall was the kind of friend who was always welcome. I never knew any Senator to object to the fact he was there. They all knew he was my friend and that he would come along. 
   We have had such a rare relationship. He had lunch with me every Friday that I was in the District of Columbia, I think, in the last 10 years. He had been to my home either one or two times a month during that whole time when we would be in Washington, DC. 
   He was the kind of friend I think every Senator needs and should have. We fished together. We fished together in Alaska. I remember how surprised he was one time when he saw a bear when we stopped at a stream. He, with my late friend Mike Joy, traveled around Alaska with me many times fishing. We fished off the coast of Costa Rica. We fished in Florida. He discussed his trips with me when I was not able to go. He went to Mongolia once, and he came back very impressed with that place. 
   Of course, our mutual interest was China, where I had served in World War II. He was one of the first Americans to reenter China after President and Mrs. Nixon's historic visit. He personally once a year visited Iceland. Another example of Marshall's interest in international affairs was his support for the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a premier public policy institution dedicated to policy analysis on the world's major geographic regions. 
   He was, I think, a friend to many Members of the Congress and to many members of the military. Mr. Coyne organized the Ambassadors' Round Table at his Madison Hotel here in Washington so that new ambassadors to our country got to meet each other socially. 
   He also organized a series of meetings for former Cabinet members and distinguished military leaders who had reached the top of our military structure so they could come together and share their interests and remember old times together. 
   He said to me once: A person really was not your friend unless he really remembered you after he left office. He developed friendships that I think the memories of will last for a long time. 
   It is a difficult thing for me to think of not having my friend in the Senate dining room with me for years to come. But I want the Senate to know that I think this is one man who contributed a great deal to the friendships of our Senate. 
   Oftentimes he had dinners at his home, at my suggestion, to help bring together some of the Members of the Senate and the House, so we might meet together socially and discuss nonbusiness subjects and get to know one another better. 
   I am hopeful that the District will remember that he was a member of the board that controlled the District of Columbia before the District became independent and elected its own Mayor. Marshall served on the Opera Board at the Kennedy Center and he served on the Boards of both Georgetown and George Washington Universities. He was proud to call himself a Mason. 
   He had a collection of rare manuscripts and books. I will be very interested to see what happens to them. He had signatures he collected of almost every well-known politician, President, and Cabinet officer in the history of the United States. 
   He obviously had a very large Lincoln collection, for he was a great admirer of Lincoln. Since I have been Chairman, when one enters the anteroom of the Senate Appropriations Committee, they will see a bust of Lincoln--it is really a reproduction of a bust of Lincoln that Mr. Coyne gave me--so people might understand the importance of Lincoln to the process we all are pursuing here; that is, equal justice for all. 
   I do hope other Members who have known Mr. Coyne will share their knowledge of his activities with us on the floor. But in any event, Madam President, thank you very much for the privilege of addressing the Senate.

   Mr. STEVENS. For the information of all Senators, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 12:30 p.m. tomorrow. Following the recess for the weekly party caucus luncheons, the Senate will begin consideration of H.R. 5, the Social Security earnings legislation. There will be approximately 4 hours of debate with three amendments in order to the bill. The majority leader has announced that any necessary votes on those amendments will occur on Tuesday afternoon. However, a vote on final passage is expected to occur on Wednesday morning. 
   During the remainder of this week, the Senate may begin consideration of the crop insurance legislation or any other executive or legislative items cleared for action. As a reminder, Senators can expect votes throughout the week of March 27, including March 31, in anticipation of the consideration of the budget resolution.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes at this time to congratulate the majority leader, Chairman JOHN MCCAIN, Senator SLADE GORTON, Representative BUD SHUSTER, and everyone in Congress who has worked so hard to produce a conference report on the FAA. Many of my colleagues have discussed the importance of this bill to our national aviation infrastructure, so I will not repeat now their comments. It is my purpose to remark to the Senate how important this bill is to my State of Alaska. 
   Mr. President, 75 percent of Alaska's communities are accessible only by air. We have enormous needs and, frankly, those needs have often taken a back seat to major metropolitan areas of the lower 48. It is my hope this bill will address some of those inequities, and I congratulate my Congressman, DON YOUNG, for his hard work on this bill. 
   We have 71 unlighted airports in Alaska. In an area where we spend half of our year in darkness, those airports are unlighted. One hundred and fifty airports in my State are less than 3,300 feet in length. More than half of our rural airports are without minimal passenger shelters. You reach the airport, get off the airplane, and there is literally nothing there. One hundred and seventy-six public use airports do not have basic instrument approach capability, and 194 locations in Alaska lack adequate communication, navigation, and surveillance. 
   This bill does not address all of those needs, and I hope to work with the Members of the House and Senate on the Appropriations Committee to fill a few of those gaps. This is a classic case in which some congressional earmarking is appropriate because the national administration too often has  written off Alaska as a priority in matters relating to aviation. 
   I am pleased my colleagues agreed with my proposal to increase the percentage of airport improvement program funds that flow to airports engaged in cargo operations. This modification will bring additional moneys, almost $6 million, to the Anchorage International Airport, which is now the busiest cargo airport in this Nation--Anchorage, AK. 
   It is also encouraging to see the committee once again included my language to allow the Administrator of the FAA to modify regulations to take into account special circumstances in Alaska. Sometimes rules that appear to make sense in the lower 48 simply do not work in our north country. That is why the conference agreed to exempt Alaska from provisions that bar new landfills within 6 miles of an airport. This provision is literally unworkable in Alaska where most of our remote villages are surrounded by Federal refuges and, despite repeated efforts, we are not even allowed to build a road a mile long because of intervention of an alphabet soup type of Federal agency domination. 
   That may sound strong, but it is literally true. 
   Many of you may have heard I was concerned about a provision in the budget treatment section of the final compromise package on the FAA. That is true, and I would like to briefly discuss it. 
   The practical effect of the provision that the House ultimately agreed to delete from this bill would have been to bar any Senate bill or conference report or budget resolution from being considered that did not slavishly adhere to the legislative structure or levels of funding in this bill. Such a provision amounted to an ultimatum to the Senate that presented an unwarranted intrusion into the legislative process. The provision would have given a small number of House Members the ability to completely derail an appropriations conference report, agreed to by the House and the Senate, on completely procedural grounds. 
   This provision could have had severe and damaging unintended consequences. For example, the House insistence on the across-the-board cuts in last year's wrapup bill would have triggered that provision, and the omnibus bill would not have been in order on the floor of the House. 
   The minority party in the House could have used this provision to oppose a transportation appropriations conference report, a supplemental conference report, or an omnibus bill if the guaranteed levels or program structures were modified in any fashion, pursuant to the waiver provisions contained in the law, even if such modification were made at the request of the leadership or of the authorization committees. 
   The bottom line when considering this particular provision is that it is hard to predict the future. Budget constraints, shifting congressional priorities, administration priorities, and other aviation issues that emerge after enactment of a reauthorization bill often require modification of other legislative provisions. The (C)(3) provision that has been deleted failed to provide for such exigencies, and I am pleased the conferees have deleted it. I hope we will not face that proposal again. 
   Beyond that, the budget treatment in the FAA reauthorization bill is challenging for the Appropriations and Budget Committees, but it is manageable. It will necessitate that the Senate and the House make some choices between discretionary priorities, transportation, and other priorities during the consideration of the budget and the funding bills for the year 2001. Above all, it will require the House and the Senate to agree to a budget at levels that will enable us to keep the mandates of the FAA reauthorization bill. 
   This bill adds between $2.1 and $2.7 billion in aviation spending above the fiscal year 2000 levels. I support that. I support spending as much on aviation as we can afford. I am not unmindful of the pressure that this and other guaranteed spending will place on the budget, the Budget Committee, and the appropriations bills. We will have to all work together on these matters. 
   Once again, I thank the members of the conference and my staff, including Steve Cortese, Wally Burnett, Paul Doerrer, Mitch Rose, and my legislative fellow Dan Elwell, for all of their work on this measure over the past year. 
   I yield the floor. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Alaska in introducing this important piece of legislation. As a member of the Senate Finance Committee he is all too aware of the need for equity in our tax system and simplicity in our Tax Code. 
   The first portion of the bill we introduce today would allow fishermen to average income and would not penalize that election with the alternative minimum tax. Up until 1986, individuals, including farmers and fishermen, could elect to average income under section 1301. That choice was no longer available after Congress repealed section 1301 in 1986. Later, in 1997, Congress inserted a new version of section 1301 with a modified form of income averaging for farmers. Section 1301 currently allows farmers engaged in an eligible farming business to average income for tax purposes. This allows farmers to take the fluctuations of their markets, prices and crop conditions into account when calculating income taxes. Fishermen should be afforded the same opportunities as farmers--they are the farmers of the sea and should be treated as such under the Tax Code. 
   A provision similar to this was included in the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 that was vetoed by the President last year. It is not a controversial measure, and its impact on the Treasury is minimal. The Joint Committee on Tax estimated last summer that this provision would cost approximately $5 million over the next ten years. This is a small price to pay to create equity and fairness in our Tax Code and to ensure fishermen receive the same benefits as farmers. While this is one step toward equal treatment for our fishermen, it is an important part of ensuring the long-term sustainability of our fishing industry. 
   The second portion of the bill we introduce today would allow fishermen to establish tax deferred risk management savings accounts to help them through downturns in the market. The Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 included similar language. These new risk management accounts would be used to let fishermen set aside up to 20 percent of their income on a tax deferred basis. The money could be held for up to five years, then it would have to be withdrawn from the individual's account. Once the money is withdrawn from the account, the fishermen would pay tax on the amount that was originally deferred. Any interest earned on the money in the account would be taxed in the year that it was earned. 
   This approach to encouraging fishermen to set some money aside for downturns in the market makes sense. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated last year that allowing fishermen to set aside 20 percent of their income into these tax deferred accounts would cost only $18 million over 10 years. This is a small price to pay to encourage fishermen to be pro-active in planning for downturns rather than having to be reactive when markets collapse or fishing stocks are weak. 
   In previous years we have had to bail out fishing areas that have been hit hard by fishery failures. A recent fishery failure in Alaska, and the impact of that failure on families and communities, is still being felt today. We were forced to allocate $50 million to bail out those fishermen and the local communities. This provision, at a cost of $18 million over ten years, is a far-sighted way to let fishermen play a part in a disaster recovery and preserve the proud self-reliance that marks their industry. 
   I thank my colleague from Alaska, Senator MURKOWSKI, for his support of this bill and I encourage all Senators to support these provisions.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, later today I will join Senators IONUYE, WARNER and LEVIN in hosting a reception to bid farewell to Joe and Dede Ralston, as General Ralston concludes his second tour as Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. 
   Happily, this event does not signify General Ralston's retirement, but his advancement to the position of Supreme Allied Commander Europe, in charge of all NATO forces, and all U.S. Forces stationed in Europe. 
   Joe Ralston has pursued a career of firsts, and breakthrough leadership success. His assignment as the first Air Force officer to command NATO is typical, and indicative, of his tremendous talents, and force of personality. 
   Remarkably, Joe Ralston has achieved success in several distinct military disciplines over his career, spanning more than 34 years. 
   Joe Ralton's military career is founded in his experience as a combat and command pilot during the Vietnam war. During two combat tours, in F-105 fighters and F-105 wild weasel jets, Joe honed his warfighting skills. 
   In the 1980's and early 1990's General Ralston played a key role in the technological revolution in air warfare. While many of these programs are still very sensitive, the direct impact of General Ralston's service in technology development and acquisition played a prominent role in our victories in Desert Storm and Kosovo. 
   Moving into more senior leadership positions, General Ralston contributed to reorganization of the Air Force during his tenure as commander of the 11th Air Force, Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff of Plans and Operations and Commander of the Air Combat Command. 
   Most recently, General Ralston served with great distinction as Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. 
   Over these past four years, General Ralston has left and indelible mark on our nation's military, now, and for many years ahead. 
   An architect of the 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review, General Ralston helped shape the force structure and training doctrine now followed by our Nation's Armed Forces. 
   The modernization plan presented in the QDR has moved us forward on recaptilizing our air and naval forces, and achieving Secretary Cohen's goal of $60 billion for procurement for FY 2001. 
   These accomplishments proceeded during a period of overseas military activity across the globe unmatched since the end of the Second World War. 
   My colleagues here recognize that I have not always supported this administration's policies in the deployment of U.S. Forces overseas. 
   Regardless of how and why those deployments commenced, the performance and success of the U.S. military in these assignments reflects the leadership that General Ralston and all the Joint Chiefs have provided. 
   Looking ahead, to the continued opportunity for service General Ralston has accepted in moving to the Supreme Allied Commander job, this will be his toughest challenge. 
   General Ralston proceeds to Brussels following another great American Commander, General Wes Clark. 
   Having visited General Clark many times at his headquarters, and in the Balkans, there is no question that he provided the glue that held the alliance together in Bosnia and Kosovo. 
   General Clark did so facing limitations unlike those encountered by any previous alliance commander. He merits our accolades. 
   General Ralston succeeds General Clark in an era where our allies must decide the nature of their military forces in the future, and the role of Europe, compared to NATO, in future security matters. 
   To me, there is no officer in the U.S. military today better prepared, by experience or temperament, to accept this challenge. 
   While that is a strong claim, I make this comment to the Senate based on my personal experience in watching General Ralston command. 
   Catherine and I have known Joe and Dede Ralston since 1992, when they arrived in Alaska to take on the responsibility of commanding all U.S. military forces in my State. 
   Joe immediately established himself as not just a military commander, but a real Alaskan. 
   In fact, as Joe and Dede saw the close of this assignment as Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs approaching, they made plans to establish a home in Alaska--coming home as neighbors. 
   While disappointed that we cannot look forward to their imminent return to Alaska, I join all Alaskans in congratulating General Ralston on the successful conclusion of his tenure as  Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and wishing him well as he proceeds to this next position of military and diplomatic responsibility. 
   I am confident that I can also speak for my colleagues here in the Senate in that wish, and commitment to work with General Ralston to meet the needs of our own military forces in Europe, and foster continued close ties with NATO. 
   Let me also take one moment to welcome General Ralston's successor as Vice Chairman, General Dick Myers. 
   Senator INOUYE and I enjoyed a close relationship with General Myers during his tenure as commander of the Pacific Air Forces, which included units in our States of Alaska and Hawaii. 
   Most recently, General Myers served as Commander in Chief of the U.S. Space Command. I know he will bring the same skills and judgment to this position that he demonstrated in these earlier assignments. 
   All Senators are invited to the reception at 5 p.m. this afternoon in S-128, in honor of the conclusion of General Ralston's tenure as Vice Chairman. 
   Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to take just a few minutes to express why so many of us are sad to see Joe and Dede leave Washington, but proud of their service, and the new challenges they will assume on behalf of our Nation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am here because I am deeply saddened to report to the Senate a very serious loss, as far as the country is concerned and a real sad loss for myself personally. I was saddened last night when my wife and I received a call about the loss of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 on a flight from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco. 
   Eighty-eight people were on board that plane, many of them apparently employees or relatives or friends of employees of that airline. While the search continues, we have been told now that no survivors have been found. My thoughts and prayers and I hope all of our thoughts and prayers are with the families of these people who have perished. 
   Among those on the plane were at least five Alaskans. We think there were more. One was one of my very close and dear friends, Morris Thompson--we called him Morrie--his wife Thelma and their daughter Cheryl. 
   Morrie Thompson has been a respected leader of the Native community of our State and a businessman. Just last fall, he retired as the chief executive officer of Doyon Limited, which is one of 12 regional corporations for our Alaska Native people. Because of Senate business, I was unable to attend that retirement dinner in Fairbanks, but my granddaughter Sara went as my representative. 
   Morrie had a tremendous background. He was not only a great leader for the Native people of Alaska, but he was a leader in his own right nationally. He was a member of the University of Alaska's Board of Regents. He served as president of the Alaska Federation of Natives. During the Nixon 
   administration, he was the Commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs for our Nation in Washington, DC, and a special assistant to the Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs in the Department of the Interior. He was president of the Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce and in 1997 was named Business Leader of the Year by the University of Alaska. 
   He is going to be remembered for his work on the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, landmark legislation in 1971, which was a tremendous economic boost for our Native people. His greatest legacy will be among the young people of our State who have benefited from Morris Thompson's fellowship program and the Doyon Foundation, which he created to subsidize tuition for Native students in Alaska. 
   My heart goes out to the Thompsons' surviving daughters, Nicole and Allison, and to all the members of their family. Morrie has not just been a political friend or a business friend. We have joined one another in each other's homes for dinner and raised our children together in a way.  
   There are many families, I am sure, mourning over this terrible tragedy. Also on that plane was the son of a former State legislator, Margaret Branson. Her son Malcolm and his fiancee Janice Stokes, both of Ketchikan, were returning from a vacation in Mexico. 
   I have this report for the Senate. I have been in touch with Jim Hall of the National Transportation Safety Board and the Secretary of Transportation, Secretary Slater. It is my intention to go to California on Thursday to meet with NTSB officials in Oxnard and the Coast Guard officials in Port Hueneme, CA, concerning the crash. 
   I say to the Senate that Alaska Airlines has an exemplary safety record. In my State, their pilots and planes fly in the most challenging terrain and weather of our whole Nation, if not the world. This is a great tragedy for that small airline and for our State. 
   My thoughts are with those people who are involved in trying to make certain the airline continues and their personal families of that airline who are affected by this tragedy are cared for as well as the relatives of people who have lost their lives. 
   I thank my colleagues very much for their courtesy in allowing me to make this report to the Senate.

   Mr. STEVENS. The Majority Leader is correct. In providing for the first of these ships to be built, we understood that the public will benefit from free and unrestricted competition on this vessel. The demands placed on our fishery management system dictate that  we procure the most technically sophisticated ship possible from our U.S. shipbuilding industry. The only way to guarantee this result is to conduct a free and open competition among all U.S. shipbuilders and meet with Dr. Baker, the Director of NOAA, who has agreed to homeport this vessel in Kodiak. By locating it mid way between the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea, it will have ready access to the Nation's two largest fisheries.

   Mr. STEVENS. I can say unequivocally that your understanding is correct. We all know that plans and operations are often revised by the applicant before being finally approved. Indeed, some revisions are required by the BLM or Forest Service during the plan review process. It is the clear intent of the language to protect revisions made prior to the plan's final approval. It is the operation, not a specific property position (whether mining claims or mill sites), that is protected. Anything less would be grossly inequitable and directly contrary to the clear intent of the conference.

Applying the opinion to these existing operations through the back door of a plan amendment would undermine the entire provision and make it meaningless. Anybody who knows the mining industry knows that plan amendments are routine. We want operators to be able to amend their plans when necessary to make them better. The provision covers such amendments, and protects them from the legal interpretation contained in the Solicitor's opinion.

   As the Senator knows, the C-Band industry is declining and the conferees correctly exempted existing C-Band consumers from numerous provisions in this bill at my request. It is my understanding the conferees sought to exempt the C-Band industry from the program exclusivity rules that we are applying in the satellite bill. Complying with the program exclusivity rules would be technically and economically unreasonable for the C-Band industry and would only deprive C-Band consumers with some of their favorite programming.

The Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Washington will remember that I asked that the language in the conference report be inserted last year. I, too, am concerned that no action has taken place. It is my intent, as chairman of this committee, that the training called for in last year's conference report take place, and that the program led by Alaska Pacific University, in conjunction with two of the closest law schools in Washington and Oregon, take place. There are sufficient funds in the training budgets of the several Interior agencies to make this happen, and I believe it should happen in conjunction with the outside resources who are developing this curriculum. While I participated in the program held in Washington, DC, on this issue, I would hope that a greater effort is put forth in the future.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, during the last month of negotiations on the FY00 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations conference report, there has been much discussion between the Alaska delegation and Commerce Department officials regarding where to homeport the Rainier. The Rainier is one of four hydrographic survey vessels currently homeported in Seattle. However, the Rainier spends nearly all of its time performing hydrographic surveys in Southeast Alaska, where the need for hydrographic surveys is great. Substantial amounts of time and money are wasted every time the Rainier transits the 650 miles between Seattle and Southeast Alaska. 
   Alaska has more than half of the United States' coastline, and no State is more dependent on marine transportation. Nonetheless, most of southeast Alaska lacks adequate hydrographic surveys. In fact, more than half of NOAA's critical backlog of survey areas is in Alaska. Much of that backlog is in southeast Alaska, where three cruise ships ran aground this summer. These ships ran aground in critical backlog areas and other areas that are literally not on the map. New coastline opens up every time a receding glacier creates a new inlet, giving vessels access to totally uncharted waters. 
   Chairman YOUNG of the House Resources Committee met personally with Commerce Secretary Daley on this issue recently. The Secretary agreed that Alaska was an appropriate home for the Rainier. The city of Ketchikan has offered to make space available for the Rainier and to provide $300,000 cash to offset the one-time cost of the move. Moving this vessel to Ketchikan makes good fiscal sense and good policy sense. I urge the Secretary to relocate the Rainier to Ketchikan at once.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I would like to explain the provisions relating to Pacific salmon and the Pacific Salmon Treaty included in the conference report for the fiscal year 2000 Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations bill. The conference report provides funding to implement the 1999 Pacific Salmon Treaty Agreement between the United States and Canada and for Pacific coastal salmon recovery efforts in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California. Section 623 of the conference report authorizes this funding and addresses other issues which are critical to the success of the 1999 Pacific Salmon Treaty Agreement. 
   Section 623(a) establishes the Northern Boundary and Transboundary Rivers Restoration and Enhancement Fund and the Southern Boundary Restoration and Enhancement Fund. The 1999 Agreement requires the United States to capitalize these two funds at $75,000,000 and $65,000,000, respectively, over the next 4 years. Interest earned from these funds will be spent each year to develop better information to support resource management, to rehabilitate and restore marine and freshwater habitat, and to enhance wild stock production. This investment will complement a C$400,000,000 Canadian investment in habitat restoration and license buyback programs. 
   Each fund will be managed by a bilateral committee of three United States and three Canadian representatives. Appropriately, the three United States representatives on the Northern Fund Committee are Alaskans: Alaska's Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner to the Pacific Salmon Commission and the Regional Administrator of the Alaska Region of the National Marine Fisheries Service. Likewise, the three United States representatives on the Southern Fund Committee are from the Lower 48: one representative of the States of Washington and Oregon; one representative of the treaty Indian tribes; and the Regional Administrator of the Northwest Region of the National Marine Fisheries Service. I expect that the Northern Fund Committee will consult with the Northern Panel of the Pacific Salmon Commission on funding proposals prior to making its decisions. Likewise, the Southern Fund Committee should consult with the Southern Panel. 
   Section 623(b) implements the 1999 Agreement by addressing several conditions to that agreement. First, it provides that the $20,000,000 appropriated to capitalize the Northern Fund and the Southern Fund will not be made available until two events occur. First, the parties to the Boldt-related litigation must be sign and file stipulations staying that litigation for the duration of the 1999 Agreement. Second, the Secretary of Commerce must determine that the conduct of Alaska's fisheries under the 1999 Agreement, without further clarification or modification of the management regimes contained in the 1999 Agreement, do not cause jeopardy to salmon species listed under the Endangered Species Act. If the Secretary of Commerce requires alterations, modifications, or any other changes to the fishery management regimes contained in the Treaty, this condition is not satisfied. 
   The 1999 Agreement is expressly conditioned on both of these requirements being met. The document titled ``Understanding of United States Negotiators,'' signed June 22, 1999, by eight United States negotiators, describes the stipulations to be filed, extended, or otherwise addressed for the duration of the 1999 Agreement. Similarly, the transmittal letter which accompanied the 1999 Agreement, signed June 23, 1999 by the Chief Negotiators for the United States and Canada, states that the 1999 agreement is conditioned on whether the conduct of Alaska's fisheries under the Treaty violates the Endangered Species Act. It is important to note that Congress has every reason to believe Alaska's fisheries do not cause jeopardy to listed salmon stocks. Alaska's fisheries operated under a ``no jeopardy'' finding before our fishermen gave up 25 percent of their Chinook catch in order to get a deal on the 1999 Agreement. To address process concerns, this subsection requires the parties to request that the court enter the stipulations before the end of the year, and that the court enter the stipulations by March 1, 2000. 
   Sections 623(b)(3) and 623(b)(4) specify conditions under which the Secretary of Commerce may ``initiate or reinitiate'' consultation on Alaska Fisheries under the Endangered Species Act. Subsections (b)(3) and (b)(4) address any consultation on Alaska fisheries which is commenced after the initial consultation required in subsection (b)(1). By using the words ``initiate or  reinitiate,'' Congress has addressed both those species which are currently listed under the Endangered Species Act as well as any species listed under ESA in the future. Therefore, before the Secretary of Commerce may initiate consultation on any listed species, including any species listed after this Act has passed, and before the Secretary may reinitiate a previously 
   conducted consultation, the conditions in subsections (b)(3) and (b)(4) of section 623 must be met. 
   Section 623(b)(3) requires the Secretary of Commerce to issue a jeopardy determination on Southern United States fisheries before he may initiate or reinitiate consultation on Alaska fisheries. Section 623(b) defines Southern United States fisheries as the directed Pacific salmon fisheries in Washington, Oregon, and the Snake River basin of Idaho that are subject to the Pacific Salmon Treaty. Subsection (b)(3) will also require the Secretary to develop the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) data or other escapement data necessary to make such a determination. The Secretary should work with the Pacific Salmon Commission to develop this information. 
   Section 623(b)(4) requires the Secretary of Commerce to provide the Pacific Salmon Commission a reasonable opportunity to implement the 1999 Agreement including, if necessary, the weak stock provisions in the 1999 Agreement, and to make a determination that the 1999 Agreement will not meet MSY goals before he may initiate or reinitiate consultation on Alaska fisheries under ESA. The phrase ``reasonable opportunity'' is intended to provide sufficient time for the 1999 Agreement to work. If the Pacific Salmon Commission implements the weak stock provisions, the phrase ``reasonable opportunity'' is intended to provide sufficient time for the weak stock provisions to work as well. A reasonable opportunity will encompass several life cycles of the salmon under consideration. 
   Subsection (b)(4) purposefully adopts the recovery standard contained in the Pacific Salmon Treaty. This standard requires that the weak stock provisions return escapements as expeditiously as possible to maximum sustainable yield or other biologically-based escapement objectives agreed to by the Pacific Salmon Commission. This subsection recognizes that conservation is the foremost tenet of the Pacific Salmon Treaty. The Treaty also recognizes the importance of the salmon fisheries to the social, cultural, and economic well-being of the West Coast. Therefore, the Treaty seeks to satisfy its conservation objective with minimum disruption to the commercial, tribal, and sport fisheries. Recognizing these, objectives, the determination of whether escapement objectives have been met as expeditiously as possible must be made over a reasonable period of time, likely encompassing several life cycles of the salmon species under consideration. 
   The most important feature of this law is that it requires the Secretary to delay the enforcement of the Endangered Species Act until the Pacific Salmon Commission has an opportunity to implement the Treaty and, if necessary, the weak stock provisions of the Treaty. This later-enacted law relieves the Secretary of his duty to apply the Endangered Species Act during the time the Commission is implementing the Treaty and the weak stock provisions. This is important because the Commission is better able to recover weak stocks using the Treaty than is the Secretary using the Endangered Species Act. The Commission can require harvest restrictions in Canada, where up to half of the coastwide Chinook harvest is caught. Unlike the Pacific Salmon Treaty, the Endangered Species Act does not apply in Canada. Subsection (b)(4) recognizes the important role the Pacific Salmon Commission should play in the recovery of weak stocks by ensuring that the Commission has the opportunity to fully implement the weak stock provisions of the Pacific Salmon Treaty. 
   Section 623(c) makes needed changes to the voting structure of the Pacific Salmon Commission. The Pacific Salmon Treaty Act of 1985 required the three voting United States Commissioners to reach unanimous agreement before making a decision on behalf of the United States. This requirement was put in place without knowing how disruptive it would prove to subsequent negotiations. In practice, it has allowed Canadian negotiators to leverage northern and southern U.S. interest against each other. Subsection (c) prevents this unintended consequence by providing that the southern U.S. interests represent the United States on southern fisheries and Alaska represents the United States on northern fisheries. In fact, the 1999 Agreement itself did not take shape until Alaska and Canada were able to negotiate northern fisheries issues without interference from southern interests. Chinook salmon, which can migrate through northern and southern jurisdictions, are exempt from this provision. 
   Section 623(d) authorizes $20,000,000 total to capitalize the Northern Fund and the Southern Fund. To meet a condition of the 1999 Agreement, these amounts will not be released until stipulations have been signed and court orders requested in certain litigation involving the application of tribal fishing rights. Subsection (d) also authorizes $58,000,000 for salmon recovery efforts in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California. Amounts appropriated to the four States are subject to a 25 percent non-federal match requirement. States may meet this requirement with cash or other in-kind contributions supported by existing state funding. 
   I understand Washington State and Oregon will use their shares of this funding to address the significant habitat issues they face in those States. Alaska has neither enjoyed the benefits nor suffered the consequence of extensive development inside its borders, although some would say that we have suffered the consequences of development elsewhere through the harvest restrictions our fishermen have endured over the years. I expect that in addition to habitat restoration, Alaska will participate in other programs consistent with Treaty implementation, such as marketing initiatives. Alaska also has the authority to participate in salmon initiatives in other States and on tribal, lands. Many of the tribes will likely use their funding to participate in demonstration projects on supplementation including the use of Mitchell Act hatcheries to increase production of wild stocks. A close analysis of NMFS's artificial propagation policy may lead to different policies which help meet the recovery goals outlined in the Pacific Salmon Treaty. I look forward to the results of the States and tribal efforts.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have some comments on issues raised by the conference report to the Interior appropriations bill. 
   On the matter of contract support costs for Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service programs operated by native organizations under the provisions of P.L. 93-638, I am pleased that we have been able to add $10 million to BIA funding and $25 million to IHS funding over fiscal year 1999 levels to support additional payments of contract support costs for these programs. This new funding will allow BIA and IHS to bring existing programs' contract support cost payments closer to the full amount of negotiated support and will allow a limited number of new and expanded programs in both agencies to go forward. 
   However, I am concerned that the tribes have been operating, in the distribution of contract support costs, under the assumption that contract support costs are an entitlement under the law. The House and Senate committees on appropriations have taken exception to that interpretation and have tried to persuade the IHS to change its allocation methodology and to set reasonable limits on the number and size of new and expanded contracts it executes consonant with resources made available by Congress for the payment of contract support costs. The Federal circuit's court of appeals in its October 27, 1999 decision in Babbitt v. Oglala Sioux Tribal Public Safety Department (1999 WL 974155 (Fed. Cir.)) has now affirmed that contract support costs are not an entitlement, but rather are subject to appropriations. Contract support cases raising similar legal issues are pending in the 10th circuit court of appeals and in various Federal district courts around the country. The Federal circuit's decision was correct both in its holding and in its reasoning and should serve as precedent for other pending cases. To assume that Congress would create a system in which tribes receive the majority of their contract support costs through funds appropriated to the Indian Health Service or Bureau of Indian Affairs and which requires tribes to seek the balance in court through the claims and judgment fund turns logic on its ear. ``Subject to appropriations'' means what it says. 
   The Indian Health Service has made improvements to its distribution methodology in fiscal year 1999 but continues to distribute funds at varying rates for different contracts, compacts and annual funding agreements. More disturbing, the current IHS system pays contractors with high overhead costs (relative to program costs) at the same percentage rate as it pays contractors with low overhead rates, rewarding inefficient operators and creating an incentive to maximize 
   overhead costs.  
   The bill allows the funding in FY 2000 of a limited number of new and expanded contracts through the Indian Self Determination (ISD) Fund of $10 million. It is expected that, once the contract support cost total (paid at an average rate not to fall above or below the average rate of payment of contract support costs to existing contractors in FY 2000) for new and expanded programs has reached $10 million, IHS will not execute any further new or expanded contracts until Congress has provided funds specifically earmarked for that purpose. Existing IHS policy does not permit reduction of existing service providers' funding in order to fund new entrants into the system. This bill does not modify that policy. If funds remain in the ISD fund after all new entrants have been accommodated, those funds should be distributed equitably across existing programs, with particular emphasis on the most underfunded. 
   The Indian Health Service should include as part of its FY 2001 budget request a detailed cost estimate for new and expanded contracts so that Congress will be aware of anticipated need when it establishes a funding level for an ISD account in FY 2001. Congress and the courts have made it plain that IHS can no longer enter into new and expanded contracts without regard to the level of funding provided for that purpose by Congress. Congress will be aided in its efforts to establish a reasonable level of support for new and expanded contracts if the IHS provides accurate estimates of anticipated need as part of the budget process. 
   The authorizing committees in the Senate and House are encouraged, in consultation with the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and tribal organizations, to develop timely proposals to address the longer term issues surrounding contract support costs, including the apparent contradiction between the self-determination principles laid out in P.L. 93-638 and the legal requirement that contract support costs are ``subject to appropriations.'' 
   Our committees encourage the transition of employees from Federal to tribal employment as part of self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts and strongly believe that the IHS should not provide disincentives for such transfers. We have noted that each year start-up costs from new and expanded contracts for the previous year are returned to the base for distribution to other contracts. These funds, currently estimated at $4.5 million, will be available in FY 2000. With my support, the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations will soon be sending a letter to the IHS requesting that it set aside a portion of base contract support funds associated with 
   prior year start up costs for use as a transition fund for costs associated with employees who elect to transfer from Federal employment to tribal employment during the period after which contract support costs for individual contracts have been determined for that year. To the extent set aside funds are not needed for employee transition, they should be distributed equitably among existing contractors, with emphasis on the most underfunded contracts. 
   In the last fiscal year and the one we are funding now, we will have added a total of $60 million in new contract support cost funding to the IHS budget. We know that these funds are critical to the success of Indian-operated health programs and that shortfalls still remain. However, in the current environment of caps on discretionary spending, we must develop policies that support the self-determination principles embodied in P.L. 93-638 while taking into account the fiscal realities of limits on funding for these programs. I look forward to receiving recommendations from the authorizing committees, the IHS and BIA, and tribal organizations which will address these issues in time for the committees' consideration during the FY 2001 appropriations cycle. 
   The conference report also includes a provision to authorize the investment of Exxon Valdez oil spill--or EVOS--settlement funds outside of the Treasury. This section is the exact language of legislation, S. 711, reported by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee earlier this year, and represents an accord struck among many interests. The details of this accord are discussed more fully in the committee report (Senate Rpt. 106-124) accompanying S. 711. These interests include Koniag, a native regional corporation with a great interests in seeing that their native lands are valued at the level they feel appropriate given their prominence in the oil spill zone. 
   The continuing availability of EVOS funds for habitat conservation raises another important issue I hope can be resolved in the coming months. It regards revenue sharing payments arising from oil spill area acquisitions. New additions to refuge lands, such as those from EVOS settlement land acquisitions, qualify adjacent communities to increased federal payments in lieu of taxes under the Revenue Sharing Act of 1935. 
   In 1995, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agreed to purchase from Old Harbor, Akiok-Kaguyak and Koniag Native Corporations over 160,000 acres of land within the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge. These lands were acquired using funds derived from the consent decree in settling 
   the United States' and State of Alaska's civil claims against Exxon, Inc. for damages caused by the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989. 
   The Exxon Valdez Trustee Council, which was formed to implement the consent decree, adopted its restoration plan in 1994 with habitat protection as a key component of the plan to recover the damages caused by the oil spill. The trustee council subsequently solicited interest from land owners throughout the spill zone and ranked the habitat based on its restoration value for the species and services injured by the spill. The council, working through State and Federal land managing agencies, commissioned land appraisals and authorized negotiations with land owners. 
   Negotiated agreements with land owners, resulting in significant habitat acquisitions, exceeded the appraisals approved by Federal and State appraisers. The trustee council in its resolutions authorizing these acquisitions with settlement funds made several findings, I'm advised that these findings included the following: 
   ``Biologists, scientists and other resource specialists agree that, in their best professional judgment, protection of habitat in the spill area to levels above and beyond that provided by existing laws and regulations will likely have a beneficial effect on recovery of injured resources and lost or diminished services provided by these resources.'' 
   ``There has been widespread public support for the acquisition of these lands, locally, within the spill zone and nationally.'' 
   ``It is ordinarily the Federal Government's practice to pay fair market value for the lands it acquires. However, due to the unique circumstances of this proposed acquisition, including the land's exceptional habitat for purposes of promoting recovery of natural resources injured by EVOS and the need to acquire it promptly to prevent degradation of the habitat, the trustee council believes it is appropriate in this case to pay more than fair market value for these particular parcels.'' 
   ``This offer is a reasonable price given the significant natural resource and service values protected; the scope and pervasiveness of the EVOS environmental disaster and the need for protection of ecosystems .....'' 
   The trustee council-commissioned appraisals--which were performed in accordance with Federal regulations--for the three large parcels acquired within Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge are estimates of fair 
   market value. However, they varied substantially from the landowners' appraisals and what they believed to be their fair market value. The landowners rejected the initial offers made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to purchase the lands based on the trustee council's commissioned appraisals. 
   The estimates of fair market value based on the Federal appraisals are below the prices actually paid for the various parcels of land, and they do not consider the purchase price paid in these and other governmental acquisitions in Alaska. The trustee council, through its public process, difficult negotiations and subsequent findings determined that the price paid for the lands was a ``reasonable price'' for a variety of reasons including past Federal large scale acquisitions.  
   The acquisition in fee of these three large parcels within Kodiak NWR now requires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make payments in lieu of taxes to the Kodiak Island borough in accordance with the Revenue Sharing Act of 1935. The act directs the agency to make such payments based on the fair market value of acquired lands. 
   The service is currently using the federally approved appraisals estimating fair market value of these three large parcels as the basis for computing the revenue sharing payment to the borough. The borough has rightly challenged the service's determination of fair market value based on the unique circumstances of these acquisitions and the findings made by the trustee council in approving funds for these acquisitions. 
   A plain reading of the Revenue Sharing Act (which authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to make refuge revenue sharing payments) requires that the determinations of fair market value be made in a manner that ``the Secretary considers to be equitable and in the public interest.'' Clearly, the public interest associated with these unique acquisitions has been well documented in the findings of the trustee council. 
   The Revenue Sharing Act imposes no legal impediment for the Secretary to make a determination of fair market value that incorporates the unique circumstances of these acquisitions and the specific findings and actions taken by the trustee council. Thus, I urge the Secretary to review the Kodiak Island borough's appeal to the service's determinations for making revenue sharing payments and do what is fair and equitable as called for by the act. 
   These are unique circumstances that exist nowhere else in the United 
   States and are limited in Alaska to lands acquired in the Exxon Valdez spill zone with settlement funds. Thus, there should be no consequences for how revenue sharing payments are computed for service acquired lands in other parts of Alaska or throughout the rest of the country. 
   At this opportunity, upon the passage of another year's funding for the Federal and Indian lands management agencies, I must call to the attention of my colleagues and to the attention of the President of the United States, an issue that troubles me deeply. Over the years, our Government has made commitments to native Americans which it has not kept. Many Americans thought that practice ended with the new, more enlightened self-determination approach to Indian policy. But as one of Alaska's representatives in the Senate, members of the President's staff made personal promises to me just last fall on behalf of the native people of the Chugach region which have not been kept. 
   In 1971 Congress passed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). The act cleared the way for Alaska native people, including the Chugach natives, to receive title to a small portion of their traditional lands as settlement of their aboriginal land claims. The act also cleared the way for the additional millions of acres to our national parks, wildlife refuges, forests, and wilderness areas. Allowing native people to develop their lands freed them from economic bondage to the Federal Government. No longer would they have to depend exclusively on the benevolence of the Federal Government for hand-outs. They could create their own jobs, generate their own income, and determine their own destiny. But only if they had access to their lands. 
   Both the administration and the Congress recognized the lands would be virtually valueless if there was no way to get to them. The Claims Act recognized that native lands were to be used for both traditional and economic development purposes. Alaska natives were guaranteed a right of access, under law, to their lands across the vast new parks, refuges, and forests that would be created. 
   In 1971 and again in 1982, under the terms of the Chugach Native Inc. settlement agreement, the Federal Government made a solemn vow to ensure the Chugach people had access to their aboriginal lands. Now, a quarter of a century later, that commitment has not been fulfilled. Many of the native leaders who worked with me to achieve the landmark Native Land Claims Settlement Act have died after waiting for decades without seeing that promise honored. Last year, Congressman DON YOUNG, chairman of the House Resources Committee, added a provision to the House Interior appropriations bill 
   that required, by a date certain, the Federal Government to live up to the access promises it made to the Chugach natives decades ago. In the conference last fall on the omnibus appropriations bill, the administration spoke passionately and repeatedly against the provision. 
   Why? They fully admitted the obligation to grant an access easement exists. They acknowledged further that access delayed is access denied and that further delays were harmful to the Chugach people. They opposed the provision on the grounds that it was not necessary since they were going to move with all due haste to finalize the easement before the end of 1998. Katie McGinty, then head of the President's Council on Environmental Quality sat across from me, looked me in the eye, and promised me they would fulfill this long overdue promise before the end of the year. 
   She even offered to issue a ``Presidential proclamation'' promising once again to do what had already been promised and promised and promised. My staff worked with OMB on the content of such a proclamation, but I told them it would not be necessary. I would take her at her word and believed the administration would live up to the personal commitment she made to me. 
   Here we are a year later. Chugach still has not received its easement. Ms. McGinty is gone, but her commitment on behalf of this administration remains. It is now the responsibility of others to ensure the promises she made to me and to Alaska's native people are kept. 
   Congressman YOUNG's House resources Committee has reported a bill, H.R. 2547, to address this issue legislatively, in the hope of forcing the administration to do what it has promised to do. Senator MURKOWSKI has been tireless in his efforts to get the Federal Government to live up to the promises made to Alaskans concerning access to our State and native lands. I support those efforts. 
   But I take the time today to say clearly to this administration that the promises made by our Government to the Chugach people for access to their lands--and to me personally as their representative--must be honored. Make no mistake, if the promises made to me by officials in this administration last fall are not lived up to soon, if they oppose the efforts of Congressman YOUNG and Senator MURKOWSKI on this issue, if they continue to obfuscate and ``slow roll'' this commitment, it will be clear to all that his administration does not perceive the true meaning of Robert Service's memorable phrase: ``A promise made is a debt unpaid!''

   These are unique circumstances that exist nowhere else in the United States and are limited to Alaska to lands acquired in the Exxon Valdez spill zone with settlement funds. Thus, there should be no consequences for how revenue sharing payments are computed for service acquired lands in other parts of Alaska or throughout the rest of the country. 
   At this opportunity, upon the passage of another year's funding for the Federal and Indian land management agencies, I must call to the attention of my colleagues and to the attention of the President of the United States, an issue that troubles me deeply. Over the years, our Government has made commitments to Native Americans which it has not kept. Many Americans thought that practice ended with the new, more enlightened self-determination approach to Indian policy. But as one of Alaska's Representatives in the Senate, members of the President's staff made personal promises to me just last fall on behalf of the Native people of the Chugach region which have not been kept. 
   In 1971 Congress passed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). The act cleared the way for Alaska Native people, including the Chugach Natives, to receive title to a small portion of their traditional lands as settlement of their aboriginal land claims. The act also cleared the way for the addition of millions of acres to our national parks, wildlife refuges forests, and wilderness areas. Allowing Native people to develop their lands freed them from economic bondage to the Federal Government. No longer would they have to depend exclusively on the benevolence of the Federal Government for hand-outs. They could create their own jobs, generate their own income, and determine their own destiny. But only if they had access to their lands. 
   Both the administration and the Congress recognized the lands would be virtually valueless if there was no way to get to them. The Claims Act recognized that Native lands were to be used for both traditional and economic development purposes. Alaska Natives were guaranteed a right of access, under law, to their lands across the vast new parks, refuges, and forests that would be created. 
   In 1971 and again in 1982, under the terms of the Chugach Native Inc. settlement agreement, the Federal Government made a solemn vow to ensure the Chugach people had access to their aboriginal lands. Now a quarter of a century later, that commitment has not been fulfilled. Many of the Native leaders who worked with me to achieve the landmark Native Land Claims Settlement Act have died after waiting for decades without seeing that promise honored. 
   Last year, Congressman DON YOUNG, Chairman of the House Resources Committee, added a provision to the House Interior Appropriations bill that required, by a date certain, the Federal Government to live up to the access promises it made to the Chugach Natives decades ago. In the conference last fall on the Omnibus appropriations bill, the 
   administration spoke passionately and repeatedly against the provision. 
   Why? They fully admitted the obligation to grant an access easement exists. They acknowledged further that access delayed is access denied and that further delays were harmful to the Chugach people. They opposed the provision on the grounds that it was not necessary since they were going to move with all due haste to finalize the easement before the end of 1998. Katie McGinty, then head of the President's Council on Environmental Quality sat across from me, looked me in the eye, and promised me they would fulfill this long overdue promise before the end of the year. 
   She even offered to issue a ``Presidential Proclamation'' promising once again to do what had already been promised and promised and promised. My staff worked with OMB on the content of such a proclamation, but I told them it would not be necessary. I would take her at her word and believed the administration would live up to the personal commitment she made to me. 
   Here we are a year later, Chugach still has not received its easement. Ms. McGinty is gone, but her commitment on behalf of this administration remains. It is now the responsibility of others to ensure the promises she made to me and to Alaska's Native people are kept. 
   Congressman YOUNG's House Resources Committee has reported a bill, H.R. 2547, to address this issue legislatively, in the hope of forcing the administration to do what it has promised to do. Senator MURKOWSKI has been tireless in his efforts to get the Federal Government to live up to the promises made to Alaskans concerning access to our State and Native lands. I support those efforts. 
   But I take the time today to say clearly to this administration that the promises made by our Government to the Chugach people for access to their lands--and to me personally as their Representative--must be honored. Make no mistake, if the promises made to me by officials in this administration last fall are not lived up to soon, if they oppose the efforts of Congressman YOUNG and Senator MURKOWSKI on this issue, if they continue to obfuscate and ``slow roll'' this commitment, it will be clear to all that this administration does not perceive the true meaning of Robert Service's memorable phrase: ``A promise made is a debt unpaid''!

   Mr. STEVENS. I certainly won't make a long statement. I still am very committed to the loan guarantee provisions that were in the Satellite Home Viewer Act. But I am also convinced that we would have a period of time to get the regulations ready to proceed with that guarantee program. It would take roughly 6, 7 months. 
   I am going to ask the FCC to start preparing those regulations now. We have the commitment that we will have a loan guarantee bill before us, and we will be voting on it sometime in April. We will not delay the loan guarantee program for rural America by what we have done. I was assured of that, and I am assured in my own mind that it will work. We will be right on time by the time we get this bill. 
   We have a commitment coming that we will either have an improved authorization for a loan guarantee or we will vote what was in the bill we took out last night. I urge my friend to understand that we have not abandoned the loan guarantee program. Coming from where I do, I would never abandon it. 
   When I came to the Senate, the Army ran the communications system of Alaska; the U.S. Government owned all of the telephones in Alaska. Now, when you look at the distance we have come in a relatively short time of my service in the Senate, we are going to do the same thing with satellite communications in a very short period of time, in a new way, consistent with private enterprise, on a guarantee program rather than a Government loan program. 
   We need to have certainty to what we are doing. I know it will take a long time to get the regulations ready. We did not agree to delaying the loan guarantee program last night; we delayed the authorization for it, and we will have that authorization by April of next year.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I checked with my office. TEA 21, the highway bill, had a loan guarantee program. It took 16 months for the regulations to be drawn before there was one guarantee made. We have the process to be started on the Satellite Home Viewer Act to create regulations for a new loan guarantee program, and I said it could be done in 6 months. My staff tells me I was very conservative; it will take much longer than that. We will have the law for authorizing the loan guarantee done by the end of April. 
   I do not believe that those who agree with me that there should be a loan guarantee program should be worried about the deletion of that authorization now. The problem on the loan guarantee program is to commence the drafting and, really, the presentation of the new program. It will be entirely new. It is not similar to any conduct of a loan guarantee program in history. So it will take a considerable amount of time.  
   I want the RECORD to note there is no reason to oppose this bill and particularly to oppose this continuing resolution on the basis of the deletion of the loan guarantee program from the Satellite Home Bureau Act.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I regret this error. It was an error. We have put together several bills in one bill and it has been a rather difficult week in many ways. This error occurred because some of the Members of the House who are involved and should have been involved were not notified of the final decision that was made with regard to a request that came from the Senators of North Carolina. 
   Senator HELMS called me several times on the matter. I talked on the floor and on the phone with Senator EDWARDS before the final arrangement was reached. Frankly, they sought more money than is even in the amendment that was left out of the bill. However, we said we would have to take up the further money in the supplemental that comes before the Congress in the early part of the next year. 
   Last evening when this bill was being read out, I did receive a call concerning the fact that some of the Members of the House were disturbed by the changes that were proposed. It was determined then that had not been properly conveyed to the Members, although some of the staff, I believe, were notified and were part of it. It is just one of those things that a staff member's interaction did not take place, and I personally did not go over and tell the House Members--I probably should have--but it was one of the final items on the discussions we had, including those that involved the White House representatives who were before our committee yesterday. 
   As a consequence, I want to assure the Senators from North Carolina, I do believe that once we have reached a decision such as that, and we felt it had been cleared out, it is our responsibility now to make certain this commitment is made good, and we will do that. This bill will do it if the House will accept it and send it to the President. If that does not happen, we will, without any question, take the matter up in the first supplemental that comes before the Congress next year. We will have the supplemental bill for Kosovo coming. That was another request we received which was not fulfilled in this series of bills that are before the Senate now. 
   I want to assure Senator EDWARDS and Senator HELMS on this side--and  both have been very diligent in seeking these moneys--that we will put this money in the next bill if this is not accepted by the House. I have every reason to believe it will be accepted by the House. I intend to get on the phone and talk to my friends and make sure they understand. If there was an error, it was one that was caused by the intensity of the work that was going on by the staffs of five different subcommittees trying to put a bill together, along with all the other bills that were being considered, many of which were rejected and are not in this bill that we all considered over this last week. 
   I do hope the Senators from North Carolina will accept that assurance. I can assure them this is an $81 million item and it is, in my judgment, small compared to the amount of money that will be in the next supplemental for the people who were affected by Hurricane Floyd anyway, so we will make up for this problem. We will make up the money, and we certainly will see to it that it is there. 
   I plead with the Members of the House to pass the bill tonight. In any event, we will take care of that error as quickly as we can. 
   Second, with regard to my good friend from West Virginia and his amendment and that of Senator MCCONNELL and the Western Senators, 
   I think there is a clear, growing understanding of the provisions of this amendment. I have been saying, as Senator BYRD has been saying for some time, this does not change existing law. It is an amendment to try to preserve the status quo until Congress has a chance to review the changes that would take place if decisions of the Solicitor's Office and decisions of one Federal judge were followed, which would affect the mining industry of the whole Nation. I hope the House will certainly see fit to send that measure to the President, so we can see what the White House is going to do with that. 
   But for now, I hope the Senators involved will let us get on with the major bill, which is going to take some time. I again express my regret to the Senators involved that this incident has taken place, and we will do our best to see it does not happen. But the distinguished minority leader reminded me, on an amendment that we had on a bill earlier this year, a similar thing happened when there were just too many things going into one bill. Our provision was left out, but it got back in the next bill, I assure you. 
   Mr. President, I do hope the Senators involved will give us the courtesy now of permitting the Appropriations Committee to present, at last, the omnibus appropriations bill that will fulfill our commitment to pass 13 appropriations bills this year.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that Congress included $10 million in the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill to continue the Russian Leadership Program in Fiscal Year 2000. 
   The Russian Leadership Program was created earlier this year in the FY 1999 supplemental appropriations bill in order to bring emerging Russian leaders to the United States to see first hand how democracy and the American free market economic system function. The program was successful in bringing over 2,100 emerging leaders from 83 of the 89 states and republics in the Russian Federation during July, August, and September of this year. Dr. Billington, the Librarian of Congress, and one of the world's leading historians of Russian culture was asked to administer this program. Our thanks go to Dr. Billington for doing an excellent job implementing this program in a short period of time. 
   The program was modeled after the Marshall Plan which was implemented after World War II. Between 1946-1956, the U.S. Government brought over 10,000 Germans citizens to the United States to learn ways to rebuild their economy through technical assistance as well as cultural and political contacts. The Marshall Plan was one of the most successful foreign aid programs of the last century. 
   Similar to the Marshall Plan, participants in the Russian Leadership Program visited more than 400 communities in 46 states and the District of Columbia observing democracy in action at all levels of government. They met and discussed the American system of government with current and former U.S. Presidents, Members of the U.S. Senate and U.S. House, Governors, state legislators, state supreme court justices, mayors, and members of city and town councils. 
   Some of the participants also campaigned door-to-door with political candidates, visited police and fire stations, met with students in schools, visited hospitals, research facilities, businesses, soup kitchens, shelters and experienced firsthand the partnership among government, and the private sector. 
   This program was unique because more than 800 American families hosted our Russian visitors, welcoming them into their homes and communities, and spending the time to answer questions about and show our guests the American way of life. Vadim Baikov, one of the six Russians who visited Alaska, the State I represent, wrote after the program that, ``In my opinion, the best cultural aspect is that we stayed with the families, because in this way one can actually gain insight of the genuine American lifestyle. I think that is what counts the most.'' 
   Organizations such as Rotary International, the United Methodist Church, Freedom Force, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints played a key role in organizing the participants in the program both in Russia and the United States. In addition to volunteering their time, these families and hosting communities generously supplemented the government's $10 million appropriations by providing approximately $1.5 million worth of meals, cultural activities, additional transportation and medical care. 
   Beyond the strong ties of friendship that developed between guests and hosts, it is clear that the Russian Leadership Program fundamentally changed how these Russian guests see America. They constitute the largest single group ever to travel from Russia to the U.S. They return to Russia with clear ideas and strong commitment to positive change. A mayor from Tomsk spend time with the mayor of Cleveland and said: ``If we were to meet more often, there would be more peaceful relations.'' 
   The Russian Leadership Program has had a tremendous impact in one year. It is a good program and I am pleased that we were able to provide the necessary funding to continue this program into the new millenium.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I want to discuss a measure that will deal with a problem with the pension limits in section 415 of the Tax Code as they relate to multiemployer pension plans. This is a problem I have been trying to fix for years. 
   Section 415, as it currently stands, deprives working people of the pensions they deserve. In 1996, Congress addressed part of the problem by relieving public employees from the limits of section 415. It is only proper that Congress does the same for private workers covered by multiemployer plans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEVENS. That is a good question. It is a difficult issue that points to the complexity of the current Tax Code. Section 415 negatively impacts employees who have had various employers. Currently, the pension level is set at the employee's highest consecutive 3-year average salary. With fluctuations in industry, often times employees have up and down years rather than steady increases in their wages. This is especially true for those in the construction industries and other sectors that fluctuate with the local economic conditions. Fluctuations in work and income from year-to-year can skew the 3-year salary average for the employee, resulting in a lower pension when the worker retires.

   Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Budget Committee chairman for asking about section 415's real impact. An example of section 415's impact illustrates how unfairly the current law treats working people in multiemployer plans. Take, for instance, a woman who held two jobs before retiring. Upon leaving her first job she had accrued a monthly retirement benefit of $474 per month. In her second job she was employed for 15 years by a local union and her highest annual salary was $15,600. When she retires she applies for pension benefits from the two plans by which she was covered. She had earned a monthly benefit of $1,000 from the one plan and combined this with the monthly benefit of $474 from the second plan for a total monthly income of $1,474 or $17,688 per year. She looked forward to receiving this full amount throughout her retirement. However, the benefits had to be reduced by $202 per month, or about $2,400 per year to match her highest annual salary of $15,600. The so-called ``compensation based limit'' of section 415 of the Tax Code did not to take into account disparate benefits, but intended only to address people with a single employer likely to receive steady increases in salary.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEVENS. No. Section 415 treats public employees differently from workers in multiemployer plans. If she had been a public employee covered by a public plan, her pension would not be cut. This is because public pensions plans are not restricted by the 
   compensation-based limit language of section 415. This robs employees in multiemployer plans of the money they have earned simply because they were not public employees.

   Mr. STEVENS. We do look for ways to encourage people to save for retirement and we try to educate people of the fact that relying on Social Security alone will not be enough. Yet the law may penalize many private sector employees in multiemployer plans by arbitrarily limiting the amount of pension benefits they can receive. It is wrong, and it should be fixed.

   Mr. STEVENS. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated last year that the changes adopted by the Senate on July 30th and included in my proposal would result in a tax expenditure of $4 million in the first year, $26 million over 5 years and $69 million over 10 years. It is a modest price to pay to ensure that people who have worked all their life can get the retirement benefits they are entitled to.

I cosponsored S. 1209 with Senator MURKOSWKI in this session to address the problems of section 415. The provisions of that bill were accepted by the Senate Finance Committee and were included in section 346 of the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 passed by the Senate. That provision would have:

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we will hear from the managers of the bill, I am certain. There are two sets of managers, as a matter of fact. This is a bill that combines the District of Columbia  appropriations bill and the Labor-Health and Human Services bill. I am here today as chairman to urge Members of the Senate to vote favorably for this bill and to send it to the President. 
   The big bill in this conference report before us, the Labor-Health and Human Services bill, is the 13th appropriations bill. With the adoption of this conference report, we will have sent all 13 bills to the President. If one considers the timeframe of this Congress, with the time we spent on the impeachment process and then the delays that came our way because of the various emergencies that have taken our attention, particularly in the appropriations process this year--Kosovo, the devastating hurricanes, and the disaster in the farm area--one will understand why we are this late in the day considering the 13th bill. 
   This bill has had some problems because of our overall budget control mechanisms. We have been limited in terms of the money available. We have stayed within those limits. We have forward funded some of the items so they will be charged against future years. But those are items that primarily would be spent in those years. 
   We have had a real commitment on a bipartisan basis not to invade the Social Security surplus. As we look into the future with the retirement of an enormous generation, the baby boom generation, there is no question that Social Security surplus must be sound, and we are doing our best to make sure that is the case. 
   We have had a series of issues before us. We have had some disagreements with the President. In this bill, we try to work out those differences. We have provided moneys for our children, for the Boys and Girls Clubs; we have provided for law enforcement officers to have safe, bulletproof vests. With so many things going on in terms of children and education, we tried to meet the President more than halfway on his requests for education. 
   The bill would probably be signed but for the differences between the administration and the Congress over how to handle the funding. We have included, as a matter of fact, against my best wishes, an across-the-board cut. That is primarily because only the administration can identify some of the areas we can reduce safely without harming the programs, and I am confident when we come to what we call the final period to devise a bill, we will work out with the administration some offsets that will take care of the bill. I am hopeful we will have no across-the-board cut, but if it comes, it will not be as large as the one in this bill right now. 
   I am urging Members of the Senate to vote for this bill. I do believe we can be assured, and I was assured yesterday, that the bill will be vetoed. There is no question about that. But 
    also, we had probably the most productive and positive meeting with the administration yesterday. I expect to be starting those discussions in our office in the Capitol with representatives of the President within just a few moments, and we are very hopeful we can come together and bring to the Senate and to the Congress a solution to the differences between us and get this final series of bills completed. 
   There are five bills that have not been signed: State-Justice-Commerce was vetoed, and that is being reviewed by the group I just mentioned, along with the foreign assistance bill; the Interior bill is in conference and should be ready to send to the President today, I hope; the D.C. bill is here, and it should be available to us. 
   The impact of what I am saying is, I think it is possible, if the Congress has the will to come together now and to work with the President's people who have indicated their desire to finish this appropriations process, that we can finish our business and complete our work by a week from tomorrow. That will take a substantial amount of understanding on the part of everyone. 
   I am hopeful from what we are hearing now that some of the rhetoric will subside and we will have positive thinking about how to complete our work. But I do urge approval of this conference report.

    Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Col. Bernt Balchen, A Norwegian-born pilot, became one of America's great Arctic experts of the 20th Century. A patriotic American, he was also a great friend of the State of Alaska. 
   Born in Norway on October 23, 1899. Colonel Balchen served in the French Foreign Legion, and both the Finnish and Norwegian Armies in World War I; and became a pilot in the Norwegian Naval Air Corps in 1921. 
   Throughout the 1920's and 1930's Colonel Balchen participated in numerous trans-Atlantic and Arctic expeditions. During 1928-1930, Balchen was chief pilot on Admiral Byrd's Atlantic expedition and on November 29, 1929, he piloted the first airplane, a Ford trimotor ``Floyd Bennett'' across the South Pole. Congress conferred United States citizenship of Colonel Balchen in 1931. 
   When World War II started in 1939, Colonel Balchen began ferrying airplanes to England and Singapore for the British. In 1941, he joined the United States Army Air Corps at the request of General ``Hap'' Arnold, and was assigned to Greenland to Supervise the Construction of, and later command, our famous airbase known as ``Bluie West 8''. His command is credited with numerous rescue missions saving many pilots whose planes had gone down on the icecap. 
   In 1943, Balchen became chief of allied transportation command for Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and the Soviet Union, operating out of a secret base in Scotland. During that period, his command regularly flew across enemy-occupied territory to rescue downed allied airmen and insert commandos and intelligence agents behind enemy lines. He also led highly secret missions into Norway to resupply underground resistance forces for their operations against the German army of occupation. 
   After the war, Balchen was recalled to active duty with the United States Air Force in 1948 and assigned to command the 10th rescue squadron at Elemendorf Air Force Base, Alaska. The techniques of Arctic Rescue that Colonel Balchen developed during this assignment continue to save the lives of civilian and military personnel to this day. In May 1949, he flew a Douglas C-54 from Fairbanks, Alaska over the North Pole to Oslo, Sweden, becoming the first pilot to fly over both Poles. 
   Colonel Balchen was transferred to headquarters, United States Air Force in 1951 to participate in developing the Ballistic missile early warning system (BMEWS). Also, he was instrumental in the establishment of Thule Air Force base in Greenland and blazed airborne trails to assist both commercial and military aviation in the Arctic region. After retiring from the Air Force in 1956, Balchen continued to serve on special assignment and as a consultant to the military. 
   Col. Bernt Balchen died on October 23, 1973, and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. His lifetime achievements influenced the course of Aviation, arctic, and military history. His legacy to this country and to my State of Alaska is a strong northern defense, an established transpolar aviation system, a better understanding of the world's polar regions, and, of course, the lives of those rescued by Colonel Balchen and the men and women who continue his work with the United States Air Force Rescue Service.

   Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, it is with great sadness that I come to the floor today to speak about JOHN CHAFEE. I first met Senator CHAFEE standing in line to register for Harvard Law School in 1947. We had both returned from World War II and completed college and were freshmen in law school that year. 
   When you met JOHN CHAFEE in those days, you knew you were meeting a man. He was really an extraordinary man, very capable physically and mentally. I remember kidding him a little bit that he was going to have a tough time in one of our first classes because his uncle was the professor. His uncle, Zechariah Chafee, was one of the great professors of Harvard Law School in those days. 
   But JOHN CHAFEE finished law school, and then he went back to war. He went to Korea. He really never gave up his commitment as a patriot to this country because he then became the Secretary of the Navy under President Nixon. I think he served with great distinction here as one who had knowledge of what it means to have been in a war and was trying to assure peace. 
   He served with great distinction, as others have mentioned here today, on various committees of the Senate. It was not my privilege ever to serve with JOHN on one of the committees in the Senate; our paths were different. As a matter of fact, at times we disagreed. But I was chairman of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee the year he got elected. 
   He had a very distinguished record as Governor of Rhode Island, and he came to us with a unique approach, really, of  a very straight thinking man. He was not bound by partisan politics. He had a Republican philosophy, but he had a commitment to this country that was very deep and one from which I never saw him waiver. I never saw him waiver from something in which he believed. He really didn't care if he was the only person voting the way he decided was the best to vote for his constituents and his country. 
   I sat here last week and talked to him. He was, as we all know, then in a wheelchair. I was very surprised to see JOHN in a wheelchair, for just 2 weeks ago today we had gathered together here, after the Senate recessed, a group of some 60 of our Harvard classmates, to be with JOHN after he had made his decision not to run for reelection next year. It was sort of a preretirement party, you might say, with the people he had known and still knew very well from throughout the country. It was a great tribute to JOHN, again as a man, because our colleagues came from the west coast, Florida, all over the country, to be with him and Ginny at his first retirement party. Sadly, it was his last because by Friday, when I saw him on the subway, he was again in his wheelchair and was quite despondent about his health at the time. It was sad to see him in that condition, knowing what a vigorous man he was and a great friend. 
   The Senate has been much better off for having JOHN CHAFEE for so many years because he brought us such an extremely broad scope of opinion from his own experience in life. He was a graduate of Yale, and then he went to Harvard Law School. That didn't happen much in those days, but he decided he would pursue education where his family had a presence. I think his work in the Senate has been extremely significant because of his background in law and his background as a marine. I know those who served with him when he was Secretary of the Navy swore by him as one of the best. 
   It is sad to see the passing of another one from my generation. When I came here, I think 70 percent of the Senate had served in World War II. I don't know if I am counting right, but I think we are down to about 7 now--about 7 percent. We see in his passing, really, the beginning of the end of an era, of the generation that fought the last great world war. One of these days, I am going to have to write that book of the story that was written by our generation. I have not done that. But if there was any person who ever served in this body who was a great, shining example of that generation, it was JOHN CHAFEE.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to ask the chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation to clarify a provision in the fiscal year 2000 transportation appropriations conference report. The conference report refers to the ``Anchorage Ship Creek intermodal facility.'' The Ship Creek area of Anchorage is undergoing an important redevelopment that will include intermodal access across Knik Arm to the Matanuska-Susitna Valley. This grant will help improve the Port McKenzie facility, a multi-use facility which will support transit between Anchorage and the Mat-Su area. The Matanuska-Sustina Borough is the sponsor of this project and the logical applicant for this funding. Do I understand correctly that is the intent of the committee?

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the authors of this legislation for working to bring this bill to the floor. I had the privilege of working under President Eisenhower as Assistant to the Secretary of the Interior and Solicitor of the Interior Department. I am proud to have served under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
   In 1947 President Eisenhower said of our democracy:  
   The American system rests upon the rights and dignity of the individual. The success of that system depends upon the assumption by each one of personal, individual responsibility for the safety and welfare of the whole. No government official, no soldier, be he brass hat or Pfc., no other person can assume your responsibilities--else democracy will cease to exist.  
   This sentiment is still true today. It speaks to the timelessness of President Eisenhower's thoughts and efforts and it offers us a glimpse of how he approached his duties and his life in general. 
   Ike was a good soldier who got most of his insight into government from his experience at West Point. His focus was on duty, honor and country. To him, the role he was given by the American people is outlined in the Constitution and he followed the language of the Constitution to the best of his ability. Also known as an ``internationalist'', he believed in friendship and peace. Ike ran for President because of concern that too many people were afraid of other countries and believed that if we were to have peace in the world then we need friendships with other countries. 
   Eisenhower as our leader made many decisions that we live by today. Unlike many who currently seek and obtain political offices, he was concerned with making the right decisions and not with what his legacy would be. Today's leaders should and do build on the leadership of the past--leadership that he provided and taught us to emulate. 
   The period of Ike's Presidency was an interesting and important period in the history of our country--particularly for my State and the State of my good  friend from Hawaii, Senator INOUYE. President Eisenhower originally opposed statehood for Alaska in his first term. In 1950 you needed a passport or birth certificate to return to the ``south 48'' from Alaska. Today we remember the phrase ``Taxation without representation''. It was true back then, especially for those of us who fought and returned from WWII. It was demeaning and unfair. As everyone knows, we won the statehood fight and it turned out to be good for the people of Alaska and the country as a whole. 
   In working for Alaska statehood under President Eisenhower I found the ability to work freely, but with his full support. Bill Ewald, a good friend of mine, is quoted in the book ``Eisenhower the 
   President'':  
   ..... in the end ..... the greatest glory must go to Eisenhower. He chose his lieutenants, gave them the freedom to think and to innovate, backed them to the hilt despite his qualms, and thus produced an outcome that, in retrospect, remains a triumph of his administration.  
   Only 40 years later Alaska provides 25 percent of all U.S. oil production, and 50 percent of fish consumed in the United States is caught off Alaska's shores. 
   Eisenhower believed that a modern network of roads is ``As necessary to defense as it is to our national economy and personal safety''. Under his leadership, the Federal Aid-Highway Act of 1956 authorized 41,000 miles of highways (later adjusted to 42,500) by 1975. By 1980, 40,000 miles were completed. Today there are more than 42,700 miles in the system. Citizens of no nation on Earth can equal the mobility that is available to the majority of Americans via our National Highway System. A study in 1994 found that the fatality rate for interstate highways is 60 percent lower than the rest of the transportation system and the injury rate is 70 percent lower. The U.S. Army cited the Interstate Highway System as being critical to the success of the Desert Shield-Desert Storm Operation because it allowed for the rapid deployment of troops and equipment to U.S. ports for deployment overseas. 
   In the area of defense, Ike's efforts could not be eclipsed. His leadership in pushing for adequate funding of our defense system led to the successes we enjoy today. With the strongest military power on Earth, and with new and effective weapon systems in our arsenal, we should look to the past and give Ike credit for his vision on our national defense. 
   In his 1961 farewell address, President Eisenhower said:  
   America is today the strongest, the most influential and most productive nation in the world ..... America's leadership and prestige depend, not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches and military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.  
   It was President Eisenhower's hope as we all pursue our careers, regardless of the path we take, that we would remember his words and would do our best to be a ``foot soldier'' in his battle to ``wage peace.'' I still consider myself one of Eisenhower's ``foot soldiers''. 
   Naming the Old Executive Office Building after President Eisenhower is a fitting tribute to the man who save the world and I am proud to cosponsor this legislation.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, yesterday the House passed the conference report which is before the Senate which accompanies H.R. 2561, which is the fiscal year 2000 Department of Defense Appropriations Act. It passed by a vote of 372-55. All 17 Senate conferees signed this conference report which Senator INOUYE and I present to the Senate today. 
   This conference report reflects nearly 4 weeks of discussions and negotiations with the House committee. The conference report before the Senate is consistent with the bill passed by the Senate in June and the armed services conference report passed recently and signed by the President. 
   In most areas, we established a compromise figure between the House and Senate levels. 
   The excellent work undertaken by the Armed Services Committee provided an essential roadmap and guide for the work of our conference on most major programs. 
   The first priority of our conference was to ensure adequate funding for military personnel, including the 4.8-percent pay raise for the fiscal year 2000. Funding was also provided to implement the restoration of full retirement benefits for military personnel and new retention and enlistment bonuses to attract and retain military personnel. 
   The conferees worked to increase needed spending for military readiness and quality of life priorities. More than $1 billion has been added to the President's request for operation and maintenance in the Department of Defense to make certain the Armed Forces are prepared to meet any challenge to our Nation's security. 
   The conferees faced wide gaps between modernization programs advocated by the House and Senate. This is the first year of many years we have had such major disagreements. 
   The Senate sustained the Department's request for several multiyear procurement initiatives which included the Apache, the Javelin, the F-18, C-17, and the M-1 tank. I am pleased to report each of these are included in the conference report before the Senate today. Those multiyear contracts, in our opinion, do give us better procurement at a lower cost. 
   The Senate included funds to meet the Marine Corps commandant's foremost priority, the LHD-8 amphibious assault ship. There is $375 million provided for that vessel at the authorized level. 
   Considerable media attention was focused on the action by the House to delete all procurement funding for the F-22. Consistent with the decision in the defense authorization bill, Senate conferees insisted that adequate funding be appropriated for the F-22. 
   Also, legislative authority was provided to execute the existing fixed-price contract for the first eight preproduction aircraft. 
   The conference outcome provides funds to sustain the F-22 program at the proposed production rates, with full advanced procurement for the 10 aircraft planned for the fiscal year 2001. 
   Legislative restrictions on those funds do mandate that during the fiscal year 2000, the Department meet its planned review thresholds. We are confident that will take place. 
   Language concerning the fiscal year 2001 contract awards by necessity will have to be reconsidered as part of the fiscal year 2001 bill, as this act does not govern appropriations after September 30 of next year. 
   The most important research and development program supported in this act is the national missile defense effort. The successful intercept test last week validates the work since 1983 to build and deploy an effective national missile defense system. 
   This conference report before the Senate allocates an additional $117 million from the 1999 omnibus bill to keep this program on track and to accelerate deployment as soon as practical. 
   The bill also provides funding for the Third Arrow Battery to assist our ally, Israel, in meeting its security needs. When the committee reported the defense bill to the Senate in May, Congress had just passed an $11 billion supplemental bill to meet the costs of the conflict in Kosovo. 
   As a result of the exceptional performance of our air and naval forces during that campaign, hostilities ended months earlier than projected in the supplemental bill. That effort afforded the Senate the option to apply those funds from the supplemental bill appropriated for Kosovo to meet the fiscal year 2000 defense needs. This bill utilized $3.1 billion in Kosovo carryover funds as it left the Senate. Based on extensive consultation with the Department of Defense, the conferees agreed to apply $1.6 billion of that sum to meet vital readiness and munitions needs for the fiscal year 2000. 
   Finally, the bill includes two new general provisions that place new maximum averages on defense contract payments. These provisions do not reduce in any way the amount the Department will pay to meet its obligations but does change the maximum number of days by which such payments must be made. 
   The Department must remain fully compliant with the Prompt Payment Act, and nothing was done in this act to extend payments beyond current legal limits. 
   As I have observed over the past 5 years, the work of presenting this bill and the conference report now before the Senate reflects a total partnership between myself and my great friend, the distinguished Senator from Hawaii. His wisdom, perseverance, and steadfast determination to work for the welfare of the men and women of our Armed Forces and the military preparedness of our Nation assured the nonpartisan result of this conference. 
   This bill also contains a provision to commence the formation of a commission to find a suitable national memorial to our former President, the distinguished general of the Army, President Eisenhower. I urge all Members become familiar with that process. It very much follows the commission that was established for a similar memorial to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. 
   Following the statement of my good friend from Hawaii, to whom I now yield, I shall urge adoption of the conference report.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I know of nothing in this bill that deals with the food stamp issue. I don't understand the remarks of the Senator from Arizona. There is a 4.8 percent pay raise in this bill. We did exceed the President's request for the purpose of trying to make certain that all members of the armed services have sufficient funds with which to live. I know of no issue in this bill that deals with food stamps for service people. There are people in the service who are eligible for food stamps because of their own economic circumstances. That is very unfortunate. We are trying to work out a system whereby that will not happen. One of the ways to do that is to continue to increase the pay so they are comparable with people in the private sector and the jobs that they perform.

   Mr. STEVENS. While the Senator from Florida is here, I want to point out that we did use the spectrum concept in this bill. It was the administration that recommended that approach to the Congress, and we decided to use it in this bill. 
   Regarding the comments made both by the Senator from Florida and the Senator from Arizona about the payment schedule set forth in this bill, Congress had previously required the Department of Defense to pay sooner than required by the Prompt Payment Act. We have not reduced the amount of payments to be made to defense contractors; we have not changed, in any way, the contracts between those contractors and the United States. All we have said is the Department of Defense does not have to pay earlier than required by the Prompt Payment Act. It was the mandate to pay earlier that was causing a scoring problem, as far as the Department of Defense activities are concerned. 
   As a practical matter, what this does is deal with the average number of days within which payments are required under defense contracts. There is no reduction in the amount of money that would be spent, and there is no acceleration or deceleration of the rate at which it is to be spent; there is just no mandate that they have to pay sooner than is required by the Prompt Payment Act. Under the circumstances, we have not varied the  amount of money that would be spent for these contracts within fiscal year 2000; we have just not mandated that they be spent sooner than would otherwise be required by normal, sound business practices. 
   Having done so, we are dealing with the scoring mechanisms that apply to this bill, not how the payments are made to contractors. I do believe that the comments that have been made concerning the scoring mechanisms under this bill do not recognize the fact that it is extremely necessary for us to pursue ways in which we can assure the moneys are available to the Department of Defense, notwithstanding the extraordinary burdens we faced in this subcommittee on defense coming from the increased activities in South Korea, increased activities in the Persian Gulf, permanent personnel stationed in both Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, from the activities in Bosnia--and we still have forces in Bosnia, and now in Kosovo; we have permanent forces now in Kosovo. All of those forces and activities have required enormous funding. We still have forces in Haiti. 
   Under the circumstances, all of these extraordinary burdens on the Department of Defense require us to find ways in which we can assure money is there for modernization, maintenance, for increased pay to our people, and for assuring that we will continue with the research and development necessary to assure that this Nation will have a viable Department of Defense in the next century. 
   I do not deny that there are things in here with which people could disagree. I only wish they had tried to understand them. I would be perfectly willing to have any of them visit with us any time if they can show us that we have underfunded the Department of Defense. We have adequately funded the Department of Defense, and that was our intention. It was our intention to use every possible legal mechanism available to us to assure that there is more money available for the Department of Defense in the coming year in view of the strains that we have on the whole system because of these contingencies that we have financed in the past 3 to 4 years. 
   This has been an extraordinary period for the Department of Defense. I can think of only one instance where we received a request from the administration to budget for those extraordinary expenses. We have had to find the money, we found the money, and we have kept the Department of Defense funded. 
   I, for one, want to thank my good friend from Hawaii for his extraordinary friendship and capability in helping on that job. I say without any fear of being challenged on this, I would challenge any other two Members of the Senate to find ways to do this better than the two of us have done it. 
   I, without any question, recommend this bill to the Senate. Those who wish to vote against it, of course, have the right to do so. But a vote against this bill is a vote to not fund the Department of Defense properly in the coming year. If you want to nitpick this bill, you can. 
   The process of putting it together was the most extraordinary process I have gone through in 31 years. I don't want to go through a conference like that again. And I assure the Senate that we will not.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I understand Senator WARNER's concerns and appreciate his support for the conference report. As the distinguished Chairman of the Armed Services Committee indicated, this was a very difficult conference. In order to assure the Senate's position on the most important national security issues, we agreed to other provisions that the Senate conferees would normally oppose. I assure my colleague that I respect the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee in these matters. I agreed to authorize the military construction projects only because it was  necessary to reach a final agreement. In my view, these actions do not set any precedent for future actions on appropriations bills. It is my hope and intention that this will not happen again in the future.

However, the Senator is correct that many health benefits are a result from technology development. I expect adjustments in the peer review process could be made, as appropriate, to delineate between basic research or technology development programs to account for differences as long as projects are in keeping with the ``clear scientific merit and relevance to military health'' requirement set forth in the report.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the conference report for the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture appropriations bill addresses one of the most beleaguered fisheries in the United States. The Norton Sound region of Alaska has suffered chronically poor salmon returns in recent years. Norton Sound is an arm of the Bering Sea off the west coast of Alaska. It lies to the north of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, which has also seen very poor salmon returns in recent years. 
   Both of these regions are extremely rural and heavily dependent on commercial and subsistence salmon fishing for survival. 
   The provision in the conference report addresses the Norton Sound problem in several ways. First, it will make the Norton Sound region eligible for the Federal disaster assistance made available to the Yukon-Kuskokwim delta region last year. 
   Second, it changes the income eligibility standard from the Federal poverty level to that for the temporary assistance to needy families program. 
   The standard of living in many of these fish-dependent communities is well below the poverty line. This was one of the chief complaints voiced to my staff and several Commerce Department officials when they visited western Alaska last summer. This provision will allow more needy families to qualify for 1999 disaster assistance, much of which has gone unallocated. 
   Additionally, this bill will provide $10 million in grants through the Economic Development Administration for infrastructure improvements in the Norton Sound region. 
   The conference report included is $5 million in disaster assistance under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to determine  the cause of the decline and to identify ways to improve the area's fisheries in the future. These funds will be available in 2001. 
   The main reason these communities are unable to ride out cyclical fishery failures is the lack of commercial infrastructure in rural fisheries. The EDA grants will help provide ice machines and other equipment to help these communities modernize their processing capabilities and extract more value from the resources they harvest. 
   I was also pleased to work with my colleagues from New England on their request for fishery disaster assistance. New England will receive $15 million in 2001 for cooperative research and management activities in the New England fisheries. These funds will provide New England fishermen with an important role in working to solve the problems of their own fisheries. 
   Within this conference report, I have also asked that the Agricultural Marketing Service--the AMS--convene two national meetings to begin development of organic standards with respect to seafoods. One of these meetings will be held in Alaska and the other meeting will be held on the Gulf of Mexico coastal area. 
   The AMS will use the information gathered at these meetings to develop draft regulations establishing national organic standards for seafood to be published in fiscal year 2000. 
   It is estimated that the sales of organic foods will reach $6.6 billion by the year 2000. The organic industry has been growing at a rate of 20 to 24 percent for the last 9 consecutive years. 
   Ocean-harvested seafood should be at the same level with other qualifying protein commodities, such as beef, pork, and chicken. I hope that these protein sources will be included in the proposed U.S. Department of Agriculture rules to be finalized by June 2000. Ocean-harvested seafood should not be excluded as an organically-produced product when USDA issues its final rule. 
   This issue is very important to Alaska, as the harvesting of seafood is an industry that employs more Alaskans than any other industry. In particular, I am concerned about the inclusion of wild salmon within USDA's final rule for the National Organic Program. Wild salmon is an organic product. 
   This past summer, two private certifying firms for organic food products visited two Alaska seafood processors to determine whether the wild, ocean-harvested salmon processed at these facilities could be certified as organic. One of the certifiers, farm verified organic, inspected capilliano seafoods. Their report is very positive. In fact, their approval allowed capalliano's salmon to be admitted to natural products east, which is a large organic food show in Boston, Massachusetts. In order to be admitted to this trade show, a product must be verified as organic. 
   I, frankly do not know what the dispute is about. Natural fish, wild fish should certainly be verified as organic. 
   I am confident that the AMS will find Alaskan wild salmon a very heart-healthy protein source, to be of high quality and organic, for the purposes of USDA's national organic program. 
   I thank my friend from Mississippi and yield the floor.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am not opposed to the concept of a comprehensive test ban treaty. 
   If we are able to maintain our own nuclear deterrent and the umbrella of nuclear protection we have extended to our allies, a ban on testing under a fair treaty could be very much in our national interest. 
   Clearly we do not want other countries to develop sophisticated nuclear weapons, the sort that are light enough to go on ICBMs that could reach our country. A verifiable test ban would seriously hinder other countries from developing those sophisticated weapons. 
   However, today we cannot indefinitely maintain with certainty the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons. So while proponents of the treaty make valid points about the benefits that may be obtained with regard to nonproliferation, we are not yet prepared to assume the risks that would be imposed upon us if we give up the ability to test our own weapons. 
   As Paul Robinson, the Director of the Sandia National Laboratory, put it:  
   Confidence in the reliability and safety of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile will eventually decline without nuclear testing *.*.* Whether the risk that will arise from this decline in confidence will be acceptable or not is a policy issue that must be considered in light of the benefits expected to be realized by a universal test ban.  
   I have considered the risks on both sides of the this issue, and I come to  the conclusion that a test ban should remain our goal, but we are not yet in a position to enter into an indefinite ban. 
   We hope over time to reduce the risks of maintaining our stockpile without testing using a science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program. But that program is not yet ready. 
   Our lab Directors believe it will take another 5 to 15 years to prove the program can be a success. 
   As John Browne, the Director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory has said, he is ``concerned about several trends that are reducing [his] confidence. These include annual shortfalls in the planned budgets, increased numbers of findings in the stockpile that need resolution, an augmented workload beyond our original plans, and unfunded mandates that cut into the program.'' 
   I hope the Senate can delay a vote on this treaty. It is in our national interest to ask others to abide by a ban as we are doing, and our ability to make that request will be reduced if we vote against ratification today. 
   However, on whole, the risk to our national security is greater if we prematurely agree to an indefinite ban. For that reason, I hope we will put off the vote on this treaty, but, if we have to vote, in the interest of national security, I will vote against the ratification of this treaty at this time. 
   I thank the Senator for the time.

   Mr. STEVENS. I could not agree more with my friend from Massachusetts and I have been pleased to work with him on this vitally important issue. Research has shown that children exposed to negative brain stimulation in the form of physical abuse or community violence causes the brain to be miswired making it difficult for the child to learn, develop healthy family relationships, reduce peer pressure, and to control violent impulses. Early intervention and treatment is much more successful than adult rehabilitation. This certainly points to a need for more early intervention and treatment programs for children and adolescents who suffer from violence related trauma. It also highlights the need for more professional training in the best practices for treating this psychological trauma.

   Mr. STEVENS. I share the concerns that the Senators are raising and join in their support of vocational education. I want to assure them that I am committed to work with the senior Senator from Pennsylvania to try to find additional funds for vocational education during Conference. I also want to encourage the Administration to request an increase in funds for vocational education in its FY2001 budget submission.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I share the sentiments expressed by my colleague from South Dakota. I have witnessed first hand the devastating effects of FAS and FAE in Alaska, which has the highest rate of FAS/FAE in the nation. Our Alaska Native people are especially at risk for these entirely preventable conditions. It has been estimated that the lifetime cost of treating and providing necessary services for a single victim of FAS/FAE is in excess of $1 million. I am pleased that the bill before us contains language encouraging the Department of Health and Human Services to provide necessary resources to fund comprehensive FAS/FAE prevention, education and treatment programs for Alaska and for a four-state region including South Dakota and will work with the conference committee to ensure that funds are available for these programs. I also support language in the report mandating development of a nationwide, comprehensive FAS/FAE research, prevention and treatment plan. I know that federal support can make a difference. In Alaska, federal assistance has allowed two residential treatment programs for pregnant women and their children--the Dena A Coy program in Anchorage and the Lifegivers program in Fairbanks--to make a positive difference in the lives of numerous Alaska Native women and their children. I look forward to working with my colleague to find real solutions to  the problems of alcohol-related birth defects.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I, too, serve on more than one of the interested committees. On Commerce with the Leader, the Senator from Arizona, and the Senator from Washington, and on the Appropriations Committee with the Senator from New Mexico, the Senator from Alabama, and the Senator from Washington. No member's state relies on aviation more than does my state of Alaska. Yet, changing the budgetary treatment of the aviation accounts is, in my estimation, shortsighted and irresponsible. The FAA is to be commended, along with the airlines, for the level of safety they have contributed to achieving. However, the FAA is not known as the most efficient of agencies. Unfortunately, the FAA has had substantial problems on virtually every major, and minor, procurement and has been the subject of numerous audits and management reports that invariably call for increased accountability and oversight. Changing budgetary treatment cannot have other than a detrimental effect on the oversight efforts of the two committees of jurisdiction that I serve on. For that reason as well as the reasons mentioned by the Leader, the Senators from Alabama, New Mexico and New Jersey, I cannot support a change in budgetary treatment for the aviation accounts.

    Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, for 28 years Albert Engelken was the man behind the scenes at the American Public Transit Association (APTA), a Washington-based member organization advancing and representing the interests of public transit systems and industry suppliers across North America. 
   He was the creative force for the vast majority of APTA's ``People Programs,'' including the innovative International Bus Roadeo, where drivers and mechanics compete in events that test  their skills at operating and maintaining public transit vehicles. His efforts at this endeavor also spawned the equally competitive International Rail Roadeo. 
   Albert Engelken was the originator of ``Transit Appreciation Day,'' which later became ``Try Transit Week,'' an annual fixture that encourages people to ride public transit, and salutes those who make the systems work. His creativity also extended to judging and selecting those systems that demonstrated excellence in transit advertising, a program now known as ``AdWheel,'' an important event held at the Association's annual meeting. 
   Albert Engelken's education programs developed transit information modules for thousands of grade school teachers throughout the United States. And, until his retirement in 1997, Albert Engelken produced the American Public Transit Association's Grant Awards Ceremony, an event that honors transit systems, individuals, and achievements in the public transit industry. 
   That ceremony continues today, and while lacking the unique skills Albert brought to directing the national and local arrangements that publicized the winners, the ceremony this year will honor him by electing him to the prestigious APTA Hall of Fame. 
   He was also the long-time editor of the Association's ``Passenger Transport'' weekly newspaper, and directed the industry's successful communications strategy in the important formative years of the federal transit program. Over his entire career with APTA, Albert's behind-the-scenes work--from speechwriting to the orchestration of presentations and the stage management of events--were critical to the success of APTA's member programs and the smooth functioning of APTA's many conferences. 
   Albert is known by his family, colleagues, and peers as a person who would always go the extra mile to help them out. No task was too small or too complicated to be turned away. He is a gentleman, trusted friend, and caring confidant. Yet he has never sought the spotlight not taken a bow over his work in public transit and APTA. 
   Those are just some of the reasons to honor Albert Engelken, Mr. President. At work and in the community he has touched thousands of lives, and made life safer and easier for hundreds of thousands of transit users and providers across our nation. 
   He is a also great family man. His wife Betsy, children Jane, Elizabeth and Richard and their spouses, and his five grandchildren can certainly attest to that. 
   Mr. President, I join them and his colleagues in congratulating Albert Engelken for a job well done, and in applauding his induction into the American Public Transit Hall of Fame.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I commend Senators SHELBY and LAUTENBERG for this bill. It is really a monstrous bill, and they have come back with a very good compromise, a bill with which we can all live. 
   The staff on this bill deserves a great deal of credit, too. To my right is Wally Burnett, staff director of the Transportation Subcommittee for the Senate. He handles the highway and aviation accounts. Wally tops at 205 pounds now, but we call him Little Wally in Fairbanks. I thank him and Joyce Rose, who handles the railroad and transit accounts. She spent a lot of time away from her young kids. Paul Doerrer handled the Coast Guard and NTSB accounts. He did a great job on his first bill. I also thank Peter Rogoff and Carole Geagley of the minority. They have worked very hard on this bill. As I said, it is an extremely good bill. 
   I want to mention two items related to this bill. We do have a very difficult problem in Alaska on aviation safety. We are, after all, the largest State of the Union, one-fifth of the size of the United States. We use aircraft as other people use taxis or buses or trains. Over 80 percent of our inter-city traffic is by air. Seventy percent of our cities can be reached only by air. As a consequence, safety is one of our major concerns. 
   This summer, Director Hall of the National Transportation Safety Board came to Alaska. He met there with representatives of the Centers for Disease Control and their National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH. There are resources provided in this bill to implement the National Transportation Safety Board's recommendations and NIOSH's interagency initiative for aviation safety in my home State of Alaska. Senator SPECTER's bill, the Labor-HHS bill, provides the resources for NIOSH. They will have to be in the bill in order to put this plan into action. 
   The NIOSH initiative for the air taxi industry in Alaska is modeled after the highly successful 1993 helicopter logging study which produced recommendations for changes that implemented safety plans without Federal regulation. NIOSH recommended crew rest and crew duty schedules along with changes in helicopter logging equipment, and that has all but eliminated helicopter logging fatalities since those recommendations were implemented. 
   It is my hope that the NIOSH study on aviation can produce the same results--industry-led improvements to commuter aviation safety operations in Alaska--again, without the need for new Government-imposed mandates. The industry itself I believe will implement the NIOSH recommendations. 
   As the Senate knows, my family has known fatalities from airplane crashes. And I have many friends who have been involved in such crashes. As one who was lucky enough to walk away, it is my hope that these studies will lead to greater safety considerations for all who fly in Alaska. I am grateful 
   to the chairman and the ranking member, Chairman SHELBY and Senator LAUTENBERG, for including in this bill these great, new safety initiatives. 
   I am happy to report on another matter. This bill ensures completion of the pedestrian footbridge that will span the Chena River in Fairbanks. Fairbanks is Alaska's second largest city. 
   The Alaska River Walk Centennial Bridge is the brainchild of Dr. William Ransom Wood. He is really the sage of Alaska. He is the executive director of Festival Fairbanks. This bridge is a small piece of an overall plan that Dr. Wood and the rest of the festival have developed to beautify Fairbanks and make it pedestrian friendly. 
   At 95, Dr. Wood has been one of Alaska's major players. He served as the president of the University of Alaska, mayor of Fairbanks, and on so many community councils and State task forces that I cannot here name them all. In honor of Dr. Wood's contribution to Fairbanks, the State of Alaska, and our Nation as a naval commander in World War II, Senator MURKOWSKI and I join together in introducing a Senate resolution which will urge Secretary Slater to designate this footbridge the William R. Wood Centennial Bridge.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, our staff tells me that we now have 62 amendments pending to this bill. That means we are going to be here an awful long time on this bill. I think I am going to request that the leader initiate a weekend session if we are going to get this bill passed. 
   We had this bill out of committee with the hopes that we could get it passed today at the end of the fiscal year so we could once again get back to the habit of passing all the bills in the Senate that come from the Appropriations Committee by the end of the fiscal year at least. 
   I hope Senators will tell us seriously how many of these amendments they intend to call up. There are 41 on that side of the aisle and 21 on this side of the aisle. Most of them are riders, and if you put them on the bill, we will drop them in conference anyway. Beyond that, those amendments that take money, you have to take money from some other Senator to get them passed. 
   Let's not play games with this bill. It is the last bill. It is the biggest bill. This is the largest bill. Two-thirds of this bill is not even subject to our control. Two-thirds of the bill is entitlements. I hope we will start watching those entitlement bills and understand it is a very hard bill to put together. 
   I congratulate the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa for their handling of the bill. But I plead with you to tell us which of these amendments you really want to call up. 
   I see my good friend from Nevada. He doesn't have on the right tie today. But he is a man who believes, as I do, that bills should move forward as rapidly as we can move them. I hope I have his help in urging Senators to tell us which of these amendments you really want considered by the Senate and give us a time agreement on them so we know how long it will take before we finish this bill. 
   Does the Senator wish the floor?

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have been in conference this morning on other matters, but I did hear the distinguished Senator from Washington, Mrs. MURRAY, discuss the situation in Alaska and particularly Anchorage. 
   Anchorage did receive $1.8 million last year and reduced class size from 22 to 18. The Senator from Washington indicated if her amendment is not adopted that the Anchorage School District would lay off those new teachers. 
   I asked my staff to get in touch with the school district. I have to point out it is 4 hours earlier in Alaska, and we had to wait a little while. I have come now to report the conversations that have taken place with the Anchorage and Alaska entities that would receive moneys under this bill. 
   I want to make it very plain that the Alaska position is, we want no strings on these block grants. We contacted the Anchorage School District superintendent, for instance, Bob Christal. He told my staff to tell me, without any question, they prefer this block grant money without any strings. But he said if Anchorage did receive the block grant, they would use the money to keep the teachers who were hired and for other purposes. 
   We also contacted the Deputy Commissioner of Education, Bruce Johnson. He said the Alaska Department of Education encourages the greatest amount of flexibility for small districts. There is no question that Alaska wants flexibility in this money. He also indicated there has been no contact with him about this prior to our call this morning. 
   The superintendent of the Fairbanks School District, Alaska's second largest city, Stewart Weinberg, said he much prefers the flexibility of a block grant. He would like to use a portion of the money that would be received for staff development by hiring mentor teachers to help other new teachers. 
   There is no question that is the Alaska situation. I know of schools in our State where the school population is going down so far that they are in the situation of maybe having to close schools. We are not talking about an across-the-board concept of money to reduce class size. We want money that can be used to meet the needs of the particular school district. 
   In some school districts, because of the very unfortunate circumstance of fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol effect in Alaska, we need teachers' assistants. There ought to be flexibility to use this money so it can meet the needs of the particular school district. 
   I want to make it very plain in voting, and I intend to vote on the Murray amendment, I will vote to support the position of the educators in Alaska who want this money without strings attached. They want to meet the needs of their districts and they do not want the Federal Government dictating how the money must be spent. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Energy & Water Appropriations Conference Report for Fiscal Year 2000 passed the Senate by an overwhelming vote of 96-3 yesterday. I thank my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from new Mexico and chairman of the subcommittee, for his excellent work in negotiating this bill and bringing back a very strong conference report. I'd also like to commend our extraordinarily talented and creative staff, Alex Flint, David Gwaltney, and Lashawnda Leftwich without whom we could no have finished this bill. 
   There are three programs I would like to highlight. First, the conferees have provided $98.7 million for biomass research. Last week, the Subcommittee held a hearing on biomass and heard testimony about a proposal by Sealaska Corporation to produce ethanol using surplus wood. I urge the Secretary to take a careful look at this project and support it within the funds provided. 
   Second, with respect to the wind program, the conferees funded it at $31.2 million, an increase over the House level. Over the past few years, the Department has supported the Kozebue wind demonstration project, the only wind generation system in my state. According to the National Weather Service, the windiest cities in the country are in Alaska. If the Kotzebue project proves to be cost efficient, wind may become a major source of electrical power in my state where electric rates are as much as ten times the rate in the lower 48: 55 cents per kilowatt hour in Alaska versus 5 cents per kilowatt hour in states like Idaho. I urge the Department to continue its support of the Kotzebue wind project. 
   Lastly, the managers agreed to language urging the Department of Energy to evaluate nuclear medicine technology known as Positron Emission Technology or PET. 
   I am pleased that the conference report includes strong language directing the Department of Energy to report back to the committee on what steps it can take to give immediate support to a new laboratory at the University of California--Los Angeles which will develop pioneering new molecular-based treatments for disease. 
   These new treatments will use genetically engineered mouse models of several human diseases and track progress with a miniaturized version of positron emission tomography (PET) called Micropet. 
   While scientists and clinicians have been able to diagnose and stage human illnesses, including most types of cancer and other diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimers' using pet imaging, the UCLA research promises to expand the examination of the biologic basis of disease into new treatment of the molecular disorders that scientists now believe are the cause of disease. 
   I understand that the new laboratory at UCLA will need at least $2 million in Federal funds during fiscal year 2000 from the other office at the Department of Energy, and I hope that the Department will make every effort to provide the needed funds to bring this critical project on line at the earliest time it can.

Senator BOND, Senator MIKULSKI, and the team of both the majority and minority have worked very hard to meet the needs of the agencies and the American people under this bill, under some very difficult circumstances in regard to ceilings and limits under which they had to live. I, again, emphasize the Budget Committee has filed a statement saying this bill is within the budget.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? 
   Let me assure the Senator from West Virginia that this is sort of a current emergency in terms of the allocation process under 302(b). We are working this out. The House has the $1.7 billion. We believe because of the reaction from the veterans community we ought to assure that this wasn't intentional all the time to meet the House level in the conference. But by the time this got to conference we believed we would have the 302(b) situation straightened out so we would know where the emergency decision should be made and whether there would be advance appropriations. 
   This is a temporary emergency concept. We are asking the Senate to help us get this bill to conference with the emergency designation on the $600 million, and we assure the Senate that this will not be an emergency coming out for this item unless it is absolutely necessary, which I don't see right now. But we would like it in the bill in conference. When we made the 302(b) allocation to this bill by, in effect, borrowing money from the Health and Human Services bill, we thought it was best to try to have some negotiating stance with the House on some items in the bill. But we never intended to negotiate this item. I conveyed that to the managers of the bill this morning and asked that we take this issue out of contingency in the conference. 
   But this is the best way to do it. I hope the Senate will agree with us. It is an emergency designation that is necessary under the circumstances, but it is not a permanent emergency designation.

   Mr. STEVENS. If I may respond, Mr. President, I have to say the managers of the bill wanted the $1.7 billion to start with. Senator BYRD wanted $1.7 billion. As chairman I found it impossible to make that allocation at the time. But we are saying right now it was always our intention to accommodate the decision made by the managers of the bill that it should be $1.7 billion. This $600 million will meet that objective, and I hope the Senate will adopt it as we suggested.

   Mr. STEVENS. That is correct. If we come back to conference with an emergency designation, it will be subject to the President's approval. We would, in effect, be making a request to the President that it be declared an emergency. I do not think this has reached the emergency stage. The House has it without an emergency, and I think we can accommodate that position.

   Mr. STEVENS. The Senate Report on the FY2000 Department of Transportation bill allocates $8 million to the Coast Guard to pay for the costs of extending the Unalaska municipal pier to provide a dedicated berth for the agency's High Endurance cutters. The Coast Guard is currently forced to shift the High Endurance cutters when in port because the large vessels inadvertantly serve as obstacles to the commercial ship traffic, and the vessels' antennae have at times impeded commercial aviation service into Unalaska. 
   I have since been informed that the Coast Guard may not have sufficient capability to manage a dock extension project in this remote region of the Aleutian Islands. Since the City of Unalaska owns the main pier, I have asked the City to take on the responsibility of managing the pier extension through its municipal competitive procurement process and to assume the responsibility of maintaining the dock extension in exchange for being able to use the space when the High Endurance Cutters are not present. Such an arrangement would dramatically reduce any outyear operating expenses for the Coast Guard associated with the pier space. This arrangement would require a transfer of funds from the Coast Guard to the City at some point next year. While I am not offering an amendment today, we may find that  such a Local-Federal cooperative endeavor may need specific legislative language in the final FY 2000 appropriation bill. Am I correct in my understanding that this issue will be evaluated and technical language may, if necessary, be considered in conference?

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alabama. As a licensed private pilot in Alaska, I am well aware of the challenges every pilot in my state faces every day. On some per capita basis, there are more pilots in Alaska than in any other state in the union. For many of the residents in my state, air travel is the only mode of intrastate transportation. 
   Alaska is one-fifth the size of the lower 48 with a population roughly the size of Montgomery County, Maryland. For many Alaskans, air travel is the only way to get there from here. We have some of the roughest terrain and weather on this continent. Very little flying in Alaska is done above 10,000 feet. Most flying is done in small, single and twin engine aircraft that have historically higher accident rates than high-flying multi-engine turbojets. 
   On average, in the last decade, there has been one aviation accident every other day in Alaska. One hundred pilots, and 266 others have died in aircraft crashes in Alaska since 1991. Every nine days, on average, we lose another Alaskan to an aircraft accident. And these statistics do not take into account four helicopter accidents since June of this year. This and other data compiled by the National Transportation Safety Board and NIOSH show that for the first time in our history, aviation accidents have become the leading cause of occupation-related fatalities in Alaska. 
   This is why I am asking the good Senator from Alabama to consider partial funding for a promising safety study that has been proposed by the Alaska Field Station of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health when his bill goes to conference. This study will bring together all the leaders in Alaska aviation. Industry, state and federal agencies and pilots themselves will all contribute to an intense examination of how to improve aviation safety in Alaska. The Federal Aviation Administration, the National Weather Service, and the National Transportation Safety Board are all enthusiastic supporters of the study. It is my hope that this study will foster common sense, industry-led safety initiatives--not promulgate increasingly burdensome federal restrictions and penalties.

   Mr. STEVENS. Yes, I agree with the Chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The Department of Energy has been investigating alternate fuels that would improve air emissions but not require a new infrastructure or delivery system such as would be required in the use of compressed natural gas. One possibility is Gas-to-Liquids or GTL. The GTL process takes natural gas and converts it to a liquid fuel that has the characteristics of diesel fuel, only without sulfur, which interferes with the catalysts that clean up emissions.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from Montana. I want the Senate to know this amendment would seriously harm a vital sector of the rural Alaskan economy. It would injure greatly those who follow the Alaskan way of life. 
   We are very much involved with this amendment. What it seeks to do is end trapping in the Federal wildlife refuges. There are some exceptions in the Senator's amendment for research, conservation, facilities protection, and subsistence. 
   Let me point out this chart I have. There are 77 million acres of wildlife refuge in our State; 85 percent of all the wildlife refuge in the country is in Alaska. 
   The amendment seeks to absolutely discard the concepts of sound game management principles. As the Senator from Montana stated, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, which represent State fish and game managers throughout the country, have opposed the amendment because it limits the ability to manage wildlife populations scientifically. The Fish and Wildlife Service wrote me a letter on July 20 explaining the Service's opposition to the House amendment in detail. This is a very serious thing. I am disturbed when my colleague talks about recreational trapping. 
   The Fish and Wildlife Service recognizes that the core of its mission is wildlife management. In its letter to me, the Fish and Wildlife Service stated that:  
   ..... a prohibition of specific animal restraint devices is not in the best interest of sound wildlife management.  
   The Department of Fish and Game of my State of Alaska also stated this amendment hinders the ability of wildlife managers to do their job. It said:  
   We have consistently supported trapping as an important tool in managing the national wildlife refuge system.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, these agencies agree wildlife managers rely upon commercial trappers to control invasive and nuisance species, as well as normal predators. In Alaska, Federal and State wildlife managers rely on these trappers to control predators in order to maintain healthy moose and caribou herds, for instance. Moose and caribou are major subsistence species, and a ban on this trapping would harm subsistence hunters by creating more competition for subsistence resources. 
   Another example is the Aleutian-Canada goose. This species was listed under the Endangered Species Act after foxes were introduced on the Aleutian Islands. At first, the refuge managers tried to poison the foxes until EPA banned the poison. Then they hired local trappers to save the goose, and trappers have successfully controlled the fox population, restoring the Aleutian-Canada goose. 
   Our Alaska Department of Fish and Game relies upon data from trappers to track remote populations, where the agency cannot afford to have biologists, through this area that is one-fifth the size of the United States. I know proponents of the amendment argue that more humane methods are available. But the trouble is the methods cost 10 times as much and will not work, and we do not have the people to pursue those methods. A $2 snare trap works much better than a $30 conibear trap that freezes in the snow. A trapper can vary the size, location, tension, bait, scent, screening, and seasonal timing of a trap to target specific animals. 
   These unfortunate concepts that have been mentioned by the Senator of the birds that have been trapped--no one seeks that. I do not believe that is a normal result of trapping, particularly in our very wild country. 
   The amendment purports to contain a subsistence exemption. I want to explain that a little bit to the Senate. In 1980, the Congress specifically allowed those who reside in the area of wildlife refuges in Alaska to use refuge lands for subsistence hunting. Most of the trappers in our States are, in fact, subsistence hunters. 
   Many Native Alaskans trap for subsistence and they generate cash income from the pelts they take. This permits trapping only for subsistence, but not for the commercial side of that operation. These people are not in trapping for recreation. They are trapping not only for the food they obtain but also for the cash they derive from the trapping activities. That cash is one of the main sources of income for people who live in the rural area of Alaska. 
   In 1980, Congress passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, which added 53 million acres, in one act of Congress, to the wildlife refuge system, the National Wildlife System, on lands within our State. Among the new Federal lands added by that act were the Innoko, Kanuti, and Koyukuk; almost 9 million acres of land, the size of New Hampshire and Connecticut together. Congress specifically recognized the furbearer resources of those refuges when it passed that act which we call ANILCA. 
   This amendment will essentially repeal the Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act concept of permitting trapping by prohibiting the harvesting of resources in a way that currently is recognized by law. In Alaska, licensed trappers earn about $7 million annually, mostly from marten, lynx, and beaver. It may not sound like a lot of money to Members of Congress, but 
   within these refuges in our State lies the most poor census district in the country; that is, the Wade Hampton District in the Yukon Delta Refuge. That stretches over 22 million acres. It's the largest refuge in the United States and the largest of the 16 refuges in Alaska. It is, I would say to my friend from New Jersey, four times the size of New Jersey. 
   The refuge contains 42 Native Alaska villages and tens of thousands of people, mostly Natives. Like many others in Alaska, most of these people rely on subsistence lifestyle, which includes commercial trapping, as I have said. 
   I have received letters from a number of villages on or near refuges, including Ruby, Mountain Village, and Quinhagak. They point out to me that trapping keeps predators in check so the other game animals on which they rely will flourish. They also point out how the only nongovernment jobs available in the winter are trapping jobs and they would rather trap and sell the fur than sit idle and collect welfare checks. As a matter of fact, we in Congress have mandated they do just that; they go to work. 
   When we passed the welfare reform we required these people to go to work. Now this amendment would outlaw the only jobs that are available for these people in this very remote area of Alaska. 
   The amendment also makes a value judgment about the way these Alaskans have lived for generations. This bothers me greatly. For decades, in many cases centuries, our Alaskan Native people have lived off the land. They have been joined by a great many non-Alaskan people, by the way. The Federal law guarantees both non-Natives as well as Natives the right to a subsistence lifestyle, and to trap within these areas if they reside in the area of the refuge. When others tell Alaskan hunters, trappers, and fishermen how to manage our resources, they are literally telling them how to live their lives.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to respect the needs of these wildlife managers and the traditional lifestyle of our Western States, as well as to respect the basic concepts of the Alaska lifestyle. 
   Let me add just a few statistics before I close. 
   Our State has 365 million acres. As I said, we are one-fifth the size of all the lands of the United States. These 16  wildlife refuges have 77 million acres. They are more than 20 percent of Alaska. More than one-fifth of our State, which is one-fifth of the Nation, has been set aside in refuge land. 
   Congress specifically recognized the need for this type of harvesting of resources in the 1980 act. We believe the impact of this amendment, if adopted, would deny our Alaskan people the protection that was assured by Congress at the time this vast acreage was set aside as wildlife refuge areas. 
   I want to quote from a book written by a friend, John McPhee. Some people may recognize John. He wrote a book, called ``Coming Into The Country,'' about Alaska. It was a book that received acclaim from all sides of issues pertaining to Alaska, those who agree with us as well as Alaskans who basically agree with John McPhee and his outlook. 
   He told a story of one woman in Alaska, and he said this:  
   Ginny looks through Alaska Magazine, where her attention is arrested by letters from the Lower 48. ``There was a time when man was justified in taking wildlife,'' she reads aloud, ``for then man's survival was at stake, but that time is long gone. .....'' She slaps the magazine down on the table. ``They don't understand,'' she says. .....''These people who write these letters are not even rational. They say we're out to kill everything. People in the Lower 48 do not understand Alaska. ..... They wonder how Alaskans get their mail, and what they do in the winter. They can't believe anything can grow here. They're amazed we can't buy any land. They think Indians are Eskimos. They know nothing about Alaska and yet they've been manipulating us for years. We thought Statehood would put an end to that. They don't understand trapping. They don't understand the harvesting of animals.''  
   That is the type of comment I get when I go home. People in Alaska constantly tell me: Those people you work with in the Congress just don't understand us. They have asked me to stand up and try to explain to the Senate what the Alaska lifestyle is. 
   That is hard for a lawyer, a person who has been here 30 years now, to continue to try to convince succeeding generations, those who have come after me, that Alaska is still that way. For the most part, Alaska is natural wilderness, and dispersed throughout that wilderness are some 700,000 people. The bulk of the people out of the cities live the Alaska lifestyle. They hunt for their food. They trap to obtain furs as well as food, but the furs give them a cash flow of income. That is supplemented by our own Alaska system of what we call a permanent fund dividend. Without the income they obtain from hunting, these people would not be able to survive. 
   In this area, hunting is done by trapping. If you take away the traps, they will go back to shooting them. This bill does not ban guns. What it would do is go back to the day before traps were recognized as a scientific management concept, and animals will be shot. For every time there is a miss, it is much worse than one being caught and having a leg broken in a trap because that animal is wandering off forever. 
   The wildlife managers have told us, if you are going to harvest these animals, the best way to do it is with these traps following the code of ethics that has been adopted by the trappers themselves, with the approval, by the way, of the wildlife managers. 
   I can tell you without any question that I have urged every Member of the Senate by a personal letter to vote no on this amendment. This is not the way to change the concept of scientific management of the lands that we have set aside as wildlife refuges. It is not the way to change basically the Alaska lifestyle. Eighty-five percent or more of its impact is in our State. We would be devastated if this concept is adopted. I urge this amendment be defeated. 
   I serve notice that I will ask for a rollcall vote on this amendment. When the time is appropriate, I will make that request.

   Mr. STEVENS. I have placed in the RECORD the statement prepared by the Fish and Wildlife Service and a letter they sent to me on July 20. In there is a statement about which I want to ask the Senator, my good friend from New Jersey, a question. It says: As background, during the period 1992 to 1996, a total of 281 refuges conducted one or more trapping programs, a total of 487 programs. Eighty-five percent of the mammal trapping programs on refuges were conducted for wildlife and facilities management reasons--85 percent.  The remaining 15 percent occurred primarily to provide recreational, commercial, subsistence opportunities to the public, as portrayed by the following table. 
   The Senator's amendment exempts all of the 85 percent. It affects only those who are not government, those who live on the land. 
   I ask the Senator, what about the 85 percent of the trapping programs using the same traps that will continue to be 
   conducted by Federal and State managers? They have the same effect as the Senator complains of concerning those that are private. Why should the Senator allow any trapping if he believes as he does? The Federal managers, State managers are not prohibited from conducting 85 percent of the trapping in the wildlife refuges. This only prohibits those of the people who live there, who reside there. Why would the Senator pick out those who earn money from trapping and say they cause more damage than the 85 percent of the trapping by Federal and State agencies?

   Mr. STEVENS. The Senator has used the statistics for all trapping on Federal wildlife refuges in order to try to eliminate those who use them for income, those who use them to pursue a lifestyle. I say to my friend, does he think that is fair? 
   The wildlife managers use these traps. The statistics the Senator has cover all the programs on all of the wildlife refuges mainly, 85 percent, conducted by managers. But the Senator presumes that the damage is done by the 15 percent. Does the Senator think it is fair to say: Let's stop these people from using these traps because they harm the animals that they trap? What about the 85 percent? They catch birds. They catch foxes that eat their legs off. They catch other animals other than the targeted species. But in terms of fairness, the Senator's amendment prohibits those who live by trapping. 
   Trapping is a management tool. I defend the 85 percent. I don't oppose it. It is a management tool. 
   I wonder if the Senator knows that trapping of species such as red fox and racoons has saved the Hawaiian coot and duck and goose. They have saved some of the indigenous species that live in these refuges from the predators they trap. 
   The predators they trap have a value. Those skins are sold for cash. I just ask the Senator, in fairness now, why should we say those people who use traps for a living do all this damage? It is not fair, in my opinion.

   Mr. STEVENS. I have the highest regard for the Secretary of the Interior as a Secretary of the Interior. I don't accept him, however, as a wildlife manager. I have put in the RECORD a letter from the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, a professional who has put over 30 years of his life into the management of wildlife refuges, and he stands by his position. The letter that I have read to you was written after the Secretary of the Interior made his statement as a political figure, and the wildlife managers stand by their position. They stand by their position that these traps are the best scientific way to manage wildlife on Federal refuges. 
   I really believe the Senator misinterprets my position. I want to make sure we understand each other. I support the use of these traps for wildlife management purposes, and I support the use of them for those who want to trap for income. But I say to my friend, in terms of the two types of traps that he would ban, those are traps that have been specifically approved by the wildlife managers. They are now opposed on a political level; I admit that. But what does the Senate want to do in terms of wildlife refuges? Manage for political purposes, or manage the system as the scientifically trained managers tell us is the best way to manage them? 
   We defend the fish and wildlife managers and the safe fish and game commissioners. I say to my good friend, I accept the fact that he is defending the political judgment of my good friend, the Secretary of the Interior. I disagree with that, and I hope the Senate does also.

   Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will yield, I say to my friend, I have this map again to show to the Senate. Isn't it 
   interesting that, however, the Senator's amendment affects 52 native villages in that one area, the Yukon Delta Refuge. The Senator says I can use the other four-fifths of the land of the United States. These people have no access at all. They are the lowest income people in the United States. The effect of the Senator's amendment would limit them, even under subsistence, to obtaining no more than $10,000. 
   I don't know if he understands that, but Federal law already limits subsistence use when it is totally for subsistence, without a commercial protection, to $10,000, in terms of barter concepts. But these people can't go to these lands that are in yellow. Those are the other lands that are not affected. The lands affected are the lands in which they live. 
   Congress, in 1980, gave them the right to continue their lifestyle in order that they might continue to live. They live on fish and game resources, and they sell both to obtain cash income, very limited amounts, on an individual basis. The total, altogether, is $7 million. But the total out there is something like 70,000 people. When you look at it, you are saying, oh, yes, you can use traps, just go to downtown Anchorage now and get one of those newfangled traps, the ones that the environmental people say are safe and humane, but you can't use the one that the scientific managers say are the most effective, not only to carry out the business of obtaining their food and their cash income, but to pursue our own objectives of limiting predators so we can protect other wildlife. 
   I have a whole list of wildlife that have been protected by these people who are subsistence hunters, who catch or trap these animals and sell the furs, but they do protect the migratory birds that come into this vast area. The areas were not set aside to protect the animals being snared. They were set aside to protect migratory waterfowl. These are not wildlife refuges to protect the red fox, or anything else. They are for migratory waterfowl. You are telling them that they cannot use these traps. As our volunteer agents, by the way, they are doing the job that it would take a thousand paid officials to do. 
   They are trapping the predators and selling their skins.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I heard this morning a brilliant statement by the Senator from Hawaii to our Alaska Federation of Natives forum being conducted now. 
   One of the things he stated I want to repeat to the Senator from New Jersey: Subsistence is not about eating. The Senator's amendment presumes subsistence means going out and obtaining food. 
   Subsistence is a way of life. Subsistence is the ability to hunt, fish, trade, or barter what they get for cash in order to live. It is more than just obtaining an animal. The Senator's amendment says one can continue to trap for subsistence and I believe he means for food. He says once they sell the pelt, they are into commercial activities. 
   Our State fish and wildlife service recognizes that trapping for subsistence is a legitimate activity. As a matter of fact, the exception in the Federal law is for subsistence hunters. They can trap in pursuing their subsistence lifestyle. 
   To think they could not then sell those animals, sell the pelts, or to put them in a position where they could only do so for wildlife management purposes--which is the effect of the Senator's amendment--offends us. The people who rely on a subsistence lifestyle hunt, fish, and trap. They consume some of the fish, they consume the animals, and they sell or use the remainder of what they catch--both mammals and fish--for their native arts and crafts. 
   They also carry out the purposes of wildlife management because they are, in fact, trapping the predators that would destroy the migratory waterfowl--the foxes that eat the eggs, the other predators that eat the birds. The area was set aside to protect the migratory waterfowl. 
   The Senator is saying they cannot use traps on these wildlife refuges that were set aside to protect migratory waterfowl because these traps catch some birds. The predators they catch considerably outnumber the impact of the traps on migratory waterfowl. The Senator says they can do it if it is for wildlife management purposes. There is no agent setting traps because these people are setting traps. In effect, they carry out the purposes of the management scheme by trapping the way the managers tell them to trap. They are using the traps that have been approved by the Federal and State system. 
   Along comes this amendment. It makes the judgment that two of those traps are inhumane and should not be used by these people. It doesn't ban the fish and wildlife managers from using them. It doesn't ban anyone from using them. It bans the 15 percent of the people who use these traps. I don't intend to support banning anyone from using them as long as the fish and wildlife managers say this is scientifically the best way to deal with both the predator  control and the objective of obtaining resources for maintaining the subsistence lifestyle of these people. 
   These 52 native villages, I think the Senator knows, can only be reached by air in the wintertime. For the most part they are on rivers. During the summertime, visitors can travel to the villages but during the winter trapping period, the only way to get to and from there is by air. Diesel costs $3 to $5 a gallon. And now the Senator would say they can't sell those pelts? They can still catch the animals and eat them but they can't sell them? 
   Those people are out there trapping simply for plain trapping purposes. That is their cash income. They are from one of the larger villages, but they have a trapline. They have a permit. They are supervised by somebody. They get approval of where they will set the traps. They get approval of the type of traps they will use. That is what the wildlife management system brought to them. They live with that. They made up the code of ethics as required by the Federal managers; they live by that. Why should the Congress of the United States tell them they cannot carry out a lifestyle that the scientific manager says is the correct way to manage those resources? 
   I think those who live in the East have the luxury of saying do something else. Go to the store and get another trap. That is not the case. Most of the traps are very old. They are maintained by our people. Many of them were made by them. The idea of saying they can continue trapping but go down to the store--there is not a Sears, Roebuck store nearby. You can't get the needed traps by mail order. 
   If you use these new traps, you can continue trapping, but you can't use the ones you have been using. 
   It is amazing; the Senator's amendment hits about 95 percent of the traps that are in use today on the wildlife refuges. Does the Senator know that? 
   I say to my friend, I could not oppose this more, not only on the basis of being the Senator from Alaska but on the basis of scientific management. As much respect as I have for the Secretary of the Interior--I was assistant to the Secretary of the Interior and the solicitor general counsel to the Interior Department in the Eisenhower administration, but in my day we relied upon scientific managers and did not reverse them for political purposes. That, I think, is what the Senator is defending, which I oppose.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Conference Report of the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 contains tow amendments I authored to extend the same tax benefits that farmers have to fishermen. The original version of the Taxpayers Refund Act of 1999 included provisions to create farm and ranch risk management (FARRM) accounts to help farmers and ranchers through down times and to coordinate income averaging with the alternative minimum tax. The FARRM accounts would be used to let farmers and ranchers set aside up to 20 percent of their income on a tax deferred basis. The money could be held for up to five years, then it would have to be withdrawn and taxed at that time. Interest would be taxed in the year that it is earned. 
   Encouraging farmers and ranchers to set some money aside for downturns in  their markets makes sense. However, I felt this provision should have been expanded to include fishermen and I offered an amendment that would do just that. 
   I also authored an amendment to expand income averaging to include fishermen and to coordinate averaged income with the AMT I am proud to say that both measures had broad bi-partisan support, and I want to thank those who cosponsored my amendments. 
   Allowing fishermen to elect income averaging and coordinating that election with the AMT is important to the overall issue of tax fairness under the tax code. Under my amendment, a fishermen electing to average his or her income would owe AMT only to the extent he or she would have owed alternative minimum tax had averaging not been elected. 
   In previous years Congress has responded to fishing disasters with Federal assistance under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. We do the same for farmers when crop disasters occur. Allowing fishermen, like farmers, to establish risk management accounts, is a responsible way to let them help themselves and preserve the proud self-reliance that marks their industry. 
   Fishermen are the farmers of the sea. Fishermen and farmers share seasonal cyclical harvest levels and fishermen should not be left behind in the tax code because of this. While these amendments are modest steps toward equal treatment for our fishermen, they are an important part of ensuring the long-term sustainability of our fishing industry. 
   In addition to the provisions in this bill for America's fishermen, I, along with my colleague, Senator MURKOWSKI, included a measure to allow Eskimo whaling captains to deduct up to $7,500 dollars of their expenses incurred during whaling hunts. This provision allows whaling captains to continue the tradition of sharing whale meat with Alaska villages. 
   It is the custom that the captain of a whale hunt make all 
   provisions for the meals, wages and equipment costs associated with the hunt. In return, the captain is repaid in whale meat and muktuk, a consumable part of a whale. The captain is then required, by tradition, to donate a substantial portion of the whale to his village. This provision will allow the captains to deduct for the costs involved since they do not recoup the actual costs from their share of the whale meat. This provision is important to the heritage and traditions of the Alaskan Eskimos, and I am pleased that it was included in this bill. 
   This tax refund plan is just that--a tax refund for every tax paying American. Every American would see a reduction in their Federal income taxes in the form of a refund. When you are overcharged for an item in a store, you march back in and demand the difference between the actual price and the amount you were charged. The American taxpayers cannot march up the front steps of the Treasury demanding a refund of their overpayments to Uncle Sam. We in Congress must do that for them. 
   Some would not like to see this measure pass because they feel it does not reduce our national debt. However, this bill contains provisions to ensure that the goal of debt reduction is met. The debt triggers included in this package would halt any future refund measures under this bill until our debt reduction goals are achieved. This is a good balance because it allows us to send money back to the American people while reducing our debt load. Under this bill, one cannot happen without the other. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this meausre and I thank the leadership of chairman ROTH and the members of the Finance Committee in organizing and authoring this sweeping tax refund bill.

   Mr. STEVENS. As the Senator from Washington is aware, the National Park Service is responsible for the management of much of the land along the Georgetown waterfront in the District of Columbia. As a regular visitor to this area, I have been disappointed with the condition and appearance of much of the land under the management of the National Park Service, particularly the area surrounding Thompson's boathouse, the boathouse itself, and the nearby lands that are  currently used for boat storage. These lands are adjacent to the confluence of Rock Creek and Potomac River, making their care and maintenance critical to the protection of the watershed. 
   I understand that upkeep and maintenance of the boathouse is the responsibility of the concessioner that manages the boathouse. Does the Chairman of the Subcommittee feel that it would be appropriate for the National Park Service to review the concession contract for the boathouse, and the performance of the concessioner under that contract, to determine whether the concessioner should be compelled to make a greater effort to maintain and rehabilitate the boathouse and appurtenant lands?

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to make a brief statement concerning my amendment to the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture Appropriations bill regarding the Women, Infants, and Children nutrition program. My reading of the regulations implementing this program indicate that they provide women and their children with a very limited range of food options. For example, the only non-dried vegetable they may chose from is carrots. They may eat canned carrots, raw carrots, and frozen carrots, but no other non-dried vegetable is permitted. Likewise the only meat or fish they allow is tuna. Salmon, the most heart-healthy protein source available, is essentially banned along with beef, poultry, pork, and other protein sources. 
   My amendment directs the Secretary to review the WIC food packages currently available to pregnant and lactating women and their children and consider adding new, but nutritious foods to the list. It is ridiculous to expect children to eat foods from such a limited list. Anyone with a picky toddler knows that a varied diet is critical to developing healthy eating habits. 
   Several years ago there was a controversy concerning Congress deciding which foods should be included in the WIC package, substituting its judgment for that of nutrition experts at USDA. This amendment does not mandate that salmon or any other food be included on the list. It gives complete and full discretion to the Secretary to determine which foods should be included. It simply directs him to periodically update the list. 
   I have worked for years with Dr. William Castelli at the Framington Heart Study in Massachusetts and know firsthand the health benefits of salmon. The omega 3 oils within salmon actually reduce cholesterol levels, I eat salmon at least twice a week. I am confident that salmon will meet any standard that USDA applies without any additional help from me. When the nutrition experts see what a wonderful protein source salmon is, they will wonder why they didn't put it on the list in the first place.

The first rollcall vote today will occur at 5:30 p.m. on passage of the sweepstakes legislation. At 3 p.m. today, the Senate will resume consideration of the Agriculture appropriations bill. It is hoped that Senators who have amendments will work with the bill managers to schedule time to debate those amendments. Additional votes beyond the 5:30 vote could occur relative to the Agriculture appropriations bill. It is the intention of the majority leader to complete action on as many appropriations bills as possible before the August recess. Therefore, Senators should be prepared to vote into the evenings throughout this whole week.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, my amendment mirrors a bill I introduced on an earlier occasion-S. 1410. 
   This amendment would equate the tax treatment of persons flying what would otherwise be empty seats on private noncommercial aircraft with the treatment of airline employees flying on space available basis on regularly scheduled flights. Currently, use of these empty seats is deemed taxable personal income to the employee. I refer to it as the empty-seat tax. In contrast, under current law, airline employees, retirees and their parents and children can fly tax-free on scheduled commercial flights for nonbusiness reasons. Military personnel and their families can hop military flights for nonbusiness reasons without the imposition of tax. Current and former employees of airborne freight or cargo haulers, together with their parents and children, can fly tax-free for nonbusiness reasons on seats that would have otherwise been empty. 
   Employers who own or lease these aircraft are compelled by IRS regulations to consider 13 separate factors or  steps in determining the incidence and amount of tax to be imposed on their employees. My proposal seeks to deal with this inequity by treating all passengers the same way, but includes a provision which retains a reasonable standard of proof at audit to prevent abuse. 
   This amendment would not allow an executive to use a company jet to fly with his family and friends on vacation. My amendment would require proof to be shown that the flight was made in the ordinary course of business, the flight would have been made whether or not the person was transported on the flight, and no substantial additional cost was incurred in providing the transportation for the passenger. 
   In addition to the facilitation of employee travel, this provision is an especially important issue to large States with smaller populations because air travel comprises such a large part of our transportation systems. Instead of driving a car from city to city, many people from rural areas get on a plane to travel within their States. There are no roads from Barrow to Nome or Anchorage to Cold Bay. Additionally, in the event of illness, many people in rural States must take an empty seat on a company owned airplane and incur a tax penalty because they need medical treatment that can only be found in larger cities. My amendment includes a provision to allow passengers to be treated as employees if they live in remote areas that are not connected to a road system. For cases of medical emergency or other time sensitive situations, a passenger could as if they were an employee of the operator of the non-commercial aircraft without being taxes on the value of the seat. 
   This is a modest proposal with small revenue impacts. The joint Committee on Taxation estimates the revenue impact for this provision would be approximately five million dollars per year over the next ten year period. While this is a small amount against the backdrop of the overall tax cut measure we are considering, it is a large amount to the people who are forced to pay the tax simply because they do not work for or are not related to an employee of an airline, the military, a cargo freight company, or because they live in remote areas without road access. Flights are often, at best, biweekly to some rural villages in my State and during the long periods when no flights are scheduled, transportation out of these remote areas in emergency situations requires chartering an aircraft. 
   We should keep in mind that we are currently debating a tax refund bill that seeks to level the playing field for the American taxpayers. The tax refund bill would remove the marriage penalty that discriminate against married couples. It addresses inequities in pension plans that discriminate against certain workers. Yet, the Tax Refund Act does not address the tax discrimination against the users of empty seats who live or do business in rural areas. 
   It is my hope that we can address this basic issue of tax fairness and complexity by eliminating the empty seat tax.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the proposed Taxpayers Refund Act of 1999 includes a provision to create farm and ranch risk management (FARRM) accounts to help farmers and ranchers through down times. The estimated cost for this provision is $887 million over the next ten years. The FARRM accounts would be used to let farmers and ranchers set aside up to 20 percent of their income on a tax deferred basis. The money could be held for up to five years, then it would have to be withdrawn from the individual's account. Once the money is withdrawn from the account, the farmers and ranchers would pay tax on the amount that was originally deferred. Any interest earned on the money in the account would be taxed in the year that it was earned. 
   This approach to encouraging farmers and ranchers to set some money aside for downturns in the market makes sense. However, this provision should be expanded to include fishermen--I have an amendment that would do just that. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates allowing fishermen to set aside 20 percent of their income into these tax deferred accounts would cost only an additional $18 million over 10 years. 
   Fishermen are the farmers of the sea. They face the same type of economic problems that farmers and ranchers face and they shouldn't be excluded from establishing their own tax deferred accounts. In previous years we have had to bail out fishing areas that have been hit hard by fishery failures. A recent fishery failure in Alaska, and the impact of that failure on families and communities, is still being felt today. We were forced to allocate $50 million to bail out those fishermen and the local communities. This amendment, at a cost of $18 million over ten years, is a far-sighted way to let fishermen play a part in a disaster recovery and preserve the proud self-reliance that marks their industry. 
   Fishermen should receive the same benefits as farmers and ranchers under the Tax Code. They share seasonal cyclical harvest levels and should not be left behind in the Tax Code. While this amendment is one step toward equal treatment, it is an important part of ensuring the long-term sustainability of our fishing industry. I thank my colleagues who have joined me on this amendment, Senators MURKOWSKI, INOUYE, SHELBY, BREAUX, HOLLINGS, GORTON, and MURRAY.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the proposed Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 contains a provision to coordinate a farmer's income averaging with the alternative minimum tax (AMT). This would ensure that a farmer's AMT is not increased solely because he or she elects income averaging. 
   Under section 604 of the Finance Committee's bill, a farmer electing to average his or her farm income would owe AMT only to the extent he or she would have owned alternative minimum tax had averaging not been elected. I have offered an amendment that would extend the income averaging to fishermen and would coordinate the tax treatment with the AMT, just as the bill attempts to do for farmers. 
   Fishermen should receive the same treatment as farmers. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the measure for farmers would cost $22 million over the next ten years. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, my amendment for fishermen would cost $5 million over the next ten years. This is a small amount to ensure that fishermen receive the same benefits as farmers under our current tax structure. 
   Fishermen face the same type of economic ups and downs that farmers and ranchers face. Because of this, they shouldn't be excluded from income averaging or coordination with the AMT. I thank my colleagues who have joined me on this amendment, Senators MURKOWSKI, INOUYE, SHELBY, BREAUX, HOLLINGS, GORTON, and MURRAY.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I find myself in a strange position because I was Solicitor of the Interior Department. At the time, I followed the law and I interpreted the law; I did not make law. The BLM manual, in case you are interested, says specifically:  
   A mill site cannot exceed 5 acres in size. There is no limit to the number of mill sites that can be held by a single claimant.  
   Now, that is a regulation made pursuant to the law that was in existence at the time the Solicitor rendered his opinion. He ignored that. But the main thing is, I am hearing things on the floor that amaze me. The Senator from Illinois says that, apparently, the environmental laws don't apply to mining claims. Why is it, then, that there is a requirement for mill sites? The mill sites are there primarily for the purpose of the tailings disposal of the ponds that must be built to provide protection under the Clean Water Act. Many of them are enormous in size and require several mill sites in order to have one disposal site. Those environmental laws are there to protect 
   the public lands. But the Solicitor's opinion says you can only have up to 5 acres, which is the Catch-22. This opinion was not intended to validate the mining law. It was made to invalidate the mining law of 1872. 
   In my State--and, after all, my State has primarily half of the Federal lands in the United States--the mining law is working. Our State has a small mining law that is compatible in terms of requiring claims to be pursued by production of minerals to take actions to protect the lands. In Alaska, it is our fourth largest industry. The Greens Creek Mine has twice as many mill sites as does active claims under a plan filed with and approved by the Federal Government. As a matter of fact, it is mandated by the Federal Government that such lands be used for specific environmental purposes to protect the lands that are being mined and protect the waters, in particular. The Clean Water Act applies. 
   I am appalled--and I wish my friend from Massachusetts had stayed here--at his comments. I would like to take you to Alaska. Come up to Alaska and I will show you mining claims, and I will show you the extent to which we require them to comply with the environmental laws. As a matter of fact, we have enormous mining claims. The Kensington, Donlin Creek--they would never get off the ground if this amendment were passed. 
   Currently, there are 235 jobs on one mine alone. This is going to put thousands of people out of work in my State. The fourth largest industry will go out of existence if this passes, because you cannot mine in Alaska with just 5 acres to comply with the mining laws and the environmental laws. 
   The other thing is, I want to make sure you understand mill sites cannot be on mineral land. Under the law, they cannot be on mineral land. They are lands that are located somewhere in connection with the mining activities, and they have mining operations on them. So most of this entirely misses me. I don't understand what is going on. As a matter of fact, we have had fights over mining claims for years. My good friend from Arkansas is not with us anymore, but we had fights over mining claims. This is the first time people have attacked mill sites. The amendment of the Senator from Washington attacks mill sites under the Solicitor's opinion--a misguided opinion at that--with regard to the number of mill sites. The Forest Service manual states:  
   The number of mill sites that may legally be located is based specifically on the need for mining and milling purposes irrespective of the types or number of mining claims involved.  
   That has been a regulation issued by the Forest Service pursuant to the mining law, and it has been valid for years. Suddenly, the Solicitor's opinion says all that is nonsense; you can only have one mill site per mining claim. I am at a loss to understand why all of this rhetoric is coming at us with regard to the sins of the past. 
   Why don't we talk about the tremendous destruction in the East? Why is this all about the West? As a matter of fact, as the companies from the East moved into the West, they laid the West to waste, and that is what led to the environmental laws that we have and live by. We abide by them, particularly the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the basic Environmental Protection Act. 
   Every one of these mining claims must have a mining plan approved by the agency that is managing the Federal lands for the Federal Government. Those agencies approved those plans. To suddenly come in and to say there is something wrong about this, I don't understand the Senators from the East, nor do I understand the Senator from the West, raising this kind of an objection to the lands that are necessary for environmental purposes. If this mining claims decision is upheld, that decision made by the Solicitor, every mine in my State must close. Every mine must close. That is nonsense. 
   Senator MURRAY's amendment merely states that the Solicitor is not going to make law. If you want to bring the law in and change the law of 1872, bring in the bill. We will debate it, as we did Senator Bumpers' bills. But don't come in and try to validate a Solicitor's opinion which is erroneous, and it is not good law.

   Mr. STEVENS. The situation is complicated by the diverse ad varied social and political institutions set up in localities and at the regional level. Alaska Natives by traditional or necessity have chosen to organize in various ways to address different circumstances. Often federal agencies chose among these groups and are satisfied that they have covered their bases with Alaska Natives. I urge the Census to take a hard look at the expertise and advice of all Native entities, including Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act corporations which by virtue of their day-to-day business responsibilities and duties to shareholders also have a vigorous pool of human resources to assist in public education and input.

   Mr. STEVENS. The State of Alaska can do its part. For example, the State could set up an Alaska advisory committee on the Census. This committee could include representatives of rural area, urban areas, Alaska Natives, the military, and municipal and state government. 
   But I hope Census officials understand that certain agency decisions already being pursued need to be reviewed right now before an advisory committee can be organized. For example, sub-regional hubs like Dillingham are subject only to an update, not a full enumeration under the 2000 Census. Also, reportedly, there are no focus groups for the many and varied Alaska Native voices to be heard; and it is my understanding that groups classified by the federal government as minorities have been provided this opportunity in other states. I urge the Census to develop a public education campaign that will communicate to rural and urban residents the importance of being counted.

   Mr. STEVENS. A specific issue that should be addressed in some manner is the highly mobile urban-rural population of Alaska Natives. We see many families coming to Anchorage on a periodic or seasonal basis, sharing common quarters in the city but considering themselves rural residents. Likewise, commercial fishermen will split the year between two or more residences within the state, and do some subsistence fishing at a traditional fish camp for some part of the year near the village of their birth. The proper enumeration of Alaska Natives would benefit from an effort to reconcile these migration patterns with the fixed residency standards used in a number of federal programs and formulas.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill to equate the tax treatment of persons occupying what would otherwise be empty seats on private aircraft with the treatment of airline employees flying on a space available basis on regularly scheduled flights. Right now, use of these empty seats is deemed taxable personal income to the employee. I refer to it as the ``empty-seat tax.'' Filling these empty seats--the way airlines do--can be likened to personnel taking offsets on freight flights, and empty seat passengers on auto, trucks, taxis or limousines that are being driven for business. 
   Under current law, airline employees and retirees and their parents and children can fly tax-free on scheduled commercial flights for nonbusiness reasons. Military personnel and their families can hop military flights for nonbusiness reasons without the imposition of tax. Current and former employees of airborne freight or cargo haulers, together with their parents and children, can fly tax-free for nonbusiness reasons on seats that would have otherwise been empty. 
   In addition, no tax is imposed on passengers accompanying employees traveling on business via auto or other nonaircraft transportation. For example, a trucker can take his wife on a haul without facing the imposition of a tax for the seat that she occupies. Yet tax is frequently imposed on employees or ``deemed'' employees flying for nonbusiness reasons when they occupy what would otherwise be unused seats on business flights of noncommercial aircraft. Employers who own or lease these aircraft are compelled by IRS regulations to consider 13 separate 
   factors or steps in determining the incidence and amount of tax to be imposed on their employees. My proposal seeks to deal with this inequity by treating all passengers the same way. 
   Under this provision, the employer would have to demonstrate to the IRS on audit that the flight would have been made in the ordinary course of the employer's business whether or not the person was on the flight. The employer would also have to show that the presence of the person did not cause the employer to incur additional costs for the flight. Personal use of a plane, such as when an executive files with his or her family or guests to a vacation home, would remain fully taxable, just as under current law. 
   In 1984, the Joint Committee on Taxation concluded that it was ``unacceptable'' to continue ``conditions'' under which ``taxpayers in identical or comparable situations have been treated differently'' because of the ``inequities, confusion and administrative difficulties for business, employees and the internal revenue service resulting from this situation.'' The Joint Committee on Taxation was right then, and the comment continues to be accurate 15 years later. 
   This is not just about creating equity for all passengers. It also goes to our ultimate goal of simplifying the Tax  Code for all Americans. Upon passage of this provision, a separate category of taxpayer will be eliminated and employees and employers will be able to better assess the tax implications of travel on aircraft. 
   This is an especially important issue to large States with smaller populations because air travel comprises such a large part of our transportation systems. Instead of getting on a plane to travel across country, many people from rural areas get on a plane to travel within the State. 
   This is also a health care issue. Many people in rural States like mine must take an empty seat on a company-owned airplane because they get sick and need medical treatment that can only be found in larger cities. In the contiguous States, someone can call an ambulance to take a car or bus to a larger metropolitan area to receive medical treatment. There are no buses from Barrow to Fairbanks or Cold Bay to Anchorage. The current Tax Code overlooks this fact of life and my provision will take this into account. We must begin to treat all passengers fairly, regardless of how they get to their final destination.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I introduce the Fish Oil Heat Act of 1999. This act would provide a tax credit for fishing operations who choose to burn waste fish oil rather than diesel fuel. Fishing operations would earn a tax credit for each Btu of heat produced by this alternative fuel source. This measure is similar to others that are before the Senate in that it encourages businesses to use alternative energy sources at hand rather than relying solely on fossil fuels. 
   This bill would amend section 45 of the Tax Code to include fish oil as a qualified energy producing resource. Fishing operations, whether on shore or at sea are able to use fish oil to keep their working areas warm and to process the fish they harvest. My legislation would expand the current Tax Code to provide an incentive to use alternative energy sources by including heat generated by waste fish oil under section 45. As it stands now, the Tax Code allows tax credits for electricity produced by wind or through a closed loop biomass system. Fishing operations are often isolated from energy grids and they do not rely on the organic biomass systems for energy, so they cannot take advantage of the electricity producing tax credit. 
   Several Senators have introduced bills to expand the current Tax Code to allow for new energy producing tax credits from alternative resources. However, the tax credits are limited to a single form of energy--electricity. My bill would take into account a different form of energy--heat. This provision would give the same amount of tax credit for a single Btu of heat produced as the current Tax Code allows for a kilowatt hour of electricity produced. This will create equity within the tax system and across industry lines. 
   Fishing operations in my State are often isolated and rely on the resources they have at hand. Unlike many of the industries in the contiguous United States, fishing operations in Alaska can't connect to area wide power grids. They rely on fossil fuels to run generators for heat and electricity. The fuel must be transported to the operation, often by barge or small boat. This bill would encourage these isolated fishing operations to collect and use the waste fish oil that they generate to keep their business warm. This would cut down on the amount of fossil fuel being transported to these distant locations, thus reducing the chances of fuel spills. Additionally, by encouraging the fishing operations to burn the waste oil they generate, we can reduce the amount of fish oil going to waste.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Natural Disaster Protection and Insurance Act of 1999. This bill will provide the Nation with a way of dealing with major national disasters. As many of my colleagues are aware I have maintained an interest in this area for some time. Over the last decade we have witnessed natural disasters and the devastating effect that they can have on our property, economy and quality of life. 
   Damages from Hurricane Andrew resulted in the insolvency of insurance companies and a lack of confidence within the industry to deal with similar catastrophes in the future. Major hurricane risk is increasing. Some scientists predict that the next decade will bring more favorable conditions for a major hurricane hitting the U.S. than existed in the period leading up the Hurricane Andrew. 
   Over half of the population of the United States resides within the coastal zone (approximately 300 km centered at the coastline). Infrastructure and population along our coast is growing rapidly and so our vulnerability to hurricanes is increasing dramatically. 
   My Home State of Alaska has had at least nine major earthquakes of 7.4 magnitude or more on the Richter scale. Alaska's 1964 Good Friday Earthquake was one of the world's most powerful, registering, a magnitude of 9.2 on the Richter scale. 
   The Alaska quake of 1964 destroyed the economic basis of entire communities. Whole fishing fleets, harbors,  and canneries were lost. The shaking caused tidal waves. Petroleum storage tanks ruptured and the contents caught fire. Burning oil ran into the bay and was carried to the waterfront by large waves. These waves of fire destroyed docks, piers, and small-boat harbors. Total property damage was $311 million in 1964 dollars. Experts predict that a quake this size in the lower 48 would kill thousands and cost up to $200 billion. 
   According to Michael J. Armstrong, associate director, mitigation directorate of the Federal Emergency Management Agency:  
   Earthquakes represent the largest single potential for casualties and damage from a natural hazard facing this country. They represent a national threat, as all but seven States in the U.S. are at some level of risk. 
   In our most recent earthquake disaster, Northridge, (CA), a moderate earthquake centered on the fringe of a major metropolitan area caused an estimated $40 billion in damage. A large magnitude earthquake located under one of several urban regions in the United States could cause thousands of casualties and losses approaching $200 billion. 
   Accordingly, reducing earthquake losses is a matter of national concern--recent findings show a significantly increased potential for damaging earthquake in southern California, and in northern California on the Hayward Fault. Studies also show higher potential earthquakes for the Pacific Northwest and Coastal South Carolina. This is in addition to areas of earthquake risk that have already been identified, such as the New Madrid Fault Zone in the Central U.S. and Wasatch Front in Utah.  
   Before 1989, the United States had never experienced a disaster costing more than $1 billion in insured losses. Since then, we have had nine disasters that have cost more than $1 billion. 
   Today, Senators INOUYE, LOTT, BOB GRAHAM, FEINSTEIN, AKAKA, and I introduce this bill to reduce the cost to the Federal Government of earthquakes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters. 
   First, the bill will reduce Federal costs by expanding the use and availability of private insurance. 
   Second, the bill will provide incentives to improve State disaster strategic planning. 
   And, third, the bill will create a national, privately funded catastrophic insurance pool to shoulder the risk of very large disasters. 
   Mr. President, the more private insurance individuals buy, the less disaster relief Federal taxpayers must pay. For instance, if this bill had been in place before Hurricane Andrew and California's Northridge Earthquake, I am advised that it could have reduced Federal costs by at least $5 billion. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me and the cosponsors in supporting this bill. Because major natural catastrophes are increasingly common and costly for U.S. citizens, we must be willing to make a commitment now to prepare for these future events in advance.

    Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on the occasion of his 80th birthday this coming 4th of July, I would like to join my Alaskan colleague in the other body in extending warm birthday wishes to Captain Curtis J. Zane, United States Navy Retired. ``Casey'' Zane, as he is affectionately known, is one of that generation of American heroes who rose to defend our nation and our freedom during the darkest days of WWII. He saw action over a wide area of the South Pacific during 1942, 1943 and 1944 including service with the fabled ``Black Cat'' PBY squadron 101. To this day he remembers dear friends who died in that conflict. In mid 1944 through the war's end Casey instructed young pilots in B-24s at Hutchinson Kansas. 
   The balance of his 27 year career in Naval Aviation spanned the early years of the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the transition to the Nuclear Navy. During that time Casey Zane served in the Guam, Tinian and Saipan areas of the post war Pacific. Later he was aboard ships of the fleet including the carrier USS Leyte and then took Command of anti-submarine warfare squadron VP 18. He served at the Command Post CinCLantFleet and as Commanding Officer U.S. Naval Communications Stations, Londonderry Northern Ireland and Thurso Scotland. He did his last tour at the Pentagon in Navy's Bureau of Personnel and retired as a Captain in November 1968. 
   Among the several types of special schooling and training he received, Casey is a graduate of the Army's Command & General Staff College and the Naval War College. He holds the American Defense Service Medal; American Campaign Medal; Air Medal; Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (3 Stars); World War II Victory Medal; National Defense Service Medal (1 Star). 
   After the Navy, Casey and his wife Dorothy started their second careers becoming successful real estate brokers and agents in the Northern Virginia area. Despite his tender age of 80, Casey continues to be an active and productive member of our society. He is a model for those who believe in being ``forever young,'' both in spirit and enthusiasm for living. I wish to extend a hearty ``many happy returns'' to a great American Veteran, Captain Curtis J. ``Casey'' Zane on his upcoming 80th birthday, July 4, 1999. Mr. President, as this Century closes it is indeed fitting that the advent of a National World War II Memorial is close at hand. As our numbers fade slowly and inexorably from our midst, perhaps the best birthday present we can give WWII Veterans like Casey Zane is the knowledge that our nation will never forget their sacrifice.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I introduce, along with Senators LOTT, HOLLINGS, and DORGAN, a bill to ensure that the Federal Government stands behind its pledge to foster true competition in the provision of local telecommunications services. 
   While competition in the local telecommunications sector is growing, new  entrants using terrestrial fixed wireless or satellite services lack of the significant advantages of incumbent local exchange carriers when it comes to gaining access to many buildings. This is particularly true when it comes to access to rooftops and to the internal risers and conduits linking the rooftop to the basement, where the access point to the internal phone wiring is usually located. 
   In some instances these wireless local carriers are welcomed by building owners and landlords with open arms; however, more often than not they meet resistance, are rejected, or just plain ignored. I believe the Federal Government should do more to ensure a level playing field for these new entrants to compete on. 
   Our bill is designed to spur competition and to hopefully save taxpayer dollars. We focus in this legislation only upon buildings owned by the Federal Government or where the Federal Government is a lessee. 
   The inspiration of this bill comes from States which have moved to encourage access by competitors. Connecticut and Texas have both enacted measures to promote nondiscriminatory access by telecommunications carriers to rooftops, risers, conduits, utility spaces, and points of entry and demarcation in order to promote the competitive provision of telecommunications and information services. 
   This bill takes a similar approach to that enacted by the States, and requires that nondiscriminatory access be provided to all telecommunications carriers seeking to provide service to federally-owned buildings and buildings in which Federal agencies are tenants. The National Telecommunications and Information 
   Administration of the Department of Commerce, the NTIA, which is the Agency that coordinates telecommunications policy for Federal agencies, is tasked with implementing this requirement. 
   Building owners can easily meet the requirements of this bill. They can either certify that they are already bound to provide nondiscriminatory access under State law or they can commit in writing that they will provide such access as a matter of contract. 
   This bill does not mandate that every building must use the services of these new competitors. What it does say is that the Federal Government should lead by example. 
   This bill does not mandate a takings. Owners and operators can charge a nondiscriminatory fee for the rooftop and conduit space these technologies use to provide local service--which I am encouraged to say is quite small. 
   Owners and operators may impose reasonable requirements to protect the safety of the tenants and the condition of the property. 
   Any damage caused as a result of installing these services will be borne by the telecommunications carrier. 
   The carriers must pay for the entire cost of installing, operating, maintaining, and removing any facilities they provide. 
   The bill will not adversely impact the ability of Federal agencies to obtain office space. Federal agency heads may waive the requirements of this bill if enforcement of the bill would result in the agency being unable to obtain suitable space in a geographic area. 
   The President may also waive the nondiscriminatory access provisions for any building if they are determined to be contrary to the interests of national security. 
   I look forward to working with NTIA, the General Services Administration, and private building owners who have a leasing relationship with the Federal Government to carry out the purpose of this bill. 
   My goal is to ensure that the Federal Government sets a good example. I hope it will become the standard in the private sector. Businesses should demand that building owners provide every opportunity for competitive choice in telecommunications providers. 
   Access to Federal buildings or a building that is housing Federal workers should be encouraged. This bill is a further step in implementing the promise of the Telecommunications Act which Congress enacted. 
   It will help ensure that telecommunications providers can compete fairly on the basis of the cost and quality of the services provided.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I take the Senate back to the time we were in conference. We were in conference a long time on the supplemental appropriations bill with concerns about Kosovo and other vital areas of our national defense policy. 
   In conference on that bill, we worked late into the night on a series of matters. We had a vote on the Byrd and Domenici amendments. As a matter of fact, the House voted to accept the Byrd version of that loan guarantee program and rejected the version from Senator DOMENICI. 
   The Senate had not voted at that time. I conferred with Senate conferees and we told the House we insisted on our amendments. The House came back and voted again. At that time, it rejected both amendments. We were stalemated. 
   We went into the night the next night and through the day. It was about 9:30, 10 o'clock and I asked Senator BYRD if he would consider a suggestion I had. We had a second supplemental in our committee, and we had not conferred on that. It was a bill that was passed by the House and is a viable bill to send back to the House as another supplemental appropriations bill. I asked Senator BYRD if he would consent to take his amendment off of the bill that was pending in conference. I assured him that when we reconvened after the recess I would move the committee to put the steel loan guarantee on that bill and report it to the Senate. I made the same request to Senator DOMENICI. Both of them agreed. 
   We then conferred with the leadership of both the House and Senate. At that time, it was clear that if this proposal of having these two loan guarantee programs on the supplemental and sending it back to the House had any other amendment it would not be sent to conference in the House. 
   I remember well Senator BYRD asked me at that time: What are you going to do if the bill gets to the floor and this amendment is offered that would not be germane to either of these two loan guarantee programs, which under the circumstance would lead to the bill not being sent to conference in the House, by the House? 
   I said: Senator, as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I will personally move to table any amendment that is not germane to the bill if it is reported by our committee. 
   We are at this position now. We have adopted the germane amendments. I congratulate all concerned for working that out. I was constrained to move to table the amendment of the Senator from Arizona. I thank the Senate for tabling that amendment. 
   The last amendment is the amendment of my colleague that I cosponsored when the bill was before the Senate before. I say to the Senate, in all sincerity, the word of a Senator has to be kept, no matter what the price. I know I will read in my papers in Anchorage and throughout Alaska tomorrow about this, which will be deemed a feud between me and my colleague. It is not a feud. I have a responsibility to keep my word. 
   As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I move to table the Murkowski amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I join Senator MURKOWSKI in introducing a measure that will fix a problem with the pension limits in section 415 of the tax code as they relate to multiemployer pension plans. 
   This is a problem I have been trying to fix for years, and I hope we can resolve this issue during this Congress. 
   Section 415, as it currently stands, deprives workers of the pensions they deserve. 
   In 1996, Congress addressed part of the problem by relieving public employees from the limits of section 415. 
   It is only proper that Congress does the same for private workers covered by multiemployer plans. 
   Section 415 negatively impacts workers who have various employers. 
   Currently, the pension level is set at the employee's highest consecutive 3-year average salary. 
   With fluctuations in industry, sometimes employees have up and down years rather than steady increases in their wages. 
   This can skew the 3-year salary average for the employee, resulting in a lower pension when the worker retires. 
   I would like to offer an example of section 415's impact to illustrate how unfairly the current law treats workers in multiemployer plans. 
   Assume we are talking about a worker employed for 15 years by a local union and her highest annual salary was $15,600. 
   The worker retires and applies for pension benefits from the two plans by which she was covered by virtue of her previous employment. 
   The worker had earned a monthly benefit of $1,000 from one plan and a monthly benefit of $474 from the second plan for a total monthly income of $1,474, or $17,688 per year. 
   The worker looked forward to receiving this full amount throughout her retirement. 
   However, the benefits had to be reduced by $202 per month, or about $2,400 per year to match her highest annual salary of $15,600. 
   The so-called ``compensation based limit'' of section 415 of the Tax Code did not take into account disparate benefits, but intended only to address workers with a single employer likely to receive steady increases in salary. 
   Currently section 415 limits a worker's pension to an equal amount of the worker's average salary for the three consecutive years when the worker's salary was the highest. 
   Instead of receiving the $17,688 per year pension that the worker had earned under the pension plans' rules, the worker can receive only $15,253 per year. 
   If the worker were a public employee covered by a public plan, her pension would not be cut. 
   This is because public pension plans are not restricted by the compensation-based limit language of section 415. 
   This robs employees of the money they have earned simply because they were not a public employee. 
   We are always looking for ways to encourage people to save for retirement and we try to educate people of the fact that relying on Social Security alone will not be enough. 
   Yet we penalize many private sector employees in multiemployer plans by arbitrarily limiting the amount of pension benefits they can receive. 
   It is wrong, and it should be fixed. 
   In addition, by changing the law to allow workers to receive the full pension benefits they are entitled to, we will see more money flowing to the treasury. 
   This is because greater pensions to retirees means greater retirement income, much of which is subject to taxes. 
   I urge my colleagues to support us in fixing this problem once and for all and I thank Senator MURKOWSKI for working with me on this issue.

   Mr. STEVENS. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. 
   Mr. President, I am humbled and honored by the statements of our two leaders in the Senate. It is true I have a deep reverence for this body. When I was in the Eisenhower administration, I sat up in the gallery many nights during the period when the Senate was considering Alaska's statehood. I gained the reverence that I have for the body now from those experiences. 
   It is truly an honor to serve in this body. Some people, I guess, have taken it a little bit for granted. I still pinch myself every once in a while to make sure I am allowed the opportunity to be present in this body, to be a U.S. Senator. 
   I value the friendships I have had on both sides of the aisle more deeply than I can say. 
   I am very proud to say for other reasons many members of my family are here in the gallery tonight. Our daughter, Lily, graduates from high school tomorrow. Tonight the National Guard has flown my grandson, John Covich, into Washington to give me an award from the USO and the National Guard. So this is a double celebration for me. 
   Just having the privilege to still be alive and be part of this body is more than anyone can know after the accident that I had years ago and the feeling I had about life then turned around. It turned around primarily because of the friendship and the helping hand I got from every Member of the Senate who was here then, and I continue to value the friendship of every one of you tonight. Thank you very much.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will take a couple of minutes. 
   I was pleased to offer this amendment for my good friend from Iowa, Senator GRASSLEY. Senator GRASSLEY's determined effort to improve the Department of Defense financial accounting standards, by demanding that funds disbursed are matched by funds obligated--simply meaning that they balance their checkbook and they let us know so the taxpayers will know what the checks have been written for--his efforts has already yielded results in lowering the Department's unmatched disbursements. 
   To those who may be unfamiliar with this problem, as of the fiscal year 1998, according to the Department's own inspector general, the Department reported a substantial problem with disbursements. That means that funds were reported having been disbursed to the Treasury but not processed, or, in other cases, the Department's employees could not match a disbursement to an obligated item. 
   There is a conflict here. We are trying to make certain those who provide services to the Department of Defense are promptly paid. On the other hand, there is a requirement for the taxpayers that we know what they have paid and what we have bought with the funds, as the Senator said. 
   The Appropriations Committee is pleased to work with Senator GRASSLEY and the Department of Defense to ensure the Department makes steady progress in reducing these problem disbursements. I do support the amendment of the Senator from Iowa, and I believe all Senators seek to improve the Department's control over the appropriation of taxpayers' funds to the Department of Defense. 
   What time will the vote take place, Mr. President?

My colleague and I are working on a package of amendments which we will submit as soon as this time has expired and this amendment has been voted upon. At least we will discuss this package. It is my hope we will be able to finish this bill today. I am going to work to achieve that goal.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to send to the desk a series of amendments which provide adjustments in the bill brought about by a review made by the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget. These amendments allocate funds in a different manner under the bill. 
   The first change is an increase in funds for the Army Test Range Facilities Program. 
   The second readjusts one account in the Navy, and moves $51.84 million into the Joint War Fighting Experimental Program, and leaves it under the control of Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs reporting to the defense committees of the House and the Senate. 
   The third will appropriate funds to meet the authorization bill's provision of funds to assist the Red Cross in providing Armed Forces emergency services. 
   The fourth is to deal with the addition of $10 million from cockpit modifications to the U2. 
   I send them to the desk, and I ask unanimous consent that they be considered en bloc.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are working on a managers' package. We have several amendments that we believe the Senate should include in such a package. I urge Members who have identified amendments they intend to offer to consult with my friend from Hawaii, myself, and our staffs to see if we can't enlarge this package and take care of a series of items that are really not controversial during the time that we have a vehicle. 
   As I have stated before, all amendments to this bill in the first degree must be introduced by 2:30 this afternoon. 
   We stand ready to work with any Member on an amendment. This would be a good time for anyone who has an amendment that is controversial to come and offer it. So far, no one has volunteered to undertake that task. But pending a Member wishing to offer an amendment, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will discuss this matter later, but I will say that the Senator's amendment is consistent with my understanding of the purposes for which we passed the 1999 supplemental. The moneys in that supplemental were for assistance to the refugees and for conducting the air war. It is my understanding that there was no money for the ground war, no money for the subsequent force--whatever it may be--that follows after the cessation of hostilities in that area. As the Senator stated, it would be for the long-term reconstruction and not for the temporary things that might be done to assist the Kosovo refugees to go back to their former homes. I think that will be probably something that will have to have money immediately, once we have a cessation of hostilities, which I pray will be very soon. 
   I think this ought to be a marker that we put down that we want to see how these costs are going to be met in this area after the hostilities cease. The economy of the European Union now is greater than ours. Their employment picture is even better than ours. I don't see any reason why there should be an assumption that we will carry on at the past level of expenditures. There is no question that the expenditures made in the war so far are overwhelmingly U.S. expenditures. I do not deny the participation of the NATO allies in the activities, but their costs are infinitesimal compared to ours when you view the long line that our supplies have to follow to get there and the cost of maintaining our forces there as compared to those who go home every night, in terms of the participants from the European Union. 
   I hope the Senate will take a very careful look at the Senator's suggestion. I want to make sure that it does not impede the activities of our forces to really provide for their own protection, as well as the facilities that will be needed by our people if they move into the area immediately after the cessation of hostilities. But I do think when we get to a long-range concept, a new Marshall Plan for this area, it is something that the Congress must be involved in, and the taxpayers must know what our share is going to be before we commence such activities. 
   I urge the Senator to lay his amendment aside.

   Let me state for the information of Members of the Senate, this is not a military construction bill. This is the defense bill. Military construction items will be in a separate bill. That bill will be marked up by the Senate tomorrow. Members who have amendments concerning military construction at home or abroad should present those to the subcommittee for consideration at markup tomorrow. We have had some suggested amendments to this bill; we do not want those to come to this bill. This is not within the jurisdiction of the Defense Subcommittee. We will be forced to oppose any amendment that is offered that deals with military construction.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regretfully must oppose Senator MCCAIN's amendment. I understand the amendment, but it takes a different approach to funding critical Department of Defense priorities for fiscal year 2000 than the committee has approved in this bill before the Senate. 
   Based upon the amounts that we provided in the fiscal year 1999 emergency supplemental appropriations for Kosovo and funds that were remaining from the 1999 supplemental for Bosnia, the committee determined--and I add that it was at my request--that at least $3.1 billion now available to the Department of Defense can and should be carried over to the year 2000. As a matter of fact, on the floor of the Senate I stated that our intent was to try and take care of some of the year 2000 obligations in that supplemental to best reflect the needs of the Department and the pressures across the discretionary accounts under the 1997 budget agreement. 
   Our committee adjusted the totals in this bill to reflect those specific amounts that carry over from the 1999 appropriation into the year 2000. Having done so, having brought $3.1 billion more into this account, we then removed some of the moneys that we previously allocated to the account into the nondefense area. The discretion to do that gave us the ability to meet critical needs in the nondefense area. 
   We believe that we did address critical readiness problems in the supplemental, and we specifically anticipated some of those needs which could possibly have been incurred--the costs incurred--before September 30th of this year. Those now appear to be funds that will be required in the year 2000, and we have met those demands by moving forward with the money. 
   I know this has caused some anxiety to people within the 
   Department of Defense who believe that we have cut the bill. We have not cut the bill. The bill is exactly the same amount of money originally under consideration by the committee, but we have found the moneys to pay those bills by carrying forward into the year 2000 some of the 1999 appropriations. 
   We believe we have met the needs of the military under this bill. The amendment of the Senator from Arizona strikes from the bill $3.1 billion, rather than carry forward with the money from 1999. I think that will have a detrimental impact on the priorities established by the committee and the priorities that some Members have presented not only in committee but on the floor. 
   For instance, the Senator's amendment would reduce nearly $270 million from the service operation and maintenance accounts, including $53.5 million from the Army National Guard alone. In procurement, the amendment pending would reduce or eliminate funding provided to replace the aging UH-1, the Huey helicopters, built in the 1960s, with the Army's modern standard, the UH-60 Blackhawk. 
   The amendment reduces funding for advance procurement of one of the Commandant of the Marine Corps' top priorities, the LHD-8 amphibious assault ship. 
   For the Air Force, funding for additional F-16, EC-130J and JStars aircraft would be deleted. 
   In research and development, funds added for the SBIRS satellite, national missile defense and the third arrow battery for Israel would be reduced. 
   For the Defense Health Program, the additional amounts provided for breast cancer research and prostate cancer research would be cut also by the Senator's amendment. 
   In response to Members' requests that the committee provide additional funds to fight the war on drugs, the committee did add funding for the gulf states counterdrug initiative, the National Guard counterdrug missions, and $50 million in response to the proposed Drug Free Century Act. Senator MCCAIN's amendment would delete $61.6 million of the funds added to the bill for those efforts. 
   The Senator from Arizona and I have discussed on many occasions that we do have different approaches to addressing the funding needs for the Armed Forces. I know Senator MCCAIN is a stalwart proponent of the men and women of the armed services and their families, and I believe I am also. We are just approaching the job from a different direction. 
   I believe that I must, on behalf of the committee, oppose the amendment. I truly believe the flexibility provided by the committee to the Department of Defense best accommodates the needs of the military, and ensures that funds are available in the accounts where necessary to accommodate readiness, quality of life, modernization and technology priorities. 
   I can state categorically the accounts that are here to accommodate readiness, quality of life, modernization and technology priorities of the Department of Defense have been met by our bill. 
   The Senator mentioned some of the items in this bill that affect my State. The Point Barrow landfill was created by the Department of the Navy. It operated in Point Barrow for many, many years. As that installation was closed down, the Department of Navy did not remediate the landfill. It is a terrible problem in the Arctic, particularly in the summertime when that landfill becomes just a morass. The local people have asked, using Defense Department funds, that the job be completed. This bill does, in fact, provide moneys for that purpose. 
   The Senator mentioned the joint Federal telemedicine project that is going on in my State. Again, this is an initiative by the Department of Defense that has a substantial amount of  communications capability in our State to deal with Federal agencies' needs and the needs of the services they provide throughout the State of Alaska to coordinate a delivery system for medicine using telemedicine techniques. We believe that is going to result in reducing the cost of health care delivery to Alaska Native people and the Indian Health Service to the military people throughout our State who serve on military bases and those who receive the benefits of Federal programs. It is not a general program for the population as a whole. 
   I say to the Senate, I understand the Senator's approach and I respect it, but I believe and our committee believes that there are instances where activities, which originated on military bases or caused by military occupation of specific portions of land within the individual States, do affect the local population and that those obligations of the Federal Government should be met with defense funds. 
   The basic problem, though--I go back to the beginning--we did not cut from other accounts in order to get the moneys to shift to other appropriations bills. For instance, we have shifted a substantial amount of money now through what we call the deficiency subcommittee--which was a subcommittee created specifically for that purpose--moneys from these accounts from the Department of Defense into the agriculture appropriations bill, but the way it was done does not reduce the amount of money that will be spent by the Department of Defense in the year 2000. A portion of the moneys really are carried over to be spent in the year 2000 rather than being spent in 1999, and that is what we intended when we asked the Congress to approve that supplemental appropriations bill. I hope the Senate will agree with us and will oppose this amendment and defeat it. It is a significant vote for us to determine. 
   Members will note the reports in the papers and in the media concerning the meetings that are taking place in the House of Representatives. They are deciding on an approach quite similar to ours to reduce the amount of money that will be spent through the fiscal year 2000 process and carry over some of the funds from 1999 to meet the obligations in the year 2000. 
   I think that is a legitimate way to use the money that is available to us and will enable us hopefully to stay under the caps in treating all of the bills that have to be passed by our committee. Thirteen separate bills have to be brought to this floor, and ours is the only committee which faces a point of 
   order under the Budget Act if we exceed the caps. We are trying our best to live with that Budget Act. I think we will. 
   There is still a serious gap in money, but we will find that money somewhere within the agencies, either by reducing carryover funds or by eliminating funds that are now no longer high priority so we can meet the obligations of the year 2000 with the funds that will be available under the budget agreement. If we cannot do that, we will come to the Senate in September, and we will have to work out a way to solve our problem. 
   Right now, our goal--and I think it is a bipartisan goal--is to live with the Budget Act, stay within the caps, yet meet our obligations. What we have done in this bill is the initial key to opening up the door down that long corridor to comply with the Budget Act. I urge the Senate to disapprove the amendment of the Senator from Arizona. 
   I yield to my friend if he has any comments to make.

   I will state for the Chair that it is my intention to find some way to call up these amendments in the order they were presented and dispose of them now as quickly as we can. There is a vote on cloture tomorrow on the Y2K proposition. I assume that will carry. We certainly do not want to have this defense bill waiting around for the completion of a long process that is related to cloture. 
   I urge Members to cooperate with us. I will inquire of Members as they come to the floor now on this vote as to when they will be able to present their amendments to see if we can find some way to get some time limitations. It is possible, I believe, to finish this bill tonight with the cooperation of Members of the Senate.

   It is the position of the committee that the aircraft we are talking about are for basically multimission functions and are really not designed for warfighting requirements. They are designed for transportation, basically to meet normal needs. If the Senator would delete that last clause, we will be happy to accept the amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am somewhat surprised by the length and specificity of the argument against this amendment. This amendment, on page 104 of the bill, would authorize the Secretary of the Air Force to obtain transportation for the commanders in chief, the regional commanders, to lease aircraft. It does not mandate any leasing. It authorizes leasing. 
   Currently these commanders in chief, regional commanders, are already flying 707 aircraft built 30, 35 years ago. Commercially, those airlines had 250 seats. They have 45 seats on those aircraft now. They are big. They are old. They are costly to maintain. It is possible to have modern replacements now. 
   The Senators would have us replace one a year. We will keep operating these old dumbos at enormous cost for repair and replacement of engines, instead of moving out and accepting the fact that there are planes there now, American-built planes, and the Department estimates it will cost $750 million to operate and maintain the current support fleet over the next 10 years. We would reduce that cost and put our people immediately in more cost-effective, quiet, efficient planes. 
   Yes, they are small compared to what they have now. Today a commander in chief takes along with him up to 45 people. This will reduce that size; there is no question about that. Further, we reduce the number of aircraft from nine to seven. They didn't mention that. This has nothing to say about all those other aircraft. 
   I would like to have a study of the flights of these airplanes that are owned by the Federal Government, particularly those owned and flown by the White House. We tried to get that and couldn't get it. We would like to find out who flies in the State Department airplane. We couldn't get that. 
   Now, be my guest and go get those, but these are commanders of our military who are serving as regional commanders of forces. I wonder if the Senate knows there are forces of the American people in 91 different countries today. We are operating at about one-third the staff we had just 5 years ago. We are trying to carry out missions that are almost impossible. Our reenlistment rate of pilots is down to less than one-third of what it was just a year ago. The deployment of our forces is overwhelming. The degree of fatigue on our managers is overwhelming. 
   I really never expected this kind of argument about replacing the 707s. I do not think anyone wants to continue to fly on the 707s. If nothing else, they are just old.

   Mr. STEVENS. No. I am going to table this, follow this bill through, and get it done. I can't understand that an amendment like this would delay this bill, because it is only an authorization to lease. All we have heard today, talking about the number of aircraft, is immaterial. Those aircraft are out there. They are not going to be affected by this amendment at all. 
   What we are trying to do is say that these commanders who stand in for the President as regional commanders in chief should have the state of the art of American industry in terms of their transportation. That is what this is. What we are doing is trying to get them to lease them, because if we started replacing them, I have to tell you, there is not money in this bill to allow us to buy seven new aircraft for these commanders. We can give them  the authority to lease them and replace them, and those leases can be options to buy later. We can fill that if we want to buy the planes later. We can't do it now, but these planes they are flying now are expensive, and they are too large. They are not what these commanders need.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, let me again say what we are trying to do. We believe under this amendment, by giving the authority to lease aircraft, we will be able to get at least six aircraft in less than 2 years to replace these aircraft that are now well over 30, 40 years old. We believe the savings in retiring these aging, expensive-to-maintain 707 aircraft will be cost effective. But what is more, this move will be very good for the Department, because by pooling these aircraft they will be able to use them efficiently. Nobody will have a dedicated aircraft that is underutilized. They will be able to be used by others when not being utilized under this plan. 
   We adopted a similar plan last year at my suggestion, and that is when we were going to have aircraft for FEMA,  CIA, and the FBI. We formed a special unit, and they have pooled the aircraft and they are available to them. They will have them available for one or all of them, depending on the needs of the people involved. This is a cost-effective utilization of air transportation to meet the needs of our National Government. I hope we can defeat this amendment. 
   I am going to make a motion to table. I will be happy to consider time for the Senators to speak. They have spoken almost an hour and a half. I will honor their suggestion if they want some time before I make that motion.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I think it would be interesting for the Senator to know that the plane of our commander in Europe, General Clark, who we all see on the news--and we have met with him respectively, and our committee has twice--the C-9A, cannot land at half of the airfields in Europe because of environmental restrictions. 
   I don't understand why we can't move to make available the process that has been pioneered and developed by American industry and even States and cities. They lease their aircraft. They lease their fleets of cars. It is cost effective. We are giving them the authority to do this. We are not mandating them to do it by the provision of the bill. 
   But if people want this substitute amendment--the Senator from California would require a study for more than a year--we would be back here again. 
   But we faced this. People forget. In the current year appropriations bill, we required an assessment of consolidated CINC support aircraft. It was required to be submitted, and it was submitted by March 1. Here it is. It led to this provision. We have had a year. We had the study. They have told us what they need. 
   I hope the Senate will support the need as outlined, but the needs can be met by exercising the authority. We are not mandating anything in this bill. 
   I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

I share the Senator's concern about levels of investment by the Air Force in Science and Technology. In the past, wise investments in Science and Technology resulted in many of the military systems on which our men and women in the military depend today. 
   The Air Force Air Expeditionary Force Deployment concept is of great interest to the Committee. Fuel Cells can reduce the logistics burden for many military systems used in peace keeping and humanitarian relief operations, as well as for combat operations. I agree that the Air Force should consider the development of fuel cell membrane materials.

   Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his support for this initiative which I sponsored in this year's Defense Authorization bill. I agree that it is a critical program benefiting our nation's children and  schools. While I recognize the Senator from New Mexico's concerns, I believe it is important to remember that the intent of this initiative is to transfer the Troops to Teachers program to the Department of Education. Funding to increase and strengthen this important program is meant to come from the Department of Education, not the Department of Defense. Furthermore, we agreed to delay transfer of this program from DOD to DOE until 2001 in order to ensure a smooth transition which affords minimal disruption to the current program and infrastructure. Our legislation clearly stipulates that expansion of this program through an infusion of funds is meant to be done at the Department of Education with Department of Education funds and not while the program is being transferred from the DOD. I am committed to working with my colleagues, including the Senator from New Mexico who is an original cosponsor of this measure, to ensure that the appropriate funds are allocated for the Department of Education allowing this agency to reform and strengthen the program as authorized by the Senate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair for bringing the Department of Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000 before the Senate. 
   It is my privilege to once again bring this defense bill to the Members of the Senate in partnership with my distinguished colleague, the Senator from Hawaii. 
   I hope all Senators were able to see or at least learn of the very distinguished memorial that was created to honor the 442nd, which was the most decorated unit of World War II; our colleague, Senator INOUYE, was part of that unit. I am very pleased we are once again able to come before the Senate to pursue a matter of great concern to each of us, and that is the defense of our country. 
   We have served together on this subcommittee now for more than 20 years, and we have been chairman or ranking member, depending upon the political tides of this country. I want the Senate to know that I could not have brought this bill to the Senate so early this year without the wisdom, experience, and judgment of my good friend from Hawaii. 
   I also commend Senator LEVIN and Senator WARNER of the authorization committee for their handling of the defense authorization bill. We have  worked closely together with that committee to stay close to the budget and the policy determinations which were made in the armed services bill. Amendments which we will offer later today reflect adjustments made to that bill to make this appropriations bill fully compatible with the authorization process. 
   As Senator INOUYE and I reported to the committee when we considered this bill in the committee, and as reflected by the Armed Services Committee in their bill, the military has faced a difficult challenge in meeting critical readiness and quality-of-life needs while modernizing our total force for the 21st century. 
   The armed services have sought to maintain that balance while undertaking contingency operations in the Balkans, southwest Asia, and the heightened alert on the Korean peninsula. Last month, the Congress, at our request, provided a second emergency supplemental bill for the fiscal year 1999 to meet some of those contingency requirements. 
   For fiscal year 2000, our committee was presented a budget that reflected real progress compared to the original forecast for the upcoming fiscal year. 
   More realistic estimates for the Bosnia operations and procurement and development of a national missile defense system established a better baseline for our national defense program. 
   Initiatives by OMB did leave real holes in the budget for fiscal year 2000, with incremental funding for MILCON, the military construction bill, and a $1.65 billion unspecified rescission recommended by the Office of Management and Budget. 
   The budget resolution adopted by Congress has provided adjustments for the defense function that offset some of those defense gaps. 
   The $8.3 billion increase in the new defense budget authority enabled the committee to restore the military construction reduction and to offset the suggested rescission. In addition, needed increases were provided for defense functions of the Energy and Water and Transportation Subcommittees. 
   Our bill reported by the Appropriations Committee is within the 302(B) allocation for the Defense Subcommittee. That is an allocation made pursuant to the budget resolution. 
   As I noted at the outset, the bill before the Senate follows closely the Defense Department authorization bill that passed this Senate by a vote of 94-4. Our bill fully funds the authorized 4.8-percent pay raise for military personnel. This bill adds $598 million to the O&M accounts, the operation and maintenance accounts, and provides flexibility to accommodate a larger civilian pay raise, if that is authorized. The increase in O&M spending will also protect the readiness of our forces and the quality of life for military personnel and their families. 
   This bill before the Senate does not include any funding for the war in Kosovo; no assumptions are made concerning either extension of the air war or a ground campaign or peacekeeping force. At this tense moment in the peace negotiations in Europe, I hope all Members of the Senate will be cognizant of these efforts in their comments and the amendments offered to this bill. 
   We will probably have another supplemental yet for peacekeeping operations in Kosovo for fiscal year 2000. That additional funding will be essential to avoid reductions in readiness and modernization for the armed services next year, if there is a peacekeeping operation, which we all expect. 
   To achieve the modernization goals by Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the recommendation increases procurement spending by $2.7 billion. 
   Looking further out in the future to the next generation of weapons systems, the bill before the Senate recommends an increase of $2.1 billion in research and development. 
   Funding for the defense health program continues to be the fastest growing component of our defense budget. The request for fiscal year 2000 grew by 7 percent compared to the appropriation of 1999. And the recommendation provides an increase of more than $1 billion for fiscal year 2000. 
   Included in that defense health program is $300 million for medical research, with $175 million allocated to breast cancer research and $75 million allocated for prostate cancer research. 
   One new initiative is the transfer of the responsibility for the soldiers, sailors, and airmen homes from the Labor, Health, and Human Services Subcommittee to our Defense Subcommittee. These facilities are more appropriately funded in conjunction with the Department of Defense, in our judgment. I hope the Senate will approve that recommendation. 
   To reflect fact-of-life economic assumption changes since the budget was prepared last autumn, our bill makes a series of adjustments. These changes are based upon the Department of Defense authorization bill and revised Office of Management Budget estimates. These estimates and items include adjusted prior year inflation rates, fuel costs, foreign currency rates, and underexecution of civilian personnel allowances. All of those are adjustments that must be made to the bill. 
   The bill also includes a general provision, section 8108, that reduces funding to reflect the amounts anticipated to carry over from the recently enacted Kosovo supplemental. 
   Mr. President, $3.1 billion is reduced from this bill and was shifted to the Deficiencies Subcommittee of our Committee. Those funds will be reallocated to other subcommittees as we proceed with the remaining fiscal year 2000 bills. 
   This adjustment holds the total defense funding for the fiscal year at roughly the level set in the budget resolution that was adopted by Congress earlier this year. 
   The Appropriations Committee also reported S. 1186, the Department of Energy appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000. That bill contains nearly $12 billion in defense funding. Our committee will also report the military construction bill later this week. 
   Again, let me thank Senator INOUYE for his support and input in this bill and thank him again for his cooperation. 
   I yield to the distinguished Senator from Hawaii for any statement he wishes to make.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, a young Alaskan, a freshman in Colony High School in the Matanuska Valley town of Wasilla, wrote an opinion piece in the Anchorage Daily news this week which shows thoughtfulness and wisdom well beyond his 15 years. 
   Travis Johnson sat down at his computer the day after the tragedy at Columbine High School, and wrote from the heart his feelings and his ideas on how to prevent further tragedies like Columbine. 
   He showed the essay to his parents who were moved and impressed with their youngster's effort. His mother, a physician, and his dad, an insurance executive, grew up in Anchorage. While they are not hunters themselves, they have friends and family who are gun owners and who hunt. 
   After Travis shared his essay with his English teacher, his dad suggested that he send it to the Anchorage Daily News. 
   Travis refutes the ideas that guns and violence on television and in films are responsible for incidents like Columbine. 
   Travis believes that parents must be more and more involved with their children. He asks the parents who read his opinion piece to ``talk to your kids, even though you may not want to, and your kids may act like they don't want to talk to you.'' And he tells teens to talk to their parents. 
   Mr. President, Travis Johnson's observations and ideas are important insights into how to avoid further incidents like those in Colorado and Georgia, from a teen who understands how teens feel.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I send to the desk and introduce the Physical Education for Progress--or ``PEP''--Act. My bill would provide incentive grants for local school districts to develop minimum weekly requirements for physical education, and daily physical education if possible. 
   Every student in our Nation's schools, from kindergarten through grade 12, should have the opportunity to participate in quality physical education. Children need to know that physical activity can help them feel good, be successful in school and work, and stay healthy.  
   Engaging in sports activities provides lessons about teamwork and dealing with defeat. In my judgment, physical activity and sports are an important educational tool, and the lessons of sports may help resolve some of the problems that lead to violence in schools. 
   Regular physical activity produces short-term health benefits and reduces long-term risks for chronic disease, disability and premature death. Despite the proven benefits of being physically active, more than 60 percent of American adults do not engage in levels of physical activity necessary to provide health benefits. 
   More than a third of young people in our country aged 12 to 21 years do not regularly engage in vigorous physical activity, and the percentage of overweight young Americans has more than doubled in the past 30 years. Daily participation in high school physical education classes dropped from 42 percent in 1991 to 27 percent in 1997. Right now, only one state in our union--Illinois--currently requires daily physical education for grades K through 12. I think that is a staggering statistic. Only one State requires daily physical education for our children. 
   The impact of our poor health habits is staggering: obesity-related diseases now cost the Nation more than $100 billion per year, and inactivity and poor diet cause more than 300,000 deaths per year in the United States. 
   We know from the Centers for Disease Control and others that lifelong health-related habits, including physical activity and eating patterns, are often established in childhood. Because ingrained behaviors are difficult to change as people grow older, we need to reach out to young people early, before health-damaging behaviors are adopted. 
   To me, schools provide an ideal opportunity to make an enormous, positive impact on the health of our Nation. The PEP Act, to me, is an important step toward improving the health of our Nation. The PEP Act would help schools get regular physical activity back into their programs. We can, and should, help our youth establish solid health habits at an early age. 
   The incentive grants provided for by my bill could be used to provide physical education equipment and support to students, to enhance physical education curricula, and to train and educate physical education teachers. 
   The future cost savings in health care for emphasizing the importance of physical activity to a long and healthy life, to me, are immense.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I first want to start off by commending the chairman of the House committee, Congressman BILL YOUNG, for his leadership in the conference on this bill. He was the chairman of this conference, and through his efforts we have achieved passage not only by the House but we achieved the result of getting a bill out of committee. Chairman YOUNG and I have worked very closely in the past. He chaired the defense subcommittee before becoming chairman of the full committee. I look forward to continuing that partnership during his tenure as chairman of the House committee. 
   We face a difficult task in reconciling the funds needed to respond to hurricane damage in Central America, the  Federal Emergency Management Agency and agriculture disasters--those FEMA disasters are national disasters declared by the President--and continued military operations in Kosovo, in Bosnia, in Iraq, and in the high state of alert in South Korea. 
   This is not an easy period to be chairman of this committee. We have what amounts to four major crises going on at one time. We are trying to maintain our defense capabilities to preserve our interests worldwide. This is very difficult, apparently, for some Members to understand. It is a difficult process, at best, to handle a supplemental and an emergency bill together, but it does take consideration of the Members of the Senate to understand which versions in these bills are emergency and which are just a normal supplemental. 
   They have been joined together. The President has sent us two bills and the House has passed two bills. They address the needs and the formal requests of the President. The Senate passed one bill, the Central American agriculture bill, in late March, prior to the Easter recess. At that time, before the recess, I urged that we have a chance to come to the floor and pass that supplemental. We knew there was going to be a second supplemental, but we could not get the time on the floor and the Senate did not act on the separate Kosovo package. 
   Due to the emergency nature of the funding for military operations and the availability of the first bill, it was our intention to merge the two bills into a second single bill in conference, which we have done. That is consistent with rules of the Senate and the House. These were matters which were emergency in nature, and we have added them as emergencies. 
   Now, as I think Senators are aware, there are many ideas in how we can address other needs in this bill. Supplemental bills have routinely been amended by both the House and the Senate. Questions have been raised about some of the matters in these bills--assuming that we have no right to add any amendments to emergency bills. 
   Now, this is both a supplemental and an emergency appropriations bill before the Senate. I hope Senators will keep that in mind. As most of the Senators are aware, these matters are brought up by individual Members of the Senate or the House and are considered and adopted by majority vote. I am not that happy about some of the provisions of this bill but, again, I have the duty to carry to the Senate floor those amendments that were included by action of the conferees. I hope Senators will keep that in mind as we proceed. 
   The conferees decided that some of these matters that are before the Senate and were presented to us should be reserved in the fiscal year 2000 bill, which the Appropriations Committees will start marking up next week. We cannot get to the regular appropriations bills until we conclude the action of the Congress on the supplemental and emergency matters in the bill before the Senate now. 
   Again, I know there are objections to this bill; there are objections to the process we are following. Many of those objections are brought forward because we do not have a point of order against legislation on appropriations bills. 
   That is not my doing. I have sought to restore that point of order and I continue to support the concept of that point of order. But we have several matters included in the Senate-passed version of the bill that were deleted by the conference. 
   One of them was a matter that was very close to my heart, and that is the Glacier Bay provision which was offered by my colleague, Senator MURKOWSKI. 
   What I am saying is there are matters before the Senate some people object to. There are matters not in the bill that people object to, and one of them is that Alaska provision of my colleague. Obviously, a conference report is always a compromise. That is why we go to conference. We have disagreements with what the House has done, the House has disagreements with what we have done, and we meet in conference and try to resolve the problems. 
   This bill, for instance, contains more money for defense needs than were proposed by the Senate. After we went to conference with the House, we concluded they were right in seeking additional moneys for our defense readiness. There is no question it also contains more funding for refugees and for agricultural relief than was proposed by the House. The House has come towards the position of the Senate on both refugees and agriculture relief. Again, I think that is the process of compromise that should take place in a conference. This conference report needs to be passed today. The men and women of the Armed Forces must understand we support them, regardless of our points of view on the war that is going on in Kosovo. 
   Refugees ousted from their homes and their country by Serbian atrocities need our help also. I was honored to be able to go with other Members of the Senate to visit Albania. We saw the camps in Macedonia. We visited with the President of Macedonia and the Prime Minister of Albania. We went to see our forces in Aviano--that is our air base in Italy--and we visited with the NATO people in Bosnia. 
   Many Senators here have also visited the region since that trip I took with my colleagues and Members of the House. There were 21 of us on the first trip. All the Senators who went there know what needs to be done; there is no question in our minds. It is unfortunate we cannot take more people over there to let them see it, because I think uniformly the people who saw the troubles over there are supportive of this bill. We have provided additional funds in this bill for the Kosovo operation and for the victims of the war there in Kosovo. They are sort of an insurance policy. 
   We have faced this in the past. We went into Bosnia. We were supposed to be there 9 months and be out by Christmas. That is 5 years ago this Christmas. We have had to add money every year, take money from various portions of our appropriations process and pay for the cost of Bosnia. 
   We also have increased the level of our activity in the Iraq area. Even during the period of the Kosovo operation, there continue to be retaliatory strikes on Iraq because of the their failure to abide by the cease-fire agreement. 
   In South Korea, the North Koreans are continuing to rattle the cage, as far as we are concerned, and we are on a high level of alert in that area. 
   What I am telling the Senate again is this bill reflects those pressures on our defense forces. We want those people who are defending this country to know we support them when they are 
   out there in the field representing our interests. The funds provided in excess of the President's request are contingency emergency appropriations for agriculture, for defense, for FEMA and for the refugees. The amounts added by the House and the Senate can only be submitted if the President declares an emergency requirement exists. We are going to get into that question of the emergency requirement here when the Senator from Texas raises his point of order. But we worked in conference very hard to assure adequate resources will be available through the remainder of this fiscal year to meet the needs in the areas we visited, in the Kosovo area, and to meet the needs of the military worldwide. Some of our systems are being taken from the areas I have described before--from South Korea, even from Bosnia and from Iraq--to move them into the area of the conduct of the hostilities in and around Kosovo and Serbia. Those funds that are needed on a global basis are in this bill. Some of them, as we know, the President did not request. 
   We believe we have taken action. Hopefully we will not have to see another emergency supplemental with regard to the conduct of the Kosovo operation during the period of time we will be working on the regular appropriations bills for the year 2000. In effect, we have reached across and gone in--probably this bill should be able to carry us, at the very least to the end of this current calendar year. The initial requests of the President took us to the end of the fiscal year on September 30. 
   I am happy to inform the Senate I am told today the President will sign this bill as soon as it reaches his desk. He has specifically asked us to complete our work and pass the bill today. I understand he has a trip planned and it would be to everyone's advantage if we get this bill down to him today and  have it signed. Therefore, I am pleased we do have the unanimous consent which does allow us to vote on this bill. I take it that will be sometime around 3:20 we will vote on the bill. 
   I do earnestly urge every Member of the Senate to vote for this conference report. To not vote for this conference report because of some difference, because of the process, would send the wrong message to the young men and women who represent this country in uniform. One of the things that impressed me when I was on the trips, both to Bosnia and into the Kosovo area, was if you go into the tents where these young people are living when they are deployed, do you know what you find? You find computers. They are on the Internet. 
   Right now, some of them out there will be picking up just the words I am saying. We are not back in the period, like when I served in World War II in China, when we did not hear from home but maybe once or twice a month at the most. We had to really just search to find news of what was going on at home and we were starved for news from home. These people are force fed news from home and many times what they see are rumors that come across the Internet. We don't need any more rumors going out to the men and women serving in the Armed Forces overseas. In this bill is the pay raise. We are committed that the money is there for the pay raise. We have initiated the concept of reforming the retirement system, which was one of the gripes we heard last year both in Bosnia and Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. 
   This is a bill the men and women of the armed services are watching. They are going to watch how you vote on this bill. And they should. It is not time for petty differences over process or committee jurisdiction. This is a time to act and 
   give the people in the Armed Forces the money they need so they know they will have the systems and they will have the protections they need when they go in harm's way at the request of the Commander in Chief. 
   I urge we not only vote to pass this bill, but Senators listen carefully to this point of order the Senator from Texas will raise, as it is raised against specific provisions of this bill. 
   Mr. President, there is no question in my mind, as we look at this bill, it is a different bill. When I woke up this morning, I looked in Roll Call and I was interested to see the statistics on supplemental appropriations, 1976 through 1996. We had no supplementals in 1995. We had one supplemental in 1996. I will get that number for 1997. People who are saying we are having too many supplementals--they are just wrong. We have not had too many supplementals. We go through a process of predicting how much money we will need. The departments of the Government start the process of sending their requests to the President through their agencies. They come up in the department, they go to the Office of Management and Budget, the President finally gets them sometime in September of the year before. In January or February, the beginning of the year, the President submits his budget which will be made available the following September, following October, going through the September of the next year. 
   In other words, what I am saying is this is the process. The money we are spending now on a routine basis started through the agencies in the fall of 1997, came into the departments in the spring of 1998, went through the President's process and got to OMB and were presented to us, in terms of a process, to have a bill for the year 2000 presented to us and considered in 1999. 
   This appropriations process is a long process. I hope I have not shortened it. But it is a very long process. In the process of trying to estimate the needs, things are overlooked, concepts are developed and, particularly in the defense field, new involvements of our military erupt. Kosovo is a good example. We had no knowledge we would have that kind of operation, an immense operation now, probably the largest engagement we have had, in terms of this type of crisis, since the Persian Gulf war. Actually, I think before we are over, it may be more expensive than the Persian Gulf war was to the United States. 
   I recognize the comments that are coming, particularly from my side of the aisle, about greater consistency in our appropriations process. I want people to look at the record. We have not had an excess of supplementals. We had an omnibus bill last fall, and most of the comments made on this floor are about the two omnibus bills that ended up the fiscal year--the one my predecessor, Senator Hatfield, was involved with and the one last year with which I was involved. 
   In both instances, if the Senators look carefully, they will find the appropriations process reached a stalemate, and the stalemate had to be resolved on the leadership level with the President. That was not the two committees that added that money. It was a negotiation with the President, in both instances, by the leadership of the House and Senate, and I commend them for it. We had to get out of that impasse or we would have had another impasse like we had previously when there was an attempt to shut down the Government. 
   When this Government is at war, it is not going to be shut down on my watch. I want everyone to know that. We are not going to shut down the Government when there is a war going on. We are not even going to suggest it. Anybody who does suggest it better understand he or she will not be here for long. The American people will not stand for that. Their sons and daughters are out fighting, and we ought to fight to get them the support they need. 
   I am going to fight--I am going to fight as hard as I can --to get bills such as this through and keep funding the Department of Defense at the level it should be funded to assure their safety--not just normal safety--but every single system we can adopt that will save the lives of the men and women in the armed services ought to be approved. This is what this does. It gives them the money they need to carry through the remainder of this year. 
   This year is going to be a very tough year. Any one of those other crises which are going on in Iraq, in Bosnia, in South Korea, or other places could erupt. I was told yesterday that we have people in the uniform of the United States in 93 different places throughout the globe now--93 different places--and any one of those places could erupt again while this Kosovo conflict is ongoing. 
   I do not want to hear anyone tell me that we have provided too much money. We have not provided too much money. If the money is not needed, I can guarantee you that this Secretary of Defense and this Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is not going to spend it. We have given them under this bill an enormous amount of discretion to spend the money. We have not earmarked this money. We have suggested things in the report that we hope they will consider, but this is the money to meet the needs of protecting our men and women in the armed services abroad, and it has to be viewed on that basis. 
   I urge every Member of the Senate to vote for it and to forget petty differences. 
   I am delighted to yield now to my good friend from West Virginia, a partner in this process of trying to get this supplemental and emergency bill to the President.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am surprised by some of the items listed in the Senator's statement. This bill is both a supplemental and an emergency appropriations bill. 
   A supplemental appropriations bill that was submitted by the President in March contained a request for $48 million to replace the National Public Radio satellite system. It is in this bill not as an emergency but as a supplemental appropriation. When we passed this bill in March, the Senate version of this bill contained $18 million for the satellite system. That was less than the President's request. The President made that request because the Public Radio system satellite failed and radio programs are currently being sent through an emergency backup satellite that will not be available until around the middle of September, early fall. The supplemental funding was requested by the President and approved by the Senate at the level of $18 million. The House insisted on the full $48 million. It is an item that is not designated as an emergency. 
   There are a series of other misunderstandings, I think, with regard to this bill, and I will be happy to discuss them with the Senator from Arizona later. I don't disagree with him about legislation on appropriations bills. The point of order under the rules that were previously in place against legislation on the appropriations bills was destroyed through a maneuver here on the floor of the Senate before my becoming chairman. We have had a tough time trying to get that put back into our system. I will be happy to help restore the point of order against legislation. 
   I don't look with favor on the omnibus process that occurred last fall and occurred once before I became chairman. But clearly, my job is to carry forward the bills as they come out of the Senate and out of the House and out of the conference by a majority vote. Under the current circumstances, there is not a point of order in the Senate on legislation against appropriations.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I have great problems now. I understand the Senator wants to vote on this point of order,  and there are 30 minutes on that. We then have time left for the debate on the bill itself. This vote then, I take it, will occur sometime around 25 after 2, the way I look at it. I put the Senate on notice that I am going to ask that the Senate stand in recess or stand off this bill from the hour of 3:30 p.m. until 4:15 p.m. I have not done it yet, but I want everyone to know we have to go off this bill. Our committee cannot be on the floor during that period of time because of a very important meeting the committee has that we cannot cancel.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for just 2 minutes on this motion to waive. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for making that motion to waive. 
   My point in addressing the Senate now is to inform the Senators that, basically, this point of order deals with the moneys that are in the bill for PL-480 food aid, for refugee assistance, for farm aid, aid for the Wye River, aid to Jordan, for the Central America and Caribbean emergency due to Hurricane Keith, and for the FEMA disasters that have taken place throughout our country. 
   All of those are matters that could not have been contemplated in 1947. We controlled $1.8 trillion on a 2-year period. And the Senator from Texas is objecting to the fact that these events, that have taken place totally unexpectedly, are going to cost $29.6 billion. 
   He is talking about 16 one-hundredths of 1 percent of the total spending that we control. In other words, estimates that were made have been exceeded now because of unforeseen circumstances in Central America, in farm aid, in terms of the assistance to Jordan, in terms of FEMA disasters, and national disasters declared by the President, and have consumed 16 one-hundredths of 1 percent more money than we estimated. 
   He is wrong in talking about the bill for the year 2000. We have not gotten to the year 2000. This does not have any impact on the year 2000 except in terms of defense. It aids us in defense trying to deal with defense matters. 
   These are things that the Budget Act rightfully said there is a time when you can have emergencies, when they are unexpected items that have happened. 
   There are a lot of things in this bill that are not emergencies; they are supplemental; they are supplemental items. We can argue about them, but they are not involved in what the Senator from Texas is doing. An opinion about lumping all those things in the bill is one thing, but to deal with this concept of knocking out the emergency clause is wrong. I hope the Senators will support the motion of the Senator from New Mexico.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, let's go back to what we are talking about. If a family had a $16,000-a-year income and had a 16 one-hundredths of 1 percent overage in their expenditures that year, they would have to borrow $20. We are talking about 16 
   one-hundredths of 1 percent in excess of the budget. And it is for items that are emergencies. What family would not borrow $20 to meet an emergency? Is it disaster relief emergency? Yes. Is the Central America-Caribbean expenditure an emergency? Yes. The Wye River accord for Jordan, was that an emergency? Yes. Is farm country in trouble? Is that an emergency? Yes. All we are saying is we are going to deal with that $20 out of $16,000. That is the comparison for an average family. 
   Mr. President, the thing that bothers me most about this is, we have to contemplate change. I will make one statement to you. If the New Madrid Fault that runs through the center of this country suffers an earthquake again--the last time it went off, the church bells rang in Boston because of an earthquake that took place going through the area west of the Mississippi. It changed the Mississippi River. It went backwards. It started a new channel which it has today. Can you imagine the amount of money we  would have to have? That is why the Budget Act provides money for emergencies. If the Senator is trying to say you have to have 60 votes to overcome that, now, that is wrong. I hope we have them today, Mr. President. This is an emergency, and this money is needed by the Department of Defense, and the agencies need it. 
   Thank you very much.

   Mr. STEVENS. That is correct. Under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, the United States has paid redress to more than 82,000 eligible individuals over the 10 year life of the program. Eligible individuals under this Act had to file a claim for redress by August 10, 1998. There were a number of individuals, however, who did not complete the documentation necessary for the Department of Justice to determine, prior to the termination of the Civil Liberties Public Education Fund and the expiration of the redress program six months later, whether they were eligible for redress under the Act. This provision would allow those individuals, if they filed timely claims, to provide any necessary information to the Department of Justice, and allow the Department to complete its review of their files. If the Department determines that they are eligible, this provision allows the Attorney General to pay the claimants restitution under the Act.

   Mr. STEVENS. That is correct. Some of the class members in this lawsuit were paid $5,000 restitution before the funds in the Civil Liberties Education Fund were exhausted. However, there are a number of class members who filed timely claims under the Mochizuki settlement who were not provided with restitution because there were no funds remaining. In addition, some class members were not able to complete the documentation necessary for the Department of Justice to determine, prior to the termination of the Civil Liberties Public Education Fund and the expiration of the redress program six months later, whether they were eligible for redress under the settlement agreement. This provision would allow those individuals, if they filed timely claims, to provide any necessary information to the Department of Justice, and allow the Department to complete its review of their files. If the Department determines that they are eligible, or has already done so, this provision allows the Attorney General to pay them restitution under the settlement agreement.

   Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair, and I thank my good friend from Mississippi for managing the bill for us as we had a distinguished visitor in the Appropriations Committee room. 
   Mr. President, there is a lot of controversy about this bill, but I think this bill represents the best of America. We have reacted to crises abroad and crises in this country. 
   There are items in this bill that are not emergencies. While many people are saying they should not be here because they are not emergencies, they are here because this is a supplemental and an emergency bill. It is a bill that we can all vote for in good conscience, and I hope there will be an overwhelming vote for this. 
   Again, I point out for the Senate that the men and women of the armed services are aware of this bill. It means a great deal to them. It is a symbol of our commitment to the pay raise for which we have already gone on record. 
   It is a symbol that we are going to step forward to modernize the armed services. It is a symbol that we are going to provide the money to assure these people when they are sent overseas, whether it is Kosovo or in the area of Iraq or in South Korea, or in Bosnia--wherever it may be in those 93 countries of the world that the American service men and women are now serving--we are going to stand behind them and give them all the support they need not only for their safety but for their comfort. 
   The passage of this bill will mean that we can now go ahead with the balance of our necessary actions in the Appropriations Committee. We have 13 full bills that come forward. I hope this will be the last supplemental of this year. I join the majority leader in not welcoming supplemental bills. But I know there are times when it is necessary; and this one is necessary. 
   Anyone who looks at our involvement in the world knows that we cannot calculate in advance the costs of events, such as the Kosovo operation, both militarily and in regard to refugees. These were things that came up after we planned expenditures for 1999 in the fall of last year. 
   I urge the Members of the Senate to vote for this bill. I urge that we, as quickly as possible, get it to the President so he can sign it today. 
   I yield back any time I have and ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it has been 30 years since the Stratton Commission took a close look at our Nation's coastal policies. The Stratton Commission's recommendations have served as a guide for U.S. oceans policy for three decades, yet as we move towards the next millennium, it is imperative that we once again consider the direction and coherence of our policies towards this immense resource. I applaud Senator HOLLINGS' efforts to explore ways to again examine these policies, and to determine the action necessary to responsibly steward this resource into the next century. I look forward to working with Senator SNOWE and others to create bipartisan support for an Oceans Act that will craft policy for a healthy ocean for our children and for their grandchildren.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I join Senator MURKOWSKI in rising in support of S. 933, which would clarify tax treatment of Settlement Trusts established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Our legislation would amend the U.S. tax code by allowing these Settlement Trusts to organize as 501(c)(28) tax exempt organizations. This bill is similar to S. 2065 which I co-sponsored with Senator MURKOWSKI last year. 
   Consistent with last year's proposal, this bill allows for conveyances to a Settlement Trust without including those contributions in the beneficiaries' gross income. This is an important provision because under the current tax code, beneficiaries of a Settlement Trust can be taxed on contributions to the trust, even though they haven't received a payment or disbursement from the Settlement Trust. 
   Our new provision also outlines the process and terms for revoking a trust's tax exempt status as a 501(c)(28) organization. Under this provision, if a Settlement Trust engages in forbidden activities as outlined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, its election as a 501(c)(28) tax exempt organization would be revoked and the trust would pay a tax on the fair market value of the assets held. This ensures that U.S. taxpayers will not underwrite forbidden transactions within the trusts or between the trusts and the beneficiaries. 
   This provision also requires a Settlement Trust to distribute at least 55 percent of its adjusted taxable income for each year. This would insure that Settlement Trusts fulfill a basic obligation to the beneficiaries. 
   In addition, the new provision requires trusts electing to be recognized as 501(c)(28) tax exempt organizations to withhold income tax from payments made to beneficiaries. There is, however, an important exception to this withholding provision. That exception would apply to third party payments made on the behalf of beneficiaries for educational, funeral, or medical benefits. 
   It is my hope that we will clarify the tax treatment of these Settlement Trusts so that beneficiaries are treated in a fair and just manner.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in the past several months when radio personalities--sometimes known as ``shock jocks''--have gone beyond the bounds of propriety, their employers have been quick to dismiss them. 
   For example, the Charlotte, NC, station just yesterday fired a radio talk show host who made an on-the-air joke about this week's tragedy in Littleton, CO. There was also a Washington, DC, station that immediately fired the ``Greaseman'' for his racist remarks after the tragic dragging death of a Texas man that we all remember. 
   Now in Chicago we learn of another one of these offensive on-the-air personalities who has stepped over the line. He made insulting remarks against Special Olympians. What he said about these brave athletes is indefensible. What he said was--and it bothers me even to repeat it--  
   Watch them run, watch them fall, watch them try to catch a ball. Olympics, Special Olympics. Watch them laugh, watch them drool, watch them fall into the pool. That's diving at the Special Olympics. And I know full well that I will burn in Hell, but those guys playing wheelchair basketball gotta be about the funniest--  
   And the expletive is deleted; they took that out--  
   thing I've ever seen in my life. [And it is all] at the Special Olympics.  
   Mr. President, these young men and women have overcome obstacles that we cannot understand. They deserve our applause and admiration. They should not be the targets of juvenile jokes on the public airwaves. 
   Instead, despite this disgusting display of ill-manners and bad taste, this radio station has refused to fire that shock jock. 
   Mr. President, I urge all of those who listen to this man in Chicago to call for his immediate dismissal. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, tomorrow, April 15, marks the last day of Senate service for Elizabeth K. Bunch. I have known Betty since 1987, when she worked as a professional staff member for me when I was on the Rules Committee and was ranking member. I thank her, on behalf of the entire Senate, for her many years of service. 
   She was born and grew up in Laramie, WY. After raising a family and having a career working as the assistant to the dean of the graduate school at the University of Wyoming, Betty came to Washington in 1977. 
   In her first year here, Betty was the special assistant to then newly elected Senator Malcolm Wallop, a good friend. Although she intended to stay in Washington for only 1 year, Betty spent 10 years working as an office manager and special assistant for our distinguished former colleague. 
   In 1987, Betty moved to the Rules Committee where she worked for me in so many important committee responsibilities, including overseeing information technology initiatives. 
   In 1991, Betty joined the staff of the Sergeant at Arms. There she was first the ``ombudsman'' for the Senate Computer Center, and then the coordinator for the consolidation of Sergeant at Arms offices in the Postal Square Building. Betty became the liaison between Postal Square and the Superintendent's office. She also formed the SAA Safety Office and did the FEMA coordination, the Federal Emergency Management Agency coordination, new Senator transition coordination planning, all maintenance coordination, and the multitude of necessary supporting operations for the Sergeant at Arm's employees. She served for five Sergeants at Arms. 
   The Senate and all its employees who serve our great institution owe Betty Bunch a debt of gratitude. I am very proud to have worked with her. I know my colleagues join me in wishing her a wonderful retirement.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment modifies section 205 of the resolution, which creates a 60 vote point of order against emergency appropriations. The modification establishes an exception from the 60 vote point of order for national security emergency appropriations. Given the on-going operations in the Balkans, the need for this exception is clear. 
   Much like the vote to authorize the Persian Gulf war, where only 52 members of the Senate voted in support of that action, the current military operations in Kosovo and Serbia gained the support of only 58 Senators. I opposed that resolution. That doesn't change the fact that the men and women of the Armed Forces mut be properly supplied, equipped and supported when they are sent to combat. That is our job, irrespective of whether each of us agrees with the specific policy that led to the deployment of U.S. forces. 
   Earlier this month, the Governmental Affairs Committee reported S. 93, which established new procedures for the consideration of emergency appropriations. That bill creates a point of order that requires 51 votes to waive. That bill has been referred to the Budget Committee, and will probably come before the Senate after the Easter recess. I urge the adoption of the amendment.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to add to my colleague's comments. The budget gimmicks in the defense budget as submitted by the Administration create a shortfall of at least $8.3 billion in budget authority. Under Senate rules, we cannot pass a defense appropriations bill which buys the programs advertised by the Department of Defense as being budgeted. We would require at least $10 billion in outlays to even fund the Administration's defense request. While the budget resolution adds $8.3 billion in budget authority, it cuts outlays by $8.7 billion relative to the CBO scoring of the defense budget request. Even under OMB scoring, the budget resolution provides only $500 million in outlays to spend with the $8.3 billion in budget authority. This mix of money will not work, and clearly does not even let us erase all of the administration's budget gimmicks. 
   The Defense Appropriations Subcommittee has also held hearings to review the readiness requirements of our military forces. If the current outlay problem is not resolved satisfactorily, Congress will be responsible for failure to provide adequate resources for our military's needs as readiness problems become more apparent. With military operations currently being conducted in Kosovo, this would be the wrong signal to be sending at this time.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today is the 10th anniversary of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. 
   I want to use this opportunity to reflect on the impact that disaster had on the land and people of my State. 
   I still remember traveling to Alaska to view the damage caused by the Exxon Valdez in Prince William Sound. 
   Believe me, Mr. President, it is a sight I never want to see again. 
   At that time, I referred to the huge oil slick battering against the shoreline as ``the black blanket of the Exxon Valdez.'' 
   And while that spill caused serious damage to our wildlife, our environment and our people, that black blanket has had somewhat of a silver lining. 
   I refer to the Oil Pollution Act of 1990--OPA '90. 
   Congress and the Department of Defense are currently looking at implementing a ``national missile defense system'' to protect the United States from incoming ballistic missiles. 
   I consider OPA '90 to be the ``National Oil Spill Defense System'' that protects the United States from future oil spills. 
   OPA '90, as many Senators will recall, was signed into law on August 18, 1990. 
   It is important to note that OPA '90 has not been significantly revised since 1990--and at present, there has not been any push for comprehensive revisions. 
   It is a testament to the act itself that it has not needed major revisions. 
   Some of the provisions of OPA '90 were under consideration prior to 1989, but unfortunately, it took the Exxon Valdez spill to bring about a comprehensive approach to our national system of oil spill prevention and response. 
   Congress enacted OPA '90 only 17 months after the spill--a very short period of time given the scope of the legislation. 
   That landmark piece of legislation created a new national framework that focuses on both the prevention of spills and the response to spills. 
   It was written to reduce the chances we will ever have another spill of the magnitude of the Valdez--anywhere. 
   That act, and the actions it mandates, has already vastly improved the response system for lesser spills. 
   On a national level, OPA '90--

    Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I join Senator MURKOWSKI in introducing this bill to allow greater interest to be earned on funds from the civil settlement between Exxon and the State of Alaska and the Federal Government resulting from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. This is another silver lining from the spill. 
   Under the civil settlement, Exxon has paid $900 million to the State of Alaska and Federal Government. The settlement established the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council to administer these funds. The Trustee Council is comprised of three Federal and three State representatives. 
   While I disagree with the Council's decisions to spend much of the funds to acquire land in Alaska, I was pleased by their decision on March 1, 1999 to dedicate $115 million for an endowment for marine research, monitoring, and restoration. 
   Our bill would allow the Council to invest these funds outside the court registry, where it would earn greater interest than under the court's authority. The bill is similar to the legislation we pursued during the 105th Congress. We are encouraged that the Trustee Council has directed its Executive Director to work with us on this measure, and we will keep an open mind when those discussions begin. 
   I also intend to explore whether we can merge the EVOS research endowment with the North Pacific Marine Research endowment I created last year with funds received by the Federal Government in the case involving Dinkum Sands oil lease revenue. The EVOS funds can only be used in the spill area, while the Dinkum Sands funds can be used for research relating to any of the marine waters off Alaska. Merging the two would maximize research benefits for Alaska and the Nation, and minimize potential duplication. 
   In 1997, we established the 19-member North Pacific Research Board to prepare the marine research plan for the Dinkum Sands funds. In 1998, however, during the first year of funding, we simplified the approach so that the University of Alaska has the responsibility for preparing the plan, and the plan must then be approved by the State of Alaska, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of Commerce. Our goal is to update the North Pacific Research Board so that the University will have the central role, but the other entities on the North Pacific Marine Research Board will also have an advisory role in the long term in setting the research priorities. 
   During our work on this, we will also see whether it is possible to merge the  EVOS research endowment with the Dinkum Sands endowment. The bill that Senator MURKOWSKI and I are introducing is the critical piece of the puzzle that will allow greater interest to be earned on the EVOS marine research endowment whether or not we are ultimately able to merge the two.

   Mr. STEVENS. I cannot match the memory of my friend from West Virginia as far as poetry is concerned. I was trying to think of another poem I remembered that would have been appropriate, but right now I will say this: 
   Mr. President, here is the problem. We had a massive bill last fall. It had emergency monies appropriated that were outside the budget. Now we are reprogramming much of that money to new emergencies or to new programs which take the money away from the programs we appropriated for last fall. But now we are going to spend it somewhere else. OMB did not score that money last fall because it was outside the budget. Now the Senator from Texas has gone to the CBO and the CBO has scored that as money that is just being appropriated. We are really reprogramming appropriated money to new uses. 
   When they score it, they do not come up with budget authority, which is the problem of the legislative committees. They come up with outlays, which is our problem. We do not have the outlays. By definition, the money, if we leave it where it is, it is going to be spent. It is going to be spent unscored. 
   As a consequence, I have told the Senator from Texas, and I hope my friends from the other side of the aisle would agree, we will take this to conference. I made a commitment. I will sit down with the CBO and see if I can understand their point of view of why they should do this to us. Most people do not agree. It is only the Senate Appropriations Committee that is subject to this control. The House just waived the points of order. Over here, our bills are subject to points of order. 
   The amendment of the Senator would lead to dramatic cuts in several priorities that were funded in the omnibus bill as emergency issues and not scored on outlays. And we have a provision in this bill that says those monies will continue to not be scored as outlays if they are spent for the purposes we redesignated them for: Diplomatic security, to rebuild our embassies destroyed in Kenya and Tanzania, the funding that we put up for the U.S. Government's response to the Y2K computer problem. At my request last year, we went forward very early and the Senate 
   started that process, $3.25 billion to deal with Y2K. It was not scored, and we are reallocating some of that. The agriculture relief from last year--again, it was an emergency. We are reprogramming some of that. 
   Above all, the FEMA disaster relief monies, all of those were not scored for outlays, Mr. President. But I understand what my friend is doing. He is trying to do the same thing we are trying to do, and that is preserve Social Security. I will be willing to do anything I can to preserve the position we have taken that Social Security funds not be touched. They were touched last fall. We are not touching them, we are reusing them. That is something the CBO cannot quite grasp right now, and I have said I will go sit down and talk to them. As a matter of fact, I will invite the Senator from Texas to come along so he will have a worthy advocate as we try to understand the new concepts of scoring outlays on monies that were already appropriated on an emergency basis. 
   I think the Senator from Texas raises some interesting points. I do hope we will be able to accept this. I have to tell the Senator from Texas that my decision to recommend these be taken to conference is still subject to being reviewed on the other side of the aisle, and I will have to defer the final approval of the amendment of the Senator until that time. But I will call him if there is any discussion to be had on his amendment. 
   I hope he agrees we set it aside temporarily while awaiting that response to my request. But I do intend to recommend the amendments of the Senator be taken to conference where we will explore them and try to see if we can accommodate what the Senator is trying to do without disturbing the process that we feel is our duty--to meet the emergencies as they are presented to us this year, not last year.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to put in the RECORD the scoring that we got on the supplemental bill as it came out of committee. It shows the problem. CBO showed we had $319 million in savings on outlays, and OMB said we had $567 million savings in outlays. OMB now has gone back and has changed the minuses to plus, and they say that we are over $441 million. It is because of a revision, I guess, of the way they have approached the bill.

   Mr. STEVENS. I think it demonstrates that there is a legitimate battle here over people who make estimates. We have one group of estimators downtown, another group of estimators over in CBO. We have our own on the committee. We make estimates of what we are doing, and it is like three groups of lawyers. Fifty percent of them are wrong all the time. I say this as a lawyer. 
   As a practical matter, there is no answer to the Senator from Texas' approach, unless we just set them all down in the same room and say find a way to come to an agreement. In the final analysis, there are three computers working on this bill and, as they say, if you put stuff in, stuff is going to come out; right? That is the trouble. I am not sure what color the stuff is that the Senator from Texas is using, but it is coming out. It disagrees with our conclusions of what this bill means. 
   I am told that the other managers of the bill agree with my concept that this is something we should explore in conference, and we will give it our best review in conference. We are willing to accept the Senator's amendments now.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if I may, in connection with the debate that just took place involving my colleague, Senator MURKOWSKI, I would like to point out the statement that I made on October 21 of last year in connection with the proposal that was in the conference report regarding Glacier Bay commercial fishing. I made this statement about matters the way that we finally arranged them in that bill and the provision that was passed at my suggestion. I said:  
   I view this compromise as an insurance policy, a safety net that offers better protection to Glacier Bay's fishermen than was offered by the draft Park Service regulations, but I do not view it as the end of the story. There are provisions that I do not like.  
   For that reason, I have cosponsored Senator MURKOWSKI's amendment this year. 
   I yield the floor.

   First is an amendment by Senator HELMS to appropriate, with a corresponding rescission, funds for the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. Second is an amendment by Senator GRASSLEY to appropriate, with a corresponding rescission, funds for regional applications programs, consistent with the direction and the report to accompany Public Law 105-277. Third is an amendment by myself to allow military technicians, while deployed, to receive per diem expenses. Fourth is an amendment by myself clarifying the intent of the fiscal year 1998 and 1999 Interior and related agency appropriations bills in relation to Pike's Peak Summit House. Fifth is an amendment by Senator GREGG in relation to an issue for renewal of fishing permits and fishing  vessel operations. Sixth is an amendment on behalf of the minority leader dealing with reprogramming of funds by the Corps of Engineers. Seventh is an amendment by myself dealing with the authority to release aircraft by the Department of Defense. Eighth is an amendment

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I might say to the Senate that I made the statement that the managers would object to any amendments that were not agreed to on both sides. We made an exception in that case for the leaders' amendments. We have taken the amendments from the distinguished minority leader. This is the last one of the majority leader. I understand there will be objection on the other side. Therefore, I will ask that it be set aside temporarily awaiting the majority leader's return, so he can decide what he wants to do with his amendment. He asked me to offer it. 
   I also state for the RECORD that although I did agree to make a motion to table on any amendments that were not agreed to on both sides, I made an exception in that situation for my colleague from Alaska, which I had cosponsored. That has been taken care of. My friend from Nevada made a motion to table that. We will let the Senate decide that issue. Other than that, as I understand it, we are in the situation that the last remaining matter is the amendment of the Senator from Texas. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the amendment of the majority leader be temporarily laid aside.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I give notice to the Senate that following the vote on the tabling motion offered by the Senator from Nevada, I shall ask unanimous consent to vitiate the remainder of the amendments on the list, and the only remaining amendments will be Senator LOTT's amendment and the amendment of the Senator from Texas, the Kosovo amendment, which has to be disposed of one way or another for us to finish this evening. So at this time, does any Member have an amendment they wish to offer? 
   Mr. President, if not, let me take a couple minutes for myself on the Kosovo question. I am glad the Senator from Virginia has given me this. I was one of those that was invited to the White House this morning. As I approached the problem of listening again to the question of what we should do in Kosovo, I listened to a President that I think has made up his mind to initiate the air war. 
   I am a very pragmatic Senator. My feeling was that if that was going to go forward, the people who were going to carry out that order deserve the support of this Congress. But I also had the feeling that we should assure ourselves that none of the funds that we have made available to the Department of Defense in the past, or through this bill we are considering now, could be used for initiating a ground war in this area. I so stated to the President that while I had severe reservations about the air war, he is the Commander in Chief, and if he has made the decision that it is going to take place, we have no way to stop that. But we do have a way to signal to the men and women of the Armed Forces that we do understand they are subject to the commands of their Commander in Chief, 
   and when they undertake fulfilling those commands by going outside the United States in particular to carry out the policies of this country, I think they deserve to know that the Congress supports them. 
   I therefore came back thinking we would have a joint resolution that the President would be asked to sign setting forth those two conditions which were ably set forth by Senator BYRD. Senator BYRD spoke ahead of me at that meeting, and he, strangely enough, made the statement that I had determined I was going to make at the meeting. The situation was that I returned thinking we would have a joint resolution. 
   We now will have before us a Senate concurrent resolution, which is a form that we all know does not require the signature of the President. I understand that is being done for reasons beyond our control. But we no longer have the resolution Senator BYRD originally discussed, and it is my understanding from talking to Senator BYRD that he has consented to consolidating that into a direct statement of one sentence. I expect that to be offered soon. 
   The second version I had intended to propose and Senator BYRD did propose  was about the introduction of the Armed Forces of the United States into this area that I understand was to be deleted. 
   I am now informed by Senators BIDEN and WARNER that there is an agreement that that section will be put back into this concurrent resolution, which will once again contain the prohibition against funds to introduce ground forces of the United States into this area in a nonpermissive environment, meaning in terms of combat or in terms of imminent combat. They could go into a nonpermissive environment to carry out the procedure we thought we might be involved in, in terms of introducing 4,000 troops along with NATO in a peacekeeping effort. Section 2 of this resolution does not address that from the point of view of the intent of this Senator. 
   But I do want to make it clear that I believe this is probably the most dangerous area of the world for our Armed Forces to be involved. I know really of no place in the world I would fear more, as a pilot flying over those mountains with the ground-to-air defenses that I know exist there, as much as this area of the former Yugoslavia. It is, beyond question, the most complicated area for military activity, far beyond Bosnia and far beyond what we might have contemplated in World War II in Europe in terms of where we operated with American Armed Forces. 
   This area consumed several Nazi divisions--21. Is that correct, Mr. President? It consumed them, destroyed them, in terms of the action of the partisans in that area. 
   If this bombing does not bring about a cessation of the genocide we believe is going to take place or is taking place, then it is going to be a very, very difficult problem to decide what to do. And I think the Congress has to be involved before that plan is agreed to by the U.S. representatives and NATO. 
   Above all, I hope the message will go out to the people who represent this country in connection to NATO, they are not to make agreements about injection of Armed Forces of this country in a ground war before approval of the Congress. That, to me, would be unconscionable. And I am delighted my friends have agreed to put this section 2 in. 
   Mr. President, I just want to close with this. There is no other word. I used it with the President. I have a ``gut feeling,'' a ``deep gut feeling,'' that we have initiated something 
   which will be very hard to control from now on. This will require the consideration and really the absolute concentration of every American to try to get out of this place without severe loss of life. 
   I urge the Members of Congress to understand that the President has made this decision. And it is not ``if.'' It is ``when.'' And when it happens, we have to be united behind our Armed Forces. That is all there is to it. 
   I yield the floor.

Mr. President, we are in this situation because sometime last year the administration authorized our representatives of NATO to enter into an agreement that would allow NATO forces to conduct strike operations against the Serbs if they did not sign an agreement that was sought--the ``peace agreement'' so-called. That did not occur. Suddenly, we find that now here we are with one sentence, one sentence approving the concept of sending in airstrikes against that nation. We do not have a prohibition against the use of ground forces, and I told the President this morning I would support this resolution if it did. 
   But beyond that, I am constrained to say that I remember standing here on the floor in 1991 when Iraq invaded Kuwait, when racial cleansing was not  only taking place, they were murdering people in public. They had taken over a nation and they were obviously going to go into Saudi Arabia. We were in the minority and we sought to support our President, and we got very little support. I put in the RECORD already the letter that President Bush sent. He said if the Congress did not agree, he would not dispatch forces. Today, I looked in the eye of a President that had already made up his mind on the air war. I seriously regret that we have not put a parameter around this war so it will prevent the use of our forces on the ground. I believe we are coming close to starting World War III. At least I know we are starting a process that is almost going to be never-ending, unless it never starts.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I give my thanks to Dr. Ogilvie, our Senate Chaplain, for arranging the visit of my good friend, Father Norm Elliott. He was the pastor of the All Saints Episcopal Church in Anchorage and has been a close personal friend since the 1950s. We were both, at that time, residents of Fairbanks, AK. 
   In 1980, our guest chaplain officiated at my marriage when Catherine and I were married. He has also officiated at the wedding of my daughter Susan, my son Ted and my son Ben. In addition to that, he has christened my daughter Lilly and my granddaughters and my grandson John. 
   He has been more than a close friend. He also performed the memorial service for my first wife Ann and assisted at the dedication of the Ann Stevens Red Cross Building in Anchorage. 
   Father Elliott was born in England and came to Detroit as a child. He came to Alaska in 1951 at a time when our church considered service in Alaska as overseas duty. For half a century, he has ministered to the people of our State. He has spent time in many small towns and villages in Alaska, such as Nenana, Eagle, Venetie, Beaver and Point Hope, just to name a few. In 1980, at my request, he was appointed to serve on the Commission of Alaska Natives. Members of that Commission were appointed by President Bush and Alaska's Gov. Wally Hickel. Father Elliott and members of that Commission spent 3 years traveling through Alaska to help our native people identify solutions to unique problems they face. 
   Norm is also chaplain of the Port of Anchorage, and he is the Civilian Episcopalian Chaplain for our Armed Forces in Alaska. 
   He is truly a dedicated man, dedicated to the word of God and to helping others. I know that some, such as our distinguished President pro tempore, would recall that Father Elliott visited us once before when he gave the opening prayer in 1981. 
   I am delighted that a cherished personal friend and advisor has been able to visit us today. Again, I thank my good friend, the Chaplain of the Senate, for arranging that. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have listened with interest at the statements made by the distinguished Senator from Delaware. And he has some very good points. My memory of the conversations that were held at the time President Bush made the statement that the Senator from Delaware referred to was that the President was talking about racial cleansing, or genocide, on the part of the Serbs versus the Kosovo population--not just a military incident, but an act of genocide, but an act of racial cleansing in the magnitude of a national aspect. 
   There is no question that there is a dispute here. And the Senator from Delaware has heard my comments that I made to the President. I believe that article V of the NATO agreement does not authorize bombing in Serbia. 
   I was very interested over the weekend to listen to people talk on the radio and television about Yugoslavia. It seems that we are slipping back now, that it is a Yugoslav question, not just a Serb-Kosovo question, that is being raised now by the media. But in any event, I think this would be the first time in the history of NATO that NATO has taken offensive action against a nation that has a dispute within its borders. I think it is a horrendous proposition that the Serbs are presenting to Kosovo. ``Either leave, or be exterminated.'' 
   But the question really is, What is the proper justification for this action  at the present time? If it is genocide, then I think we have really ample cause to be involved. If it is a matter of relocation of people within a nation, based upon whatever power the nation claims to relocate people within their boundaries, it is a different issue. 
   I must admit to being torn, as one who has attended the NATO meetings many, many times in the past, of what will be the future of NATO, if this action is taken. 
   I think the threat that President Bush made is the threat that all Americans would support; that is, that we would use military force to retaliate against a nation that instituted a process of racial cleansing, racial extermination within its borders, to the extent that it was contemplated at the time. 
   But I have to also raise the question: Where were we in Cambodia? Where were we in Ethiopia? Where are we going to be as this type of process continues in Africa? And we are reading more and more about that. Even this last weekend, juxtaposed to the story about Kosovo, is the story about the new racial cleansing commencing once again in Ethiopia. 
   It is not an easy issue. And I think it is one that we ought to pursue, because, from the point of view of this Senator, I do not like to set the precedent that an administration informs a foreign nation to sign an agreement, or, if you do not sign the agreement, we are going to bomb until you do. That to me is a precedent of which I don't want to be a part. 
   If we make a statement, as President Bush made, that if you engage in a process that is really against a whole concept of 
   humanity, we are going to be first in line to punish you for doing it. Somehow or other, there is a place here where we can find a common position and support taking action as a nation. But, for myself, I just revolt at the concept that we are going to send people out to negotiate peace agreements, or whatever other kind of agreement it is, and authorize them to say, ``Unless you agree with us, we are going to bomb you, and we are going to bomb you until you change your mind, and, if you do not change your mind, within our period of time, we are going to bomb you again.'' In this instance, the process would require taking down the air defenses of another nation in order that we might attack the forces that are on the ground. 
   I assume that most Members of the Senate have been there now and know what they are talking about. This is the most mountainous country of Europe. It is a place where, as I recall, some 20-odd divisions under the command of Adolf Hitler got just absolutely tied down by the actions of the people there on the ground. Of course, they didn't have the precision bombing we have now. They didn't have the automated systems that we have now and unmanned systems that can wreck havoc on any nation. 
   The question, really, to me is, ``Are we to offer the use of military power to carry out a threat of a negotiating team based upon their interpretation of the reasons behind a foreign nation's unwillingness to enter into an agreement that we sponsor?'' Or, are we going to take action, as I said, on behalf of humanity to prevent the extermination of a race? To me, there is a great gulf between those two positions. 
   I intend to continue to raise the question with the President and his representatives about the constitutional power to make these threats, and then carry them out as threats as opposed to making a national statement--as President Bush did, as I understand it--that if there is a process of extermination going on, or racial cleansing going on, we will not stand idly by and watch that process, and we will use our military power. 
   I don't know whether the Senator from Delaware sees the difference in the two circumstances. But, as far as I am concerned, we are still on the first base. And that is we are asked to support the concept of using force--our force, mainly unmanned--to coerce the Serbs into signing an agreement. They have refused to sign that. As a sovereign nation, they have that right. If they take the action that is contemplated, and that many people feel they are going to take--that is, to enter into a process of racial extermination--then it is an entirely different question. I do hope that the Senate will remember that as we are considering the majority leader's amendment tomorrow. 
   It does seem to me that we are still on the question of should we use force to coerce the Serbs into signing the agreement that they do not want to sign. It is perhaps a distinction without a difference to some people. But it is a great difference to me.

   Mr. STEVENS. I will go on a little bit and let him know my fears, as I expressed to the President, if we go after those air defenses. I hope Serbia knows if we go after them we will get them. There is no question in my mind we have absolute capability to totally destroy the air defenses of Serbia. After having done so, though, I wonder how are we going to get him to sign the agreement. If he doesn't sign the agreement, then I assume we are going to carry out the threat, and we are going to bomb his tanks. And we can do that, too. And then, if he doesn't sign the agreement, we can start bombing his people. And we can do that, too. All without involving our airmen yet. We can do all that without involving our airmen. 
   But the time is going to come when we are going to have to use manpower in the air or on the ground, and that is war. We ought to make up our mind. What the President is deciding is to commit an act of war. It is not covered by article V. I do not think there would be any hesitancy in President Bush, that he was threatening war. If you are threatening war in this country, that means you get a resolution, you get approval of the Congress. Only Congress can declare war.

   Mr. STEVENS. I hope you do. But what is more, as I see it, once you do that, once you lay down the air defenses of a country, once you cripple their military--remember who is around them, a bunch of people who would like to find them crippled. Pretty soon you are going to have other people coming in there. We will be protecting the Serbs, before this is over. 
   People just do not understand. We are finally going to have to put people on the ground and when we get people on the ground--how long have they been in Germany since we conquered Germany? We still have men and women in uniform in Germany pursuant to a peace agreement that was entered into 50 or more years ago. That is what I told the President. Mr. President, these people are going to be there 50 years if you do this. If you are going to do it, you better have the support of the American people before you do it. And the way you get the support of the American people is to have their Representatives here in Congress stand up and say yes, I am ready to vote for a declaration of war. 
   I told the President, if he can show me that there is a concept of inhumanity, of absolutely racial cleansing, ethnic extermination, I will introduce his resolution of war. I told him that. But short of that, I do not see we should authorize a negotiator to go over to a foreign conference and say: Tell them if they don't agree with what you tell them to do, we will bomb them. If they do not agree after that, we will bomb them again. That is using our Armed Forces as a process of negotiation, not for the purpose that we maintain our military. We maintain our military to defend this Nation and to carry out our national interests abroad, not as an arm of negotiators and not to give the Presidency a feeling that all they have to do is enter into a series of negotiations, and if they fail, then use the military and bomb away. 
   There is more to it than just bombing. There is more to it than just using Tomahawks or unmanned weapons. There is the concept of what is the followup. I say if we do that, if we take out their air defenses, we will be involved in trying to manage the Serbian military for the rest of my lifetime. I think I am going to live a little while, Mr. President. It does seem to me that it is wrong the way we are approaching this. 
   We ought to look at what is in our national interest. If our national interest requires us to use military power, Congress should authorize them to use it. But the Presidency should not use our military power to carry out negotiations. That is wrong. I still maintain that the way it is being approached this time is wrong. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume consideration of the supplemental appropriations bill. The pending amendment is the Enzi amendment regarding Indian gaming. Unless an agreement can be worked out on this amendment, I intend to move quickly to table it in an effort to keep this bill moving forward. If an agreement is not reached, all Members should expect the first vote of today's session to be approximately at 10 a.m. 
   Following that vote, it is my hope that Members with amendments will come to the floor to offer debate on those amendments. With the budget resolution scheduled beginning next week, it is imperative that the Senate complete action on the supplemental bill in a timely fashion. The cooperation of all Senators will be necessary to achieve that goal. 
   The leader has stated that on Monday the Senate is expected to debate a Kosovo resolution for several hours, and then resume consideration of this supplemental appropriations bill. There will be no rollcall votes during Monday's session, according to the leader's statement. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is an amendment that deals with the provision in the bill that was reported from the committee that deferred spending from the temporary assistance to needy families account. 
   This will defer, instead, monies from the section 8 fund of HUD. There is approximately $1.2 billion in that account. This will defer for 1 year the use of $350 million in that account. It replaces the TANF amendment in the bill. Under that amendment, we deferred until 2001 the availability of funds which are transferred to the States. 
   Because of the misunderstanding about that fund, I want to explain why we use that fund in the first place. I am once again alarmed over the misinformation that has been spread by some people in that entity, that agency, to try and make it look like somehow or other we took monies away from States or any specific State. 
   In the first place, these grant awards are made quarterly. Actual cash outlays are made, but they are not transferred to the States until the States make expenditures in their TANF programs, the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families. In other words, the States first make the payments, and we pay it back. Some people, in the House in particular, have said this a way that the States can use this money for a piggy bank. In no way can they take this money and put it into another bank account and draw interest on it if they comply with the law. That is one report I have heard--that we are preventing States from taking the money to put it into their own accounts. 
   We checked and we found that there was between $3 billion and $3.5 billion at the close of fiscal year 1998 in this fund. There are two quarters that have not even been distributed yet of this fiscal year 1999. And it is clear that the States have spent some money, and there is plenty of money to meet the States' expenditures and their requests for reimbursement of those expenditures. But this is not a fund that the States can 
   come to willy-nilly and transfer the funds to their accounts. 
   Secondly, Mr. President, we deferred this money from obligation in this fiscal year--really until 2001, October 1, 2001. 
   The States would not--the bill that was reported from the committee--lose any of their funds. We, pursuant to the entitlement that was authorized, agreed that Federal funds, taxpayers' funds, in the amount of $16.5 billion, from 1997 through 2002, would be placed in this account, to be available to reimburse States for the expenditures they made for Assistance to Needy Families. 
   Nothing in what the Appropriations Committee did harmed that program at all. But because by October 1 another $16.5 billion would have been added to $3 billion to $3.5 billion in that account--and there has never been a drawdown at the rate that would make those funds needed within that period of time. 
   This is not a rainy day fund. We have been told that some people have said that States take these monies and put them in a rainy day fund to use at a later date. But the law says they can only get them to reimburse expenditures. If the administration is allowing this fund to be used as a rainy day account or a piggy bank account, it is wrong. 
   We have had so many calls from so many States, including my own. And I see the Senator from New York is here, and I know that they have been besieged because of their population base. Of course, they are eligible for more money from this account, more than anyone other than California. But it depends on how much they spend before they can get it back. 
   We made the decision to offset this bill. This is the first time we have offset totally a supplemental emergency bill. I have said to our committee, we ought to offset emergency funds with prior appropriated emergency funds and nonemergency funds with nonemergency prior appropriated funds. I think we are going to have a little discussion about that here on the floor. 
   But clearly what we have done, Mr. President, is we have used this bill to reprogram prior appropriated funds. These funds that were appropriated to the TANF account are sitting there waiting for the States to spend money and then come and ask for it to be repaid. The process is so rapid that the administration has not paid the first two quarters of this year yet. So this is not something we have interfered with by deferring money until the second fiscal year. Because, as I said, this account would get $16.5 billion credited to it on October 1. 
   What we have done is, in order to avoid this controversy--and we do not need a controversy on this bill. We need to get it done. This bill, in my opinion, is a very important bill. It will provide money for assistance because of a great natural disaster in a neighboring country in this hemisphere. The President asked us to declare that an emergency. We have taken the declaration of emergency through as far as the outlay categories are concerned, because it is very difficult to score under the budget process outlays that come from emergency accounts. 
   We have not taken an emergency declaration through on those things that we believe are nonemergency in terms of the authorization process. So by that I mean, I fail to understand how we should extend the concept of emergency appropriations to natural disasters off our shores. We should be able to find the money, if we want to be good humanitarian members of this 
   hemisphere, to assist our neighbors. 
   I believe we should assist them. But I do not believe we should use the laws that were intended to demand taxpayers' funds immediately to meet natural disasters or declared emergencies by the President of the United States within the boundaries of our United States. 
   So Mr. President, I offer this amendment in the spirit of compromise, to try and take away this battle that I saw coming over the use of TANF funds. No one supports the concepts of this Temporary Assistance to Needy Families. We all know it replaced the old Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the AFDC program, that assisted so many States, including mine for so many years. 
   But this now is a block grant program that works in conjunction with the welfare-to-work concepts, and that is very vital for the States. We know that. And I think the fear that was engendered in those States that somehow or other we might not keep the commitment that was made, that if they make those expenditures we would repay them according to the formula under the law that was passed in 1996, the Welfare Reform Act, is unfortunate and wrong. 
   I hope that someone in the administration is listening. One of these days I will find some way to tweak the nose of the people who keep doing this, because they did it in the terms of border guards last week, and now they are doing it in terms of the States themselves in terms of the comments that have been made that somehow or other we were taking money that the States were entitled to; we were deferring money that they were entitled to,  which they would never get under the process of the law anyway until the time we deferred the expenditures. 
   As a matter of fact, some people on this side of the aisle have argued with me to say this is not a full offset because I know that I am offsetting the expenditures under this bill against a fund that would never be expended this year. That is partially true. That is why we have declared an emergency, as far as the outlays, and we have admitted that, and we have said that is the only way we can do it. But we need to do it. I hope, in particular, my new friend from New York will understand that we are doing this to meet his objections and others, and we do so in the spirit of compromise. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.

   We have Senator SHELBY's amendment which makes a technical correction to title IV. 
   We have an amendment by Senator BYRD making a technical correction to the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program in the bill. 
   An amendment by Senator FRIST and Senator THOMPSON providing $3.2 million for repairs to Jackson, TN, Army aviation facility damaged by a tornado in January. It also provides for an offset in the same amount. 
   An amendment by myself for a technical correction to the current year, 1999's Commerce-Justice-State bill, and provides for rules on the taking of Beluga whales.

   not expect them all to be offered when you see what is going to happen to this amendment. I say that advisedly, after being advised by the proponents. 
   But, Mr. President, it is going to be my policy as the majority manager of this bill to move to table every amendment that is not cleared on both sides. This is an emergency measure. We are going home a week from Friday. Next week is all taken up with the budget. We either get this done now so we can go to conference with the House on Monday or Tuesday and bring it back before Friday, or we might as well forget about it. 
   So I respectfully inform the Senate I shall move, as the manager, to table every amendment that does not have bipartisan support. So, if you have an amendment on that list and you do not want to lose on it, now is the time to take it off.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have a progress report for the Senate. Our chief of staff, Mr. Cortese, has just informed me that we have approximately 20 of the 70 amendments that were listed on the agreement almost ready for presentation for approval on a bipartisan basis. 
   I am making this statement to appeal to Senators who have amendments on the list to bring them to our staff so we can review them now, and I hope that when we explain to them why we cannot take them, they will withdraw their amendments. 
   I am hopeful we can pursue a process and find a way to complete action on this bill by noon tomorrow. I do hope that will happen. 
   I will be able to present those other amendments to the Senate for approval on a bipartisan basis probably within an hour or so. Meanwhile, we cannot proceed all the way through the amendments unless the Senators give us their amendments to review. I know there are two committee meetings at this time, Mr. President. They are slowing down this process, and they are both trying to get bills out in order that they may be considered next week. We will just have to bear with the situation for a few more hours. 
   We intend to keep going on this bill, and that may mean late tonight, if necessary. If we had the cooperation of the Senate in presenting these amendments, I think we could tell the Senate by 6 or 6:30 the number of votes we will have to have and when they will occur. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

I believe that Senator COCHRAN and Senator INOUYE have championed this measure for some time now in the face of very strong opposition. I am pleased to see that opposition is now fading away. 
   I cannot fathom anyone being opposed to deploying the defenses that are necessary to protect this Nation. Recent events clearly warn that our Nation must prepare for the worst possible scenario. We have watched reports that India and Pakistan have detonated nuclear devices. Each of these countries have very solid, demonstrated capabilities in building ballistic missiles. Our U.S. intelligence community admitted surprise after those demonstrations. 
   Unrest in Indonesia and turmoil in other Pacific nation economies demand the attention of the United States and the world. Those nations increasingly look to develop or acquire a range of ballistic missiles. The threat that troubles me the most is North Korea. North Korea's missiles can already reach parts of Alaska and Hawaii, and perhaps beyond. 
   When I visited North Korea 2 years ago, I was struck by the contrast there. Their people live a life of sacrifice, but many of their limited resources are diverted to military investments. The United States should not underestimate the determination of the North Koreans nor the risks the threats pose to the United States and our Pacific allies. 
   Now, new reports indicate that North Korea may launch another rocket, possibly a satellite or possibly a longer-range ballistic missile. The world's ability to monitor North Korea now is limited. We all know that. Certainly almost no one in the intelligence community anticipated the recent launch of the multistage booster that we saw. 
   Just as in World War II, the first to be threatened in the Pacific will be the States of Hawaii and Alaska. My constituents, the residents of Alaska, ask me, Why should it not be the policy of the United States to deploy a national missile defense system as soon as it is technically feasible? I can state categorically that after my recent trip home I know Alaskans want these defenses now. 
   Indeed, the Alaska Legislature has already passed a joint resolution calling on the President of the United States to deploy a national missile defense system. I know, as more Americans recognize that this threat is here today--and I believe the whole country will wonder what is wrong with us; I believe they are going to even wonder why we have to have this debate this long on this issue. 
   I am confident that Members of the Senate should be familiar with the congressionally established commission of evaluating the ballistic missile threat to the United States, known as the Rumsfeld Commission, which completed a thorough review of the missile technologies existing in other countries. More importantly, that Commission recognizes the fact that missile technologies are increasingly available to any nation with money and determination to use them. 
   Protecting our Nation requires building a national missile defense system that will protect every square inch of every 
   State, including Alaska and Hawaii, and the 48 contiguous States. When this issue first came before the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, the administration projected a system that would defend almost all of the 48 States but did not include Alaska and Hawaii and the tips of Maine and Florida. At that time, I expressed concern about that. I am pleased to see we all are now considering a truly national missile defense system. 
   In recent weeks, I was fully briefed on the Defense Department's efforts to develop a national missile defense, a defense which would provide our Nation's only capability against these missiles. I have been reassured of the commitment to protect all 50 States by Lieutenant General Lyles, the Director of the Ballistic Missile Organization. I can also tell the Senate that some of the best engineers in this Nation are working on the current national missile defense program under the direction of Brigadier General Nance, a very capable officer and knowledgeable program manager. 
   I believe this team, and any of the ballistic missile defense organization program managers, would tell the Senate that building this defense system is technically feasible today. That is good news. We have it within our reach and our means to build a missile defense system to protect our entire Nation from ballistic missiles. 
   Last year, we added $1 billion as emergency funds for the development of the missile defenses to protect the United States as well as its deployed forces. This Cochran-Inouye bill makes clear that these funds are available only for enhanced testing, accelerated development, construction, integration, and infrastructure efforts in support of ballistic missile defense systems.  
   The taxpayers' money being made available on an emergency basis was put up for the purpose of encouraging the availability of this system and to reward success in the efforts. I believe we have to have the ability to defeat the threat that is posed by ballistic missiles as soon as possible. Many Senators will recall the criticisms made last year of our ballistic missile defense programs--too little testing, schedules that didn't ask for the dollars available, and many other concerns expressed. 
   I am pleased to report to the Senate that the $1 billion emergency increase has become a catalyst for the national missile defense program--allowing this program to add testing, fully fund development, and to rebut the critics who say it is not possible for such a system to be deployed. 
   The administration has stated that it will match these funds and budget the necessary additional funds to develop and deploy a national missile defense system. I am still concerned that the funds budgeted by the administration, however, will allow a missile defense system to be deployed about 2005. 
   On March 14, 1995, Defense Secretary Perry testified before our Defense Appropriations Subcommittee that:  
   On the national missile defense system, that system would be ready for deployment in 3 years on the basis of this program projection, and then 3 years later than that it would be operational.  
   He said it would be operational in 3 years.  
   So we are about 6 years away from deployment of national missile defense systems.  
   That was 1995. In responding to my question during a 
   hearing in June of 1995, Lt. Gen. Malcolm O'Neill noted Secretary Perry's promise and went on to add:  
   I think the timeframe (Secretary Perry) talked about was 3 years of development and then 3 years to deploy. So that would mean a 2001 scenario, and that would get a system in position before the Taepo Dong 2.  
   Mr. President, that is the Korean missile that we are all so worried about now. The Taepo Dong 2 is ready now but we are still developing a system. The national missile defense system that should be in place by 2001 will not be there in 2001, and we were promised an operational national missile defense system as early as 2001. As one who has watched this system now develop over a period of years, I have been frustrated that it has slipped now, apparently, to 2005. The track record is one of continual delays and slips as far as the deployment date is concerned. 
   I believe that this Nation must get ahead of the threats. The risks are too great. 
   Again, I basically come here to commend these two Senators for their very hard work on this bill. 
   Senator COCHRAN and Senator INOUYE deserve the entire support of the Senate. I am pleased that these matters which had previously looked like they might delay this bill might be resolved. I congratulate the managers of this bill and its author for their wisdom and determination. I hope the Senate will proceed rapidly to approve it.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate will consider a supplemental appropriations bill that includes both emergency and nonemergency spending for the fiscal year. 
   Over the past 3 months, the Office of Management and Budget has transmitted to Congress several supplemental budget requests, totaling $2 billion.  
   These requests seek funding for agricultural relief, implementation of the Wye River Accords and recovery in Central America from the damage caused by Hurricane Mitch. 
   Each of the subcommittees has examined the requests under their jurisdiction, and closely reviewed other emergent agency needs. 
   In addition, the administration proposed deep cuts in defense funds to offset additional foreign assistance sought for Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian Authority. 
   This proposed offset re-opened issues settled in the omnibus bill in October, and violated the spirit of the firewalls that govern discretionary spending for fiscal year 1999. 
   In total, the bill reported by the committee provides $1.538 billion in emergency appropriations and $332 million in non-emergency appropriations. 
   These new appropriations are matched by $1.87 billion in rescissions and program deferrals. 
   The recommendations made by the committee nearly double the administration's request for agricultural relief, providing a total of $285 million. 
   That bill proposes $100 million in funding this year for Jordan, to provide additional support for a vital ally during a period of transition and tension in the region. 
   The deferral of the remaining $800 million in funding to implement the Wye agreements does not reflect opposition to that request. 
   After consultation with the administration, it was determined that those amounts can await consideration later this year. This committee has a long record of support for the Middle East Peace Process--our friends in the region know they can count on us. 
   The amounts requested for Hurricane Mitch relief respond to the truly desperate conditions facing our neighbors in Central America. 
   The Department of Defense, and the U.S. Southern Command, led by Gen. Charles Wilhelm, deserve great credit for their efforts to respond to the immediate crisis late last year. 
   We must backfill the amounts spent by the Department to ensure our ability to respond to future crises is not diminished--especially in respect to drawdown authorities and overseas humanitarian assistance. 
   In addition, we must address the needs of our friends in Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic to rebuild from this disaster. These funds provide a good first step in that effort. 
   Recognizing the considerable amount of emergency spending provided in the omnibus bill in October, I recommended that all new appropriations in this bill be offset by rescissions of other available funds. 
   These rescissions include defense and non-defense discretionary appropriations, mandatory appropriations, emergency appropriations and funding deferrals. 
   There were very few good choices to consider. I'm sure every Member here might have assembled a different mix of offsets. 
   These rescissions, totaling $1.868 billion, reflect an effort to balance competing needs. 
   Only defense funds were rescinded to offset defense spending, and only non-defense amounts to balance the non-defense spending. 
   Some of these will be controversial, but our intention is to reduce only funds that are not likely to be obligated this year, or are of a low priority. 
   We are at or over the budget caps for 1999. We have no headroom or flexibility to make any non-emergency appropriation unless it is fully offset in both budget authority and outlays. 
   For that reason, any amendment to this bill must be accompanied by offsets. I must insist that even emergency spending amendments be accompanied by budget authority offsets. 
   Finally, many Members have raised various legislative amendments this week. 
   I hope that controversial amendments can again be deferred. Every Member has a right to propose amendments, but this is a supplemental appropriations bill, and deals with some very real emergency needs. 
   In my judgment, we need to complete final action and try to send this bill to the President before the Easter recess which commences a week from tomorrow. I believe we must pass the bill in the Senate this week to meet that schedule. 
   Mr. President, compared to previous emergency supplemental appropriations bills presented to this body, this bill does not respond to the kind of domestic disasters we faced in 1997 or 1998. 
   This is a modest bill, that is fully offset in terms of new budget authority. 
   It extends an important hand of friendship and support to our neighbors in Central America, and a closer partner in the Middle East Peace Process, Jordan. 
   Mr. President, it is our goal to complete this bill by Friday, no later than 11 a.m. 
   I yield for my good friend from West Virginia.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I say to my friend, I was looking around to see who he was talking about when he was talking about that kind, benevolent and calm fellow, but I do thank you for your courtesy and kindness. It is a pleasure to work with you. Mr. President, I studied under Senator BYRD so long I think I imitate his ways. I have tried to anyway. 
   Mr. President, it is now time to have an amendment offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. SPECTER. It is my hope, and I want to announce to the Senate it is my hope, we will get an agreement tomorrow that will require amendments to this bill to be filed no later than 5 o'clock. We don't have that agreement yet. It has not been cleared. But if we are to finish this bill and get it ready to go immediately to the House after the House passes their bill on Monday, it will be necessary to complete this bill on Friday. I am hopeful we will complete it in time to allow those people who have to catch planes to go West, so they can make their schedules. 
   I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania. There is a time agreement for tomorrow on this amendment, is my understanding, but there is no time limit this evening. Is that correct?

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have not gone into this argument before. In the committee, in dealing with this supplemental, I did vote for the Hutchison amendment. I voted for it because I do believe that, because of the circumstances of this series of settlements coming after the failure of the Congress to pass the tobacco legislation, we should not force the States to turn the money over to the Federal Government as required by law.

   Mr. STEVENS. I thank our majority leader. Throughout this ordeal, no one has tried to poll me on any substantive matter or influence my vote. That, to me, means a great deal. I view this process as the most serious task I have faced as a Senator over the past 30 years, and I appreciate the recognition by the leadership of the solemnity of our duties under these circumstances and the fact that we each must reach our own conclusions based on the evidence. 
   As Senators, each of us joined in this oath:  
   I ..... do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.  
   And now, we took an additional oath:  
   [I] solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States, now pending, [I] will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws, so help [me] God.  
   As free citizens of the world's most successful democracy we are inexorably tied to the pledges and commitments we make. These obligations, and the unlimited benefits they bestow on us, depend on our willingness to be truthful with one another. The President took the two most serious oaths any American ever encounters: the oath to faithfully execute our laws, administered by the Chief Justice, our Presiding Officer, on the steps of this building, and the oath to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth to a jury of his peers. 
   I am most concerned that the action we take here to day not denigrate the role of oaths and truth in our society. To be fair to the President, I feel he believed that he admitted to the Grand Jury that he had not testified truthfully under oath in his deposition. In fact he did not, and he did not tell the truth to the grand jury either. 
   Both the House Managers and the President's lawyers have seized on apparent conflicts in the evidence and recorded testimony before this Court of Impeachment. Nonetheless, the evidentiary record and the presentations of both sides, as supplemented by their responses to our questions, leave no doubt in my mind that if I were sitting as a juror in a criminal case I would find that the accused is guilty of perjury as charged in Article I. Following the jury's verdict, it would then fall to the judge to determine appropriate punishment within the bounds of the federal sentencing guidelines provided by Congress. 
   But an impeachment trial is no ordinary proceeding. We sit as judge and jury--rulers on law and triers of fact. The Constitution charges us with a great responsibility. Section 4 of Article II of the Constitution requires that the President be removed from office upon conviction of high crimes and misdemeanors. No President has ever been removed under these circumstances. To me, that history alone should make each of us seriously consider whether the facts presented to us require that the Senate exercise this awesome power. 
   The process by which our Founding Fathers determined that this power should be vested in the Congress is adequately briefed in the record. I found particularly helpful the testimony and scholarly papers from the hearings before the House Judiciary Committee on November 9, 1998. 
   Remember in the House committee deliberations, the minority submitted a joint resolution of censure for consideration in lieu of the Articles finally voted upon. It restated:  
   Expressing the sense of Congress with respect to the censure of William Jefferson Clinton. Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That it is the sense of Congress that--

   Mr. STEVENS. We cannot hear that monitor. 
   Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. I will read the answer again:  
   ..... and Mr. Jordan informed you of that, is that right? 
   Answer: No, sir.  
   Now, in fairness to the President, he gives a longer answer than that. I welcome anybody to read it, but it appears rather convoluted. I think that you can see the contrast. There is no question in Mr. Jordan's mind as to the details that he is providing to the President on a regular basis. We are on December 19. The subpoena is issued. He notifies the President. He notifies the President how the job search is going. He notifies the President that they got representation through Mr. Carter. So the details are provided to the President and to contrast that with the President's recollection as to did he have any contact with Mr. Jordan, once again diminishing that. 
   Let's go back to December 19, back to the chart--to December 19 when the subpoena is issued. Mr. Jordan meets with Monica Lewinsky. He confronts her about the relationship. Now, he goes that evening to see the President at the White House to confront him personally about it to discuss this with him. Let's hear from Mr. Jordan, and this is at the White House.

    Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have in the past brought to the attention of the Senate one of the most significant economic problems facing Alaska--the underdevelopment of the business sector in the rural areas of Alaska. Today I am introducing the Rural Business Lending Act to help fix this problem in my state and in Hawaii. Senators INOUYE, MURKOWSKI, and AKAKA join me as cosponsors. 
   Many of my colleagues have heard me speak of Alaska's vast size, of our lack of a highway system, and of the problems faced by small Alaska communities because of their remoteness and because they are islands surrounded by a sea of federal land. Our economic problems are in some ways more like the problems of third-world countries than the problems of towns in the contiguous 48 states. More than 130 Alaska villages and communities have populations under 3,000, and almost 80 percent of these communities are not connected to any road or highway system. They can be reached only by small plane or boat. Many do not have a bank branch office or any other lending source. 
   The nearest banks--which, even within Alaska are likely to be hundreds of miles away--often cannot make loans in rural communities due to the cost of servicing the loans, the cost of transportation, higher credit risks and other unknown risks, the seasonality of the economy, and the collateral limitations inherent to remote real estate. Most Alaska villages have few, if any, privately- or independently-owned small businesses. 
   The Rural Business Lending Act would attempt to help with these problems. The bill would create a pilot loan guarantee program in Alaska and Hawaii administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). The pilot program is modeled after the SBA 7(a) program that was in effect prior to changes made in 1995. These changes dramatically reduced small business lending by banks and other financial institutions in Alaska. Among other things, the changes: (1) decreased the portion of a loan that SBA could guarantee under the 7(a) Program, from 90 percent of the loan amount down to a sliding scale of only up to 80 percent; and (2) increased the guarantee fee for 7(a) loans from 2 percent of the loan amount up to a sliding scale of between 2 percent and 3.875 percent. Another change was that the SBA discontinued servicing loans that have gone into default. This change is particularly detrimental in Alaska and Hawaii, because of the transportation costs involved in servicing a loan, and in small Alaska communities because it is difficult for the employee of a bank branch to take action against his neighbor on a loan. 
   Before these changes went into effect, the SBA 7(a) lending program provided much of the critical financing for rural Alaska businesses. For instance, the SBA guaranteed 315 loans totaling $29 million with fiscal year 1995 funds--170 of which went to businesses in what we consider rural areas of Alaska (generally not on the road system). By comparison, the SBA guaranteed only 88 loans in Alaska--and only 48 in rural areas--with fiscal year 1998 funds, after the changes had gone into effect. The total amount of the loans between fiscal year 1995 and fiscal year 1998 decreased by over 60 percent, from $29 million down to $10 million. It appears this downward trend is continuing during the Fiscal Year 1999 cycle. 
   Prior to the changes, the National Bank of Alaska was one of SBA's biggest 7(a) lending program participants, having made over 91 loans totaling more than $15 million during the fiscal year 1995 cycle. Three years later, during the fiscal year 1998 cycle, the National Bank of Alaska made no loans under the 7(a) program. There is no question that the changes have negatively affected the availability of loan funds and credit in rural Alaska and other rural areas. 
   The bill I am introducing today is intended to make the 7(a) program more viable in the rural parts of Alaska and Hawaii. The Rural Business Lending Act would create a 3-year ``Rural Business Lending Program'' in the 49th and 50th states that would be similar to 7(a) Program before the 1995 changes. It would allow up to 90 percent of loan amounts to be guaranteed, cap the guarantee fee at 1 percent, require the SBA to service loans on which it honors a guarantee, and allow the SBA to waive annual loan fees (one-half of one percent of the outstanding loan balance under existing law) if necessary to increase lending. Loans under the ``Rural Business Lending Program'' would be available only in communities with a population of 9,000 or fewer. The program would be required to be administered from the SBA's Alaska and Hawaii offices, where the unique characteristics and needs of rural small businesses are more likely to be understood. The SBA would be required to report to Congress after two years on the effectiveness of the program so that consideration could be given to making it permanent or expanding it to other areas. 
   This legislation will ensure that small businesses in rural Alaska and Hawaii have similar access to the national 7(a) Program that other small businesses have. The national 7(a) program should not provide opportunities only to businesses in urban settings. The changes in the Act are intended to revive the SBA 7(a) Program in rural parts of Alaska and Hawaii, creating a model that perhaps can be applied more broadly in the future. I look forward to working with other Senators on the enactment of this legislation that is so critical to small businesses in Alaska and Hawaii, and ultimately perhaps, to small businesses in rural areas throughout the United States.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have all been pleased with the recent decline in crime in many areas of the country, and today I am introducing a bill to acknowledge the great commitment and sacrifice public safety officers at every level have made to that decline. From responding to traffic accidents, apprehending violent criminals, fighting fires, combating domestic terrorism, assisting people during natural disasters--not to mention performing the functions many of us take for granted--public safety officers are essential to the well-being and stability of the United States. 
   While public safety accomplishments often go unrecognized, the selfless service of those who work each day to preserve the peace and improve safety in our communities continues. This past year were reminded of the tremendous sacrifices of this American mainstay when Officers Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson gave their lives defending the peace and protecting lives in our nation's Capitol. In fact, since 1988 over 700 law enforcement officers have been killed in the line of duty, another 629 have been killed in duty-related accidents, and over 600,000 have been assaulted. We owe a tremendous debt to these heroes and to their families who have made such a tremendous sacrifice for the rest of us. 
   In the past ten years we've had earthquakes, flooding, hurricanes, vast fires, record cold spells, and numerous other natural disasters. Throughout those natural disasters, Americans from around the country counted on firemen, emergency medical technicians, emergency services personnel, and other public safety personnel from all levels of government. The many peaceful moments and days that we enjoy between these disasters and tragedies are the product of the vigilance, dedication, and hard work of those dedicated to the protection of the public. 
   In recognition and honor of these great public servants, I am introducing the Public Safety Medal of Valor Act. This Act establishes the highest national recognition of valor for public safety personnel for acts above and beyond the call of duty. 
   Under this legislation, an 11-member Medal Review Board selected by the Congress and by the President will consider nominations of public safety officers and select recipients of the medal. No more than 10 Public Safety Medal of Valor recipients will be selected in one year. I call on all of the members of the Senate and House to join me in support of this important measure to at last provide national recognition to the heroes in the field of public safety.

   Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, according to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service more than 221,000,000 acres of wetlands existed at the time of Colonial America in the area that is now the contiguous United States. Since then 117,000,000 of those areas, roughly 53 percent, have been filled, drained, or otherwise removed from wetland status. 
   In the 1972 Federal Water Pollution Control Act, more commonly known as the Clean Water Act, Congress broadly expanded Federal jurisdiction over wetlands by modifying the definition of ``navigable waters'' as used in the 1899 Rivers and Harbors Act. The 1899 Act established the basis for regulating disposition of dredge spoils in navigable waters. The 1972 Act expanded that basis to encompass all ``water of the United States''. 
   In 1975, a United States district court ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to publish revised regulations concerning their program to implement section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Since then, the Courts have further expanded upon the Corps's authority to include isolated wetlands and have issued decisions that effectively constrain agency decision makers to act only to promote conservation, often at the expense of sound economic development. This expansion of Congressional intent has also formed the basis for burdensome intrusions on the property rights of many Alaskans, Alaskan Native Corporations, and the State of Alaska. 
   The erosion of agency discretion clearly undermines the Corps of Engineers' ability to implement sound public policy in my State. Over the 100 years since the Rivers and Harbors Act, their ``Section 404'' regulatory program has become unnecessarily inflexible and unresponsive to common sense. In recognizing the value of preserving and restoring wetlands where appropriate, Congress intended to leave appropriate discretion to agency managers to balance competing public values. That intent has lost flexibility with age. Today the lack of regulatory flexibility threatens to destroy the economic health of many Alaskans. We are being over-regulated to the point of economic strangulation. 
   According to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, approximately 170,200,000 acres of wetlands existed in Alaska in the 1780's and approximately 170,000,000 acres of wetlands exist now. That represents a loss of less than one-tenth of 1 percent through the combined effects of either human or natural processes. 
   Alaska contains more wetlands than all of the other States combined. Fully 75 percent of the non-mountainous areas of Alaska are wetlands. Yet we are regulating these vast wetlands in Alaska to the same strict levels as all the other states, without regard to either special economic hardships or the unnecessary federal expense this causes. 
   Ninety-eight percent of all Alaskan communities, including 200 of the 226 remote villages in Alaska, which incidently are dispersed over 1/5th of the land mass of the United States, are located in or adjacent to wetlands. To promote the economic self sufficiency of these remote communities, about 43,000,000 acres of land were granted to Alaska Natives through regional and village corporations. 
   These Native allotments were intended to be available for use. However between 45 percent and 100 percent of each Native corporation's land is categorized as wetlands. Therefore development of these Native lands and basic community infrastructure is delayed or even prevented by an ever tightening regulatory regime designed to protect an excessively abundant resource in Alaska because it is scarce elsewhere in the Union. 
   Naturally Alaska villages, municipalities, boroughs, city governments, and Native organizations are increasingly frustrated with the constraints of the wetlands regulatory program because it interferes with the location of community centers, airports, sanitation systems, roads, schools, industrial areas, and other critical community infrastructure. 
   The same is true of State-owned lands. 104,000,000 acres of land were granted to the State of Alaska at statehood for purposes of economic development. Nowhere is flexibility more appropriate than on these lands. What minimal identifiable environmental benefits expected from the ever tightened regulation of wetlands are certainly not justified in Alaska. 
   The Federal Government already has vast wetlands holdings in Alaska under the protection of a variety of Federal land management programs. In Alaska we have 62 percent of all federally designated wilderness lands, 70 percent of all Federal park lands, and 90 percent of all Federal refuge lands, thus providing protection against use or degradation for approximately 60,000,000 acres of wetlands. National policies intended to achieve `no net loss' of wetlands reflect a response to the 53 percent loss  of the wetlands base in the 48 contiguous States, but do not take into account the large percentage of conserved wetlands in Alaska. 
   Only 12 percent of Alaska's wetlands are privately owned, compared to 74 percent of the wetlands in the 48 contiguous States. Wetlands regulation designed to protect a large majority of a dwindling resource are clearly too strict where they would only apply to a small percentage of a vase resource. Unfortunately, Federal agencies no longer enjoy the discretion to modify their program to address these special circumstances. As a result, individual landowners in Alaska have lost up to 97 percent of their property value and Alaskan communities have lost a significant portion of their tax base due to wetlands regulations. 
   Expansion of the wetlands regulatory program in this manager is beyond what the Congress intended when it passed the Clean Water Act. In Alaska, it has placed unnecessary economic and administrative burdens on private property owners, small businesses, city governments, State government, farmers, ranchers, and others, while providing negligible environmental benefits. 
   It is time to stop using the wrong regulatory tools. For a State, such as Alaska, with substantial conserved wetlands, my bill provides much needed relief from the excessive burdens of the current cumbersome federal wetlands regulatory program. It relaxes the most stringent aspects of wetlands regulation, without dismantling agency discretion to regulate where necessary. This bill restores common sense and cost effectiveness without loss of high value wetlands.
