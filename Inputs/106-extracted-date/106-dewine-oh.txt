   Mr. DEWINE. I notice my colleague from Ohio, Senator VOINOVICH is on the floor as well as the majority leader. I think I speak for my colleague when I say we are extremely disappointed that our bill, S. 2955, was not able to be passed in this Congress. That bill is very important to asbestos victims and two of our State's largest employers.  As we all probably know, our nation is facing an asbestos litigation crisis. A crisis for which the federal government, in my opinion, shares responsibility. From World War II through the Vietnam war, the government mandated the use of asbestos to insulate our naval fleet from secondary fires. This mandate is the cause of many tragic disabilities. Unfortunately, while the federal government would be one of the largest asbestos defenders due to this mandate, an aggressive and successful litigation strategy to assert sovereign immunity has allowed them to evade any monetary culpability. 
   Since the federal government is not paying their fair share of the costs, the former asbestos manufacturers are burdened with asbestos claims. Of the approximately 30 original core defendants, over two dozen have gone bankrupt, in large part due to asbestos claims. The situation has reached the crisis stage. Good companies, providing good jobs, and providing payments to victims, are in significant peril. The recent bankruptcies of several former asbestos manufacturers have placed an even more overwhelming burden on the remaining defendants. Due to joint and several liability, the remaining defendant companies are now paying an even higher share of asbestos claims. The markets have taken note. Stock market values are declining, making it more and more difficult for these companies to receive the financing they need to survive. The very future of these companies, the very future of these jobs are at stake. 
   But, it is not just the companies who are suffering. Asbestos victims are also suffering greatly. They are not receiving the awards to which they are entitled. If something is not done to correct this situation, good companies will continue to go bankrupt, good jobs will continue to be lost, and asbestos victims will not receive any compensation. 
   We must act now to do this. I understand the majority leader understands and appreciates the urgency of this situation. I would ask that the bill that Senator VOINOVICH and I have introduced would be one of the first bills considered when we return for the 107th.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to hail the impending passage of H.R. 4640--the DNA Backlog Elimination Act. This is a House companion bill to S. 903--the Violent Offender DNA Identification Act of 1999--which I introduced with my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator KOHL. 
   While existing anticrime technology can allow us to solve many violent crimes that occur in our communities, in order for this technology to work, it must be used. I have been a longtime advocate for use of the Combined DNA Indexing System (CODIS), which serves as a national DNA data base to profile convicted offender DNA. In fact, during consideration of the Anti-Terriorism Act of 1996, I proposed a provision under which Federal convicted offenders' DNA would be included in CODIS. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice never implemented this law, though currently all 50 States collect DNA from convicted offenders. 
   One of the purposes of this legislation is to expressly require the collection of DNA samples from federally convicted felons and military personnel convicted of similar offenses. Collection of convicted offender DNA is crucial to solving many of the crimes occurring in our communities. Statistics show that many of these violent felons will repeat their crimes once they are back in society. Since the Federal Government does not collect DNA from these felons, however, the ability of law enforcement to rapidly identify likely suspects is slowed. Collection of such data is critical. 
   The case of Mrs. Debbie Smith of Virginia underscores the importance of collection of DNA from convicted offenders. Debbie Smith was at her home in the middle of the day when a masked intruder entered her unlocked back door. Her husband, a police lieutenant, was upstairs sleeping. The stranger blindfolded Mrs. Smith and took her to a wooded area behind her house where he robbed and repeatedly raped her. After warning Mrs. Smith not to tell, the assailant let her go. She told her husband, who reported the incident, then took her to the hospital where evidence was collected for DNA analysis. 
   Debbie Smith's rape experience was so terrible that she contemplated taking her own life. She continued to live in constant fear until 6 1/2 years later when a State crime laboratory found a CODIS match with an inmate then serving in jail for abduction and robbery. In fact, the offender was jailed on another offense 1 month after raping her. There are thousands of other crimes the DNA database can solve. With CODIS we can grant countless victims, like Mrs. Smith, peace of mind and bring their attackers swiftly to justice. 
   We need to do everything we can to make sure law enforcement has access to these tools. A major obstacle facing State and local crime laboratories are the backlogs of convicted offender samples. The Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that there are almost one-half million convicted offender samples in State and local laboratories awaiting analysis. Increasing demand for DNA analysis in active cases, and limited resources, are reducing the ability of State and local crime laboratories to analyze their convicted offender backlogs. While I introduced, and Congress passed, the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998 to address the long-term needs of crime laboratories, many crime laboratories need immediate assistance to address their short-term backlogs that will help law enforcement solve crime. 
   H.R. 4640 would provide $170 million over 4 years to help State and local crime laboratories address their convicted offender backlogs. Violent criminals should not be able to evade responsibility simply because a State lacks the resources to analyze their DNA samples, or because a loophole excludes certain Federal offenders from our national database. This legislation will be a huge asset for our local law enforcers in their day-to-day fight against crime. 
   I thank Representative MCCOLLUM for his efforts.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to support passage of H.R. 4281, the ``ICCVAM Authorization Act of 2000.'' This bill would make permanent the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods, otherwise known as ``ICCVAM.'' Doing so would give companies and federal agencies a sense of certainty and would encourage them to make the long-term research investments necessary to develop new, revised, and alternative toxicology test methods for ICCVAM to review. This would decrease and ultimately could lead to the end of animal use in testing shampoos, pesticides, and other products, while ensuring that human safety and product effectiveness remain protected. 
   ICCVAM was created pursuant to the 1993 National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act's mandate that the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) recommend new processes for federal agencies' acceptance of new, revised, or alternative toxicology test methods. ICCVAM is composed of representatives of various federal agencies that use or regulate the use of animals in toxicity testing. 
   ICCVAM evaluates and recommends improved test methods and makes it possible for more uniform testing to be adopted across federal agencies. Ultimately, ICCVAM streamlines the test method validation and approval process by evaluating methods of interest to multiple agencies, thus reducing the need for companies to perform multiple animal tests to meet the requirements of different federal agencies. This bill and ICCVAM do not apply to regulations related to medical research. 
   Recent advances in analytical chemistry and computer modeling have created new opportunities for the development of more accurate, faster, and less expensive test methods--methods that use fewer animals or bypass the need to use any animals in toxicity testing. This is a ``win-win'' situation for the public, industry, animal protection groups, and agencies. 
   This is a truly bipartisan and cooperative effort among industry, animal protection groups, and various federal agencies. It simply makes sense to make permanent a process that is currently working so well. This bill is supported by the Doris Day Animal League, Procter & Gamble, the Colgate-Palmolive Company, the Humane Society, the American Humane Association, the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Gillette Company, the Chemical Specialties Manufacturers Association, the American Chemistry Council, the Soap and Detergent Association, the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association, and the American Crop Protection Association. 
   I thank Senators KENNEDY, MURRAY, SMITH of New Hampshire, ABRAHAM, SANTORUM, and BOXER for their support of ICCVAM and for their work in this bipartisan effort. I also thank Chairman JEFFORDS for his help in moving forward the Senate counterpart bill I introduced--S. 1495--upon which we based our bipartisan negotiations.

   Mr. DEWINE. I can assure my colleague from Montana that nothing in this legislation is intended to prevent or slow the implementation of existing statutory mandates under the FQPA and SDWA. 
   In fact, the EPA is currently exercising its discretion to submit test methods to be used in the EDSP to the ICCVAM for assessment of validation. Nothing in this legislation challenges a Federal agency's authority to choose which screens and tests to send to ICCVAM for review, and an agency's decision whether to refer a test to ICCVAM and whether to follow ICCVAM recommendations is within the agency's discretion. 
   Furthermore, the bill will not have an impact on existing animal tests in existing federal regulatory programs. Its goal is to facilitate the appropriate validation of new, revised and alternative test methods for future use. using the ICCVAM to assess validation of these test methods can streamline  individual assessment by multiple agencies and enhance the scientific validity of these programs, thereby better protecting public health, and ensuring that laboratory animals used in these programs are not used in vain.

   Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Senator from California for her comments. She is correct. The Nazi War Criminal Records IWG has done an outstanding job. It only made sense, given the work the IWG already has done, to explicitly expand its current requirements to cover activities of the Japanese Imperial Government. Mr. President, I see the distinguished chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on the floor, and would like to ask the chairman if the provisions of title VIII apply only to the work done by the IWG with respect to the declassification of records exclusively relating to the Japanese Imperial Government?

   Mr. DeWINE. It is my assessment that title VIII does not change any of the provisions in the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act that govern the declassification of records required under that Act, most notably but not limited to Nazi war crimes committed in the European theater of war, including Northern Africa. Therefore, title VIII refers only to activities exclusively of the Japanese Imperial Government and does not attempt to change any procedures relating to the declassification of all records under section 3(a)(1) and (2) of the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, as the lead sponsor of the Older Americans Act, along with my friend, the chairman of the committee, Senator JEFFORDS, I thought I would take a few moments, even though we are not technically on the bill at this point, to begin a discussion of this bill. I make note to my colleagues in the Chamber that I will be a few minutes in doing this, so if any of my colleagues do want to proceed in morning business on other matters, I will be more than happy to yield when they come to the floor. 
   We will begin today a debate about a bill that has been long in coming. Previous Congresses have had difficulty reaching agreement on reauthorizing the Older Americans Act for any number of reasons, and previous Congresses have failed to do that. But I think anyone who works in this field, anyone who understands what is going on with the Older Americans Act, knows it is past time for Congress to reauthorize the bill. 
   This is a bipartisan program. It is a program that dates over 35 years. It is a program that delivers great services to the senior citizens of this country. What we have done in this bill in a very bipartisan fashion is to bring it up to date to meet the needs of senior citizens entering this new century. 
   This bill is going to help ensure the continuation of valuable supportive services for lower income older Americans. It will establish new and reliable services from which every older American can benefit and provide support for those caring for older adults. 
   This reauthorization would not be a reality if it were not for the persistent, bipartisan efforts and dedication of the Senate Aging Subcommittee ranking member, Senator MIKULSKI; Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee chairman, Senator JEFFORDS and the ranking member, Senator KENNEDY; the House Education and the Workforce Committee chairman, Congressman GOODLING, and the ranking member, Congressman CLAY; as well as the House Postsecondary Education, Training, and Life-Long Learning Subcommittee Chairman MCKEON and Congressman MARTINEZ. Each has worked tirelessly on this legislation, along with the members and staff of the Senate Aging Subcommittee, the full Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and the Senate Select Committee on Aging. 
   I also thank additional colleagues, such as Senator HAGEL, Senator COLLINS, and Senator WYDEN, for their insights and contributions to reaching a bipartisan agreement on this bill. I will mention later the great work that Senator GRASSLEY has also done to offer a new provision in this bill which, again, meets the needs of seniors in this century. Because of this support and help, we are going to see the Older Americans Act finally reauthorized. 
   Reauthorization attempts in both the 104th and 105th Congresses failed for many reasons. So as chairman of the Aging Subcommittee, I introduced S. 1536, with the hope we could get a reauthorization passed in this Congress. At the end of this past July, our committee marked up that bill and developed a solid piece of legislation that reflects months of hard work and deliberation. I am very pleased that yesterday the House of Representatives passed this bill overwhelmingly by a vote of 405-2. They passed their reauthorization bill which represents the combined legislative efforts of both the House and the Senate. 
   I point out to my colleagues that one of the things we did as we worked through this bill for the last 2 years was to work with the House Members on both sides of the aisle so we would finally emerge with a consensus bill and a bill we would be able to pass in both the Senate and the House. 
   This reauthorization bill we have before us today represents a modernized and streamlined Older Americans Act and one that maintains some of the most important and successful programs the Federal Government provides for our senior citizens. 
   As an editorial in a newspaper in my home State of Ohio, the Cincinnati Post, on September 20, 1999, stated:  
   The Older Americans Act has been the closest thing on record to a national policy on aging.  
   That is a pretty strong statement, but it is true. It is true because the  Older Americans Act created and is responsible for programs that do the following: Provide nutrition both at home and at senior community centers; protect the elderly from abuse, neglect, and unhealthy nursing homes; offer valuable jobs to seniors; furnish transportation which is so vital for the way seniors live today; and render valuable in-home services such as homemaker and home health aides, chore services, respite care, and personal care services. 
   To be sure, as our senior population grows larger and larger, these services and many others become more and more important--not just important but, in many cases, essential to maintain the quality of life of our senior citizens, central to the continued well being and prosperity of our aging senior 
   community. That is why it is fundamental to the security of our seniors that we reauthorize, protect, and improve the Older Americans Act. Our reauthorization bill does just that. 
   First, it will permit States to implement cost sharing for some of the services provided under the Older Americans Act. This means that States will be able to obtain payments from wealthier seniors for services. Doing so enables States to expand services to additional older individuals. 
   This is something that was asked for by the people who testified in our committee. They told us the current rules and regulations were complicated, very difficult to understand, and were being interpreted differently from county to county within a State, such as my State of Ohio. 
   Working in a bipartisan fashion, we put together the language that will make it much easier for these laws to be administered. 
   Second, our authorization will increase flexibility for States by authorizing the Assistant Secretary on Aging to issue waivers to States with certain provisions of the Older Americans Act. This flexibility will help eliminate obsolete, duplicative, and burdensome requirements of a State plan and the area plan. 
   Third, our bill includes the first major changes to the Senior Community Service Employment Program, title V. It begins to change the allocation of funds between the States and the organizations that provide jobs. It allocates 75 percent of the first $35 million in additional funding for the program to the States and 25 percent to organizations. Any increase in funding over $35 million will be split 50-50 between the States and the national organizations. Historically, the funding split has been practically the reverse, with 78 percent allocated to national sponsors and 22 percent to the States. This is an improvement that has received bipartisan support of the Governors across the country. 
   Let me stop for a moment and say how much we have relied on the Governors as we have fashioned this bill and how much they support this bill. This bill is supported by the NGA; it is supported by the southern Governors. It has received a great deal of support and help from them. We thank them for that support. 
   Additionally, our bill provides Governors greater responsibility and influence over the allocation of title V job slots within their States, and it includes performance measures that all organizations and States must meet. Failure to meet such standards will result in the loss of job slots. Those slots then will be redistributed through open competition and will help eliminate poorly performing grantees in the program--one more way the Governors will have more say in title V and more say in how these slots are allocated and, not only a say in how they are allocated, but a say in what happens with them, and they will have the ability to measure the success or failure of these programs. 
   These improvements are the result of our efforts to make sure our reauthorization bill addresses the most important concerns facing older Americans. That is why even before drafting the reauthorization bill, as chairman of the Aging Subcommittee, we held six subcommittee hearings covering titles of the existing law. 
   I see on the floor my colleague, Senator MIKULSKI, who played such a major role in those committee hearings. In fact, those six hearings were very helpful in eliciting information to 
   make this a better bill. 
   At one of those hearings, for example, we heard from Reeve Lindbergh, the daughter of Charles and Anne Morrow Lindbergh. Her mom was subjected, according to her testimony, to 10 years of financial and other abuse and, as Reeve pointed out: ``It''--referring to that type of elder abuse--``can happen to anyone.'' 
   Because of similar testimony, we included language in the reauthorization to protect elders not only from physical abuse and neglect but also from financial abuse and exploitation. We also added language to coordinate State and local advocacy and protection services directly to State and local law enforcement agencies, as well as linking them to the court system. 
   I will now turn to a provision that has bipartisan support and whose lead sponsor is my friend, Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY. This is the National Caregiver Support Act which is an integral part of this bill. 
   Another one of our Aging Subcommittee hearings focused on the bill I just referenced, the National Family Caregiver Support Act, which Senator GRASSLEY sponsored, along with Senators BREAUX, BRYAN, DODD, HUTCHINSON, KOHL, LINCOLN, MIKULSKI, REED from Rhode Island, REID from Nevada, SANTORUM, and WYDEN. 
   Following moving testimony from people such as Carolyn Erwin-Johnson from Baltimore, MD, we included this important act as a provision in our reauthorization bill. At our subcommittee hearing, Carolyn spoke movingly of one of the most important aspects of the Caregiver Support Act--the need for respite care. Let me explain. 
   When her elderly mother became unable to care for herself anymore, Carolyn decided against placing her in a nursing home. She chose, instead, to care for her mom at home. When her mother first moved in with her, Carolyn said she had to discontinue her doctorate program. She had to find a job and more accommodating hours. Unfortunately, and not surprisingly, that job also paid less money. 
   Carolyn continued in her testimony that she needed advice about lifting her mother, feeding her mom, medications, and many other challenges, things she had not faced before in her life, and most of us have not. 
   Most of all, however, because of her mother's constant care needs, Carolyn testified that she just needed some rest, she just needed a break. With the National Family Caregiver Support Act provision included in our reauthorization, Carolyn will get that break in the form of respite care--someone 
   to take over for her for maybe a weekend, maybe a day, maybe just a few hours, so she can shop for herself and complete some overtime work or just rest. Again, this is an attempt to bring this bill up to date and to authorize the type of services that are so very important today. 
   In addition to respite care, the Caregiver Support Act brings an intergenerational element to the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act. 
   During an Aging Subcommittee field hearing we held in Cleveland, we heard from grandparents who, for any number of reasons, were caring for their grandchildren, raising their grandkids. In some cases their own children were addicted to drugs or were in prison or died. There are any number of reasons why these folks were doing something that we did not see done that much 20 or 30 or 40 years ago but something that is, frankly, very common today. Rather than relinquishing their grandchildren to foster care, these grandparents took on the responsibility of raising them and keeping the family together. That is something that we in Congress should support when people make that choice. 
   The grandparents who testified in front of our committee in Cleveland are not alone. The number of grandparents raising children is growing and growing. In fact, a Census Bureau report released last year indicated that 3.9 million children in the United States were living in homes maintained by their grandparents. That is up an astounding 75 percent since 1970. 
   A 1998 study by the University of Cincinnati found that grandparents are caring for their grandchildren in 10 percent of Ohio households with children, and of that 10 percent, approximately 32,000 grandparents statewide are the sole providers for their grandchildren. Amazing figures.  
   Let's look at the example of a Cleveland woman in her early seventies named Bertha. At our hearing last year, she told us her story. She told us about the difficulties she faced in taking on the responsibility of raising her three great-nephews--Clarence, age 12; Joseph, age 11; and Christopher, age 10. 
   The boys' father--a horribly sad story--died from AIDS. Their drug-addicted mother was simply in no shape to take care of them at all. Someone needed to take care of those boys, so Bertha took them in. 
   When the three boys first moved into Bertha's home, she had no way to support them financially. To be eligible for assistance, she became a licensed foster mother. But despite doing so, a full year went by before the county gave her any financial assistance at all. Additionally, she testified it has been very difficult getting information about available services. In the process, she has encountered mounds of bureaucratic redtape. 
   New information and assistance services in the Older Americans Reauthorization Act, as well as the respite care and support groups provided in the Caregiver Support Program, will provide much needed assistance to people, relatives, great-aunts, grandparents--people such as Bertha, people who have taken on a tremendous responsibility many years after raising their own children, many years, I am sure, after they thought they would ever be doing this. 
   Many older Americans who are now raising children for the second time need information, and they need respite care. Our bill would provide those kinds of services. 
   I see my colleagues on the floor, Senator MIKULSKI and Senator KENNEDY. And Senator JEFFORDS will be here in a moment. Let me conclude for now by saying that this is a long time in coming. It is a good reauthorization bill. It is the product of a great deal of work by many Members of this Chamber. It is a bill we can all be proud of, a bill we can be proud today to pass and send to the President. Our reauthorization bill makes the most substantial reforms in the Older Americans Act since its creation. 
   Our bill is a key step toward preparing for the demographic tidal wave of aging baby boomers in the next few decades. The fact is that we are an aging nation. Today, 12.7 percent of the U.S. population is over the age of 65. By the year 2030, that number will grow to 20 percent. There is no indication that this trend will slow anytime soon. 
   Americans, thank heavens, are living longer, making it all the more pressing we ensure that supportive services exist for every older American now and in the future. By working together, on a bipartisan and bicameral basis--both sides of the aisle; both the House and the Senate--we have crafted a bill that will make a lasting contribution to all older Americans; and that is something we can all be proud of as a major accomplishment as this 106th Congress ends. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, the business before the Senate is the Older Americans Act. Specifically, we have Senator GREGG's amendment. I rise, very reluctantly, to oppose that amendment. In a moment, I will explain to my colleagues why I believe that amendment is unnecessary and why I believe it simply must be turned down if we are going to pass the Older Americans Act this year. 
   Before I do that, I want to allow my colleague from Iowa, who has come to the floor and has a major provision in this bill, to talk about this provision. I compliment him on it. He has been the lead sponsor in the Senate on a separate bill. We incorporated his bill into the Older Americans Act. The provision he will explain to the Senate is one of the new provisions of the Older Americans Act in this bill and it is a major contribution. I thank him for that. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DEWINE. I thank the Chair, and I thank the chairman of the committee. 
   Mr. President, I rise very reluctantly to oppose the amendment of my colleague, Senator GREGG. I do so reluctantly because it is very well intended. Frankly, as I listened to his speech, there was very little, if anything, about which I disagreed. The bottom line is that the reforms he has requested and about which he has been so eloquent over the last few years are, in fact, included in the bill that is in front of us. The reality is that while those reforms are already in the bill, if his amendment were accepted, it would kill the bill at this late date. 
   We need to keep in mind that the House of Representatives has already passed this bill overwhelmingly with only two dissenting votes. This bill is the result of over 2 years of compromise work and labor. This bill has the accountability and the reforms that my colleague was asking about and has requested. I salute him for bringing these issues up not just on the floor today but, frankly, for bringing them up during the committee hearings, and I salute him for bringing them up before that. Because of what my colleague has done and because of the issues he has raised, we have incorporated these reforms into this bill. He gets a lot of credit, I believe, for doing that. 
   I think, therefore, his amendment is simply just not necessary and ultimately, at this late date, turns out to be an amendment that could kill this bill. 
   I would like to talk a minute about this bill from the point of view of the Governors. I think when looking at it from the point of view of the Governors, we can get a better 
   understanding of the reforms this bill makes, the improvements this bill makes, and the accountability that is now in this bill that does not exist in the status quo. 
   Let me make something very clear. The killing of this bill will not improve the status quo. We will be stuck with the status quo if this bill goes down. The question is, Does this bill fundamentally improve where we are today and bring about more accountability? I think clearly a fair reading of this bill indicates that it would. 
   Let me talk about this bill from the point of view of the Governors. 
   First of all, this bill recognizes growth in States that have more senior citizens, and therefore it is fair and it is the right thing to do. 
   No. 2, this bill has numerous reforms in regard to title V. We recall what title V is. Title V is employment for seniors who couldn't get a job. That helps them; it not only helps them but helps the community. We have these all over the country. My colleague talked about Green Thumb and talked about the National Park Service. These jobs are all over the country in all 50 States. They are very valuable to the seniors and very valuable to the communities that are being served. 
   The appropriators have traditionally, year after year, split this money 78 percent and 22 percent--78 percent going to the 9 or 10 national contractors and 22 percent going to the States. That has not changed. That is what the appropriators have done year after year. 
   We bring about some more equity and fairness. We say dollars on top of that up to $35 million--any additional dollars up to $35 million--we are going to split and we are going to reverse that. Basically, we are going to have 25 percent that is going to go national but 75 percent of the money will be spent by the Governors in the local communities as they see fit. That is a fundamental change. Again, it is one of the reasons the Governors of our Nation want this bill. 
   We then go further and say beyond $35 million--if the appropriators put in beyond $35 million--it would be a 50-50 split; again, certainly an improvement over the status quo. Again, we get to the issue of accountability. 
   The next reason the Governors like this bill is that they get to submit for the first time a plan to the Department of Labor for the national contractors that are coming into the States. The complaint we hear from them now is: These national contractors come into  our States, and they may be doing good work, but they may be in the wrong area or they may not spread around the States. The Governors and the people in the States of Ohio, or Illinois, or Pennsylvania, or Florida understand what our communities' needs are. We ought to have some input in that. 
   This bill says: Yes, you can have that input. You can submit this plan to the Department of Labor, and they have to pay attention to it for the first time. That is an improvement in local control. That is one of the reasons the States like this bill so much and one of the reasons the National Governors' Association has endorsed this bill wholeheartedly. 
   We next provide more accountability. We say after the national contractor comes in, after the national contractor begins its work, after they have this employment, if the State of Ohio or the State of Vermont or the State of Massachusetts decides the contractor is not doing a good job, they have redress and procedures they can follow to hold that national group accountable--again, a very significant improvement. Again, a reform that is contained in this bill. 
   In summary, Governors will have a greater role in planning and administering a program within a State. Under our reauthorization bill, Governors will submit a State plan to the Department of Labor which will describe where these jobs are needed within a State, where the population of older individuals who qualify for the program are located, and describe how the plan would coordinate with the programs under the Workforce Investment Act. The Governors are also given, under our bill, the opportunity to submit recommendations to the Secretary of Labor regarding proposed projects within the State that would be carried out by the public and private nonprofit grantees. 
   Finally, under our bill, the Governors can hold those public and private grantees that operate in their States, for the first time, accountable if they fail to serve seniors. Under the bill, the Governor can request the Secretary of Labor to review a public and private nonprofit grantee operating within the State. If the grantee is not meeting performance standards, the Secretary, under our bill, is required to take corrective action against that grantee. 
   Next, new cost controls will prevent misuse of funds by the grantees. That is very important. The reauthorization bill would codify definitions of administrative expenses and programmatic expenses. It would also require at least 75 percent of a grantee's funds be used for enrollee wages and benefits. This bill also explicitly states that the funds a grantee receives for the program must be used solely for that particular program. Moreover, the bill expressly requires each grantee to comply with OMB circulars and rules, and requires the grantees to maintain records sufficient to permit tracing of funds to ensure that funds have not been spent unlawfully. 
   Further, grantees will be required to serve seniors or they will lose their grant. The reauthorization bill introduces performance measures in competition into the program for the first time. 
   The bill will establish a three-strikes-and-you-are-out policy to ensure performance goals are met. Failure to meet performance standards will first result in technical assistance and require the grantee to come up with a plan for the future. Failure to meet performance standards a second consecutive year will result in a net loss of 25 percent of the grant which will be competitively bid in an open competition. Failure to meet performance standards a third year will cut off the grantee from the program, and the grant will be competitively bid in open competition. Failure of a public and private nonprofit agency grantee to meet performance standards a fourth year in an individual State will also lead to the loss of the grant, which will then be competitively bid in an open competition. 
   These reforms significantly improve the Older Americans Act. They protect the taxpayers and provide seniors with a jobs program that works. Failure to pass these reforms this year will only continue a system that has not served the job placement needs of seniors in many States and will not correct 
   the deficiencies in the administration and planning of the program. The only way these improvements will be realized is to pass this bill, the Older Americans Act, a bipartisan, bicameral initiative. 
   Under the bill, funding may only be used for provisions of title V. I want to make this very clear. The provisions of training and jobs to low-income seniors is the only legal use of money under our bill. You can't use, under this bill, money for lobbying. Under our bill you cannot use it for litigation. We make sure of that by specific reference to the OMB circular and we make reference in the bill to that which prohibits that type of activity. 
   Each grantee receiving funds must comply with the law. They cannot do lobbying; they cannot do electioneering activities. That is under our bill, as well. 
   Under our bill, the Secretary must conduct a review and apply responsibility tests to all applicants receiving funds, just as the Gregg amendment provided. Under our bill, it is simple: If you fail to meet a responsibility test, you cannot be a grantee. 
   Putting this bill together has not been an easy task. Let me remind my colleagues, it has been 8 years since Congress reauthorized the Older Americans Act. It has been 5 years since that last reauthorization expired. It has not been easy, but we are here today with a bill that fundamentally changes the status quo. Our bill makes significant and substantial improvements to the existing Older Americans Act. Failure to pass this bill would mean that we are going to be stuck with the status quo for at least 2 more years. 
   I will be quite candid. After what we have gone through to put this together, if this bill fails today, I don't know how anybody thinks we could put another bill together next year or the year after. It would force another Congress to rehash these issues and try to pass a bipartisan bill. Keep in mind, we now have a bill that is more acceptable to our friends in the House. We worked this bill and coordinated this bill closely with them. They passed this bill yesterday 405-2. This bill has the support, as I indicated a moment ago, for very good and substantial reasons, of the National Governors' Association. It is not easy getting all 50 Governors to agree on anything. They agree on this bill. They want this bill. They have lobbied for the bill. They have been a part of putting it together. Failure to pass this bill means we will be stuck with the status quo for a long time. 
   I congratulate my colleague from New Hampshire for his work. I believe it is abundantly clear we have covered the concerns he has raised. The good news is if we pass the bill before the Senate, we can change the status quo for the better, particularly title V. 
   Let me talk for a moment about the status of title V. It is funded now at $440 million annually and administered by the Department of Labor, which awards grants to 10 national organizations, AARP, Green Thumb, U.S. Forest Service, and the State governments. As I outlined, 78 percent of the funds are awarded by the Department of Labor on a noncompetitive basis to the 10 national organizations; 22 percent of the funds are distributed to the States. That is the status quo. As I indicated a moment ago, we fundamentally change that status quo. 
   Let me conclude by referencing the bill. If my colleagues have concerns about the reforms, whether or not they were in this bill, I reference them to this bill, to actually look at the bill. We provide for accountability in regard to title V entities in two separate ways. One, we do it before the fact, before they are chosen; second, we provide it after the fact. 
   The first is what is labeled in the bill as a responsibility test. In the section on the responsibility test, it outlines what the Federal Government must look at before a grantee is chosen. Let me emphasize this is not in current law. The great improvement this bill makes is we put this in law. No matter who the Secretary of Labor is, no matter which party runs the Department of Labor, they have to follow the law. They have strict criteria that they have to follow. We spell it out. 
   The bill provides:  
   Before final selection of a grantee, the Secretary shall conduct a review of available records to assess the applicant agency or State's overall responsibility to administer Federal funds.  
   As part of that, the Secretary may consider any information about that  proposed grantee-specific language which I will read. 
   The organization's history with regard to the management of other grants-- 
   So I listened very carefully to the concerns of my colleague from New Hampshire about a specific grantee. I say to him, look at the language in this bill. We have addressed those concerns. The Department of Labor will look at these things and they will look at a past history and they will look at a pattern and they will look to see if there have been problems in the past. We go on and spell this out, page after page, all the different things the Department can look at and should, in fact, look at:  
   Failure to submit required reports; failure to maintain effective cash management or cost controls; failure to ensure that a subrecipient complies with the Office of Management and Budget Circular[s]; failure to audit a subrecipient within the required period; willful obstruction of audit process; failure to establish a mechanism to resolve a subrecipient's audit in a timely fashion--[et cetera, et cetera.]  
   I will not read them all. They are all here. Then we also provide any history and we provide any information. 
   So the Department, for the first time, is being told they have to consider this information, and that is what the law will be after we pass this bill. 
   We next say after the fact, if they get that, if they do get the grant, we then provide in a section called ``National Performance Measures And Competition For Public And Private Nonprofit Agencies And Organizations'':  
   The Secretary shall determine if each public or private nonprofit agency or organization that is a grantee has met the national performance measures established.......  
   We outline, as I indicated a minute ago, how that is done as well. That is in this bill as well. We step them down and we punish them and we eventually, if they keep doing it, say they do not get any more money and they are gone. That is what is in this bill. 
   So let me conclude. We have a strong bill in front of us. It is a bipartisan bill. It is our chance to pass the Older Americans Act. We will not have another chance in this Congress. We may not get another chance in the next Congress. It is the right thing to do. There are groups across this country that want this but, more importantly, the senior citizens of this country need it. It is the right thing to do. 
   We address the concerns my colleague has raised. I again thank my colleague from New Hampshire for raising this amendment, but I very reluctantly must oppose it, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it. Make no mistake about it, we have this covered. We have the reforms in the bill and, No. 2, if his amendment would pass, this bill would die and we would not reauthorize the Older Americans Act. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, in half an hour we are going to have the opportunity to cast two votes. The first vote will be on the Gregg amendment. The second vote will be on the Older Americans Act. We have the opportunity to do something that Congress has not done for 8 years; that is, to reauthorize and change and improve the Older Americans Act. For 5 years this bill has not been reauthorized. It is time we do it. 
   Let me be very candid and very blunt about the amendment of my colleague from New Hampshire. I understand his concerns. He has expressed them very well. The reality is we have taken his concerns into consideration, and we have done more than that, we have incorporated them into this bill. So the bill we will ultimately pass today, I certainly hope without the Gregg amendment, will reflect what my colleague from New Hampshire has already contributed. That has already been done. He should be very proud of that because he has been the voice talking about accountability. 
   The bill that is in front of us is a bill that needs to pass. Lest anyone make a mistake about what is at stake on this first vote on the Gregg amendment, if the Gregg amendment is agreed to, the Older Americans Act reauthorization will die. It is as simple as that. We have taken a long time to get to this point. We are in the last few days of this Congress. 
   The House of Representatives, that has been working with us so very closely, passed this identical bill yesterday by an overwhelming vote, with only two votes against it. The idea we would be able to add the Gregg amendment, which makes changes in the bill, and get the bill ultimately passed is absurd. Make no mistake about it; the key vote today is on the Gregg amendment. Anyone who is for the Older Americans Act needs to vote against the Gregg amendment. 
   Let me talk about the accountability we have been able to put into this bill. The accountability takes care of those issues about which Senator Gregg was concerned. We do it, basically, in two separate ways. We do it by requiring, for the first time, the Department of Labor to have very specific standards and very specific criteria. We enumerate that in the section I have in front of me called ``Responsibility Tests.'' We outline what the Department of Labor will take into consideration when they decide whether or not this contract will be let to an organization. It says:  
   Before final selection of a grantee, the Secretary shall conduct a review of available records to assess the applicant agency or State's overall responsibility to administer Federal funds. 
   As part of the review described in [this paragraph] the Secretary may consider any information, including the organization's history with regard to the management of other grants.  
   It goes on and on, page after page, to describe what is in there that they will have to look at. 
   The second way this bill brings about accountability is after the fact, if a grantee is awarded a contract. It provides for a process of review, to make a determination whether or not the grantee has met the national performance standards.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I think it has pretty much been said. I ask my colleagues to defeat the Gregg amendment and to pass the Older Americans Act. This is a bill that needs to pass. It is a bill that is sponsored by 73 Members of this body. It is a bill that is supported by the National Governors' Association which urges us to pass the bill. I have a letter from the Southern Governors' Association, signed by all the Southern Governors, including Governor Bush from Texas, as well as Governor Bush from Florida. 
   Governor Bush from Florida has been very instrumental in working with us on this bill and is a very strong proponent and advocate of the bill because he understands what a difference it will make. 
   I reiterate, the concerns my colleague from New Hampshire has raised, and I know he will speak in a moment, are valid concerns. We have taken them into consideration. We have incorporated them into this bill. We congratulate him on the work he has done. This bill is a better bill because of what JUDD GREGG has done. 
   We are now, though, at the point where we have incorporated those reforms. This is a reform-minded bill. This is a bill that will make a difference. This is a bill that will change the status quo. We are now faced with the prospect of either passing this good bill and sending it on to the President of the United States or, if we adopt the Gregg amendment, killing the bill and seeing the status quo remain because that is what will happen. 
   None of the reforms my colleague wants to see take place will take place if we kill this bill. It will not be one of them. We will continue to muck along. We will continue to move along as we have year after year with the status quo and with no reforms at all. If you are for reforms, you have to vote against the Gregg amendment and then vote for final passage. 
   I thank the Chair and thank my colleagues.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the impact the Internet is having on database producers and the lack of Intellectual Property protection we provide to creators of databases, in particular. This is an issue that deserves the Senate's attention, and I will be encouraging the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, to hold hearings early next year to examine this issue in detail.  
   Intellectual Property laws are about striking a balance between our need to encourage invention and creativity with a public policy that discourages the use of monopoly power. Our founding fathers recognized the importance of national patent and copyright laws in Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution. Similarly, we have a long tradition of protecting the public from monopolistic abuses through our Antitrust laws, starting with the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. 
   Through our copyright and patent laws, we allow artists and inventors to have monopolies of limited duration on their creations and inventions, which can have the short-term effect of limiting access by consumers. However, these exclusive rights give artists and inventors incentive to create more--ultimately to the benefit of the public at large. Our thriving economy and the success of our country's technology sector is evidence that we have reached an appropriate balance between exclusive rights and consumer access. 
   However, the balance has shifted with the emergence of new technology. Digital technology, for example, allows an individual to copy huge volumes of data from anonymous sources and then distribute it almost immediately all over the world through the Internet. 
   I am very concerned about the utter lack of protection for individuals and companies who invest substantial resources in gathering and organizing large volumes of data or information. These databases were, at one time, protected by our copyright laws under a legal theory known as ``sweat-of-the-brow.'' This policy protected collections of information from theft and recognized that significant resources often were spent in collecting and organizing information. In 1991, the Supreme Court overturned the sweat-of-the-brow protection and said that only ``original'' works are covered by copyright law. This ruling, coupled with the ease of copying and distributing databases over the Internet, have created a significant problem with theft or ``piracy'' of databases. The creators of stolen databases are usually left with only piece-meal protections and often have no recourse whatsoever. 
   I share the concerns of those who believe that database protection legislation could limit the access of consumers to information, and I certainly will not support legislation that harms consumers. However, Mr. President, I believe that this is a case where our policies are out of balance. 
   Information is a resource that becomes much more valuable when it is organized in a coherent way. Database companies devote substantial resources to collecting, organizing, and maintaining information for users. Without such investments, vast quantities of data would be incomprehensible and almost unusable. We must give the companies that create these databases some sort of exclusive right to enjoy the benefits of their hard work and investment. 
   Without granting some exclusive right to database producers, investment in databases will diminish over time, as more and more databases are copied and distributed by pirates. Ultimately, the reliability of information available to consumers over the Internet would be undermined. 
   This potential for unreliability has serious real-life implications. For example, emergency room staff and parents use databases to identify poisons and their remedies; doctors use them to find specifics about a medical procedure; farmers use them for weather and soil information; lawyers use them to find cases and precedents; pharmacists use them to detect dangerous drug interactions; chemists use them to test new compounds; workers use them to find new jobs; and home buyers use them to find the right house. If these databases are not available or are inaccurate, it is the consumer who loses. As with all of our intellectual property rights, some small limitations on consumer access in the short-term will produce significant long-term advantages and increased access to accurate information. 
   This is not a new issue for the Senate. Two years ago, in the 105th Congress, a serious effort was made to pass legislation that would limit database piracy. Judiciary Committee Chairman HATCH hosted extensive negotiations between all interested parties. Unfortunately, a compromise on database protection could not be reached. At the last minute, the database provisions were dropped from the conference report for the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). 
   When we passed the DMCA, I came to the Floor and expressed my disappointment that we could not reach a consensus on a database provision. Judiciary Committee Chairman HATCH and the Ranking Member LEAHY also expressed their disappointment. I asked, and Senator HATCH agreed, that the Judiciary Committee address the database bill early in the 106th Congress. Unfortunately, despite efforts particularly in the House of Representatives to reach an agreement, conflicts in the industry remain. We have not been able to consider such a bill during this Congress. Now, with only a few days left, it appears that we will not consider database protection at all this year. 
   I believe that we should start fresh on database legislation early next year. I ask Chairman HATCH for his commitment that the Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on this important matter in the Spring. For my part, I will do everything I can to draw attention to this matter. I will continue working toward a solution that protects databases from piracy while protecting the rights of consumers.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, just before the August recess, the Senate passed the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, S. 2869. I had some serious concerns about this bill as originally introduced. As my colleagues know, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH and my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts, Senator KENNEDY, came up with a bipartisan compromise that addressed many of the concerns I had about the initial bill. Specifically, I was concerned that the bill would have unintentionally impeded the ability of states and localities to protect the health and safety of children in a variety of ways. I am relieved that the new Senate version has a much more limited scope. Because the bill that was passed applies only to zoning decisions, landmark designations and institutionalized persons, it will not have any impact on child welfare systems, including the ability of states and localities to protect the health and safety of children. I see the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts on the floor and I would ask my colleague, as one of the authors of this new legislation, if my understanding of this legislation correct?

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the National Child Protection Act Improvement Act of 2000. This bill would amend the National Child Protection act, as amended by the Volunteers for Children Act. It is designed to facilitate the gathering of criminal history record information from both state and federal repositories for background checks of employees and volunteers for organizations providing services to children, the elderly, and the disabled. 
   Despite the best efforts of the law enforcement community and the volunteer and child services community, many of the individuals who volunteer and are employed in these critical positions still are not subject to criminal history background checks. The bill that I am introducing today modified the National Child Protection Act to facilitate these background checks. Under my bill, with the consent of the individual, the organization with which the individual is applying would receive a copy of the full criminal history record, including relevant arrest information. Further, the bill includes an authorization to provide assistance to these volunteer and service organizations in offsetting the cost of these background checks. To help protect the privacy of individuals who volunteer and are employed in these positions, the bill also would provide a number of important privacy protections. 
   we need to be sure that we do everything possible to facilitate these important background checks, while assuring that these background checks are not so costly that volunteer organizations and their volunteers are deterred from initiating these vital safety checks. 
   In shaping this bill, I have worked closely with law enforcement, state officials, and other interested parties. Because of that, the legislation that I am introducing today would help accomplish the laudable goals of the national Child Protection Act and the  Volunteers for Children Act--which are to facilitate national background checks initiated in states which have not adopted authorizing language, and, at the same time, assure that those checks are processed effectively and quickly. We need to give states the flexibility they need to accomplish those goals.

   Mr. DEWINE. I would also like to add that both the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the Government Affairs Committee have heard testimony from the Department of Energy on worker exposure to ionizing radiation at the Portsmouth uranium enrichment plant in Portsmouth, Ohio, and we became aware that chondrosarcoma has afflicted some in the workforce. The chapter on bone cancer in the Schottenfeld and Fraumeni medical text should provide helpful guidance as the Administration implements this proposal. I ask for unanimous consent to include a portion of that text for the RECORD.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank my colleagues who have worked very hard over the last several months on a proposal to compensate eligible workers in nuclear energy facilities who have been exposed to hazardous materials. Without the extraordinary effort of so many members and their staffs, including Senators THOMPSON, MCCONNELL, VOINOVICH, BINGAMAN, and KENNEDY, we would not have been able to create this compensation program. I especially appreciate the patience of Chairman WARNER and Ranking Member LEVIN for working with us on the initiative and including it in the Defense Authorization bill. 
   For more than 50 years, Ohio has been home to numerous facilities that performed work for the Department of Energy's nuclear programs. During the Cold War, hundreds of Ohioans, as well as thousands of Americans, were exposed to hazardous and radioactive materials as a result of their employment. Often, workers were unknowingly exposed to these materials, and if workers became ill, they had no relief. Our federal government directed, and even paid for, contractors and subcontractors to fight worker compensation cases. A worker had to prove his or her case on evidence that the government would not make available. 
   A little over a year ago, things began to change. Stories started appearing in the press about what workers were exposed to and how the government ignored evidence. Several Senate Committees, such as Government Affairs; Energy and Natural Resources; and Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, have held hearings the issue of harmful exposure and proposed remedies. I believe that we have a good understanding of the problem now, as well as a solution. 
   However, Mr. President, we all fully understand that no level of benefits can compensate these workers for what they have endured. But we are trying to reimburse them for their financial loss. The agreement in the Defense Authorization bill provides eligible victims with a lump sum payment of $150,000, plus health care coverage. 
   This agreement also defines those workers who are eligible based on the latest scientific evidence on beryllium disease, beryllium sensitivity, and radiogenic cancers. Mr. President, we have created stringent guidelines to determine eligibility. However, there are instances when the administering agency will not be able to recreate an employee's radiation dose exposure. We have reversed the burden of proof for exposure to employees at the Gaseous Diffusion Plants in Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee, because their radiation exposure doses cannot be assessed. 
   More than likely, there will be other instances of extremely poor record keeping, where it will be nearly impossible to determine employees' radiation exposure levels. Therefore, the administering agency may propose additions to the definition of ``special cohort'' under this agreement. Once a new cohort is proposed, Congress will have one hundred eighty days to act to reverse the decision to add the cohort. If Congress fails to act within that time, the cohort will be accepted and eligible for benefits. 
   Eligible employees will have seven years from either the enactment of this bill or from the date on which the employee learned that his or her illness was related to work in which to apply and collect the benefits provided by this program. Like a traditional worker compensation program, compensation under this program will be an exclusive remedy to an employee for claims against the United States, its contractors, and subcontractors--but not against beryllium vendors. 
   The benefits under this program are completely voluntary. Eligible individuals with beryllium disease must decide whether to litigate a claim or receive the benefits provided under this plan. Individuals who currently have pending lawsuits against beryllium vendors are eligible for benefits under this plan. Those individuals have two-and-one-half years from today to decide whether to dismiss their lawsuit and accept the benefits under this plan or to continue with litigation. During that two-and-one-half year window in which litigants must decide whether or not to drop their litigation, plaintiffs may begin an eligibility review with the agency administering this program, so the plaintiff knows whether he or she is eligible for compensation under this program. Nothing in this agreement prohibits plaintiffs or the administering agency from determining whether a plaintiff is eligible under this new program, allowing them to make an informed decision whether or not to pursue litigation. 
   Mr. President, this is a reasonable proposal. It will help people, like Sam Ray, who worked at the Portsmouth  Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Ohio as an operator and instrument mechanic. It was there that Sam was exposed to technetium, plutonium, neptunium, and heavy metals. He has consequently developed chondrosarcoma--a rare type of bone cancer. As the medical text, Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention, by Doctors Schottenfeld and Fraumeni, points out, cancers of the bone include cancers of the cartilage, including radiosensitive cancers that originate in cartilage, such as chondrosarcoma. 
   Mr. President, let me conclude by thanking my colleagues once again for supporting this program. I also want to thank the many, many workers who came to Washington, DC, or to Columbus to testify on why a compensation measure is needed. They worked tirelessly with my office and other offices to get us to where we are today. They deserve a great deal of the credit for the program contained in this bill. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the Floor.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is considering the ``Microenterprise for Self-Reliance Act''--legislation that would ensure the continuation of international microenterprise grant and loan programs that are administered worldwide by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). This is legislation that I introduced last year, along with Senators BINGAMAN, CHAFEE, DURBIN, KENNEDY, SCHUMER, TORRICELLI, BOXER, COLLINS, FEINSTEIN, MIKULSKI, and SNOWE. Representatives BEN GILMAN of New York and SAM GEJDENSON of Connecticut introduced a similar measure, which the House approved last year. 
   I thank the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Senator HELMS, and ranking member of the committee, Senator BIDEN, and the committee staff for their cooperation and insistence on this legislation. My staff and I have been working closely with these offices since last fall as well as with the administration and the Microenterprise Coalition. I thank Chairman GILMAN and the House International Relations Committee staff for their ongoing cooperation and support of this initiative. 
   We believe the investment in microenterprise programs that we are now investing will reduce the need for foreign assistance in the future. By passing the Microenterprise Self-Reliance Act, the Senate has a chance to ensure the future of these very successful programs and help provide a sense of hope and a future of possibilities for the poor in developing countries. 
   I thank my colleagues for their support of this legislation and I look forward to the continued success of the microenterprise programs.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about comments that have been made, both on the floor and off the floor, with regard to the job that the distinguished Senator from Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. HATCH, has been doing in regard to judicial nominations. I rise today to commend my colleague for the outstanding work he has done in regard to these nominations. 
   Make no mistake about it, this is tough work. No one who has not had the opportunity to watch this from a close point of view, to see it up close and personal, really has any idea what kind of effort Senator HATCH has made to make sure nominees who come to this floor have been examined very closely and very carefully. It is proper; it is correct that this be done. No one can do a better job at this than Senator ORRIN HATCH. I have watched him, day after day, in his examination and his staff's examination and work on people who have been nominated to the judicial bench. I must say he does a tremendous job. 
   Senate consideration of judicial nominations is always difficult. It is always contentious. That is just the nature of the business. Yet in this Congress, under the guidance of Chairman HATCH, the Senate has confirmed 69 Federal judicial nominations--69, for those who offer criticism. Mr. President, 35 of these nominees have been confirmed earlier this year, and we have just confirmed 4 more. Yet not only has the chairman been criticized for nominees who are still pending in the Judiciary Committee, he has even been criticized for nominees who have already been confirmed; that is, nominees who are now serving, today, this very day, as Federal judges. Chairman HATCH has been criticized for not moving those nominees fast enough. I strongly disagree. I believe the chairman has done an outstanding job, a fine job. I wanted to come to the floor this afternoon to say that. 
   I would like to talk about the confirmation process for a moment because, again, I think many times people really don't understand what this process entails--or at least what it entails when the chairman is doing a good job. I think an explanation of the process may help those who are listening to the debate today understand why some of the delays in confirmation of judicial nominees occur. 
   The President has very broad discretion, as we know, to nominate whomever he chooses for Federal judicial vacancies. The Senate, in its role, has a constitutional duty to offer its ``advice and consent'' on judicial nominations. Each Senator, of course, has his or her own criteria for offering this advice and this consent on these lifetime appointments. 
   The Judiciary Committee, though, is where many of the initial concerns about nominees are raised and arise. Often these concerns arise before a hearing is even scheduled. Judicial nominees are required to respond to a very lengthy and a very detailed questionnaire from the Judiciary Committee. They must submit copies of every document they have ever published, any writing they have ever published, and provide copies of every speech they have ever given. If they have previously served as a judge, they must provide information regarding opinions they authored. 
   There are various background checks conducted on each nominee. Sometimes outside individuals or organizations provide the committee with information about a nominee. Sometimes that information from outside groups comes very early in the process. 
   But sometimes, quite candidly, it comes later on. Each time it comes in, the committee, committee staff, and ultimately the chairman must review that information. 
   All of this information is, of course, available to every member of the Judiciary Committee and must be thoroughly reviewed before the nominee is granted a hearing by the committee. If questions about a nominee's background or qualifications arise, further inquiry may be necessary. The chairman will schedule a hearing for a nominee only after thorough review of a nominee's preliminary information. At the hearing, a nominee has an opportunity to respond to any remaining concerns about his or her record. But even after a hearing, sometimes followup questions are necessary to properly examine issues regarding the nominee's qualifications. Obviously, this is a long process, as it should be--as it must be. After all, these are lifetime appointments. These judges will have a tremendous impact on how our laws are interpreted and enforced. 
   Some nominees, of course, have clear records of achievement and superb qualifications. These nominees often move through the committee and to the Senate floor very quickly. Other nominees have records that are really not quite so clear. These nominees take more time for additional investigation and careful consideration. If a nominee is nominated late in a Congress, and that nominee has questions raised about his or her background or qualifications, it is more likely that his nomination will not be considered by the Senate.  
   If nominees were only considered in the order they were nominated, the process would, of course, grind to a halt. We have heard some comments about that. Some people have argued this is a queuing up process; we just queue up whoever is next in line; they should go next on the Senate floor. But we know that cannot happen. If nominees were only considered in the order they were nominated, the process would grind to a halt as more qualified nominees would back up behind questionable nominees. 
   I believe, if it were not for ORRIN HATCH's efforts, there would have been far fewer judges confirmed during this session of the Congress. But I am also sure that if ORRIN HATCH had not been chairman, other questionable nominations would have been made. Because of this man's integrity, because of this man's honesty, because of this man's proven track record, and because he takes his job so seriously, I am convinced that certain nominations this White House might have considered making simply were never made and were never submitted. 
   I commend Senator HATCH for his efforts in moving the nominees along, but also for his efforts in doing a thorough and complete job. I am very proud to have ORRIN HATCH as chairman of this committee. We are very honored to have him serve in that capacity. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today as a co-author of the ``Children's Health Act of 2000.'' This bill is essential in enabling us to build a health care system that is responsive to the unique needs of children. The ``Children's Health Act of 2000'' is a big step in the right direction, and I commend my colleagues, Senators FRIST, JEFFORDS, and KENNEDY for their efforts to construct a bill that can really make a positive difference in the health and the lives of children. 
   Mr. President, I am especially pleased that the ``Children's Health Act'' contains several important initiatives that my colleagues and I had introduced already as separate bills. One such initiative--the Pediatric Research Initiative--would help ensure that more of the increased research funding at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is invested specifically in children's health research. 
   While children represent close to 30 percent of the population of this country, NIH devotes only about 12 percent of its budget to children, and, in recent years, that proportion has been declining even further. We must reverse this disturbing trend. It simply makes no sense to conduct health research for adults and hope that those findings also will apply to children. A ``one size fits all'' research approach just doesn't work. The fact is that children have medical conditions and health care needs that differ significantly from adults. Children's health deserves more attention from the research community. That's why the Pediatric Research Initiative is such an important part of the ``Children's Health Act.'' It would provide the federal support for pediatric research that is so vital to ensuring that children receive the appropriate and best health care possible. 
   The Pediatric Research Initiative would authorize at least $50 million for each of the next five years for the Office of the Director of the National Institute of Health (NIH) to conduct, coordinate, support, develop, and recognize pediatric research. In doing so, we will be able to ensure researchers target and study child-specific diseases. With more than 20 Institutes and Centers and Offices within NIH that conduct, support, or develop pediatric research in some way, this investment would promote greater coordination and focus in children's health research, and hopefully encourage new initiatives and areas of research. 
   The ``Children's Health Act'' also would authorize the Secretary of HHS to establish a pediatric research loan repayment program for qualified health professionals who conduct pediatric research. Trained researchers are essential if we are to make significant advances in the study of pediatric health care, especially in light of the new and improved Food and Drug Administration (FDA) policies that encourage the testing of medications for use by children. 
   Additionally, the ``Children's Health Act'' includes the ``Children's Asthma Relief Act,'' which Senator DURBIN and I introduced last year. The sad reality for children is that asthma is becoming a far too common and chronic childhood illness. From 1979 to 1992, the hospitalization rates among children due to asthma increased 74 percent. Today, estimates show that more than seven percent of children now suffer from asthma. Nationwide, the most substantial prevalence rate increase for asthma occurred among children aged four and younger. Those four and younger also were hospitalized at the highest rate among all individuals with asthma. 
   According to 1998 data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), my home state of Ohio ranks about 17th in the estimated prevalence rates for asthma. Based on a 1994 CDC National Health Interview Survey, an estimated 197,226 children under 18 years of age in Ohio suffer from asthma. We need to address this problem adequately. The ``Children's Health Act'' would help do that by ensuring that children with asthma receive the care they need to lead healthy lives. The bill would authorize funding for fiscal years 2001 through 2005 for the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish state and local community grants to be used for asthma detection, treatment, and education services; require coordination with current children's health programs to identify children who are asthmatic and may otherwise remain undetected and untreated; require NIH to direct more resources to its National Asthma Education Prevention Program to develop a federal plan for responding to asthma; and require the Center for Disease Control to conduct local asthma surveillance activities to collect data on the prevalence and severity of asthma. This surveillance data will help us better detect asthmatic conditions, so that we can treat more children and ensure that we are targeting our resources in an effective and efficient way to reverse the disturbing trend in the hospitalization and death rates of asthmatic children. 
   Since research shows that children living in urban areas suffer from asthma at such alarming rates and that allergens, such as cockroach waste, contribute to the onset of asthma, this bill also adds urban cockroach management to the current preventive health services block grant, which currently can be used for rodent control. 
   The ``Children's Health Act'' also includes a bill I introduced separately with Senator DODD. This section would require that the Secretary of HHS ensure that all research that is conducted, supported, or regulated by HHS complies with regulations governing the protection of children involved in research. Children who participate in clinical trials are medical pioneers. It is just common sense that we update and apply the strongest federal guidelines to ensure the safety of these young people as they participate in clinical trials that will ensure that  medicines will be safe and appropriate for use in all children. 
   Finally, Mr. President, the ``Children's Health Act'' includes language that I strongly support to re-authorize funding for children's hospitals' Graduate Medical Education (GME) programs for four additional years. Last year, as part of the ``Health Care Research and Quality Act,'' which was signed into law, we authorized funding for two years for children's hospitals' GME programs. The teaching mission of these hospitals is essential. Children's hospitals comprise less than one percent of all hospitals, yet they train five percent of all physicians, nearly 30 percent of all pediatricians, and almost 50 percent of all pediatric specialists. By providing our nation with highly qualified pediatricians, children's hospitals can offer children the best possible care and offer parents peace of mind. They serve as the health care safety net for low-income children in their respective communities and are often the sole regional providers of many critical pediatric services. These institutions also serve as centers of excellence for very sick children across the nation. Federal funding for GME in children's hospitals is a sound investment in children's health and provides stability for the future of the pediatric workforce. 
   Mr. President, as the father of eight children and the grandfather of five, I firmly believe that we must move forward to protect the interests--and especially the health--of all children. The ``Children's Health Act of 2000'' makes crucial investments in our country's future--investments that will yield great returns. If we focus on improving health care for all children today, we will have a generation of healthy adults tomorrow.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, I yield myself 30 minutes. I candidly don't expect to take 30 minutes. For those Senators who wish to speak after me, it will probably be a shorter period of time than 30 minutes. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the legislation before us--H.R. 4444, the legislation extending Permanent Normal Trading Relations to the People's Republic of China or PNTR. As we approach's today's final vote, I want to make it clear that I believe strongly in free and fair trade. And, I support efforts aimed at increasing free and fair trade with China. However, as we approach the vote, I think we must take a few minutes and try to put the current debate into its proper perspective. That is what I intend to do. 
   Passing PNTR will result in lower trade barriers and more U.S. sales to China. We know that. But, the extent of our increased sales will depend on factors beyond our control. Our ability to send more exports to China depends largely on China's continued economic growth, its compliance with the bilateral agreement, and its development of a middle-class. 
   While increasing trade with China certainly is important, we must put this current debate into its proper context. We need to view this debate as it relates to both our worldwide trade policy and to our foreign policy and national security interests. With this broader perspective in mind, it becomes very clear that passing the PNTR legislation is just one part of our overall relationship with China and one part of our overall global trade policy. There remain other pressing foreign policy issues and other trade issues that await our next President, the next Congress, and the American people. Let me explain. 
   The fact is, as we all know, the United States is a leader in the area of free trade. If we fail to pass the PNTR legislation, we would be sending a signal to the world that the United States wants to isolate China. That's a signal we don't want to send. Both by word and deed, the United States must be the world's leader in promoting free trade. At the same time, though, we also don't want to send China--and the  world--a signal that we will tolerate the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction--a practice China engages in openly. 
   In terms of our overall trade policy, we also cannot send a signal to our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere that says we are only interested in concentrating on the Chinese market. Since so much time and energy and resources has been directed to liberalizing trade in China, it may be a surprise to some that China represents only two percent of our foreign sales. 
   To keep it in proper perspective, there was no one who estimates that percentage will go beyond 2 1/2 or 3 percent in the immediate future. Two percent of our total foreign markets is only $13 billion in U.S. sales to China. 
   Now, compare that to markets closer to home. Last year, Canada was our number one export destination, with $167 billion in U.S. sales, while Mexico was our second largest export market with $87 billion in sales. Further, our exports to Brazil ($13.2 billion) last year exceeded our sales to China. And what's more, forty-four percent of our exports remained right here in our own hemisphere. 
   Those $13 billion in sales to China pale in comparison to trade within our hemisphere. Yet, the Administration and the business community have made granting PNTR to China their single-minded trade focus. This narrow agenda has not come without cost. 
   Because the Administration has not emphasized expanding free trade in our hemisphere, other nations are taking the lead in seizing the economic opportunities that are right in our backyard. Our inaction in this hemisphere has essentially made it easier for Europe, Asia, and Canada to significantly expand their exports throughout Latin America. The European Union (EU), for example, is now Brazil's largest trading partner. The EU's exports to Brazil have grown 255 percent from 1990 to 1998. 
   Additionally, during that same period, Asia experienced an incredible 1664 percent increase in its growth of exports to Argentina. 
   The next administration and the business community need to pay attention to our own hemisphere. That means that the next administration and the next Congress need to pass fast-track trading authority and move toward a hemispheric free trade area. It is imperative that we do this. That means that we will need to expand the North American Free Trade Agreement, which, over this last decade, has advanced economic cooperation and growth between the United States and Mexico, increasing U.S. exports to Mexico by 207 percent. And, that means that we must abandon this very narrow focus with which the current administration has viewed trade policy and start widening the lens to be more inclusive of the markets right here in our own backyard. This is significant unfinished business that our next President and our next Congress and the American people will have to address. 
   But, even more significant in terms of our unfinished business are the considerable national security issues at stake regarding our overall relationship with China. I say that because this is China we are talking about. China is different. China, as my colleagues all know, is unlike any other country in the world. China is a major power--a nuclear power--and China is the world's major proliferator of weapons of mass destruction. 
   Sadly, this administration has failed to stop the Chinese government's weapons proliferation. Sadly, this administration has not demonstrated the kind of leadership necessary to prevent China from manufacturing and selling weapons technology worldwide. 
   Like the United States, China is a co-signator of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, yet over the last decade, its government has violated the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty willingly, openly, and egregiously. Their actions are well documented. For example, Washington Times National Security reporter, Bill Gertz, writes in his recent book:  
   [f]or at least a decade, China has routinely carried out covert weapons and technology sales to the Middle East and South Asia, despite hollow promises to the contrary.  
   The PRC has shown no remorse for its past actions--and certainly no inclination to change them. Rather, China has flaunted--openly--its violations. 
   At the beginning of the last decade, Pakistan was believed to possess a very modest nuclear weapons program--one that was inferior to India's 
   program. Our own laws effectively banned U.S. government assistance to Pakistan because of its decision to go nuclear, and our sanctions laws contained tough penalties for any nation attempting to feed Pakistan's nuclear hunger. 
   That was then. Today, China has single-handedly worked to change the balance of power in South Asia and, in turn, has made the region far more different and far more dangerous. 
   Today, according to news reports, Pakistan possesses more weapons than India and has a better capability to deliver them. President Clinton stated earlier this year that South Asia has now become the most dangerous place in the world. We have China to thank for that. 
   The significant change in the balance of power between Pakistan and India was engineered by China, which provided Pakistan with critical technology to enrich and mold uranium, M-11 missile equipment and technology, and expertise and equipment to enable Pakistan to have its own missile production capability. 
   What has this Administration done to change this behavior? Essentially nothing. Time after time, as reporters, like Bill Gertz, uncovered extraordinary information on proliferation activities, this Administration failed to impose even the mildest sanctions against China as required by law. For example, in 1995, at the same time this Administration was aware of China's transfer of sensitive nuclear technology to Pakistan, the Administration was seeking to weaken our non-proliferation laws against Pakistan. And, rather than aggressively use the sanctions laws on the books to try to bring about a change in China's behavior, this Administration sought to find ways to show it had reached a common understanding with China to prohibit these activities and thus avoid sanctions. 
   However, according to the Central Intelligence Agency's unclassified bi-annual report to Congress on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, China remained a ``key supplier'' last year of weapons and missile assistance to Pakistan. 
   In the Middle East, it's the same story. News reports have documented China's contributions to Iran's nuclear development and ballistic and cruise missile programs, including anti-ship missiles that are a threat to our naval presence and commercial shipping in the Persian Gulf. Further, the CIA's bi-annual report also confirmed that Chinese government multi-nationals are assisting the Libyan 
   government in building a more advanced missile program. 
   As it stands, international rules of conduct and pledges to our government to forego its proliferation activity have not deterred China's arms-building practices. Further, this administration has not enforced U.S. non-proliferation laws adequately nor effectively. The Chinese government certainly does not take our government seriously on the question of weapons proliferation--and frankly, why should they? The current Administration hasn't been a leader in encouraging nations to honor international non-proliferation agreements. Consequently, weapons of mass destruction are in more questionable hands than ever before. 
   Last year, a bipartisan commission headed by former CIA Director, John Deutch, concluded that our Federal Government is not equipped to fight nuclear proliferation. What does that say about our international credibility? What does that say about our ability to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction? What it says is that our diminished credibility may oblige other countries who are adversaries of Pakistan, Iran, and Libya to build their own weapons capabilities to counter these emerging threats. 
   In simple terms, the current administration has not led on these proliferation issues. That is why we should have passed Senator THOMPSON's amendment last week. 
   The Thompson amendment was important because it would have given us the ability to hold the People's Republic of China, and any nation, accountable for proliferating weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. The bottom line is that if we are  going to sacrifice our annual review of normal trade relations with China, then our next President and the next Congress will need new tools to pursue our national security objectives. Candidly, the next President will also have to use the tools that we have now given him. 
   So, where are we? When we put this whole debate in perspective--when we put the debate into its proper economic and national security contexts--where does this leave us? Realistically, approval of PNTR does not change the disagreements we have with China on weapons proliferation. It certainly will not change China's behavior. China will continue to proliferate. China will continue to pursue policies that will destabilize two critical regions of the world, placing our soldiers and our allies in serious danger. 
   Now that we are about to pass this legislation--now that we are about to advance our free trade policy--what do we intend to do to advance our 
   non-proliferation policy and our own national security? Does this Administration have an answer? No, I do not think they do. Quite candidly, they never have. 
   We need an answer. And, from the vantage point of our national security strategy, I believe that if we fail to show vigilance in the enforcement of non-proliferation policy, we will place this nation at a terrible disadvantage. If we fail to show vigilance, we will effectively continue a de facto policy that has worked to undermine our national non-proliferation policy and is working to make our world a more dangerous place. 
   Had this administration pursued a non-proliferation policy with the same amount of intensity, creativity, and vigor it showed in advancing our commercial relationship with China, this would have been a far easier vote to cast. 
   Had the Senate done the right thing and adopted the Thompson amendment, that too would have made today's vote easier to cast. 
   I fear if we do not act soon to change the current course of our weapons proliferation policy--if we do not revisit the Thompson amendment, and we will revisit the Thompson amendment--we will be sending a signal to China and to the world that says our trade interests are more important than the security of our Nation, more important than the security of our children and grandchildren. 
   I intend to vote for the PNTR legislation before us because I believe strongly in the power of fair and free trade. 
   The United States has been the world's most outspoken advocate for free trade. We are the world's free trade leader. We believe free trade is a cornerstone of a free society and a free people. We believe it can be a step toward helping closed nations become open and democratic. No one here can say with certainty that it will work in China, but as the world's leader in free trade, I believe we have to try. 
   With this vote today, we are keeping our word as that leader, and we are moving forward. To do otherwise, to go back on the agreement this country negotiated last November, would send the wrong message to the world. It would say that the United States cannot be counted on to practice what we preach, and the implications of that message will extend far beyond our ability to negotiate trade agreements with China. A message such as that will affect our credibility worldwide. 
   Further, I have concluded that a ``no'' vote will do nothing to wean China from its weapons-building addiction. But that is why we must not stop here with today's vote. We should move forward and show clear leadership and clear direction in regard to our nonproliferation policy. 
   With this vote, I pledge to work with our next President to change the current state of affairs and to work toward maintaining our place as the world's model for free and fair trade. I will continue to push for free trade opportunities, both within and beyond our hemisphere. Much more important, I also pledge to work toward making our world a safer and more secure place for our children, our grandchildren, and our great grandchildren. I will continue to insist that China and other weapons-proliferating nations abide by international agreements, and I will continue to insist again, again, and again that our Nation take the lead in this area. 
   This is not the last time I will be on this floor talking about the problems with China. This Senate will regret if we do not return to this issue. The Thompson amendment will come back, and we will insist that it be voted on. This country has to stand strong and firm against China and their proliferation policies. Their proliferation policies threaten the security of our children and our grandchildren, and we will ignore their actions at our peril. 
   I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleagues.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Thompson-Torricelli amendment. This amendment will give us more of a chance to hold the People's Republic of China, or any nation, accountable for proliferating weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. 
   This amendment would not have been necessary had this administration shown effective leadership in nonproliferation policy. When the administration sat down with China last year to negotiate an agreement on China's admission to the World Trade Organization, that was an extraordinary opportunity to discuss China's weapons proliferation practices. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity to insist that China change its ways on proliferation once and for all and advance the security of all nations. 
   That opportunity, sadly, was lost. 
   The bilateral agreement reached between China and the United States last November is the price China has to pay for our Nation to agree to PNTR and China's admission into the WTO. So the fundamental question is this: Have we imposed a high enough price on the Chinese Government? Sadly, I think the answer is clearly no. 
   Yes, the bilateral agreement arguably is a good economic document for both countries. However, it is by no means an acceptable document for our own national security. If we are going to sacrifice our annual review of normal trade relations with China, then our next President and the next Congress must have new tools in place to pursue our national security objectives.  
   It is that simple. And that is why we need to adopt the Thompson amendment. 
   As my colleagues know, China is a signator of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Article VI of that treaty states that nuclear powers are to:  
   ..... pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date.......  
   No nation has violated that specific article in the NPT more egregiously, more openly, and more willingly in the last decade than the People's Republic of China. That is the truth. 
   In Asia and the Middle East, our Nation and China hold two fundamentally different visions of the future direction of these two regions. Right now, China has used its expertise in nuclear and missile technology to effectively advance their interests and destabilize the region. 
   For example, at the beginning of the last decade, Pakistan possessed a very modest nuclear weapons program inferior to India's. 
   That was then. Now the balance of nuclear power has shifted, and it is a far more different and far more dangerous region today. 
   In the Middle East, it is the same story. News reports have documented China's contributions to Iran's nuclear development, and ballistic and cruise missile programs, including anti-ship missiles that are a threat to our naval presence and commercial shipping in the Persian Gulf. And published news reports say a CIA report issued last month confirmed that Chinese Government multinationals are assisting the Libyan Government in building a more advanced missile program. 
   China certainly does not see our Government as a serious enforcer of nonproliferation policy--and why should they? As a result, weapons of mass destruction are in far more questionable hands and the world is a far more dangerous place. 
   The high priority China placed on WTO membership certainly presented our Government with an opportunity to reassert its nonproliferation credentials.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we can make up for this lost opportunity by passing this amendment. It is vitally important, I believe, that we do this and we move forward. 
   This amendment is not just about holding other nations accountable as proliferators, it is also about holding our President accountable as the world's principal nonproliferation enforcer. 
   With this amendment, Congress would receive a comprehensive report each year from the President about the proliferation practices of other nations. This report would require comprehensive information on proliferation practices, how these acts threaten our national security, and what actions are being taken by the President in response to these violations. 
   This reporting requirement will prevent future administrations from repeating the approach taken by the current administration, which ran and hid from our nonproliferation laws and responsibilities. 
   The amendment of the Senator from Tennessee would dramatically improve the PNTR legislation. I say this because PNTR is not just about trade--it is about U.S. foreign policy. We cannot let our trade policy with China supercede our national security policy. The lessons learned from the Cox Commission were clear: foreign policy and national security policy must drive trade policy and not the other way around. 
   I ask my colleagues: Have we asked enough of China? Has this administration done enough to advance our foreign affairs with China? I believe the answer to both is a resounding ``no.'' The Thompson-Torricelli amendment gives the Senate a chance to insist on more from China and more from this administration. If both China and future administrations are going to take this Senate seriously as a clear and strong voice in our national security policy, we should stand together to support this amendment. 
   I thank my colleagues, I thank my colleague from Tennessee, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as co-chairs of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, the distinguished Senator from Michigan and myself want to take this opportunity to reiterate our support for a program of great interest to our colleagues from the Great Lakes states. 
   Section 516(c) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1996 authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to construct sediment transport models for major tributaries of the Great Lakes. This is a project aimed at the prevention end of a complex of sediment-related problems in the Great Lakes region--problems which are costing this country millions of dollars each year to remediate. The potential benefits of these models are such that they will pay for themselves in terms of reduced dredging and disposal costs. The benefits of  the program are well-recognized nationally; the program is being used as a template for a similar authorization for the Upper Mississippi river system. In addition to their uses to the Corps of Engineers in planning for dredging needs of the region and development of cost-effective alternatives to dredging, the tributary transport models are made available to local, state and federal partners involved in nonpoint source pollution control to help target their efforts to prevent erosion which results in sedimentation of harbors and channels. A total of approximately sixty Great Lakes tributaries qualify under the authorization guidelines, 25 of which are considered high priority based on their current dredging needs.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I would like to ask my distinguished colleague from New Mexico and Chairman of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, Mr. DOMENICI, if he is aware of a serious problem facing Ohio and the entire Great Lakes region.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, dredging in Great Lakes harbors and navigation channels is authorized by reference to low water datum. During periods of extremely low water, like those today, lake levels drop below low water datum. These low water levels not only threaten to cripple Great Lakes industries that depend on waterborne transportation, but they also create a serious threat to the safety of the thousands of recreational and commercial boaters on the Lakes. Would my colleague from New Mexico agree that the Corps should ensure minimal operation depths consistent with the original authorized depths and current use of the channels and harbors when Great Lakes water levels are below the International Great Lakes Datum of 1985?

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, the Army Corps of Engineers plays a key role in addressing the contaminated sediments problem in the Great Lakes region. Section 401 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1990 authorized the Corps of Engineers to provide technical assistance to the Remedial Action Planning Committees for each of the Areas of Concern. This technical assistance is critical to developing a cost-effective and scientifically sound approach to cleanup. One of the largest obstacles to cleanup of contaminated sediments in the Great Lakes region is the lack of availability of alternative technologies for remediation of contaminated sediments. The Water Resources Development Act of 1996 amended Section 401 allowing technical assistance funds to be used for the development and demonstration of promising new remediation technologies. 
   Since 1990, Congress has provided a total of just $3.25 million for the Section 401 program. Funding has never exceeded $500,000 in any fiscal year, a level far too low to support even a single technology demonstration while maintaining key technical assistance capabilities. 
   We note that the House Committee has provided $600,000 in fiscal 2001 funding for the Section 401 Program. While we welcome the prospect of this increase, even at this level funding remains woefully short of the amount needed for this key component of our regional battle to address the problem of sediment contamination in the Great Lakes. We ask the distinguished chairman and ranking member to make funding for this program a high priority in conference with the House and within any additional funding which may become available.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, on a happy note, I rise this evening to honor someone who has spent the last 30 years of her life serving the people of this country, of this Congress, of the State of Ohio; specifically, of the Seventh Congressional District in Ohio. 
   I am talking about a dear friend of mine, Virginia ``Ginny'' Gano. I had the great pleasure and honor to work with her during my years as Congressman from the Seventh Congressional District in Ohio. Ginny is now in her 31st year of service to the people. She is truly an ambassador for the Seventh district and for the entire State of Ohio. 
   Ginny grew up in Springfield, OH. She started working for Congressman Bud Brown at a very young age in 1969. In 1982, when I was elected to the House of Representatives, I asked Ginny if she would come work with me. I became the Congressman. Ginny agreed to stay on and work in our office. During that time, Ginny Gano was really invaluable to me and invaluable to our office and to the people of the district. She had and has an unbelievable wealth of knowledge and institutional memory. If you want something done, if you want to know something, you ask Ginny Gano. 
   In 1991, she joined current Seventh District Congressman DAVID HOBSON's team. This evening--I am sure at this very moment--knowing Ginny, she is still at work in the Longworth Building serving the people in the district. 
   Ginny is one of the hardest working people whom I have ever met. With her resources, her experience, and her knowledge, she can answer any question or just about any request made of her. She never says no. She is that good. She gets the job done. She just knows how to get it done. Whatever you want, Ginny will figure out a way of getting it done. 
   One of the many things that Ginny has done over the years has been to work with interns in a Congressman's office. She goes to great lengths to make sure these young people who come out from Ohio to serve the people and to learn have meaningful experiences in Washington, that they feel at home, that they have someone to look out for them. 
   Ginny has spent the last 30 years helping people in our district and has truly gotten to know the people of the Seventh District, and they know that she cares about them. She is the one constant in the office of the Congressman from the Seventh Congressional District. Whether it was Bud Brown, MIKE DEWINE, or DAVE HOBSON, Ginny Gano has been there. Ginny Gano is making a difference. 
   One of the things I appreciate about Ginny so much is that she has a way about her that makes everyone feel at ease. Whether it is a group of schoolchildren from Greene County or maybe someone whom she bumps into in the Rotunda of the Capitol, a total stranger, it does not matter; Ginny is there to help them and she makes everyone feel welcome in our Nation's Capitol. Ginny is a caring and compassionate human being. Being around Ginny Gano just makes you happy. She is that type of person. Her smile, her spirit, her energy--you just feel good when you are around Ginny Gano. 
   Ginny has dedicated some of her free time--the little free time she has--to something she loves: music. For years she has participated with a great deal of enthusiasm in the Capitol Hill Choral Society. She also has been a driving force behind the Ohio State society's selection of the cherry blossom princess every spring. 
   My wife Fran and I are just so proud to call Ginny Gano a friend. I thank her for over 30 years of dedicated service to the people of the Seventh Congressional District of the State of Ohio. 
   Ginny, thank you.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I want to talk this evening about an issue about which I have spoken before on the floor of the Senate, and that is the situation with the children in the poor country of Haiti. I rise tonight to remind my colleagues of a very important feeding program that is crucial to these children. The program I am talking about, of course, is the Public Law 480 title II Food Assistance Program which, according to the USAID mission in Port au Prince in Haiti, helps feed roughly 500,000 Haitian schoolchildren and almost 10,000 orphaned children through its Orphan Feeding Program. 
   As we know, funding for the P.L. 480 title II program was included in the Senate fiscal year 2001 Agriculture appropriations bill, which we in the Senate recently passed. I commend and thank the chairman and ranking member on the subcommittee, Senator COCHRAN and Senator KOHL, and also the chairman and ranking member on the full committee, Senator STEVENS and Senator BYRD, for their continuing ongoing support of Public Law 480. 
   I am very pleased the committee included language in the Agriculture appropriations bill that will maintain the same level of USAID resources for the Orphan Feeding Program in Haiti as were provided for our current year. I urge my colleagues in conference to continue this language and continue this program. 
   The reality is that the country of Haiti is a great human tragedy. The nation is in turmoil on a political, economic, and humanitarian level. Though the small island nation finally did hold its parliamentary elections in May after three previous postponements, and though voter turnout was certainly acceptable and the citizens were voting, the openness of these elections remains in serious question. The violence against opposition party members and supporters leading up to the May election cast serious doubt on the legitimacy of this election. 
   Leon Manus, the president of the electoral council, resigned after the first round of elections and had to flee the country fearing for his life after having accused the Haitian Government of pressuring him to approve the questionable election results. 
   The international community has severely and justifiably criticized both rounds of elections, with the European Union threatening economic sanctions. In spite of widespread criticism, in spite of OAS refusal to recognize the contested election results, Haitian officials proceeded with the runoff elections on July 9, and, as expected, a handful of Haitians turned out to vote, just a handful of people for the few legislative and local offices that were not already won by the ruling Lavalas Party. 
   Prior to these elections, I spoke on the Senate floor about Haiti's distressing political and economic situation. I talked at that time about how it was incumbent upon the political elite and the ruling party in Haiti, the Fanmi Lavalas Party, to make and to take reforms seriously. As I said then, and I have said many times before, Haiti simply will not progress until its political leaders and the elite in that country take responsibility for their situation and commit to true democratic reform. 
   Regardless of the recent election outcome, Haiti can succeed as a democracy if and only if the leaders of the nation, the political elite, the ruling elite, the economic elite, resolve to develop a free market system, 
   resolve to reduce corruption, resolve to improve Haiti's judicial system and its election process, resolve to respect human rights and develop a sustainable agricultural system that can feed its people, and especially the poor children of Haiti. 
   Despite the success--I have seen it; and there has been success--of some  USAID programs to promote growth in Haiti's agricultural sector, past deforestation and a lack of education about how best to use the land for both short-term and long-term economic gain have slowed, almost to a standstill, any improvement in the agricultural sector. 
   Because of that, I firmly believe that the United States should continue efforts aimed at teaching Haitian farmers viable ways to farm--agriculture that produces food for the Haitian people now and conserves the land for production in the future by generations to come--agriculture that shows farmers how sustainable agriculture is really in their best economic interest, both in the short run and in the long run. 
   Efforts to work directly with farmers provide the greatest hope of preventing Haitians from abandoning agriculture for urban areas, such as Port-au-Prince. One of the biggest problems in Haiti is that so many people who are not making it in agriculture at all, who can't feed their family, understandably flee the countryside and go into one of Haiti's big cities, only to face worse poverty and create a more dire situation for their family. The only way that will stop is if Haiti can develop, with our assistance, with the assistance of the international community, a viable, sustainable agricultural program. 
   As I have said, I have visited Haiti eight or nine times. My wife and I have seen many of these programs and have seen that they do, in fact, work. But until sustainable improvements are made in the Haitian agricultural sector, I believe we have a responsibility--I believe we have an obligation--to ensure that humanitarian and food assistance continues to reach this tiny island nation and most particularly, most importantly, continues to reach these children. 
   That is why it is vital that we maintain current funding levels for the Public Law 480 title II assistance program for Haiti and other parts of the world as well. The simple fact is, this program is essential to the survival--literally the survival--of many thousands of Haitian children, especially those living in overcrowded orphanages. 
   There are currently 114 orphanages throughout Haiti receiving USAID funds and caring for a vast number of children. Quite candidly, these represent just a small fraction of the total number of orphanages on this island. 
   My wife Fran and I have traveled to Haiti repeatedly--eight times in the past 5 years. We visited many of these orphanages. We have seen the dire and dismal conditions. We have held the children and felt their malnourished bodies. But we have also seen what can happen with these children, and how so many dedicated people working in these orphanages can literally nurse these children back to life. 
   The orphanages of Haiti feed and take care of thousands upon thousands upon thousands of orphaned and abandoned children. The flow of desperate children into these orphanages is constant, and these facilities face the increasing challenge of accommodating these children. 
   It is these children who need our help the most. It is these children who are not capable of providing for themselves. 
   That is why I am convinced that the Public Law 480 title II feeding program is absolutely essential. This low-cost program guarantees one meal per day to orphan children who otherwise would not receive any food at all. 
   The school feeding program is also essential because the title II assistance program--the offer of a free meal to these children, and the parents who send their children to school--helps keep Haitian children in school. 
   I again thank the committee for its support for and its commitment to Public Law 480 title II assistance for these children in Haiti. 
   I urge my colleagues on the conference committee--and throughout this year, and into the next--to continue their support for this program.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, on another matter related to Haiti, I take this opportunity this evening to commend and thank my friend, Ambassador Tim Carney, for his 2-year service as U.S. Ambassador to Haiti. Tim and his wife Vicki proudly represented the United States. Day in and day out, they were committed to helping the people of Haiti overcome their dismal surroundings and their dire circumstances. Tim and Vicki worked to alleviate hunger and poverty throughout the island and encouraged practical economic reforms. 
   Through the support and cooperation of Ambassador Carney and Vicki, the conditions of several Haitian orphanages continue to improve. Although the Carneys' assignment in Haiti has concluded, their commitment continues today. 
   My wife Fran and I appreciate their friendship. We appreciate the support and help they have given to the children of Haiti. We look forward to continuing our work with them to help the children of Haiti.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise this evening to celebrate the life of a great man from my home State of Ohio, a true renaissance man. I am talking about Erv Nutter, who died on January 6 of this year at the age of 85. 
   I am honored to have known Erv and am humbled to have the chance this evening to say just a few words about what his friendship has meant to me and my family, to my community, and to my State. 
   Ervin John Nutter was born in Hamilton, OH, on June 26, 1914, to parents he described as ``a Kentucky schoolteacher and a Wyoming cowboy.'' He was a running guard on the State championship Hamilton High School football team and later graduated from there. He attended Miami University in Oxford, OH, and then transferred to the University of Kentucky where, at the age of 21, he dropped out to take the Ohio examination for stationary engineers. Following that test, he became the youngest licensed engineer in Ohio, and then took a job at Proctor & Gamble in Cincinnati. 
   In 1943, Erv returned to the University of Kentucky to earn his degree in mechanical engineering. After graduation, he took a job in the engineering division of the Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, where he was put in charge of aircraft environmental testing. 
   Then in 1951, Erv Nutter founded the Elano Corporation, which fabricates metal parts for jet engines. He started the business in a Greene County, OH, garage. Elano grew and grew, and it grew ultimately into a multimillion-dollar business that has influenced aviation worldwide, through precision forming and bending of tubular assemblies for fuel, and lubrication and hydraulic systems for jet aircraft and missiles. 
   I met Erv Nutter for the first time in 1973. I was right out of law school, on my first job, as an assistant county prosecutor in Greene County. I remember Sheriff Russell Bradley and then-county prosecutor Nick Carrera, and I were conducting a major drug investigation. It was going well. The only problem was, we had run out of money. 
   So we went to some people in the community. One of the first people we went to was Erv Nutter. To keep that investigation going, we simply had to have some financial assistance. So we asked Erv if he would help. Without any hesitation, as Erv would always do--he didn't ask anything--he just said: Sure. If you boys think it's a good idea, if you think we need to do it, I'll do it. 
   When it came to his community, Erv was always ready to lend a hand, whether with his financial resources or his time and energy. That was just Erv Nutter. 
   Erv has been a role model for so many people throughout the years. Through his kindness and extreme generosity, he has taught invaluable lessons, such as the importance of giving back to our communities, 
   the importance of building and trusting our neighbors, and the economic future of our villages and our cities. 
   Through the years, he donated millions of dollars to the University of Kentucky and Wright State University. Today, two buildings at the Lexington campus bear Erv's name, as does Wright State University's indoor athletic complex. 
   Erv Nutter was a blunt man. He was an open man. He was a man who would tell you what he thought, never afraid in any way to express his convictions or his strong beliefs.  
   That is one of the things that made Erv Nutter so endearing. It has been said that the greatness of a man can be measured by the extent and the breadth of his interests and how he acts on those interests to make a difference in this world. Surely by that test, Erv Nutter was a great man. He was so passionate about his interests, and what interests he had: agriculture, technology, wild game conservation, education, sports, history, aviation, or working for a better government. Whatever Erv was interested in, he cared passionately about and he acted upon. And in each area, he made a difference. Sure, he helped financially but, more importantly, Erv gave his time and he gave his energy. He was a man of great passion. 
   In 1981, Erv Nutter was named Greene County Man of the Year. He served as business chairman of the American Cancer Society, chairman of the Fellow's Committee at the University of Kentucky, member of the President's Club at both Ohio State and Wright State University, past president and trustee of the Aviation Hall of Fame--one of his great passions and his wonderful wife, Zoe Dell's great passions; the work with Zoe Dell continues to this day--as former chairman of the Ohio Republican Finance Committee, and former chairman of the Beavercreek Zoning Commission. 
   In 1995, at the age of 80, Erv was inducted into the Ohio Senior Citizens Hall of Fame, an honor for outstanding contributions and exceptional achievements begun or continued after the age of 60. Erv always was there for our community. Erv always was there for our State. In all that he did, he made a positive difference. Erv Nutter was a remarkable person, a person who affected countless lives for the better. His family knows that probably better than anyone else because there were so many things Erv Nutter did that he didn't tell anybody about. He just was there to be supportive and to make a difference. He just quietly helped out whenever his community asked. And many times when his community didn't ask, he did it anyway. 
   The only thing Erv wanted was to make the world a better place for his children, his grandchildren, and for all of us. Erv Nutter took great pleasure in sharing his personal success with the whole community. I was particularly struck by Erv's humility. I remember that he once told the Xenia Daily Gazette he was the luckiest man in the world. He was lucky because he had had the opportunity to do so many things he had never, ever, in his wildest dreams, thought he would be able to do. He told the paper:  
   No one can achieve success by himself. I think this is one of the most important things for people to remember today.  
   Erv didn't seek credit. Rather, he appreciated his success and understood that his community was a great part of that success. We all admired Erv Nutter. We all respected him. 
   As Chesterton once said:  
   Great men take up great space, even when they are gone.  
   Erv Nutter will continue to take up great space on this Earth, not just in buildings but in lives touched and lives changed. Erv Nutter will continue to live on through the great work he has done. He also will live through his wonderful family: his wife Zoe Dell, Joe, Bob and Mary, Ken and Melinda, Katie and Jonathan. 
   We pay tribute to Erv tonight for what he has meant to our community.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise to recognize tonight Rocco Scotti, a talented and patriotic singer from my home State of Ohio, who is a fixture in Cleveland and Cuyahoga County, northeast Ohio, a fixture at Cleveland Indians baseball games and just about any public event in our community that matters. 
   Rocco, because of the countless times he has sung our national anthem at local, national, and international events, has truly earned the title of ``Star-Spangled Banner Singer of the Millennium.'' 
   Rocco, an Italian American whose family is from Italy's east coast, grew up in Cleveland and started his vocal training in opera. He first performed the national anthem publicly in 1974 at an Indians-Orioles game. 
   Since that time, he has become a regularly featured national anthem singer for both American and National League baseball games, games played in Cincinnati, Cleveland, New York, for the Baltimore Orioles, Oakland A's, Kansas City Royals, Toronto Blue Jays, LA Dodgers. The list goes on and on. Rocco has also had the honor of performing the national anthem for Presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. 
   Rocco's list of accomplishments doesn't end there. He was awarded the United States civilian Purple Heart for inspiring patriotism for his exceptional performance of the national anthem, and he has performed the anthem on national television for events such as the NBC game of the week, an American League playoff game, the 1981 All Star game, and countless other televised sporting events. Dubbed by People's magazine as one of the best anthem singers in America, he is the first singer to perform the national anthem for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 
   Cooperstown, NY. He is a featured singer for the Indians, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Cleveland Force, and he is the permanent singer of the anthem for the Football Hall of Fame ceremonies in Canton, OH. 
   While Rocco is most known for his rendition of the national anthem, he is also a featured singer of other nations' anthems. He has sung the Polish national anthem for Polish boxing team matches, the Hungarian national anthem for Hungarian basketball games, the Italian national anthem for Italian soccer team contests, and the Israeli national anthem for the appearance of the Assistant Prime Minister of Israel in Cleveland. 
   Needless to say, Rocco Scotti is an American icon. His voice, indeed, is a national treasure. What impresses me most about Rocco isn't so much his beautiful voice, although it is beautiful, but his amazing attitude about his heritage, his life here in this great country. Rocco said the following to me once:  
   I am very, very proud that with my Italian heritage, God has given me the honor of performing our country's greatest and most meaningful song.  
   For that kind of patriotism, love of country, I wish to say thank you to Rocco. I am proud to call him the Star-Spangled Banner Singer of the Millennium.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, today I would like to honor a great volunteer organization from my home state of Ohio--The General Daniel ``Chappie'' James American Legion Auxiliary Unit 776. Based in the city of Dayton, this organization and its members were recognized recently by USA Weekend magazine for their participation in the ``Ninth Annual Make a Difference Day,'' which is the largest national day of helping and volunteerism. 
   To be recognized by USA Weekend, an organization must demonstrate great efforts and achievements in the areas of volunteerism and community service. The General Daniel ``Chappie'' James American Legion Auxiliary Unit 776 certainly has done that. One of its members, Mrs. Ola Matthews, heard that foster children around the Dayton community must carry their belongings through the foster care system in plastic trash bags. This worried her greatly. So, she set about to help these children. Under her leadership, the members of Unit 776 conducted fundraisers to buy luggage and collected luggage from community donors. On October 23, 1999, the members of Unit 776 delivered the fruits of their effort--over 1,000 pieces of luggage, plus toiletries, underclothes, and baby supplies--to the Montgomery County Children's Services in Dayton. This is a remarkable achievement and one demonstrating great selflessness and generosity. It is actions like these--an organization helping those in its community--that makes Dayton such a great city. 
   Mr. President, one young member of this organization, in particular, has made outstanding contributions to her community. Shatoya Hill, who has been involved in Unit 776 most her life,  has just been awarded a $6,000 scholarship for her community service and academic achievements. She has been Junior President of the organization for over 5 years. During this time, she has organized and participated in many fundraisers, from helping veterans to delivering food baskets to the needy during Christmas. 
   The Dayton Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta, a public service sorority, awarded the scholarship, which is presented to young women who have excellent academic records, possess high moral character, participate in their church and community, and have interest in higher education. Shatoya certainly exhibits all of these positive qualities. It is great to see Ohio youths working hard for their communities and being recognized for their achievements. 
   Congratulations Unit 776 and congratulations Shatoya! 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Following morning business, the Senate will have a swearing-in ceremony for Senator-designate Zell Miller. After the ceremony and the remarks by the Senator-designate, the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the energy and water appropriations bill. By previous order, following the cloture vote, the Senate will begin consideration of the conference report to accompany the Department of Defense appropriations bill, with a vote to occur at approximately 3:15 p.m. Assuming cloture is invoked on the motion to proceed to the energy and water appropriations bill, the Senate will then begin 30 hours of postcloture debate. 
   As a reminder, cloture was filed on the motion to proceed to the PNTR China legislation during today's session. It is hoped an agreement can be made to schedule that vote for tomorrow afternoon.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Reconciliation Act. This bill would eliminate much of the so-called marriage penalty contained in the current tax code by expanding the standard filing deduction for married couples filing jointly, widening the tax brackets, increasing the income phase-outs for the earned income credit, and extending permanently the preservation of the family tax credits. 
   My main reason for supporting this measure is the simple fact that I do not believe that the federal government should be penalizing marriage. If two people meet and fall in love, they should not have to worry about whether their formal union will bring about adverse tax consequences. After all, newly married couples have enough to worry about, without the added burden of increased tax liability. 
   Mr. President, one of the basic principles of our tax system is that it treats individuals in similar situations in the same way. In other words, if two individuals make the same amount of money and the rest of their lifestyles are similar, they pay the same amount of tax. 
   When two people marry, these principles of fairness should remain in  place, even if the basis of tax liability changes from the individual to the family. Two people, as a married couple, simply should not have to pay higher taxes than they would as singles. And furthermore, two couples who make the same income should pay the same amount of taxes. The proposal before us today adheres to those principles. The alternative offered by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, does not. 
   Mr. President, I support the marriage tax relief proposal currently before us now--it is a step toward eliminating one of the most egregious examples of unfairness and complexity in the tax code today. I strongly urge my colleagues to support its final passage.

   Mr. SMITH (of New Hampshire). I would agree with my colleague from Ohio and add that I applaud the innovative efforts that have led to the development of this emerging emissions control technology. As many of you know, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is currently working to develop a bill that will address the significant problem of the hodge-podge of overlapping Clean Air Act regulation on utilities. Our goal is to draft a comprehensive, multi-pollutant bill to provide a more sensible  emission control regime on utilities while at the same time achieving greater reductions of pollutants than is currently possible under the Clean Air Act. New technologies, much as electro-catalytic oxidation will be critically important to our ability to successfully revise our approach to utility emission control. I would support any efforts to expedite the development of this technology.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the ``Death Tax Elimination Act.'' This bill would reduce federal estate and gift tax collections over the next nine years, followed by full repeal in the tenth year. 
   Many of my colleagues have come to the floor and made compelling arguments for the elimination of the death tax. Many have argued that the death tax is unfair and even immoral in a sense. The death tax penalizes the most productive in our society and discourages savings and investment. 
   Mr. President, I agree with all of these arguments. Each of these arguments supply ample warrants for eliminating the death tax. And ultimately, I have concluded the estate tax stunts continued economic growth and provides only very limited federal revenues. Simply put, the negative economic and societal consequences of the death tax, coupled with-- at best--very limited contributions to federal revenues simply do not justify its continued existence. 
   So, what exactly does the collection of this tax mean to federal revenues? In Fiscal Year 1999, the estate tax amounted to just 1.5 percent of all federal revenues, or $28 billion. While $28 billion sure sounds like a lot of money, when put in the context of overall federal revenue, it is difficult to comprehend just how inconsequential this amount really is. Given that, how can anyone make the argument that the estate tax is an essential part of our nation's tax code? 
   Mr. President, I said before that the limited benefits of the death tax do not justify its negative economic and societal consequences. What are these negative consequences? Studies indicate that the death tax results in lower savings, reduced capital accumulation, slower economic growth, and fewer new jobs. These studies simply confirm what our own common sense should have already made plain: Confiscatory taxes, such as the death tax, discourage industry and hurt the overall economy. 
   Throughout this debate, I have heard my colleagues quote seemingly contradictory statistics gleaned from different studies or economic experts. I am not going to engage in that sort of discussion. Instead, I am going to focus on the stories of some of my constituents in Ohio to help confirm the facts that many studies and my own common sense tell me are true. 
   Like many of my colleagues, my office has received hundreds of letters from constituents and their families who have been or will be affected by the death tax. One farmer from a small town in Fulton County, Ohio wrote: ``. . . the `Death Tax' wrecks havoc on family farms when parcels have to be sold to pay estate taxes to the government. . . . We have paid our taxes on property, on our equipment, on our income and when its time to transfer our properties to our children, we do not want them to have the added burden of  having to sell off assets to pay Uncle Sam.'' My staff followed up with this constituent to find out more about his story. This particular farmer, who is shy about having his name used, has been involved with agriculture his whole life. He grew up on a farm owned by his father. In 1969, he purchased land of his own for about $700 per acre. Since then, he continually has added land, and he now farms approximately 425 acres. In his words, he and his wife have sacrificed and ``skimped to make sure it works.'' He is now 53 years-old, with three sons, all of whom farm. When the time comes, he'd like to pass his farm on to his children. Unfortunately, his land and equipment are now too expensive to escape the death tax. Rather than become more efficient and perhaps grow his farm further, this farmer has begun the process of estate planning. If we do not eliminate this tax, it is quite likely that his sons will be forced to sell land and/or equipment to meet the tax bill. This just isn't right. 
   A second story comes from Jerry Boes, of Antwerp, Ohio. Mr. Boes wrote: ``I have worked hard all my life and paid all my taxes on everything I own. Why does the government take away 50 percent of whatever might remain upon my death?'' Again, my staff followed up with Mr. Boes, who is now 62 years-old. It seems that around 15 years ago, he saw an ad in the local newspaper for opportunities to own a ``Subway'' sandwich shop franchise. He took a chance and almost lost his home in the process. Mr. Boes now says this: ``I took chances, stuck my neck out and paid my taxes.'' It has indeed paid off for him. He now owns six ``Subway'' stores and employs around 75 people on average. I am happy to report that he was able to keep his house, too. 
   Mr. Boes' story is representative of our American entrepreneurial spirit. It is a fantastic example of many Americans' struggle to own their own businesses. Unfortunately, he may have done too well. When he passes away, he'd like to hand the business down to his children. But, because most of his assets are tied up in land and buildings, his children will be forced to sell about 50% of his assets to pay the death tax. He has tried to do some estate planning on at least two different occasions to no avail. He has become so frustrated that he, and I quote, ``Just threw up my hands and gave up.'' Upon his death, I wonder what will become of his 75 employees? 
   Finally, there is a story of Erin Nyrop Glasgow from Dublin, Ohio. In 1952, her parents started an electrical contracting business out of the trunk of their car. They worked hard over the years to build up that business. The Sterling Electric Company currently employs 40 people. Again, this is another great story of our American entrepreneurial spirit--and one that we, as a nation, should be encouraging. In the early 1990's, Erin's parents convinced her to take over the company. They wanted to keep it in the family upon their passing. The death of Erin's father and the fact that another local family-owned business was forced to sell upon the death of its founder, really caused her to become aware of the perils of the death tax. 
   Now, she spends thousands of dollars, practically on an annual basis, in estate planning. These dollars could be used to grow the business, become more efficient, or hire new employees. She views monthly finance reports with trepidation. She is happy to find out that Sterling Electric is profitable. But, it is, in her own words, ``A double-edged sword.'' The more profitable she is, the more she'll lose upon her mother's death. Again, this is just wrong. The federal government should not, on the one hand, encourage businesses to grow and be more and more profitable, while on the other hand, threaten the loss of a family business for becoming too successful. 
   Mr. President, these stories tell more about the regressiveness and the simply unfair nature of the death tax better than any think tank study. Right now, we have an opportunity to eliminate this burdensome tax. This is an opportunity we simply should not miss. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill today--the ``Veterans Mission for Youth Initiative''--that would expand the current mission of the successful Troops to Teachers program. As many of my colleagues know, Troops to Teachers is a practical and sensible teacher recruitment program--a program that helps our veterans and retired military personnel gain the necessary certification to teach in our children's classrooms. 
   The bill I am introducing today would build on the current program's success by expanding its mission to help veterans who want to volunteer in our schools and be role models, but do not necessarily want to become certified teachers. This bill not only will help children benefit from the knowledge and experiences of veterans, but it also will help our veterans get more involved and active in their own local  communities. I am pleased that Governor George W. Bush is proposing this same idea today in Pittsburgh. 
   Specifically, the ``Veterans Mission for Youth Initiative,'' would authorize $75 million to be used for matching federal grants to community organizations that help train and then link veterans and retired military personnel with local school volunteer opportunities to mentor and tutor students. The grant program will be administered through the Defense Department's Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support division, which runs the Troops-to-Teachers program. 
   Mr. President, the sad reality is that our schools are in crisis--especially in the inner cities and in places like Appalachia. And, I am frustrated and saddened that far too many children simply are not getting the quality education they deserve. The current Troops to Teachers program is helping to improve educational quality in America by providing mature, motivated, experienced, and dedicated personnel for our nation's classrooms. In fact, when administrators were asked to rate Troops to Teachers participants in their schools, 54 percent of the administrators said that the former military personnel turned teachers were among the best teachers at the schools. I am pleased to say that since 1994, 3,720 retired members of the U.S. military have been hired as teachers in all 50 states. 
   Additionally, a 1999 alternative teacher certification study found that participants in the Troops to Teachers program broaden the make-up and skills of our current teacher pool. For example, 30 percent of participants are minorities, compared to 10 percent of all teachers; 30 percent of participants are teaching math, compared to 13 percent of all teachers; 39 percent are willing to teach in inner cities compared to the current 16 percent urban teaching force; and 90 percent are male, compared to the overall current teaching force which is 26 percent male. 
   By expanding the current mission of the Troops to Teachers program by helping to link veterans with community volunteer opportunities to tutor and mentor school children, we can strengthen our education system overall. By linking students and America's retired military personnel--men and women who have exhibited the ideals of discipline, order, courage, and civic responsibility--we can teach our children valuable lessons outside the classroom. 
   Sadly, Mr. President, a recent survey of American youth, called the ``New Millennium Project,'' found that students chose as their three lowest-ranking priorities in life: 1. Being a good citizen who cares about the good of the country; 2. Being involved in democracy and voting; and 3. Being involved in helping make one's community a better place. Furthermore, a recent survey by the Horatio Alger Society found that 21 percent of students had no heroes. 
   We need to change this, Mr. President. We need to change these apathetic and aimless attitudes. We need to give American youth some direction--the right direction. After all, these children are our future--we need to equip them with an arsenal of lessons--lessons they can learn in the classroom and out of the classroom by interacting with our country's heroes--our veterans. 
   The bottom line is this: As a nation, we need to do all we can to get the best teachers available into our public schools. We are trying to do just that through the current Troops to Teachers program. Now, the ``Veteran's Mission for Youth Initiative'' is another step in that direction. I urge my colleagues to support this effort and to join me in taking an important step toward improving education in this country. We owe it to our children; we it to our veterans; and we owe it to our nation.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today as a co-author of the ``Children's Public Health Act of 2000.'' The sad fact is that far too many children never realize success as adults or even reach adulthood because of debilitating or life-threatening disease. That is why we must build a health care system that is responsive to the unique needs of children. The ``Children's Public Health Act of 2000'' is a big step in the right direction, and I commend my colleagues, Senators FRIST, JEFFORDS, and KENNEDY for their efforts to construct a bill that can really make a positive difference in the health and the lives of children.  
   Mr. President, I am especially pleased that the ``Children's Public Health Act'' contains several important initiatives that my colleagues and I had already introduced as separate bills. One such initiative--the Pediatric Research Initiative--would help ensure that more of the increased research funding at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is invested specifically in children's health research. 
   While children represent close to 30 percent of the population of this country, NIH devotes only about 12 percent of its budget to children, and, in recent years, that proportion has been declining even further. We must reverse this disturbing trend. It simply makes no sense to conduct health research for adults and hope that those findings also will apply to children. A ``one-size-fits-all'' research approach just doesn't work. The fact is that children have medical conditions and health care needs that differ significantly from adults. Children's health deserves more attention from the research community. That's why the Pediatric Research Initiative is such an important part of the ``Children's Public Health Act.'' It would provide the federal support for pediatric research that is so vital to ensuring that children receive the appropriate and best health care possible. 
   The Pediatric Research Initiative would authorize $50 million annually for the next five years for the Office of the Director of NIH to conduct, coordinate, support, develop, and recognize pediatric research. By doing so, we will be able to ensure that researchers target and study child-specific diseases. With more than 20 Institutes and Centers and Offices within NIH that conduct, support, or develop pediatric research in some way, this investment would promote greater coordination and focus in children's health research and should encourage new initiatives and areas of research. 
   The ``Children's Public Health Act'' also would authorize funding through the National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)--for pediatric research training grants to support training for additional pediatric research scientists and would provide funding for loan forgiveness programs. Trained researchers are essential if we are to make significant advances in the study of pediatric health care, especially in light of the new and improved Food and Drug Administration (FDA) policies that encourage the testing of medications for use by children. 
   Additionally, the ``Children's Public Health Act'' includes the ``Children's Asthma Relief Act,'' which Senator DURBIN and I introduced last year. The sad reality for children is that asthma is becoming a far too common and chronic childhood illness. From 1979 to 1992, the hospitalization rates among children due to asthma increased 74 percent. Today, estimates show that more than seven percent of children now suffer from asthma. Nationwide, the most substantial prevalence rate increase for asthma occurred among children aged four and younger. Those four and younger also were hospitalized at the highest rate among all individuals with asthma. 
   According to 1998 data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), my home state of Ohio ranks about 17th in the estimated prevalence rates for asthma. Based on a 1994 CDC National Health Interview Survey, an estimated 197,226 children under 18 years of age in Ohio suffer from asthma. This is a serious health concern among children--and we must address it. 
   The ``Children's Public Health Act'' would help ensure that children with asthma receive the care they need to live healthy lives. The bill would authorize $50 million annually for five years for the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award grants to eligible entities to develop and expand projects that would provide asthma services to children. These grants also may be used to equip mobile health care clinics that provide asthma diagnosis and asthma-related health care services; educate families on asthma management; and identify and enroll uninsured children who are eligible for, but are not receiving health coverage under Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). The ability to identify and enroll children in these programs will ensure that children with asthma receive the care they need. 
   Since research shows that children living in urban areas suffer from asthma at such alarming rates and that allergens, such as cockroach waste, contribute to the onset of asthma, this bill also adds urban cockroach management to the current preventive health services block grant which currently can be used for rodent control. 
   To better coordinate federal activities related to asthma, the Secretary of HHS would be required to identify all federal programs that carry out asthma research and develop a federal plan for responding to asthma. To better monitor the prevalence of pediatric asthma and to determine which areas have the greatest incidences of children with asthma, this bill would require the CDC to conduct local asthma surveillance activities to collect data on the prevalence and severity of asthma and to publish data annually on the prevalence rates of asthma among children and on the childhood mortality rate. This surveillance data will help us better detect asthmatic conditions, so that we can treat more children and ensure that we are targeting our resources in an effective and efficient way to reverse the disturbing trend in the hospitalization and death rates of asthmatic children. 
   Finally, Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today includes language that I strongly support to re-authorize funding for children's hospitals' Graduate Medical Education (GME) programs for four additional years. Last year, as part of the ``Health Care Research and Quality Act,'' which was signed into law, we authorized funding for two years for children's hospitals' GME programs. The teaching mission of these hospitals is essential. Children's hospitals comprise less than one percent of all hospitals, yet they train five percent of all physicians, nearly 30 percent of all pediatricians, and almost 50 percent of all pediatric specialists. By providing our nation with highly qualified pediatricians, children's hospitals can offer children the best possible care and offer parents peace of mind. They serve as the health care safety net for low-income children in their respective communities and are often the sole regional providers of many critical pediatric services. These institutions also serve as centers of excellence for very sick children across the nation. Federal funding for GME in children's hospitals is a sound investment in children's health and provides stability for the future of the pediatric workforce. 
   Mr. President, as the father of eight children and the grandfather of five, I firmly believe that we must move forward to protect the interests--and especially the health--of all children. The ``Children's Public Health Act of 2000'' makes crucial investments in our country's future--investments that will yield great returns. If we focus on improving health care for all children today, we will have a generation of healthy adults tomorrow. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this vital children's health care bill.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, now that we have passed the Transportation Appropriations bill and it heads to the conference committee, I strongly urge my colleagues to support in conference a provision in the bill that would encourage states to adopt a .08 Blood-Alcohol Concentration (BAC) level as the per se standard for drunk driving. 
   This issue is not new to the Senate. In 1998, as the Senate considered the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, or TEA 21, 62 Senators agreed to an almost identical provision--an amendment that Senator LAUTENBERG and I offered to make .08 the law of the land. Sixty-two Senators, Mr. President, agreed that we needed this law because it would save lives. 
   We made it clear during the debate in 1998 that .08, by itself, would not solve the problem of drunk driving. However, .08, along with a number of other steps taken over the years to combat drunk driving, would save between 500 and 600 lives annually. Let me repeat that, Mr. President--if we add .08 to all the other things we are doing to combat drunk driving--we would save between 500 and 600 more lives every year. 
   On March 4, 1998--when the Senate voted 62 to 32 in favor of a .08 law--the United States Senate spoke loud and clear. This body said that .08 should be the uniform standard on all highways in this country. The United States Senate said that we believe .08 will save lives. The United States Senate said that it makes sense to have uniform laws, so that when a family drives from one state to another, the same standards--the same tough laws--will apply. 
   But sadly, Mr. President, despite the overwhelming vote in the Senate--despite the United States Senate's very strong belief that .08 laws will save lives--this provision was dropped in conference. The conferees replaced it with an enhanced incentive grant program that has proven to be ineffective. Since this grant program has been in place, only one state--Texas--has taken advantage of the incentives and put a .08 law into effect. 
   So, here we are again--back at square one, making the same arguments we made two years ago--the same arguments that compelled 62 United States Senators to vote in favor of .08 legislation. Let's not make the same mistake this time, Mr. President. The Senate kept the .08 provision in the Transportation Appropriations bill we passed last week--this time, we need to do the right thing and keep the provision in the conference report and make it law once and for all. 
   The case for a .08 law in every state is as compelling today as it was two years ago when we voted on this. The fact is that a person with a .08 Blood-  Alcohol Concentration level is seriously impaired. When a person reaches .08, his/her vision, balance, reaction time, hearing, judgement, and self-control are severely impaired. Moreover, critical driving tasks, such as concentrated attention, speed control, braking, steering, gear-changing and lane-tracking, are negatively impacted at .08. 
   But, beyond these facts, there are other scientifically sound reasons to enact a national .08 standard. First, the risk of being in a crash increases gradually with each blood-alcohol level, but then rises rapidly after a driver reaches or exceeds .08 compared to drivers with no alcohol in their systems. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports that in single vehicle crashes, the relative fatality risk for drivers with BAC's between .05 and .09 is over eleven times greater than for drivers with BAC's of zero. 
   Second, .08 BAC laws have proven results in reducing crashes and fatalities. Back in 1998, when Senator LAUTENBERG and I, argued in support of a national .08 law, we cited a study that compared states with .08 BAC laws and neighboring states with .10 BAC laws. That study found that .08 laws reduced the overall incidence of alcohol fatalities by 16% and also reduced fatalities at higher BAC levels. During our debate two years ago, the accuracy of this report was called into question by opponents of our amendment. Since then, a number of different studies have verified the findings of the original Boston University study. I will talk about these new studies shortly. 
   Third and finally, according to NHTSA, crash statistics show that even heavy drinkers, who account for a large percentage of drunk driving arrests, are less likely to drink and drive because of 
   the general deterrent effect of .08. 
   Right now, Mr. President, we have a patchwork pattern of state drunk driving laws. Forty-eight states have a per se BAC law in effect. Thirty-one of these states have a .10 per se standard. Seventeen have enacted a .08 level. With all due respect, Mr. President, this doesn't make sense. The opponents of the .08 level cannot convince me that simply crossing a state border will make a drunk sober. For instance, just crossing the Wilson Bridge from Virginia into Maryland would not make a drunk driver sober. 
   This states' rights debate reminds me of what Ronald Reagan said when he signed the minimum drinking age bill: ``The problem is bigger than the individual states.........It's a grave national problem, and it touches all our lives. With the problem so clear-cut and the proven solution at hand, we have no misgiving about this judicious use of federal power.'' 
   The Administration has set a very laudable goal of reducing alcohol-related motor vehicle fatalities to no more than 11,000 by the year 2005. Mr. President, this goal is going to be very difficult to achieve. But, I believe that recent history provides a road map for how to achieve this goal. Beginning in the late 1970's, a national movement began to change our country's attitudes toward drinking and driving. This movement has helped spur state legislatures to enact stronger drunk driving laws; it led to tougher enforcement; and it caused people to think twice before drinking and driving. In fact, it was this national movement that helped me get a tough DUI law passed in my home state of Ohio back in 1982. In short, these efforts have helped reverse attitudes in this country about drinking and driving--it is now no longer ``cool'' to drink and drive. 
   The reduction in alcohol-related fatalities since that time is not attributable to one single thing. Rather, it was the result of a whole series of actions taken by state and federal government and the tireless efforts of many organizations, such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Students Against Drunk Driving, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, and many others. 
   Despite all of our past efforts, alcohol involvement is still the single greatest factor in motor vehicle deaths and injuries. We must continue to take small, but effective and proven steps forward in the battle against drunk driving. Passage of a national .08 blood alcohol standard is one of these small, effective steps. 
   Mr. President, how do we know that .08 is an effective measure in combating drunk driving? Earlier I cited a Boston University study which showed that, if all 50 states set .08 as a standard, between 500 and 600 lives would be saved annually. A number of my colleagues questioned that study during the Senate debate back in 1998. But, we don't need to rely on that one single study. 
   Since we last debated .08, at least three studies have been published on this issue. The most comprehensive of these, conducted by the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, concluded the following: ``With regard to .08 BAC laws, the results suggested that these laws were associated with 8% reductions in the involvement of both high BAC and lower BAC drivers in fatal crashes. Combining the results for the high and low BAC drivers, it is estimated that 275 lives were saved by .08 BAC laws in 1997. If all 50 states (rather than 15 states) had such laws in place in 1997, an additional 590 lives could have been saved.'' Let me repeat that. ``If all 50 states . . . had such laws in place in 1997, an additional 590 lives could have been saved.'' 
   A second study, Mr. President, conducted by NHTSA, looked at eleven states with ``sufficient experience with .08 BAC laws to conduct a meaningful analysis.'' This study found that ``. . . the rate of alcohol involvement in fatal crashes declined in eight of the states studied after the effective date of a .08 BAC law. Further, .08 BAC laws were associated with significant reductions in alcohol-related fatalities, alone or in conjunction with administrative license revocation laws, in seven of eleven states. In five of these seven states, implementation of the .08 BAC law, itself, was followed by significantly lower rates of alcohol involvement among fatalities.'' 
   Finally, the third most recent study, conducted by the Highway Safety Research Center at the University of North Carolina, evaluated the effects of North Carolina's .08 BAC law. Opponents of this amendment use this study as supposed proof that .08 does not work. But, here is what the study concluded: ``It appears 
   that lowering the BAC limit to .08% in North Carolina did not have any clear effect on alcohol-related crashes. The existing downward trend in alcohol-involvement among all crashes and among more serious crashes continued . . .'' In other words, .08 when enacted by a state that is progressive and aggressive in its efforts to deal with drinking drivers helps to continue existing downward trends in alcohol involvement in fatal crashes. 
   Mr. President, some skeptics still might not be convinced of the positive effects of a national .08 BAC standard. The General Accounting Office (GAO) conducted a critical review of these studies. GAO concluded that there are ``strong indications that .08 BAC laws, in combination with other drunk driving laws (particularly license revocation laws), sustained public education and information efforts, and vigorous and consistent enforcement can save lives.'' The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), in its response to the GAO report, concluded that ``significant reductions have been found in most states;'' that ``consistent evidence exists that .08 BAC laws, at a minimum, add to the effectiveness of laws and activities already in place;'' and that ``a persuasive body of evidence is now available to support the Department's position on .08 BAC laws.'' The GAO responded to DOT, stating: ``Overall, we believe that DOT's assessment of the effectiveness of .08 BAC laws is fairly consistent with our own.'' 
   The fact is that since we last debated this issue, all of these published studies have reached the same conclusion: .08 laws will save lives. I urge my colleagues not to be fooled by the opponents' rhetoric during conference negotiations and keep the provision in tact. The opponents attempt to demean .08 laws by saying they will not ``solve the problem of drunk driving.'' These opponents--in the way they use the word ``solve''--are correct: .08 is not a silver bullet. By itself, it will not end drunk driving. However, it is exactly what proponents have always said it was--another proven effective step that we can take to reduce drunk driving injuries and fatalities. Make no mistake--.08 BAC laws will save lives.  
   I want to conclude by thanking my friend from New Jersey, Senator LAUTENBERG, for his continued dedication to this issue. His hard work and perseverance have helped bring us to the point today where the Senate once again has passed legislation to strongly encourage states to enact this life-saving measure. I would also like to thank Senator RICHARD SHELBY, the Chairman of the Subcommittee, for his support of the .08 measure as the Transportation Appropriations bill was being crafting; and Senator JOHN WARNER for his continued dedication to reducing drunk driving. 
   Mr. President, .08 is definitely a legislative effort worth fighting for, and I hope we will succeed this time in retaining the provision in the conference report. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk recently in this country about gun control. It is no secret that gun control measures are very controversial and are subject to a great deal of debate--as they should be. But, we have to remember that in the heat of this debate, we must not lose sight of the real issue at hand--and that's gun violence. There is nothing controversial about protecting our children, our families, our communities by keeping guns out of the wrong hands--keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and violent offenders--not law-abiding citizens, Mr. President, but criminals. 
   These criminals with guns are killing our children. They're killing our young adults. They're killing our friends and our neighbors. I am here on the floor today because I am very troubled by this, Mr. President, and I am troubled by the current Administration's handling of crimes committed with guns. Let me explain. 
   Right now, current law makes it a federal crime for a convicted felon to ever possess a firearm. So, once a person is convicted of a felony, that person can never again own a gun. It is against federal law to use a gun to commit any crime, regardless of if that crime is otherwise a state crime. And, under federal law, the sentences for these kinds of crimes are mandatory--no second chance, no parole. 
   In the late 1980's, President Bush made enforcement of these gun laws a priority. His Justice Department told local sheriffs, chiefs of police, and prosecutors that if they caught a felon with a gun--or if they caught someone committing a crime in which a gun was used--the federal government would take the case, and put that criminal behind bars for at least five years--no exceptions. During the last 18 months of the Bush Administration, more than 2,000 criminals with guns were put behind bars. 
   Consistent, effective enforcement ended once the current Administration took office. Between 1992 and 1998, for example, the number of gun cases filed for prosecution dropped from 7,048 to about 3,807--that's a 46 percent decrease. As a result, the number of federal criminal convictions for firearms offenses has fallen dramatically. 
   For six years, the Justice Department refused to prosecute those criminals who use a gun to commit state crimes--even though the use of a gun to commit those crimes could be charged as a federal crime. The only cases they would prosecute were those in which a federal crime was already being committed and a gun was used in the commission of that crime. 
   Even worse, to this very day, some federal gun laws are almost never enforced by this Administration. While Brady law background checks have stopped nearly 300,000 prohibited purchasers of firearms from buying guns, less than .1 percent have actually been prosecuted. 
   I have repeatedly questioned Attorney General Reno and her deputies about the decline in prosecutions, and their standard response is that the Department of Justice is focusing on so-called ``high-level'' offenders, instead of ``low-level'' offenders, who commit one crime with a gun. They say that they want to prosecute the few sharks at the top rather than the numerous guppies at the bottom of the criminal enterprise. With all due respect, that's nonsense. 
   Attorney General Reno recently said that she would aggressively prosecute armed criminals, but only if they commit a violent crime. Again, that type of law enforcement policy just doesn't make sense. Current law prohibits violent felons from possessing guns, and so we should aggressively prosecute these cases to take guns away from violent criminals--before they use those guns to injure and kill people. It's that simple. 
   Mr. President, we have often heard that six percent of the criminals commit 70 percent of the crimes--six percent of the criminals commit 70 percent of the crimes. Well, if you have a violent criminal who illegally possesses a gun, I can bet you that he is part of that six percent! He's one of the bad guys--and we should put him away before he has a chance to use that gun again. 
   Mr. President, we need to take all of these armed criminals off 
   the streets. That is how we can reduce crime and save lives. Why wait for armed criminals to commit more and more heinous crimes before we prosecute them to the full extent of the law? Why wait, when we can do something before another Ohioan--or any American--becomes a victim of gun violence? 
   We shouldn't wait, Mr. President. That's why the House of Representatives recently passed legislation that would increase gun prosecutions. And that's why, along with a number of my colleagues, including Senators ABRAHAM, SANTORUM, WARNER, SESSIONS, HELMS, ASHCROFT, and HUTCHINSON from Arkansas, we have introduced the companion to the House-passed bill--a bill that offers the kind of practical solution we need to thwart gun crimes. 
   Our bill--called ``Project Exile: The Safe Streets and Neighbors Act of 2000''--would provide $100 million in grants over five years to those states that agree to enact their own mandatory minimum five-year jail sentences for armed criminals who use or possess an illegal gun. As an alternative, a state can also qualify for the grants by turning armed criminals over for federal prosecution under existing firearms laws. Therefore, a state has the option of prosecuting armed felons in state or federal courts. Qualifying states can use their grants for any variety of purposes that would strengthen their criminal or juvenile justice systems' ability to deal with violent criminals. 
   This approach works, Mr. President. In Virginia, for example, the state instituted a program in 1997, also called ``Project Exile.'' Their program is based on one simple principle: Any criminal caught with a gun will serve a minimum mandatory sentence of five years in prison. Period. End of story. As a result, gun-toting criminals are being prosecuted six times faster, and serving sentences up to four times longer than they otherwise would under state law. Moreover, the homicide rate in Richmond already has dropped 40 percent! 
   Every state should have the opportunity to implement Project Exile in their high-crime communities. The bill that we have introduced will make this proven, commonsense approach to reducing gun violence available to every state. It will take guns out of the hands of violent criminals. It will make our neighborhoods safer. It will save lives. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support and pass this legislation. It's time to protect our children, our families, and our country from armed and dangerous criminals. It's time to get guns out of the wrong hands. It's time we take back our neighborhoods and our communities from the criminals and take action to stop gun-toting criminals.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the Chairman of the Labor, Health, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator SPECTER, and the Ranking Member, Senator HARKIN, for their support of our Nation's poison control centers. Because of their help, the appropriations bill we pass will contain a sound investment in these centers. 
   Mr. President, many of us--as parents--have experienced the terrifying situation when a child accidently swallows something potentially toxic. Fortunately, poison control centers are in place to field poison-related phone calls and to offer parents and everyone valuable medical advice when these types of emergencies arise. Additionally, the professionals at the centers provide education and training to the public to help prevent poisonings. Without a doubt, poison control centers offer vital health services. 
   Earlier this year, Congress passed legislation that I sponsored along with 34 of my colleagues--and the President signed it into law--which authorizes $27.6 million to be used to fund a national toll-free number to ensure access to poison control center services; a nationwide media campaign to educate the public and health care providers about poison prevention; and a grant program to: (1) Help certified regional poison control centers achieve financial stability; (2) Prevent poisonings; (3) Provide treatment recommendations for poisonings; and (4) Improve poison control center services. 
   Last year, I worked with Senator SPECTER, to include $3 million in FY2000 for the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to initiate planning for the national toll-free number and to begin assisting the local poison control centers' other efforts. Because of that initial investment, the national toll-free number will be fully operational by September 30th of this year. The new toll-free number will provide easy access to poison control services no matter where you are in the country by directing calls to the local poison control center closest to you. 
   To ensure that the local centers can maintain current operations and handle increases in calls resulting from the new toll-free number, the centers must be funded at an adequate level. The investment this bill makes will help poison control centers continue providing essential services to parents and to the public now and in the future. 
   Investing in poison control centers just makes good economic sense. Do you realize that for every dollar spent on poison control center services, we can save $7 dollars in medical costs? The average cost of a poisoning exposure call to a poison control center is $31.28. The average cost of using other health care system options, like emergency room services, for example, is $932 dollars. 
   Each year, the Central Ohio Poison Center handles more than 66,000 calls, and the Cincinnati Poison Center handles about 78,000 calls. According to Dr. Marcel Casavant--medical director for the Central Ohio Poison Center and emergency department physician at Columbus Children's Hospital--the Central Ohio Poison Center refers callers to their doctors or to an emergency department about 10 percent of the time. The other 90 percent of cases don't usually require a trip to the emergency room and can be treated and monitored right at home with treatment advice provided by poison control professionals. Poison control centers save lives and save money by offering immediate treatment advice. They help keep patients from calling 911 or going to emergency rooms unnecessarily, while offering immediate treatment advice to callers. 
   Throughout the United States each year, more than two million poisonings are reported to poison control centers. More than 90 percent of these poisonings happen in the home, and over 50 percent of poisoning victims are children younger than six years of age. My own personal experience with poison control centers occurred two years ago, when our granddaughter, Isabelle, who was two years old at the time, fell into a bucket of bubble solution as we were wrapping up our annual Ice Cream Social at our home in Cedarville, Ohio. We feared that Isabelle may have swallowed some of the solution, since she was covered with it from head to toe. 
   My sister-in-law, who is a nurse, immediately called the poison control center to determine whether Isabelle had swallowed a poisonous substance. We were very lucky. The professional at the local poison control center told us immediately what to do and explained that we needed to rinse Isabelle off and have her drink several glasses of water to flush the solution through her system. But for the quick response of that local poison control center, we would probably have ended up taking Isabelle to the emergency room needlessly. 
   My friend and colleague from Michigan, Senator ABRAHAM, also had his own personal experience with a poison center. In 1999, he and his wife were at home and spotted their toddler son, Spencer, with an open bottle of allergy medicine. They immediately called the poison center. The Abrahams, too, were very lucky. As it turned out, little Spencer hadn't swallowed more than an ounce, so the poison center staff recommended that his parents just monitor him at home through the night. 
   While poisonings very often affect children, adults also face situations necessitating information and help from  poison control centers. The centers provide services for adults who have been exposed to potentially poisonous or toxic substances. Take the example of what occurred in Marysville, Ohio. Thirty workers in a manufacturing plant in Marysville were victims of gas exposure. Twenty of these workers went to Union Memorial Hospital. The hospital contacted the poison center, after which these patients were given oxygen and later discharged that same day. Ten others went to a different hospital which did not call a poison center. These patients were not released until the next day, even though their symptoms did not differ from the other 20 workers. 
   Because the local poison centers cover a lot of area and handle a large number of exposure cases, they can help identify trends and patterns of exposure which might not otherwise be recognized by individual health care providers. The organized network of poison centers facilitates instant communication of public health concerns, as well as effective methods of treatment. For example, in 1993, an Oregon Poison Center staff member noticed a cluster of symptomatic callers who had all used an aerosol leather protector. Subsequent investigation revealed similar cases in the preceding four days. Immediate notification of other centers confirmed cases in other states. Contact with the manufacturer and subsequent product removal occurred within only four hours. 
   Here's another example: On January 28, 1998, there was a nationwide recall of a popular snack cake due to possible asbestos contamination. This recall resulted in about 1000 calls to one poison center in Ohio, with similar numbers of calls to poison centers in Illinois, Indiana, and Missouri. The poison centers were able to reassure callers about the low toxicity of small oral ingestion of asbestos and referred callers to the company's customer service number. 
   Despite their obvious value, poison control centers have been seriously under-funded. The centers have been financed through unstable arrangements from a variety of public and private sources. Over the last two decades, there has been a steady decline in the number of poison control centers in the United States. In 1978, there were more than 600 poison control centers nationwide. Today, there are fewer than 75--of which, only 53 are certified. Since 1991, six centers in Ohio have closed, leaving only three in current operation. 
   This trend has jeopardized the ability of the remaining poison control centers nationwide to provide immediate, around-the-clock service to all Americans. As a result, more emergency rooms are likely to be visited by anxious parents who fear their children were accidentally poisoned. This is a trend that is increasing the total cost of treating poisonings and increasing the risk of accidental injury or death. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased that my colleagues have agreed to take things to the next level and are providing a substantial investment in these centers. This investment will help bring stability to our nation's poison control centers and bring peace of mind to parents. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Aging Subcommittee I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator SPECTER, for his efforts to address the needs of America's aging population. At this time, I would like to engage the distinguished chairman in a colloquy. 
   Mr. President, there is a lack of understanding of what constitutes the best outreach and professional services for our elderly population. I am pleased to report that Ohio is taking the lead in providing quality health care professionals to the provider community. In particular, the Geriatric Nursing Program at the University of Akron has been recognized as the top such program in the United States. They are most interested in identifying and developing best practices in elder care that can be disseminated nationally for use by other institutions and health care providers. Would you agree that such a program would help improve the overall quality of care of our elderly population?

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee who have worked with me, the Senator from Georgia, Senator COVERDELL; the Senator from Florida, Senator GRAHAM; the Senator from Iowa, Senator GRASSLEY; and so many others on the emergency supplemental provisions contained in the Conference Report to the Fiscal Year 2001 Military Construction Appropriations bill. I am especially pleased that the Conference Report contains essential funds to begin correcting resource and funding shortfalls in the U.S. Coast Guard, and vital assistance needed to reverse the deteriorating situation in Colombia--a situation I would like to discuss in just a few minutes. 
   First, though, let me say a few words about the Coast Guard's current--and precarious--budget situation and how this Conference Report will help keep it afloat--at least for the remainder of this fiscal year. The reality is that our Coast Guard has been forced to cut back on its current services this year and could be forced to cut back even more next year. These reductions make it far more difficult for the Coast Guard to meet its many missions. They put at risk the sustainability of valuable fish stocks in the North Atlantic and Pacific Northwest. They reduce the Coast Guard's capability to stem the flow of illicit drugs and illegal immigration into the United States. And they can work against the Coast Guard's ability to respond quickly to search and rescue situations, which often in fishing grounds and high traffic migrant areas. 
   As early as last February, the Coast Guard began reducing its operating hours in the air and at sea. In some parts of the country, operating hours have been reduced as much as 20 to 30 percent. 
   Fortunately, Mr. President, the Conference Report we passed today will carry the Coast Guard through the current fiscal year. In total, more than $700 million is provided to help restore the Coast Guard's aircraft and vessel spare parts supply; cover the cost of rising fuel prices; pay for rising health care costs and quality of life improvements for Coast Guard personnel; and increase by six its fleet of C-130 aircraft--assets critical to the Coast Guard's counter-drug and search and rescue capabilities. 
   Additionally, the Conference Report includes funding for the replacement of the Great Lakes Ice Breaking vessel--the Mackinaw. As my colleagues from the Great Lakes region know, this replacement vessel is invaluable to avoid disruption of winter-time commerce on the Great Lakes. 
   This legislation is a step in the right direction, but it is only a step. Our Coast Guard still remains seriously underfunded. We must still address the overall funding problems facing the Coast Guard, which is the task that awaits the conferees to the Transportation Appropriations bill. Unless we address this funding crisis, our Coast Guard will be in the exact same boat--no pun 
   intended--year after year. Ultimately, unless we put the Coast Guard under a far more sound financial footing, we risk compromising the entire Coast Guard apparatus, its routine and emergency operations, training and maintenance functions, and even its safety and commercial missions along our coasts and Great Lakes. 
   Not long ago, the Senate approved a Transportation Appropriations bill for the next fiscal year that would fund the Coast Guard's operating expenses at a level $159 million less than what it needs to conduct its missions. Mr. President, I understand the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Transportation Subcommittee had to make some tough choices. They had a smaller budget to work with than their counterparts in the House. In fact, the House had $1.6 billion more in its allocation for the Transportation Appropriations Bill than the Senate. This funding disparity needs to be resolved in the upcoming conference. 
   Mr. President, let me remind my colleagues about the unique importance of the Coast Guard. They are called ``the rescue experts,'' and for good reason. Each year, the Coast Guard responds to 40,000 search and rescue cases and saves 3,800 lives. During the devastation of Hurricane Floyd, the Coast Guard conducted search and rescue missions and delivered drinking water and critical supplies to citizens along the Eastern seaboard. And, following the dramatic floods in North Carolina that resulted from the hurricane, Coast Guard helicopters came in right behind the storm and pulled stranded survivors from rooftops and trees surrounded by the swollen rivers. 
   The Coast Guard's rescue and response missions are often front page news, but often the untold stories are the emergencies prevented by the Coast Guard. Few people realize that before any cruise ship ever touches the ocean, Coast Guard ship inspectors from its Marine Safety Offices inspect each ship to ensure they are built not just for beauty and recreation, but for safety as well. That's good news for the approximately seven million Americans who embark on cruise ships every year. In fact, the Coast Guard doesn't just inspect cruise ships--the Coast Guard inspects all commercial ships, including cargo ships and tankers. 
   Of course, I have spoken on the Senate floor on several occasions to highlight the Coast Guard's extraordinary contributions to keep illegal drugs from ever reaching our shores. The scourge of drugs is the primary security threat within this hemisphere. It is a cancer that destroys civil institutions and erodes the sovereignty of nations in the Caribbean and South and Central America. 
   That is why a number of us here in the Senate and the House worked to provide additional funding in 1998 for the Coast Guard's counter-drug efforts, and that investment has paid off. The following year, the Coast Guard seized 57 tons of cocaine with a street value of $4 billion--that's more than the total operating cost of the Coast Guard.  
   The Coast Guard's law enforcement skills extends as far as the Middle East, where Coast Guard cutters and tactical law enforcement teams enforce the continuing U.N. embargo against Iraq. 
   Perhaps one of the Coast Guard's toughest jobs is the day to day enforcement of U.S. immigration law. It is an emotional and gut wrenching mission. It challenges Coast Guard men and women daily to carry out their responsibilities with due regard for the law, human dignity and, above all, safety of human life. It is a tough job. But, day in and day out, the Coast Guard continues to carry out its duties with professionalism and a never-ending commitment to the people it serves. 
   These are just some of the vital missions that would be undermined if the Coast Guard is not given the resources to sustain its daily operations. In some respects, we have passed that point already. The Coast Guard is at a point that it is essentially cannibalizing equipment for parts, deferring maintenance, and working their people overtime--and this is just to sustain daily operations. This doesn't even take into account the rapidly rising fuel costs, which are exacerbating problems this fiscal year. 
   At the same time, the Coast Guard has to invest in its future. When compared to 41 other maritime agencies around the world, the ships that make up our Coast Guard fleet of cutters are the 38th oldest. Over the past four years, the Coast Guard has had to spend twice as much money to fix equipment and hull problems. This is not surprising because the older the equipment becomes, the harder it is to maintain. As the need for equipment maintenance increases, so too does the cost of operations. This is a problem that is not the result of mismanagement, but from insufficient funding. And that fact is reflected by this Congress having to use emergency supplemental funding for the Coast Guard two straight years just to sustain normal operations. I think you would agree, Mr. President, that this kind of stop-gap funding process is not the best way to keep an organization running--particularly one of such vital importance to our nation. 
   I urge the conferees to the Transportation Appropriations bill, in both the House and Senate, to keep these facts in mind as they proceed to conference. Again, the bill we have passed today is a good first step, but it is only that--a step. 
   Today, the United States Congress took a very important and necessary step toward bringing stability to countries in our hemisphere, and communities in our own country that are caught in the death grip of drug trafficking. 
   Today, we are sending to the President more than just an assistance package to Colombia--we are sending a blueprint of a partnership with Colombia and other countries in the hemisphere to reduce illegal drug production and distribution. This is partnership among democracies in our hemisphere. 
   No one denies that an emergency exists in Colombia. The country is embroiled in a destabilizing and brutal civil war--a civil war that has gone on for decades with a death toll estimated at 35,000. The once promising democracy is now a war zone. Human rights abuses abound and rule of law is practically non-existent. 
   The situation in Colombia today bears little resemblance to a nation once considered to be a democratic success story. But today, the drug trade has threatened the sovereignty of the Colombian democracy and the continued prosperity and security of our entire hemisphere. And, tragically, America's drug habit is what's fueling this threat in our hemisphere. It is our own country's drug use that is causing the instability and violence in Colombia and in the Andean region. When drug deals are made on the streets of our country, they represent a contribution to continued violence in Colombia and in the Andean region. 
   The sad fact is that the cultivation of coca in Colombia has doubled from over 126,000 acres in 1995 to 300,000 in 1999. Not surprisingly, as drug availability has increased in the United States, drug use among adolescents also has increased. To make matters worse, the Colombian insurgents see the drug traffickers as a financial partner who will sustain their illicit cause, which only makes the FARC and the ELN grow stronger. 
   A synergistic relationship has evolved between the drug dealers and the guerrillas--a relationship bonded by the money made selling drugs here in the United States. Each one benefits from the other. Each one takes care of the other. This is not a crisis internal to Colombia. It is a crisis driven by those who consume drugs in our country, and a crisis that directly impacts all of us right here in the United States. 
   It is a crisis that has flourished in part because the current Administration made a significant and unwise policy change in its drug control strategy in 1993. When President George Bush left the White House, we were spending approximately one-quarter of our total federal anti-drug budget on international drug interdiction--spending it either on law enforcement in other countries, on Customs, on the DEA, on crop eradication--basically on stopping drugs from ever reaching our shores. 
   After six years of the Clinton presidency, that one-quarter was reduced to approximately 13 to 14 percent, a dramatic reduction in the percentage of money we were spending on international drug interdiction. 
   Fortunately, in the last few years, Congress has had the foresight to recognize the escalating threats in Colombia, and has worked to restore our drug fighting capability outside our borders. In 1998, Congress passed the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act (WHDEA), which not only has begun to restore our international eradication, interdiction and crop alternative development capabilities, it contained the first substantial investment in Colombia for counter-narcotics activities in almost a decade. 
   Today, we are building on that effort with a more focused plan to eliminate drugs at the source and to reduce the financial influence of drug trafficking organizations on the paramilitaries and insurgents within Colombia. In short, Mr. President, we are reversing the direction of our drug policy for the better. Congress saw what the Administration was doing. We said the policy has to change; we need to put more money into interdiction and source country programs; and that's exactly what we did. 
   We must not lose sight of why we are providing this assistance. The bottom line is this: The assistance package we put together because Colombia is our neighbor--and what affects our neighbors affects us too. We have a very real interest in stabilizing Colombia and keeping it democratic and keeping it as a trading partner, and keeping its drugs off our streets. 
   As we consider the great human tragedy that Colombia is today, we must not lose sight of the fact that the resources we are providing to Colombia now are an effort to stop drugs from ever coming into our country in the future. And ultimately, the emergency aid package is in the best interest of the Colombia-Andean region. It is in the best interest of the United States. And, it is clearly something we had to do.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend and colleague from Connecticut, Senator DODD, in introducing the Children's Research Protection Act. This bill is a logical and  necessary follow-up to the Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, which Senator DODD and I got passed and enacted into law in 1997 as part of the FDA Modernization Act. This law created incentives for drug manufacturers for use by children. Since the law has been in place, more children than ever before are participating in clinical trials for drug testing. 
   Mr. President, it is imperative that we test drugs for children--on children. There are several reasons that such testing is necessary. Children have different physical make-ups from adults, which means they metabolize drugs differently. They likely need different doses and different amounts of time between doses for medications to be safe and effective. Also, because the same disease can manifest itself very differently in children and adults, we need to thoroughly test the drugs that we are using for children to treat the same illness. 
   As I noted already, since our Better Pharmaceuticals Act was enacted, we have seen a rapid increase in the number of children being enrolled in clinical trials. More than 18,000 children will be needed just for the 300 studies that have been proposed so far. Research has been completed and exclusivity granted on 22 drugs that were previously used for children without safety information, and more than 300 pediatric studies of 127 products are currently underway. Of those 22 drugs for which studies have been completed, eight drugs have already been re-labeled to reflect, the new pediatric safety information. 
   In contrast, in the five years prior to enactment of our Better Pharmaceuticals Act, only 11 studies to gather additional pediatric safety information about drugs already on the market were conducted--that's 11 studies in five years versus over 125 in just two years since this legislation was enacted. The increase in pediatric studies is good news for children and parents and is certainly a welcome improvement at a time when only one in five drugs currently on the market in the United States has been approved for use by children. 
   While we want to encourage better drug testing for children, we also need to ensure that strong federal protections are in place to protect children who participate in such research. Tragically, there are parts of the current law that do not protect children who participate in HHS federally-regulated research, unless it is also federally funded research. These federal protections for children also have not been updated since 1981, and have not been adopted by all of the federal agents that conduct research involving children. 
   That's why the Children's Research Protection Act we are introducing would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to review the current regulations governing the protection of children participating in research and update them to ensure that the strongest federal protections exist for such children. 
   Now, only HHS federally funded and federally regulated research has to comply with certain protections for children. 
   Our bill also would extend research protections for children to all research regulated by the Secretary of HHS, even if it is not federally funded. 
   Furthermore, our bill would require that all other federal agencies that conduct, support, or regulate research involving children must adopt regulations to provide greater protections for those children. 
   Finally, our bill would address the shortage of pediatric clinical pharmacologists whose specialized expertise is essential in performing pediatric studies, because the bill would authorize grants to ensure that an adequate number of pediatric clinical pharmacologists and clinical investigators are trained and retained to meet the increased demand for expertise created by the Better Pharmaceuticals law. There are fewer than 200 academic-based clinical pharmacologists in the United States, of whom 20 percent are pediatricians. Moreover, the bill would authorize the Secretary of HHS to enter into loan repayment contracts with doctors who agree to train and practice in pediatric pharmacology. 
   Mr. President, it is very important that we pass our legislation this year. While we have successfully encouraged better drug testing for children through the incentives in the ``Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act,'' we must take the next step and ensure that strong federal protections are in place to protect the children who participate in such research. 
   The children who are participating in clinical trials are medical pioneers. They will help to ensure that drugs used for children will be proven to be safe and appropriate for use in children. At the very least, we should make certain that strong federal safeguards exist to ensure their safety as they participate in these trials.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the Child Handgun Injury Prevention Act being introduced by my friend and colleague from Massachusetts, Senator KERRY. I support this bill because I believe it will save lives. 
   Recently, we have all witnessed a disturbing trend. Day after day after day, we see shocking news reports about children dying because they got their hands on a loaded, unlocked firearm. In 1999 alone, this was an almost daily occurrence. Last year, more than 300 children died in gun accidents. Most of these accidents occurred in a child's own home, or in the home of a close friend or relative--the very places where these children should feel the safest. 
   Mr. President, the mixture of children and loaded firearms is deadly. An estimated 3.3 million children in the United States live in homes with firearms--firearms that are always or sometimes loaded and unlocked. I believe that the majority of parents with firearms believe they are being responsible about gun storage and other safety measures dealing with firearms. But, the sad fact is that some parents simply have a fundamental misunderstanding of a child's ability to access and fire a gun, to distinguish between real and toy guns, to make good judgments about handling a gun, and to consistently follow rules about gun safety. These are children, after all, and we can't expect them to understand completely what is involved with handling a gun safely. 
   Here's a startling fact: Nearly two-thirds of parents with school-age children who keep a gun in the home believe that the firearm is safe from their children. However, another study found that when a gun was in the home, 75 to 80 percent of first and second graders knew where the gun was kept. 
   Many gun owners, state and local governments, as well as this Senate, have started to recognize the combustible relationship between children and loaded, accessible firearms. This recognition has led many gun owners to purchase gun safety locks to ensure the safe storage of their handguns. In some states, gun locks are required at the time handguns are purchased. Seventeen states have Child Firearm Access Prevention laws that permit prosecution of adults if their firearm is left unsecured and a child uses that firearm to harm themselves or others. And, also, the Senate passed an amendment to the juvenile justice bill last year that would require the use of gun safety locks. 
   Despite the fact that gun owners are buying more firearm safety devices and governments are rushing to mandate their use, surprisingly there are no minimum safety standards for these devices. Currently, there are many different types of trigger locks, safety locks, lock boxes, and other devices available. And, there is a wide range in the quality and effectiveness of these devices. Some are inadequate to prevent the accidental discharge of the firearm or to prevent a child access to the firearm. 
   As governments move toward mandated safety devices, it is crucial that consumers know whether or not the devices they are buying will actually keep children from harming themselves. If states are going to prosecute adults when a child uses a firearm, these gun owners should--at the very  least--have some peace of mind that their gun storage or safety lock device is adequate. 
   The legislation I am introducing today with Senator KERRY would help responsible gun owners and parents know that the safety devices they buy are at least minimally adequate. This legislation just makes sense. It requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to formulate minimum safety standards for gun safety locks and to ensure that only adequate locks meeting those standards are available for purchase by consumers. The standards to be used by the Commission require that gun safety locks are sufficiently difficult for children to deactivate or remove and that the safety locks prevent the discharge of the handgun unless the lock has been deactivated or removed. 
   Mr. President, I would also like to note what this bill does not do. First of all, it does not give CPSC any say in standards of firearms or ammunition. In other words, it is not intended to regulate firearms, themselves, in any way whatsoever. Second, it would not mandate which type of gun lock device consumers use. 
   As I said earlier, there are many different types of gun locks currently available. Some of these allow for easy access and use of firearms for adults should they decide that is important to them. Other devices are more cumbersome and do not provide quick and easy access. Gun owners would be free to decide what device is best for them. This legislation would have no effect on that issue. Finally, this legislation does not require the use of gun safety locks. While the Senate has already passed legislation to do this, if that language is removed in conference, this legislation will not affect that. 
   As I have stated already, Mr. President, I believe that this legislation will save lives. But, more than that, this legislation will empower parents--parents who decide that they want to have a gun safety lock but are awash in a sea of different devices--to purchase only gun safety locks that provide adequate protection for their children. I urge my colleagues to join Senator KERRY and me in support of this bill.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for increased funding for Community Health Centers. These health centers offer much-needed primary and preventative health care services to hundreds of medically underserved urban and rural communities across our country. 
   Currently, the Labor, Health and Education Appropriations bill before us would provide $100 million in Budget Year 2001 for these health centers. The amendment I have cosponsored with Senator BOND and Senator HOLLINGS would provide an additional $50 million, bringing the total investment to $150 million. This amendment, Mr. President, is very important. It deserves the Senate's support. There are millions of Americans who rely on Community Health Centers for their health care needs. We have an obligation to ensure that those necessary services are not interrupted due to a lack of sufficient federal funds. 
   The value of the services provided by these health centers becomes quite apparent when you consider that right now there are at least 44 million uninsured people in our nation; and of those 44 million people, Mr. President, 4 million of them receive health services from Community Health Centers. When you combine the uninsured with the under-insured, that total rises to 10 million--yes, Mr. President--10 million patients who look to these centers for health care. 
   In my own home state of Ohio, the Third Street Community Clinic in Mansfield and the Neighborhood Family Practice in Cleveland, for example, are just two of the 69 Community Health Centers that serve more than 200,000 Ohioans each year. In just the first three months of this year, Ohio's Community Health Centers medically treated more than 29,000 uninsured people, of whom more than 31 percent--nearly one-third--were children under 18 years of age. 
   These health centers provide critical health services to those who would otherwise not have access to health care providers. The centers offer prenatal care to uninsured or under-insured pregnant moms, and by doing so, are working to prevent undue adverse risks to the health of unborn babies. The health centers also provide immunizations so that young children can continue to be healthy, even those that live in medically underserved urban or rural areas. 
   And, in practical terms, by providing these and other types of primary and preventive care, Community Health Centers save Medicare and Medicaid dollars, because these services significantly reduce the need for hospital stays and emergency room visits. 
   The value of Community Health Centers should not be underestimated--nor should they be underfunded. The challenge we face today is that we have to make sure funding keeps pace with the growing numbers of Americans who will be in need of the health care services provided by these centers. To keep pace with this rapid growth, the overall budget for Community Health Centers will need to increase from $1 billion to $2 billion by Fiscal Year 2005. This $1 billion increase would enable the health centers to provide care to an additional six to ten million people. 
   Because of the pressing need to increase funding, I am also a cosponsor of Senator BOND's REACH Initiative, which is the ``Resolution to Expand Access to Community Health Care.'' This important Initiative would double the federal contribution for Community Health Centers over the next five years. And, the Bond/Hollings amendment to the Labor, Health, and Education Appropriations bill before us now would keep us on track of meeting this five-year plan by increasing this year's $100 million allocation to $150 million. 
   I commend my colleagues from Missouri and South Carolina for their amendment and for their tireless commitment to Community Health Centers. I urge the rest of my colleagues to support this important amendment.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am troubled--deeply troubled. I am troubled by a report in the Washington Post that--yet again--illustrates Germany's reluctance to return American  children who have been kidnapped by a parent and taken to Germany. The Post article details the latest event in the continuing international struggle that American Joseph Cooke has endured as he seeks the return of his children. As my colleagues may recall, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder recently promised President Clinton during the President's visit to Europe that Germany would help Mr. Cooke and grant him and his family visitation rights. Well, despite this promise at the highest levels government, the Kostanz Special Service for Foster Children now is limiting the access that Joseph Cooke's mother has to visiting her grandchildren--apparently as a punishment for all the recent media attention the case has received. This is outrageous, Mr. President. And it simply cannot be tolerated. 
   Let me take a moment to review the events that have led to where we are today on this issue. At the recent European conference on ``Modern Governance in the 21st Century,'' President Clinton met with Chancellor Schroeder to discuss several pressing international concerns. One issue, in particular--one I had urged President Clinton to raise with the Chancellor--was the tragic situation of U.S. children being abducted by a parent and taken to Germany. 
   It was necessary to raise this issue with Chancellor Schroeder because parents--and not just American parents, either--have had a very difficult time getting their children back when they have been abducted and taken to Germany. Although Germany has signed the Hague Convention, our ally--yes, our ally--has not taken their obligations under the Convention seriously. In fact, from 1990 to 1998, only 22 percent of American children for whom Hague applications were filed were returned to the United States from Germany--and that percentage includes those who were voluntarily returned by the abducting parent. 
   Last month, I spoke on the floor about the Joseph Cooke case--a case that illustrates perfectly Germany's reluctance to return kidnapped children. In Mr. Cooke's case, his wife took their two children to Germany, and without his knowledge, turned them over to the German Youth Authority. Despite Mr. Cooke's desperate attempts to get his children back, a German court decided that they were better off with a German foster family than with their American father. Only after President Clinton's meeting with Chancellor Schroeder and only after Mr. Cooke's case received considerable publicity and media attention, did Germany agree to help Joseph Cooke. 
   The Germans promised to allow Mr. Cooke and his family visitation with his children. The Germans also promised to form a working group with the United States to examine pending abduction cases. Chancellor Schroeder agreed to ``think about organizational and institutional consequences to be taken'' to speed up the German court process and make changes in German law to allow visitation rights for those parents previously prevented from seeing their children at all. Although the Chancellor acknowledged that it would be difficult to reverse German custody decisions, he assured President Clinton that this soon-to-be-created commission would work on providing the so-called left-behind parents access to their children. 
   But now, as the Washington Post reports, Germany is restricting visitation of the Cooke children's American grandmother from open, six-hour visits to supervised, two-hour visits in a psychologist's office. We must take a very tough stance against this, Mr. President. We must judge Germany by its recent actions--not its recent words--recent, empty words. We must hold Germany to its promises and see to it their government matches words with deeds and returns every single American child. 
   Given Germany's reversal on the visitation agreement, I am even more skeptical now about the sincerity of Germany's commitment to return kidnapped children. I say that partly because German officials have repeatedly blamed their non-compliance on the independence of their judiciary system. They say that they are reluctant to challenge court rulings because the courts are separate and independent from the parliament. Chancellor Schroeder even likened such interference to the days of Nazi Germany, when he told a German newspaper that: ``We have always fought for the well-being of the children to be at the core of divorce and custody cases. That is the only standard. The times 
   in which Germany would routinely change the decisions of the courts [during the Nazi era] are over, thank God'' (Reuters, 6/1/00). 
   I find that argument very interesting since the United States has a very independent judiciary branch, yet we return children in 90% of all international abduction cases. And, our return rate of German children, specifically, is equally high. Even according to the German Justice Ministry's own figures, from 1995 to 1999, there were 116 cases of German parents demanding children back from the United States. Of those cases, the U.S. courts refused to return the children in only four cases. During those same five-years, there were 165 known cases in which a parent living in the United States wanted his or her children returned from Germany. Yet, in 33 of those cases, German courts declined to return the children (AP Worldstream, 6/2/00). 
   Mr. President, I am also concerned about Germany's offer to create a ``working group'' with the United States given the result of a similar promise Germany made to France. French President Jacques Chirac, who has characterized Germany as applying ``the law of the jungle'' in abduction cases (The London Evening Standard, 6/1/00), repeatedly asked Germany to address the difficulty his country is having in getting French children returned. In response, Chancellor Schroeder agreed to create a ``working group'' between the two nations to reach some resolution. While this working group was created a year ago, results have yet to come in on its effectiveness. Given France's experience, it is crucial that we hold Chancellor Schroeder to his word and see to it that his words are not just empty promises made in an attempt to improve a tarnished image in the international community. 
   Assistant Secretary of State for consular affairs, Mary Ryan will be in Germany this weekend where, according to the Washington Post, ``she will be raising this specific issue with every person she meets in the German government.'' I am encouraged to see that our State Department has indicated that it is outraged by Germany's action--perhaps now, they will take these kinds of cases seriously and take some type of significant action against Germany. Never-the-less, I urge her and our State Department and President Clinton to not take Germany's broken promises lightly. We must insist that the Germans reverse these restrictions on visitation, otherwise there is absolutely no reason to set up the commission. 
   Mr. President, we cannot tolerate lip service from our allies. We must hold the German government's feet to the fire. No excuses should be accepted by the parents of these children, nor by this Senate, nor by this Congress, nor by the American people. This must be a priority.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today Senators KOHL, SPECTER, LEAHY, GRASSLEY, FEINGOLD, and I have introduced the ``No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act of 2000'', NOPEC. We do so to address the long-standing problem of foreign governments acting in the commercial arena to fix, allocate, and establish production and price levels of petroleum products. 
   More than two months ago, Senators SPECTER, KOHL, THURMOND, SCHUMER, Biden, and I sent a letter to the President asking him to seriously consider legal action to put an end to the cartel behavior of OPEC nations. The White House has failed to take any action,  and it appears that there are some within the Administration who believe there may be legal stumbling blocks to such a lawsuit. During the time in which the Administration has failed to take action, we have witnessed gas prices begin to rise again. Most notable are the unexplainable, sharp price increases in several Midwestern states. These price increases have harmed many in Ohio and across the Midwest. There is no relief in sight. Many are speculating about the cause of the price-spikes. One cause is indisputable--the unacceptably high price of imported crude oil set by the OPEC cartel. 
   Nation after nation has adopted antitrust enforcement principles that recognize the illegality of price fixing and other restraints of trade. Yet OPEC is undeterred, and continues to flout broadly accepted legal principles and artificially restrains the production of oil. It is time for internationally recognized principles of competition to operate in the oil and petroleum industry--just as they do in other markets. 
   The purpose of NOPEC is simple and straightforward. It makes clear that the U.S. enforcement agencies may bring antitrust enforcement actions against foreign states which violate antitrust laws in the production and sale of oil and other petroleum products, and it establishes that the district courts have jurisdiction and authority to consider such cases. 
   NOPEC does this by amending the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, ``FSIA''. Under FSIA, the governmental activities of foreign governments are immune from the jurisdiction of the federal courts. A lower federal court has ruled--we believe erroneously--that the conduct of OPEC nations in relation to oil production and exportation are governmental, not commercial activities, and thus immune. NOPEC corrects this ruling, and clarifies the law, specifically removing immunity from foreign governments when they are engaged in the limitation of the production or distribution of oil and other petroleum products. NOPEC also makes clear that the federal courts should not decline to make a determination on the merits of an action brought under NOPEC based on the ``act of state'' doctrine. 
   This legislation will send a strong signal to OPEC nations that their agreements restrain trade and harm American consumers. This will no longer be accepted. Our legislation will allow the U.S. enforcement agencies to do their jobs and enforce the antitrust laws.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise in reluctant opposition to this amendment that has been offered by my friend and colleague from Minnesota. I commend him for his commitment to drug use reduction. He and I serve on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. We have worked on a number of bills having to do with this very topic, including the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program. 
   Ultimately, however, this amendment is, I am afraid, attempting to reallocate resources from one part of our antidrug strategy to another. The amendment raises important questions about the effectiveness of our entire strategy and opens, I believe, an important and necessary discussion about our drug control policy in this country. 
   The sad fact is that since almost the beginning of the last decade, our antidrug strategy has not worked. More children are abusing drugs, and with an abundant supply, drug traffickers are seeking to increase their sales by targeting children ages 10, 11, 12, and 13. This is certainly an assault on the future of our children, an assault on our families, and an assault on the future of our country. This is nothing less than a threat to our national values and, yes, a threat to our national security. 
   All of this, though, begs the question: What are we doing wrong? Clearly, there is not one simple answer. However, in 1998, a bipartisan group of Senators--myself; the Senator from Georgia, Mr. COVERDELL; the Senator from Florida, Mr. GRAHAM; the Senator from Iowa, Mr. GRASSLEY; and the Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN--worked together to deal with this problem. We came to the conclusion that our overall drug strategy simply was no longer balanced. I want to talk about this because I am afraid what my colleague is doing is not helpful as we attempt to balance our antidrug strategy. 
   We have been working together since 1998 to restore that balance. The emergency assistance antidrug package for Colombia contained in this bill is part of that effort to restore this balance, but even with this, we still have a long way to go. 
   The fact is, to be effective, our national drug strategy must have a strong commitment in three different areas: No. 1 is demand reduction which consists of prevention, treatment, and education. The Federal Government in this area shares responsibility to reduce that demand, along with State and local governments, local community groups, nonprofit organizations, and families. 
   When you are dealing with education, when you are dealing with treatment, you are dealing with something that is a shared responsibility between the Federal Government and the local communities. 
   The second component is domestic law enforcement. Again, in this area, it is a shared responsibility among the Federal Government, the local communities, and the States. Again, the Federal Government has a shared responsibility to use law enforcement resources, along with the State and local governments, to detect and dismantle drug trafficking operations within our borders. 
   We witnessed a successful return on that investment last week on what was called Operation Tar Pit, when the Justice Department announced it had worked with State and local law enforcement agencies in 12 cities, including 2 in the State of Ohio, to dismantle  a major Mexican heroin trafficking organization. They did a great job, in a coordinated effort. 
   The third component in any successful antidrug strategy is international eradication and international interdiction. This is the sole responsibility of the Federal Government. States can't help. Local communities can't help. We are the only ones who can do this. I am afraid my colleague's amendment strikes directly at our attempt to do this. 
   Like our national defense and immigration policies, only the Federal Government has the authority, only the Federal Government has the responsibility to keep drugs from ever crossing our borders. If we do not do it, no one else will. No one else can. The buck stops in this Chamber. 
   These three components are all interdependent. We need to have them all. A strong investment in each is necessary for them to work individually and to work collectively. 
   For example, a strong effort to destroy or seize drugs at the source or outside the United States both reduces the amount of drugs in the country and drives up the street price. As we all know, higher prices do in fact reduce consumption. This, in turn, helps our domestic law enforcement and demand-reduction efforts. 
   As any football fan knows, a winning team is one that plays well at all three phases of the sport: Offense, defense, and the special teams. The same is true with our antidrug strategy. All three components have to be supported if our strategy is to be a winning one. 
   While I think the current administration has shown a clear commitment to demand-reduction and domestic law enforcement programs, the same, sadly, cannot be said for our international eradication and interdiction components. This was not always the case. 
   I think these charts I have will show how our commitment has changed. 
   In 1987, a $4.79 billion Federal drug control budget was divided as follows: 29 percent for demand-reduction programs, 38 percent for domestic law enforcement, and 33 percent--one-third--for international eradication and interdiction efforts. This is the way it should be. This is a balanced program. This is what we had in 1987. 
   Now we fast forward to 1995, and you will see that this balance goes out of whack. We no longer had that balance. We no longer had that balance today. 
   The balanced approach worked. It achieved real success. 
   Limiting drug availability through interdiction drove up the street price of drugs, reduced drug purity levels, and as a result reduced overall drug use. 
   From 1988 to 1991, total drug use declined by 13 percent, cocaine use dropped by 35 percent, and overall drug use by American adolescents dropped by 25 percent--results. We began to see results. 
   This balanced approach, however, ended in 1993. By 1995, the $13.3 billion national drug control budget was divided as follows: 35 percent for demand reduction, 53 percent for domestic law enforcement, but only 12 percent for international interdiction efforts. International interdiction efforts have gone down to 12 percent from 33 percent. 
   Though the overall antidrug budget increased almost threefold from 1987 to 1995, the percentage allocated for international eradication and interdiction efforts decreased dramatically. This disruption only recently has started to change. 
   We have put together, on the floor of the Senate and in the House of Representatives, a bipartisan group--a bipartisan group of Senators--who have said: We cannot have this imbalance. We must begin to restore the balance we had a few years ago in 1987. We have to do it. 
   Let me go forward, if I may, to this current budget year, the budget year 2000. In the budget year 2000, 34 percent has been allocated for demand reduction, 51 percent for domestic law enforcement, and 14.4 percent for international interdiction efforts. 
   We are slowly moving in the right direction. Even in this year's budget we have a long way to go, with only 14.4 percent for international interdiction efforts. We have more work to do, more work, such as the assistance package for the Colombians that we are debating on the floor today. But we are starting to see some modest progress. 
   But what really matters is what these numbers get you, what they buy us as a country, what they buy in terms of resources. The hard truth is that our drug interdiction presence--the ships, the air, and the manpower dedicated to keeping drugs from reaching our country--has eroded dramatically over the course of the last decade. We are just now starting to restore those valuable resources. 
   In fact, with the modest improvements we have made in our international drug fighting capability, we have seen progress. In 1999, for example, the U.S. Coast Guard seized 57 tons of cocaine with a street value of $4 billion. By the way, that is more than the total operational costs of the Coast Guard. These operations demonstrate we can make a big difference, a very big difference, if we provide the right levels of material and the right levels of manpower to fight drug trafficking. It worked before. It can work again. 
   The emergency assistance package we are talking about today, along with investments included in the Senate-passed military construction appropriations bill, is designed to build on that success. The amendment of the Senator from Minnesota, while it is very well intentioned, simply, effectively robs Peter to pay Paul just as Paul is getting back on his feet again. Just look at the example I mentioned earlier. 
   Through my visits to the Caribbean, Colombia, and Peru in the last several years, I have seen firsthand the dramatic decline in our eradication and interdiction capability. The results of this decline have been a decline in cocaine seizures, a decline in the price of cocaine, and an increase in drug use in the United States. 
   We have to turn this around. This is why we need emergency assistance to Colombia. We need to dedicate more resources for international efforts to help reverse this trend. We have to restore the balance. 
   I want to make it very clear, as I have time and time again, that I strongly support our continued commitment to demand reduction and to law enforcement programs in the United States. No one is a stronger supporter of these. It has to be a balanced program where we have money for treatment, where we have money for education, where we have money for domestic interdiction and law enforcement. 
   My concern is not that this amendment is not well intentioned, not that we should not be putting more resources in this area. My concern is what this does to the other side of the component, and that is international drug interdiction. 
   Let me make it clear. We do need this balanced program. I believe that reducing demand is the only real way to permanently end illegal drug use. However, this is not going to happen overnight. That is why we need a comprehensive counterdrug strategy that addresses all components of this problem. 
   Let me say again, if the United States does not make an effort to stop drugs before they reach our borders, no one else will. It is the Federal Government's responsibility. I remind my colleagues that our antidrug efforts here at home are done in cooperation with a vast number of public and private interests. Only the Federal Government has the ability and the responsibility to help deal with the problem at the source level overseas. Only the Federal Government has the ability to stop drugs in the transit routes. This is our responsibility; the buck stops with us. 
   It is not only an issue of responsibility. It also is an issue of leadership. The United States has to demonstrate leadership on an international level, especially in our own hemisphere, if we expect to get the full cooperation of source countries where the drugs originate, countries such as Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, as well as countries in the transit zones, including Mexico and Haiti. 
   In conclusion, ultimately what we are striving for is a balanced, effective antidrug strategy. I agree with the Senator from Minnesota; we can and should do more to reduce demand but not at the expense of our sole responsibility to stop drugs abroad. That would not result in the balanced approach we are looking for today. That is what we need to aim for, balance and effectiveness. It worked before; I believe it can work again.  
   If my colleague from Kentucky will indulge me, I will respond to a couple comments that have been made by my colleague from Minnesota. This bill is full of human rights, if I may say it that way. It is full of attempts by the U.S. Government to condition the money we send to Colombia and the money that will be spent in the antidrug effort. We have doubled the money for human rights monitoring. We have established conditions before the money can be released, including the fact that human rights violations must be prosecuted in civilian courts pursuant to Colombia law; troops will be vetted for abuse. 
   Ultimately, the question my colleague from Minnesota is raising is a fundamental question: Will we back away from our responsibilities in this hemisphere--our responsibility to a fellow democracy, our responsibility to our own citizens to protect us from drugs coming from Colombia into the United States? Will we back away from that, wash our hands of it and say we don't want to get involved in this, or will we become involved only in the sense that we condition the money that we send to Colombia on very tough conditions, great respect for human rights, and see what we can do in that arena? 
   I think we are better off staying. We can have more impact; we can have more influence; and it is the right thing to do. It is in our national interest. With this bill, my colleague from Kentucky brings to the floor a balanced approach, a logical approach, an approach that is very concerned about human rights, a bill that is concerned about our obligations to ourselves and our obligations in this hemisphere. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, we will be voting in just a few moments in regard to the Gorton amendment. I rise to talk about the bill but also to oppose, with due respect, the Gorton amendment. 
   What is at the heart of this debate on the emergency aid package to Colombia, the very essence of why we need to help restore stability in Colombia and help combat the violent insurgents, is the urgent need to keep drugs off our streets in the United States and out of the hands of our children. That is what this debate is all about; that is what this vote on the amendment is all about. 
   As my colleagues know, this emergency package would provide $934 million to support Colombian efforts to eliminate drugs at the source, improve human rights programs, improve rule of law programs, and increase economic development. The fact is, there is an emergency in our neighbor to the south, in the country of Colombia. This country, this democracy, is embroiled in a destabilizing and brutal civil war, a civil war that has gone on for decades with a death toll reaching at least 35,000.  
   Today, we have heard a lot of speeches about human rights abuses in Colombia and what has taken place in the past. In that context, I remind my colleagues of the fact the current aid package that the Senator from Kentucky has put together is based on legislation Senators COVERDELL, GRASSLEY, GRAHAM, and I introduced last fall, which was developed with the protection of human rights in mind. It is an integral part of this bill. Our colleagues have a right to be concerned with past human rights abuses. The way to deal with this is through the conditions that are written all through this bill. 
   My office met with numerous human rights organizations. We worked closely with Senator LEAHY's office, and many others, to ensure that safeguards were put in place to prevent U.S. assistance from being used by those in Colombia who do not respect human rights. 
   Many of those original provisions have been incorporated into the package before us, such as funds to monitor the use of U.S. assistance by the Colombian armed forces and Colombian national police; funds to support efforts to investigate and prosecute members of both the armed forces and the paramilitary organizations involved in human rights abuses. It also contains funds to address the social and economic needs of the displaced population in Colombia. 
   Our provisions were not only developed to punish human rights abuses in Colombia but, more importantly, they were developed to prevent those abuses. 
   The fact is that this Congress places such a strong emphasis on the protection of human rights that the legislation before us today would provide more funding for human rights--$25 million to be exact--than was in the President's requested budget. It is more than the President requested. 
   This Congress is committed to the protection of human rights and will continue to monitor the assistance we provide to ensure that every penny is used for its intended purpose, which is the respect for and protection of human rights. 
   Many of us on the floor today, and those watching in their offices, have spent a lot of time and energy to expel communism and bring democracy to this hemisphere and to bring a rule of law and human rights protection to this hemisphere. The 1980s were a true success story for the ideals we believe in and for our attempt to spread those ideals and beliefs in democracy throughout this great hemisphere. The people of this hemisphere paid a very heavy price, but I think that price was worth paying to achieve the spread of democracy throughout the hemisphere. We brought democracy and we brought opportunity to our neighbors. 
   Today, the drug trade--not communism--is now the dominant threat to peace and freedom in the Americas. It threatens the sovereignty of the Colombian democracy and the continued prosperity and security of our entire hemisphere. Tragically, our own drug habit--America's drug habit--is what is fueling this threat in our hemisphere. It is our own country's drug use that is causing the instability and violence in Colombia and in the Andean region. 
   The sad fact is that the cultivation of coca in Colombia has doubled, from over 126,000 acres in 1995 to 300,000 in 1999. Poppy cultivation also has grown to such an extent that it is now the source of the majority of heroin consumed in the United States. Not surprisingly, as drug availability has increased in the United States, drug use among adolescents has also increased. To make matters worse, the Colombian insurgents see the drug traffickers as a financial partner who will sustain their illicit cause, which only makes the FARC and ELN--these guerrillas--grow stronger and stronger day by day. So the sale of drugs in the United States today not only promotes the drug business, but it also fuels the antidemocratic insurgents in Colombia. 
   Some may ask, why does Colombia matter? Why are we taking good tax dollars to help our neighbors to the south? I think the answer is simple. It matters because Colombia is shipping their drugs into the United States. It matters because the drug trade is a source of rampant lawlessness and violence within Colombia itself--violence and lawlessness, which has destabilized that country and now threatens the entire Andean region. 
   Fortunately, in the last few years, Congress has had the foresight to recognize the escalating threats, and we have been working to restore our drug-fighting capability beyond our shores. Many of us who have worked very tirelessly on the Colombian assistance package this year also worked together just a few short years ago to pass the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act, which is now the law of the land. This 3-year plan is designed to restore international eradication, interdiction, and crop alternative development funding. With this law, which we passed on a bipartisan basis, we have already made a $800 million downpayment--$200 million of which represents the first substantial investment in Colombia for counternarcotics activities. 
   The emergency assistance package that we have before us this afternoon is based on a blueprint that Senator COVERDELL and I developed and introduced last October--3 months before the administration unveiled its proposal. As our plan, the emergency assistance package the Senator from Kentucky has crafted goes beyond counternarcotics assistance and crop alternative development programs in Colombia. It goes beyond Colombia and targets other Latin-American countries, including Bolivia, Peru, Panama, and Ecuador. 
   This regional approach is the only approach, it is the right approach, and it is critical. Both Peru and Bolivia have made enormous progress in reducing drug cultivation in their respective countries, and they have done it with the help, candidly, of our assistance, and it has worked. Now, an emphasis only on the Colombian drug problems risks the obvious ``spillover'' effect of Colombia's drug trade shifting to adjacent countries in the region. 
   Some of my colleagues have taken the floor today to express hesitancy and reluctance and opposition to this assistance package. I wish to take a moment to direct my comments specifically to them and specifically to some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle. 
   Our Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act was an attempt to change the direction of our national drug policy--a drug policy that clearly was not working. We took that first step. Today, we must take the second step. We passed that very important legislation because we had to; we had to because the current administration, unfortunately, had presided over the literal dismantling of our international drug-fighting capability. 
   Let me explain. When President George Bush left the White House, we were spending approximately one-quarter of our total Federal antidrug budget on international drug interdiction, either on law enforcement in other countries, on our own Customs, on the DEA, and on crop eradication. Basically, it was taking that huge chunk of the Federal antidrug budget and spending it to try to stop drugs from ever reaching our shores. It was a balanced approach and it made sense. 
   After 6 years of the Clinton Presidency, that percentage of our budget--that one-quarter of our total budget--was reduced to 13 to 14 percent, which is a dramatic reduction in the percentage of money we are spending on international drug interdiction. 
   That is why many of us in this body--on a bipartisan basis, in both the House and here in the Senate--worked to pass the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. Speaker HASTERT, before he was Speaker, played a major role in working on the House version of this bill, as did many, many others. 
   We passed that bill. It became law. It has made a difference. We have begun to at least reverse the direction of our foreign policy. We need to get back to that balanced approach, where we spend money on international interdiction, domestic law enforcement, treatment, and education. It has to be a balanced approach. 
   We passed the bill, it became law, and we started to reverse that policy. The initiative for that came, quite candidly, from this side of the aisle, with support from the other side of the aisle. We saw what the administration was doing and we said that the policy had to change. We said we needed to put more money into interdiction, and that is exactly what we did. We said, candidly, we needed a balanced policy  and we began to move in that direction. Now, today, we need to build on that effort. 
   We need to build on that effort, which today is focused primarily on the current crisis that we see in Colombia. Senators COVERDELL, GRASSLEY, FEINSTEIN, and others worked with me to put together a package specifically dealing with the situation in Colombia. 
   I ask my colleagues to look at the big picture. Step back from the debate about this amendment and look at where we are going as a country. Think about what is in the best interest not of Colombia, but of the United States. This assistance package before us, which my colleague from Kentucky has put together, was put together because Colombia is our neighbor, and what affects our neighbor to the south affects us. 
   We have a very real interest in helping to stabilize Colombia and keeping it democratic, keeping it as our friend, keeping it as our trading partner, and keeping its drugs off our streets. 
   Colombia faces a crisis that is different than any crisis that any country has ever faced before in the history of the world. Many countries have faced guerrilla movements in the past few decades, but no country has ever faced guerrillas with as much money as the Colombian guerrillas have. I don't know of any country that has ever faced a guerrilla movement supported by so much illegal drug money. A synergistic relationship is involved between the drug dealers and the guerrillas; each one benefits from the other; each one takes care of the other. While this is a crisis that Colombia faces, it is a crisis driven by those who consume drugs in our country, and we must admit that it is a crisis that directly impacts all of us in the United States. It directly impacts you; it directly impacts me, our children, and our grandchildren. 
   I ask my colleagues to really consider the great human tragedy that Colombia is today. I ask my colleagues to remember how we got here, and to remember what role this side of the aisle, with help from the other side, played in trying to deal with the Colombian problem, and what role we played in trying to increase the money we were spending and the resources we were providing to stop drugs from ever coming into to our country. 
   The emergency aid package before us today is in the best interests of the Colombian-Andean region. There is no doubt about that. But, more importantly, and more significantly for this body and for the vote we are about to cast, it is in the best interest of the United States. 
   It is clearly something we have to do. It may be tempting on the Gorton amendment to say: Look. Why don't we just take that money? We don't need to send it to Colombia. We don't need to send it down there. What do we care about what goes on in Colombia? Let's keep it here, spend it here, and apply it to the national debt. 
   I understand how people may come to the floor and say that. I understand how people may come to the floor and think that and maybe even vote that way. But I think in the long run it would be a tragic mistake. 
   If we are trying to make an analogy, let me be quite candid. The analogy isn't any long-term involvement in the United States. The analogy shouldn't be to Bosnia; it shouldn't be to Vietnam; It shouldn't even be Kosovo. The analogy is what happened in the Central Americas in the 1980s. 
   Quite candidly, many people on this side of the aisle and on the other side were directly involved in trying to make sure democracy triumphed in Central America. We were successful because people took chances. People cast tough votes. People said we care. Today, when you travel through Central America, you find democracies. I have had the opportunity within the last several years to do that, and to travel to most every Central American country. No, things are not perfect. But each of those countries is moving towards more democracy. Each of those countries is moving towards more market-driven economies. Each of those countries has a chance to develop a middle class. 
   That is the analogy. The United States cared. We were involved. The people there got the job done. 
   Colombia faces a very difficult challenge. Will this be the only time Members of the Senate are asked to vote on this and to send money to deal with this? Of course not. We all know that. This is a commitment, and it is probably going to be somewhat of a long commitment. But I think it is clearly in our national interest. 
   We vote today not to assist Colombia. We vote today really to assist ourselves because what happens in Colombia directly impacts the United States--whether it is trade, whether it is illegal immigration, or whether it is drugs coming into this country. What happens in that region of the world has a direct impact on people in Cleveland, on people in Cincinnati, or any other State, or any city in the United States. We vote in our self-interest today for this package. We vote in our national self-interest, I believe, to vote down the Gorton amendment. 
   Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I began my public career prosecuting individuals who committed violent crimes against our fellow citizens. And, that's why I believe that people who commit violent crimes should be punished. 
   The debate about hate crimes legislation is about fighting crime. It is about fighting violence. It is about taking a stand against crime and violence. 
   The amendments that we're debating here today would permit states to take full advantage of the investigative resources of the federal government in prosecuting these cases. And, should a state be unwilling or unable to prosecute a case itself, the federal government is there to make sure that these kinds of violent criminals are brought to the bar of justice. 
   A country that so righteously protects free speech, even when such speech is abhorrent, must vigorously act as a nation, so that when vicious speech is turned into despicable acts--acts that lead to violence and to death--such acts do not go unpunished.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, earlier today, I voted to table Senator MURRAY's amendment to the FY2001 Department of Defense authorization bill. This amendment, which was successfully tabled, would have allowed for the performance of abortion services on our military bases. It is clear to me, Mr. President, that this amendment would have violated the spirit of the Hyde law, which prohibits Government-funded abortions. 
   Proponents of the amendment attempted to get around this prohibition by requiring that women receiving abortions on military installations pay for their own abortions. But, Mr. President, this simply does not eliminate government involvement in the delivery of abortion services. Military doctors would have to perform the abortions voluntarily, or our Armed Forces would have to contract with private doctors to perform the abortions. 
   Mr. President, we cannot turn our military bases into abortion clinics. Clearly, the federal government is prohibited from the provision of abortions, and should not be in the business of facilitating any abortion services on our military bases. Our federal government has no role to play in providing abortion services. It is that simple.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered is designed  to ensure the continued viability of and effectiveness in a vital Air Force asset--the Air Force Institute of Technology, known as AFIT. AFIT, located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, provides defense-focused graduate and continuing education, research, and consultation to the Air Force and the Department of Defense.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I think we all recognize that the Medicare Program is outdated. The bill introduced by the Senator from Washington would modernize Medicare's coverage to include new biotechnology innovations. Currently, the Medicare program covers physician-administered therapies that are given in an office by infusion or injection, but not those that are injected by a patient or a caregiver at home. Biotechnology has brought us new innovative biologics that are made with large proteins that are so unlike other drugs that they must be formulated as injectables. Science has allowed us to make many of these new products in the form of simple injections that do not have to be given by a health care professional in a clinical setting. 
   The bill I have cosponsored today would bring Medicare up to date with these developments by ensuring that new biological therapies are available to Medicare beneficiaries. It just does not make sense to continue Medicare's bias toward treatments that are more expensive and less convenient for patients. 
   I would like to add one point about the bill's cost. We do not know yet what the Congressional Budget Office [CBO] will determine the estimated cost of this change in Medicare policy will be. I understand the cosponsors of this legislation have requested an estimate from CBO. An analysis by the Lewin Group found that this legislation would not result in increasing the cost to the Medicare program. This finding is not surprising given that the bill would reduce certain costs, such as physician office visits and other expensive services, which would no longer be needed. I am hopeful that the CBO will reach the same conclusion. While it is important to modernize Medicare, it is equally important that we do so in a way that does not weaken the financial strength of the program. 
   I commend Senator GORTON for his leadership on this legislation. It represents the kind of constructive reform that is needed in the Medicare program; reform that would advance and modernize Medicare without imposing additional costs to the program.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, today Senator VOINOVICH and I are introducing the Department of Defense Civilian Workforce Realignment Act of 2000. This legislation is designed to give the Department of Defense some of the administrative flexibility it needs to shape the civilian workforce to meet the tremendous national defense challenges that face our nation well into this century. 
   My colleague from Ohio and I, along with our Ohio colleagues in the House, Mr. HOBSON and Mr. HALL have been working on this issue for almost two years. What has fostered this bipartisan unity is the current workforce situation at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. What we have seen there is a rather large microcosm of a current and growing problem that affects the civilian workforce throughout our defense infrastructure. At Wright-Patterson, this problem threatens to diminish significantly the pool of talented experts in critical research and development fields. As I have often said, Wright-Patterson is the brain power behind our air power, and is the central reason why our Air Force is second to none in technological and aeronautical superiority. 
   Wright-Patterson has already lost a significant number of people who constituted that brain power as a result of Cold War downsizing. In the last decade alone, 8,000 positions at Wright-Patterson have been lost. For the entire Department of Defense, approximately 280,000 positions were lost during the same period. At the same time we were downsizing, hiring restrictions prevented the Defense Department from establishing a foundation of younger innovators. In short, the combination of downsizing, retirement, and a hiring freeze has left a shallow talent pool of young skilled workers. 
   The statistics tell the story. Today, for example, nearly one out of 10 civilian workers at Wright-Patterson's Aeronautical Systems Center are under the age of 35, while more than one-third of the workforce is over the age of 50. In less than five years, more than half of this workforce will be eligible for retirement, but only 2.5 percent will be under the age of 35. This trend is typical for all civilian functions at Wright-Patterson. 
   The Department of Defense Civilian Workforce Realignment Act would extend, revise and expand the Defense Department's limited authority to use voluntary incentive pay and voluntary early retirement. Our bill would allow for the Department to utilize the added authority to restructure the civilian workforce to meet missions needs and to correct skill imbalances. Given the significant numbers of eligible federal retirees the Department will face in just a few short years, this legislation would give the Department the ability to better manage this extraordinary transition period. Just as important, this smoother transition period would allow for better and more effective development of our younger workers, who will have a better chance to learn and gain from the expertise of the older generation of innovators. 
   The legislation we are introducing, fundamentally for Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, is about maintaining technological superiority. That superiority is the foundation of future Air Force dominance in the skies. It's that simple. Weakening that foundation places the lives of our pilots and the security of our nation at risk. Our legislation is a positive step toward rebuilding and strengthening that foundation with an investment in those who will make tomorrow's discoveries and breakthroughs that will keep our pilots safe and our nation secure. 
   I am pleased that the Department of the Air Force and the Department of Defense have expressed the need for workforce realignment legislation. I believe the legislation Senator VOINOVICH and I are introducing today will meet the concerns they have expressed not just to us, but also to other members of the House and Senate. 
   I want to thank Senator VOINOVICH for his efforts and leadership on his legislation, and also want to extend my appreciation to his staff, especially Aric Newhouse and Andrew Richardson, for their hard work. The Miami Valley community also has been of great help in demonstrating the importance of this issue not just to Wright-Patterson but also to the entire region and the nation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, along with my colleagues, Senators VOINOVICH, LAUTENBERG, and TORRICELLI, to authorize the President to present gold medals on behalf of Congress to astronauts Neil A. Armstrong, Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin, and Michael Collins--the heroic crew of the Apollo 11.  
   For thousands of years, man has gazed at the moon with awe, dreaming of the day when that celestial body would no longer be out of man's grasp. On July 20, 1969, thanks to the crew of the Apollo 11, the heavens became part of man's world. 
   The mission to the moon was a long and treacherous endeavor. It started with President Kennedy's vision to put a man on the moon before the end of the decade and concluded with a simple step and the immortal words: ``One small step for man and one giant leap for mankind.'' We owe a great deal of gratitude to the men and women of America's space program. And, I believe that presenting Congressional gold medals to the crew of Apollo 11 is a fitting tribute to them and the mission. 
   The primary objective of Apollo 11 was simple and straightforward: ``Perform a manned lunar landing and return.'' The mission, though, was anything but simple. The historic journey began with the Eagle's fiery lift-off at Cape Kennedy at 9:32 a.m. on July 19, 1969. The world watched as astronauts Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins blasted toward outer space. While the millions who witnessed the event were excited and exhilarated, I do not think any of us truly appreciated the complexity and magnitude of the crew's responsibilities. One mistakenly pulled lever, one power failure could have rendered Apollo 11 a disaster. When asked to recall his thoughts on the mission's outcome, Astronaut Michael Collins said: ``I am far from certain that we will be able to fly the mission as planned. I think we will escape with our skins, or at least I will escape with mine, but I wouldn't give better than even odds on a successful landing and return.'' 
   On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Aldrin began their descent to the lunar surface. The Eagle landed with less than 45 seconds worth 
    of fuel and the buzz of several warning alarms. It was shortly after that landing when Neil Armstrong emerged from the craft and set foot on the moon's surface. Never before in the history of mankind had a human being set foot on another celestial body. The crew of Apollo 11 embodied the spirit of discovery that is so prevalent in our space program. It is this same spirit that we need to communicate to our next generation. 
   Neil Armstrong, the commander of Apollo 11, was born on August 5, 1930, in my home state of Ohio. He developed an interest in flying at an early age. In fact, he obtained his student pilot's license before he got his driver's license. After high school, he received a scholarship from the U.S. Navy and studied aeronautical engineering. He later became an aviator in the Navy and was chosen for the space program with the second group of astronauts in 1962. He made seven flights in the X-15 program, reaching an altitude of 207,500 feet. He was the command pilot for Gemini 8 and Apollo 11. After Apollo 11, he was Deputy Associate Administrator for Aeronautics at NASA from July 1970 until August 1971, when he left to become Professor of Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Cincinnati. He served on the National Commission on Space from 1985 to 1986 and on the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident in 1986. 
   Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin was born in New Jersey on January 20, 1930. He attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and later entered the U.S. Air Force, where he received pilot training. He was chosen with the third group of astronauts in 1963. He was a pilot on Gemini 12, where he was one of the key figures working to improve in-space docking and was the lunar module pilot for Apollo 11. After leaving NASA in 1971, he became Commandant of the Aerospace Research Pilot's School at Edwards Air Force Base in California. He retired from the Air Force in 1972 and became a consultant for the Comprehensive Care Corporation, Newport Beach, California. He has authored two books, ``Return to Earth'' and ``Men From Earth.'' 
   Michael Collins was born on October 30, 1930, in Rome, Italy and later moved to Washington, DC. Upon finishing high school, he attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Prior to joining NASA, he was a test pilot at the Air Force Flight Center, Edwards Air Force Base. He was chosen in the third group of astronauts in 1963. He served as a pilot for Gemini 10, where he set a world altitude record; became the nation's third spacewalker; and served as the command module pilot for Apollo 11. He left NASA in 1970 and was appointed Assistant Secretary of State  for Public Affairs. He became Director of the National Air and Space Museum at the Smithsonian Institution in April 1971 and was promoted to Under Secretary of the Smithsonian in April 1978. He retired from the Air Force with the rank of Major General. He has written numerous articles and two books, ``Carrying the Fire and Liftoff,'' as well as a children's book, ``Flying to the Moon and Other Strange Places.'' 
   Mr. President, presenting Congressional Gold Medals to the crew of the Apollo 11 is as much about the future as it is about the past. These medals will be a reminder of the great accomplishment of Apollo 11 and her crew. Moreover, the presentation of the medals will help inspire future generations of Americans to continue striving to accomplish tasks that may seem out of reach, like putting a man on the moon. I am convinced that somewhere in our schools today are the next Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins. Before long, our children will be talking about where they were when the first man or woman set foot on Mars. Let's honor the immense achievement of the crew of Apollo 11. I urge my colleagues to support presenting Congressional Gold Medals to Neil Armstrong, Edwin E. ``Buzz'' Aldrin, Jr., and Michael Collins.

    Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, there has been a great deal of attention given to the sizeable problems both in recruiting and in retaining the men and women in our military services. In response, Congress last year passed a 4.8 percent across the board pay raise, reformed the pay scales, and corrected a retirement system for our soliders, sailors, airmen, and marines in the service of our country. This year, Congress is considering ways to reform and improve the strength of our military health care system. 
   Mr. President, these measures are the least we can do to recognize the men and women of our military services for the important part they play in maintaining our nation's security and our influence around the globe. 
   But, Mr. President, there are other members of our civilian workforce that also face recruiting and retention problems, and deserve congressional attention. Last year, Congressman STEVE LATOURETTE and I introduced the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Nurse Appreciation Act, which is designed to correct a provision in the law that has been used in recent years to deny VA nurses the annual cost of living pay adjustments given to federal employees. In some cases, the law was used to cut the pay of some VA nurses. The law needs to be changed. 
   Today, I am introducing legislation to address another field of critical importance to the VA--dental care, which is also facing serious personnel retention problems. Over the past five years, the Department of Veterans Affairs has experienced a decline from 830 full-time dentists to only 630, and the numbers are still declining. In addition, the turnover rate during the past 2 years have been more than 11 percent. An increasing number of young and mid-career dentists are leaving the VA. There are fewer highly qualified applicants applying to fill vacant positions, and most vacancies take several months to fill. An additional concern is the aging of the current VA dental workforce. Within 2 years, almost 50 percent of all VA dentist will be eligible for regular or early-out retirement. 
   The legislation I am introducing today would attempt to address these challenges and ensure the availability of quality dental health care for our veterans.  
   One of the major reasons for the decline in the numbers of VA dentists is the availability of higher paying jobs in the civilian sector. The type of work done at the VA is more challenging than that of the average hometown dentist. VA dentists frequently provide their services to homeless veterans whose dental needs are much more demanding. 
   An additional reason is that even with the ``special pay'' and the ``responsibility pay'' that is available under current law, VA dentists' salaries still are not competitive with fellow non-VA dentists. In addition, all full-tme VA physicians receive a ``special pay'' incentive of $9,000 annually, while VA dentists receive only $3,500. The ``responsibility pay'' depends on the additional responsibilities the physician or dentist is performing. 
   The reason for the difference is that when current law was passed nearly a decade ago, there was a shortfall of physicians, and a ready supply of dentists. 
   The legislation I am introducing today, would correct this disparity and bring ``special pay'' for dentists to $9,000 annually and would increase the ``responsibility pay'' for dentists in management positions, so that they would be in the same responsibility pay range as physicians. This bill is similar to legislation introduced by Congressman BOB FILNER of California 
   The National Association of VA Physicians and Dentists have offered their full support for this initiative and so has the American Dental Association. As a matter of fact, a very dear longtime friend of my family, Doctor Dwight Pemberton, a friend of my parents and gransparents, was the one who brought this issue to my attention and encouraged me to introduce this legislation. I thank him for his support and advocacy for this legislation, and look forward to working toward a positive solution to this problem. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill for the continued reliable dental coverage for our veterans.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as you know, our colleagues in the House passed, by a vote of 237-197, legislation to establish permanent normalized trade relations with China. The vote yesterday condensed months of intense debate over economics, foreign policy, and national security concerns with regard to that relationship with China. 
   This is significant legislation, and I look forward to a thorough Senate debate on this matter. I will have more to say about this very important issue during that debate. There are very significant economic and trade concerns, but there are also some very significant national security issues that must be discussed. 
   Over the last several months, the current administration has invested considerable time, energy, and resources to achieving House approval of what is essentially a bilateral agreement with China. While this issue is a very important one, I also believe we need to place it in its proper context and consider whether our overall trade policies have been successful. 
   I am concerned that over the last 4 years, the administration's pursuit of a bilateral trade agreement with China has come at the expense of missed bilateral and even multilateral trade agreements and economic opportunities right here within our own hemisphere. 
   Regardless of what the potential economic benefits that PNTR with China could offer, the bottom line is that stability and economic opportunity within our own hemisphere always must be a top priority. To that extent, we, as a nation, stand to lose or gain, depending on the economic health and security of our own neighbors. What that means is that ultimately a strong and free and prosperous hemisphere means a strong and free and prosperous United States. 
   The reality is that in 1997, we had an opportunity to move forward to give the President greater authority to negotiate new trade agreements with countries in our own hemisphere. Sadly, that did not happen. Now it will be up to our next President to pursue new markets in this hemisphere. If we as a country do not lead, other nations and their businesses will take our place. No country is waiting for us to act first. 
   In the end, the longer we wait to pursue more trade opportunities in our own hemisphere, the more we stand to lose. 
   Take, for example, my home State of Ohio. The future of Ohio's economy is linked to our ability to send our products abroad. Given the chance, Ohio's businessmen and women and Ohio's farmers can and do compete effectively on the world stage. For example, in most years, one-third to one-half of Ohio's major cash crops--corn, wheat, and soybeans--are found in markets and meals outside our country. In 1998, the city of Cincinnati increased its exports by slightly more than $1 billion. It was the fourth-biggest such increase in the country. Columbus, OH, boosted its exports by $92.5 million, ranking 36th in the country and second in the State in terms of percentage growth. Open trade opportunities have allowed Ohio's and the Nation's economy to continue thriving. 
   This argument has been used to support granting permanent normal trade relations with China. Much of the public debate has focused on the potential of more than 1 billion Chinese consumers. Yet, we are ignoring another very sizable market--the market within our own hemisphere. Right here in our hemisphere, with a combined gross domestic product (GDP) of more than $10 trillion--a hemisphere encompassing 800 million people--trade with our hemispheric neighbors represents vast opportunities. These are opportunities that we must not ignore. 
   Right now, Europe, Asia, and Canada are securing their economic fortunes throughout Latin America and Central America. Take the example of Brazil--the world's eighth largest economy. In 1997, the European Union--the EU--exported to Brazil more than they did to any other country, and between 1990 and 1998, their exports grew 255 percent. Also, although United States exports to Argentina are double that of Asia's, our growth rate is less than half of Asia's incredible 1664 percent increase from 1990 to 1998. 
   As my colleagues can see, other nations are riding the tides of change--of free-market economics and openness--and integrating into the world economy. The region's ``Mercosur'' or common market--which includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and associate member Chile--is the world's  largest growing trading bloc, experiencing trade growth of 400 percent between 1990 and 1998. In 1990, they bought less than $7 billion worth of U.S. products. In 1997, their U.S. purchases had grown to $23 billion. 
   The Europeans aren't asleep at the wheel either. As of now, the European Union is the largest trading partner with the Mercosur countries. Trade between the EU and the Mercosur countries totaled $42.7 billion in 1996 compared to $31 billion for the United States. Additionally, between 1990 and 1998, the EU's market share of all Mercosur imports increased from 23 percent to 27 percent. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the European Union is not going to sit idly by and let the United States gain any market share in our own hemisphere, our own region. In fact, the EU recently has intensified negotiations with the Mercosur toward consolidating the two regional blocs. Moves like this represent more than just a loss of export opportunities for our Nation--they represent a lack of leadership to aggressively pursue new markets in our own hemisphere. 
   This is the hemisphere we live in. Those should be our markets. To lose them through neglect would be a truly shameful outcome for our country. 
   There is enough of a consciousness in Latin America of the benefits of economic liberalization that we will see more and more trade barriers go down--to somebody's benefit. The question that remains is: Will we in the United States be in on that market, or not? 
   I am optimistic, though, that our Nation can capture a larger share of markets in our hemisphere now that the Senate passed and the President signed into law the Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act. This act will bring tremendous benefits to the United States and to the Caribbean Basin. It will enhance our economic security, both by opening new markets for American products and by strengthening the economies of our closest neighbors. And, it would create new hope for 
   those left jobless by Hurricanes Mitch and Georges. 
   The CBI law will extend duty-free treatment to apparel assembled in the Carribean Basin--or assembled and cut in the region--using U.S. fabric made from U.S. yarn. This will help strengthen existing U.S.-CBI partnerships in the apparel industry, because the duty-free treatment will help U.S. apparel manufacturers maintain their competitiveness with the Asian market. 
   CBI is a good law. It is a good law that was long, long overdue. In the context of our overall trade policy, it represents a modest step forward. To do more toward further expanding market opportunities abroad will require strong leadership both in the Congress and from the President. 
   Despite the success of CBI, plenty of unfinished business remains with regard to our hemispheric trading partners and our hemispheric trading policies, as well as our overall trading strategy. It will be incumbent upon our next President and this Congress to deal with this unfinished business of our country. I am hopeful that several important initiatives will, in fact, be pursued. That is why I believe the next administration and the next Congress needs to approve fast track trading authority. 
   It is not a stretch to say that America's continued leadership in the global economy is fundamentally dependent on our ability to secure new markets abroad. By giving the President greater flexibility to negotiate trade agreements, and by giving the President the ability to set the pace and the timing of many of our most important trade negotiations, Congress would be giving the President the authority to negotiate trade deals very quickly, but also the ability to assert and protect the continued international economic supremacy of the United States. And that--that is key to our economic future. 
   Finally, ultimately, our Nation's ability to aggressively promote free and fair trade and enter into trade agreements with countries within our hemisphere is critical. The more we pursue economic initiatives with our neighbors, the more we, as a nation, stand to gain and in ways that go beyond economic growth. In a region that is largely Democratic, a hemispheric commitment to free and fair trade will strengthen Democratic principles and the rule of law. Such pursuits are good for the Caribbean Basin; they are good for Central America; they are good for Latin America; and they are good for agriculture and business right here at home in the United States. Overall, it just makes good sense. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the Levin amendment which would strike the Byrd-Warner provision regarding U.S. troop withdrawal from Kosovo. As my colleagues know, the Byrd-Warner provision includes language designed to ensure our allies in NATO provide their fair share of the peacekeeping burden in Kosovo. This certainly is an important goal, and I understand the Europeans right now are meeting the requirements outlined in the Byrd-Warner provision. 
   Frankly, I believe a great deal of the credit for this great accomplishment goes to my friend and colleague from Virginia, Senator WARNER. He has demonstrated unfailing dedication and commitment to this very important burdensharing issue. Senator WARNER traveled to Kosovo in January of this year and saw firsthand that the Europeans needed to share a larger portion of the burden in the Balkans. Because of his efforts in the short time since his visit to Kosovo, the proportion of European involvement has changed considerably. In fact, currently U.S. troops now make up 5,900 of the 39,000-member NATO peacekeeping force. U.S. involvement accounts for 15 percent of the overall peacekeeping effort, and the Europeans are carrying the bulk of the effort on the civilian side. This is a victory for Senator WARNER. I believe we have to pause for a moment today to congratulate him on a job very well done. 
   I also agree with the Senator from Virginia, Mr. WARNER, and the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, Senator BYRD, that Congress needs to assert itself more in foreign affairs. Congress can and Congress should engage more in the kinds of debate over foreign policy issues such as the one we are having today and should work harder to shape 
   U.S. defense and foreign policy. The last 7 years of drift in foreign affairs has demonstrated the need for Congress to reassert its constitutional role in shaping American foreign policy. 
   I also share the very legitimate concerns expressed by the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator STEVENS, about the way the current administration funds our peacekeeping activities. We find ourselves repeatedly in a situation in which the administration draws funds and resources away from important defense activities to pay for its peacekeeping operations. 
   For example, the administration knew before the end of last year when we were negotiating the remaining appropriations bills that they were planning to keep our forces in Kosovo for the duration of the fiscal year. They knew it but did nothing in the budget about it, except to put a number of readiness and operational projects on hold at reduced funding levels. That practice has become the standard practice in recent years. That practice needs to change. We should debate the cost of operations before the operations. We should debate the cost before the beginning of each fiscal year and not do this back-door funding. 
   I do understand the motives of the proponents of this provision. I understand what they are trying to accomplish. They have good reason to be frustrated, but this is not a debate about motive but, rather, one about method. It is the method that will be employed under this language that deeply troubles me. What concerns me most about this provision is that it sets an arbitrary deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Kosovo. The deadline is not based on any goals that would make it possible for the reduction of forces in the region. This arbitrary deadline signals to the Albanians the limits to our commitment for providing for their protection. This, in turn, could give them cause to rearm and prepare to protect themselves from what they would view as an inevitable Serbian reentry. In essence, this provision would undermine our current efforts to achieve stability in the region and could give the despotic Milosevic the victory he could not achieve on the battlefield. 
   The fact is, in the delicate and complex world of foreign affairs, one thing should always be clear: As a nation, we should demonstrate to our allies the certainty of our resolve, and we must demonstrate that same resolve to our enemies, while at the same time making our enemies uncertain as to how and when we will exercise that resolve. 
   Unfortunately, what this provision does is just the opposite. It makes our allies uncertain and signals to our adversaries what we will do and what we will not do. 
   The proponents of this provision have argued this is really all about process. Respectfully, I disagree. This debate is about whether Congress will use sound judgment in the exercise of power. I believe the Byrd-Warner provision is not a wise use of congressional power. By voting for this provision, we will be exercising our power arbitrarily and setting ourselves on a course toward the removal of U.S. troops in Kosovo in 14 months. 
   The next President would be placed in the position of having to convince Congress to change the policy, to act. We have sadly found many times that to get this Congress to act is very difficult. 
   The current administration, for example, could not convince the House of Representatives to authorize airstrikes over Serbia. There simply are no guarantees that Congress will act in 14 months. 
   Congressional inaction over the next year could result in a dramatic change in policy that would create uncertainty and undermine our credibility with NATO and with our own troops. Fostering that kind of uncertainty about U.S. resolve is not what is intended but that, sadly, could be the result. That result, that uncertainty, will, I believe, create a more dangerous situation for our troops for the next 14 months. 
   The fact is that our credibility as a leader in the international community is predicated on a shared commitment to the stability and growth of democracy and free markets on the European continent. 
   We cannot reach these goals through arbitrary, unilateral deadlines. We cannot reach these goals by placing the next administration in the position of shaping foreign policy in response to a congressionally imposed deadline rather than on current and future world events. In essence, we cannot allow our foreign policy to run on autopilot. 
   I say to my colleagues, if they believe we should withdraw our troops, there is ample opportunity to have an up-or-down vote on that at any time. We could do it today. We could do it in 14 months. We could do it in July of the year 2001. That is the right way for us to exercise our power. 
   I believe this is the wrong action because what this does is, in essence, say that Congress may never directly vote on this issue. Members can vote for this language which would provide that our troops would automatically have to come out in July of the year 2001 if Congress took no action. Members could vote for this, and then Congress could take absolutely no action and we would never have a direct vote on the issue. 
   I believe that is the wrong way to approach this issue. I believe that if Members believe our troops should be withdrawn, they have ample opportunity to have an up-or-down vote on this at any time they wish to do it. 
   I believe the uncertainty that will be created over the next 14 months by the insertion of this language into law will create a very difficult and untenable position for our troops and for our country in the conduct of American foreign policy. 
   I thank my colleague for the time and yield the floor.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as we prepare to begin the debate concerning the provisions within the fiscal year 2001 foreign ops appropriations bill, I would like to call my colleagues' attention to an event scheduled to take place this Sunday, May 21, referring to the parliamentary elections of Haiti. 
   The openness, the fairness, the transparency of these elections that will be held on Sunday are critical to Haiti, and really place the country and its people at a crossroads. 
   These are the elections that have been postponed, postponed, postponed, and postponed. Finally, it appears as if they will actually take place this Sunday. 
   The world is watching to see how Haiti conducts these elections. The international community and the United States will be judging Haiti based on these elections. I think it is a fair statement to say that future assistance, future aid from the international community, from the private sector, private organizations, as well as governments, as well as the United States, will depend certainly to some extent on how these elections are conducted. Not how they turn out but how they are conducted. The world will be looking on Sunday to see the amount of violence connected with these elections; to see whether or not the elections are fair, transparent, and open; to see what kind of participation takes place among Haitian people. 
   We have every right to be concerned about these elections. We have a right to be concerned because of the investment the United States has made in Haiti, which I will discuss in a moment. We have a right to be concerned because these elections have been postponed, postponed, and postponed. We have a right to be concerned because we want to see whether or not this fledgling democracy is, in fact, making progress. 
   So, yes, the world will be watching. We are concerned, quite candidly, about these elections because of the action and because of the inaction of Haiti's political elite, its upper class, what they have not done and what they have done during the past 5 years. 
   We all had high expectations for Haiti when the United States sent 20,000 U.S. troops to that island in 1995 to restore President Aristide to power. At that time, we understood it would take time for Haiti to become politically stable. We understood it would take time to establish a free and open market system in that country. We understood it would take time to invoke the rule of law and privatization of government-run-and-owned industries. And we understood it would take a while to establish a fair and impartial and functioning judicial system. 
   Quite tragically, time has passed and very little, if anything, has changed. The phrase ``Haitian Government'' is an oxymoron, given President Preval has been ruling by decree without a democratically elected Parliament since January 1999. Political intimidation is rampant, with violence and killings increasing as the elections approach. Furthermore, the Haitian economy is, at best, stagnant. Haiti remains the poorest nation by far in our entire hemisphere, with a per capita income estimated at $330 per year per person, where 70 percent of the people are either without jobs or certainly underemployed. 
   When we deal with Haiti, the statistics don't matter. We are not even sure how reliable they are. Anyone who has visited Haiti--and I have had occasion to visit Haiti nine different times in the last 5 1/2 years--sees where that economy is and sees the years of wrenching, unbelievable poverty in Haiti, a country that is just a short trip from Miami. 
   Absent a stable and democratic government, Haiti has no hope of achieving real and lasting economic nor political nor judicial reforms. That is why Haiti is finding itself stuck in a vicious cycle of despair. It is a cycle in which political stalemate threatens the government and judicial reforms, which, in turn, discourages investment and privatization. 
   Caught in this cycle, the economy stands to shrink further 
   and further until there is no economic investment to speak of at all. With no viable law enforcement institutions in place, and given the island's weak political and economic situation, drug traffickers operate with impunity. 
   I have talked about this on this floor on several different occasions in the last few years. I predicted several years ago that we would see the amount of drug transportation in Haiti, the amount of drugs flowing through that country, go up and up and our own Government has estimated today that prediction has, tragically, come true. Our Government estimates Haiti accounts for 14 percent of all cocaine entering the United States today. Haiti is now the major drug transshipment country in the entire Caribbean. We estimate 75 tons of cocaine moved through Haiti in 1999. That represents a 24-percent increase over the previous year. 
   Quite frankly, Haiti has become a great human tragedy. While the decade of the 1980s witnessed unbelievable changes in Central America, with countries moving from totalitarian regimes to democracies, that was the great success story of the 1980s. Many of us hoped in the 1990s, and into the next century, we would see that same progress made in Haiti. Tragically, that has not taken place. Haiti now stands as a missed opportunity for reform, a missed opportunity for progress, for growth, and for development. The true casualties, the real victims of all the turmoil and instability are the children. They are the victims because the small band of political elite in Haiti has not moved forward and taken seriously the need for reform. They have missed their opportunity. 
   The economy is worse, human rights are being violated, and there is very little optimism today in Haiti. These dire conditions are every day killing children. Haiti's infant mortality rate is approximately 15 times that of the United States. Because Haiti lacks the means to produce enough food to feed its population, the children who are born suffer from malnutrition, malnourishment. They rely heavily on humanitarian food aid. Additionally, because of the lack of clean water and sanitation, only 39 percent of the population has access to clean water. It is estimated only 26 percent have access to sanitation. Diseases such as measles and tuberculosis are epidemic. 
   Given this human tragedy, we can't turn our backs on these children as mad as we may get at the political leaders of that country, as frustrated as we may become with the political leaders of that country. Haiti is part of our hemisphere, and what happens in our hemisphere, what happens in our own backyard, is very much our concern. If we ignore the situation, we risk another massive refugee exodus for our shores, and drug trafficking through Haiti will continue to increase and increase and increase. 
   We must seek ways to foster democracy building in Haiti and promote free markets in the rule of law. We also must fight drug trafficking through Haiti and expand agricultural assistance through nongovernmental organizations. Let me say there are good nongovernment organizations that are in Haiti working to make a difference in spite of the Haitian Government. 
   I must also say I have personally seen and visited a number of Americans in church groups who are down in Haiti risking their lives, making a difference every day to save the lives of children. 
   Finally, most important, I believe we must ensure that humanitarian and food assistance continues to reach the Haitian people, especially the children. We cannot just sit back and let the political elite in Haiti starve these orphan children as well as the elderly and the destitute. 
   Ultimately, though, Haiti will not really progress until its political leaders and the elite of the country take responsibility for the situation and commit to turning things around. The tragedy of the last 5 years is that the elite in Haiti has not made a decision that it is in their interests and in the interests of their country to change things. Until the elite of Haiti decides to make these changes, it is going to be very difficult, no matter what we do, to have any significant progress made in that very poor country. 
   Haiti can succeed as a democracy if, and only if, the elite has the resolve to hold open elections, create free markets, reduce corruption, improve its judicial system, respect human rights,  and learn how to sustain an agricultural system that can feed its people. Nothing the United States does with regard to Haiti can provide long-term permanent solutions unless and until the Haitians take democratic and societal reforms seriously and work in earnest to create a stable political system in a free and democratic market economy. That is why the world is watching to see how these elections are conducted this Sunday. 
   Let me turn to another portion of the foreign operations appropriations bill. There is language, as I have just talked about, in regard to Haiti in this bill. I wanted to speak about Haiti this evening on the Senate floor because of that language in the bill but also because of the upcoming elections. 
   There is another provision in the foreign operations appropriations bill we hope we will be taking up shortly. This provision has to do with our neighbor to the south, Colombia. 
   Let me first commend the chairman and ranking member on the subcommittee, Senator MCCONNELL and Senator LEAHY, and also the chairman and ranking member of the full committee, Senator STEVENS and Senator BYRD, for working with me, for working with Senator COVERDELL, Senator GRASSLEY, Senator GRAHAM of Florida, and so many others on the Colombia/Andean emergency antidrug assistance package which is now part of this bill. 
   This assistance to Colombia would provide approximately $934 million to support Colombian efforts to eliminate drugs at the source, to improve human rights programs, to improve rule of law programs, and to increase economic development--$934 million is what is contained in this bill. Passage of this assistance package is crucial to helping keep drugs off our streets here at home and to bring stability to our hemisphere. 
   No one questions there is a real emergency that currently exist in Colombia. Colombia is a democratic success story that is now in crisis. Thanks largely to the growing profits from illicit drug trafficking, Colombia is embroiled in a destabilizing and brutal civil war, a civil war that has gone on for decades with a death toll that continues to rise and that we estimate is at least 35,000 people. We have seen and continue to see the tragedy of Colombia unfold in our newspapers; we see 
   the violence that is occurring there. Members of the army, members of the police are killed on a daily basis at an unbelievably alarming rate. 
   Just this week we saw a graphic, horrible picture in our newspapers of a bomb necklacing, where one of the terrorist groups, one of the guerrilla groups, placed a bomb around a woman's neck, asked her family for money, locked the bomb so it could not be removed, and told the family the bomb would go off at 3 in the afternoon. The bomb squad came in, the army. For 8 hours they tried to get the bomb off. Tragically, the bomb went off. The bomb killed the woman and killed the young man who was working to try to free her. That is just a graphic example of what is occurring, in one form or the another, in Colombia every single day. 
   Many of us on the floor were in Congress in the 1980s when we worked so hard to give assistance to the countries in this hemisphere, particularly in Central America, to drive communism out to allow these countries to become democratic. The 1980s are a true success story for this hemisphere. We paid a very heavy price, but I think most of us believe that was a price worth paying. We brought democracy, we brought opportunity to our hemisphere. 
   Today the drug trade has emerged as the dominant threat to peace and freedom in the Americas. Communism was the threat in the 1980s. Today the drug trade is the threat. It threatens the sovereignty of the Colombian democracy and the continued prosperity and security of our hemisphere. 
   We have devoted a good portion of this week to discussing the threat that is involved in the whole situation in the Balkans, specifically in regard to Kosovo. I think we should have; it is very important. But I believe what we are seeing right here in our own hemisphere, what is happening in Colombia, is certainly equally important and maybe more important than what is going on in the Balkans. 
   Tragically, it is America's own drug habit that is fueling this threat in our hemisphere. It is our own drug habit that is causing the instability and violence in Colombia and in the region. Let's just look at what is happening in my own home State of Ohio, in Cincinnati, OH. In 1990, there were 19 heroin-related arrests in Cincinnati--1990, 19 heroin-related arrests. Last year, there were 464 arrests. Law enforcement officers in Cincinnati understand the reason for this surge. Colombia produces low-cost, high-purity heroin, making it more and more the drug of choice. And because of our Government's inadequate emphasis on drug interdiction and eradication efforts, that Colombian heroin is making its way across our borders and in my case, to the State of Ohio. 
   We may say, sure, Cincinnati is just one urban area, one metropolitan area. But if there is a heroin problem in Cincinnati, you can bet there is a heroin problem in New York City and Chicago and Los Angeles and throughout our country. The fact is that drugs from Colombia are cheap and plentiful in this country, so our children across America are using them. In fact, more children today are using and experimenting with drugs than 10 years ago--many more than did 10 years ago. The facts and statistics are startling. According to the 1999 Monitoring the Future Study, since 1992 overall drug use among tenth graders has increased 55 percent, heroin use among tenth graders has increased 92 percent, and cocaine use among tenth graders has increased 133 percent. 
   The ability of our law enforcement officers to succeed in keeping drugs off our streets and away from our children is clearly, directly linked to our ability to keep drugs produced in places such as Colombia from ever reaching our shores. To be effective, our drug control strategy needs to be a coordinated effort that directs and balances resources and support among three key areas: Domestic law enforcement, international eradication and interdiction efforts, and demand reduction. This means we must balance the allocation of resources towards efforts to stop those who produce drugs, those who transport illegal drugs into this country, and those who deal drugs on our streets and in our schools. 
   The sad fact is, the cultivation of coca in Colombia has skyrocketed, doubling from over 126,000 acres in 1995 to 300,000 in 1999. Poppy cultivation has grown to such an extent that it is now the source of the majority of heroin consumed in the United States. Not surprisingly, as drug availability has increased in the United States, drug use among adolescents also has increased. 
   To make matters worse, these Colombian insurgents see the drug traffic as a financial partner to sustain their illicit cause, only making the FARC and ELN grow stronger. The sale of drugs today not only fuels the drug business, but also the antidemocratic insurgents in Colombia. 
   Why does Colombia matter? It matters to us, first of all, because of what I just talked about, and that is the drugs Colombia ships into the United States. 
   Why else does it matter? The drug trade in Colombia is a source of rampant lawlessness and violence in Colombia. It has destabilized that country and stands to threaten the entire Andean region. Fortunately, in the last few years, Congress has had the foresight to recognize the escalating threats, and we have taken the lead to restore our drug-fighting capability beyond our borders off our shores. 
   Many of my colleagues who have worked so hard on this Colombia assistance package also worked with me just a few short years ago to pass the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act, a $2.7 billion, 3-year authorization initiative aimed at restoring international eradication, interdiction, and crop alternative development funding. 
   With this law, we already have made an $800 million downpayment. We have appropriated and spent $800 million, $200 million of which represented the first substantial investment in Colombia to counternarcotics activities. 
   I stress to my colleagues that the emergency assistance package before us is based on a blueprint that Senator COVERDELL and I developed and introduced last October, 3 months before the administration unveiled its proposal. 
   Like our plan, the emergency assistance package before us this evening goes beyond counternarcotics assistance and crop alternative development  programs in Colombia. This plan targets Latin American countries, including Bolivia, Peru, Panama, and Ecuador. 
   This is a regional approach, and a regional approach is crucial. Peru and Bolivia have made enormous progress to reduce drug cultivation in their countries, and they have done it with our assistance. What has taken place in those two countries has been a success story. 
   An emphasis only on the Colombian drug problems risks the spillover effect of Colombia's drug trade shifting to other countries in the region. That is why resources are needed and provided in this bill for countries such as Bolivia, Panama, Ecuador, and Peru. 
   I also note the positive contributions to our antidrug activities made by the chairman and ranking member, Senator BURNS and Senator MURRAY, of the Military Construction Subcommittee. We passed today the military construction bill which includes investments in equipment and support activities as part of our Colombia-Andean region antidrug strategy. 
   That bill also includes funding for the Coast Guard to provide supplies, reduce the maintenance backlog, and for pay and benefits for Coast Guard personnel. 
   Funding in that bill also was provided for six C-130J aircraft, which give critical support to our counternarcotics efforts. 
   That bill also contains funding for forward operating locations which will provide the logistic support needed for our aircraft to conduct detection and monitoring flights over the source countries. The closure of Howard Air Force Base in 
   Panama, as part of the Panama Canal transfer treaty, severely diminished this capability. That is why we need these forward operating locations, and that is why the money provided in this bill is so important. 
   As I stated a moment ago, a balanced approach is critical to the success of our counterdrug policy. We must continue to invest resources in our law enforcement agencies--Coast Guard, Customs, and the Drug Enforcement Agency. They are our front line of defense against drugs coming into the United States. They also work with law enforcement agencies of other countries to eradicate and interdict drugs. These agencies need additional resources to ensure the increase in illicit drug production in Colombia does not result in a corresponding increase in drugs on the streets and in the schools of our country. 
   Addressing the crisis in Colombia is timely and necessary. It is in the national security interest of Colombia and the United States to work together and with our other partners in the hemisphere to curb the corroding effects of illicit drug trafficking. The bottom line is that an investment in the Andean region to help stop the drug trade and preserve democracy is a direct investment in the peaceful future of our entire hemisphere. It is in our national interest. 
   I know there are some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle who have expressed some hesitancy and reluctance about the provision in this bill concerning Colombia. I want to take a moment to direct my comments specifically to them. 
   The Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act that Congress passed several years ago was an attempt to change the direction of our drug policy. What do I mean? I consistently said during this speech and other speeches on the floor that we need a balanced drug policy. We have to have treatment, education, domestic law enforcement, and we have to have international law enforcement and interdiction. We have to do all these things. We have to have a balanced approach. 
   We found 3 years ago when we looked at what had happened in our antidrug effort over the last decade that beginning with the Clinton administration, that administration began to reduce the percentage of the money we were spending on international drug interdiction. 
   When George Bush left the White House, we were spending approximately one-third of our total Federal antidrug budget on international drug interdiction, basically on stopping drugs from ever getting inside the United States--spending it either on law enforcement in other countries, on Customs, on DEA, on crop eradication, stopping drugs from ever reaching our shores. That was about one-third of our budget. That is what we were spending when George Bush left the White House. 
   As of 2 years ago, after 6 years of the Clinton administration, that one-third has been reduced to approximately 8 to 10 percent, a dramatic reduction in the amount of money we were spending on international drug interdiction. 
   Some of us in this body--Senator COVERDELL, myself, and others--decided we had to change that, so we introduced the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. A corresponding bill was introduced in the House of Representatives. Then Congressman HASTERT, now Speaker HASTERT, played a major role in working on that bill, as did others. 
   The bottom line is, we passed the bill, it became law, and we have begun to change that direction. The initiative for that came from this side of the aisle. We saw what the administration was doing. We said the policy has to change; we need to put more money into interdiction, and we need to begin to do that. We did do that. 
   Fast forward a couple more years as the crisis in Colombia continued to get worse and worse. Again, Senator COVERDELL, Senator GRASSLEY, myself, and others put together a new package. It was a package aimed specifically at dealing with the crisis in Colombia. We introduced that package last October. After we introduced that package, a few months later the administration finally came forward and said: Yes, we have to do something about Colombia. But it was our initiative that started it. 
   It brings us now to where we are today. The initiative that Senator COVERDELL, Senator GRASSLEY, and others introduced has now been wrapped into this bill. 
   The good news is that the administration is on board. 
   The administration also came forward with a proposal to deal with Colombia and has stated their understanding of the severity of this problem. So that is where we are today. 
   I ask my colleagues to look at the big picture and to think about what is in the best interests of the United States. This package is not put together for Colombia. It is not put together for the Colombians. It is put together for us. It is put together because Colombia is our neighbor, and what happens to our neighbor, in our neighbor's country, affects us. 
   Why? Trade. Colombia is a major trading partner of the United States. What happens in that country affects our trade. The drugs that come into this country, as I have already demonstrated in this speech, come from Colombia to a great extent. The drugs that are killing our young people come from Colombia. 
   So we have a very real interest in stabilizing that country, keeping that country democratic, keeping that country a trading partner of the United States, and to help that democratically elected government in Colombia help themselves to beat back the drug dealers, to beat back the guerrillas. 
   They face a crisis that is different than any crisis that any other country has probably ever faced. Many countries have faced guerrilla movements throughout history. But I do not know any other country that ever faced a guerrilla movement that was fueled with so much money. There is this synergistic relationship now that has been created between the drug dealers and the guerrillas. Each one benefits the other. Each one takes care of the other. The end result is that the guerrillas are emboldened and enriched by the drug dealers' money. So it is a crisis that Colombia faces, but it is a crisis that directly impacts the United States. 
   I ask my colleagues to remember how we got here, to remember what role this side of the aisle played in trying to deal with the Colombia problem and deal with the problem in Central America, South America, what role we played in trying to increase the money that we are spending and resources we are spending on stopping drugs from coming into this country. 
   If we recall that history, and recall what the situation is in Colombia today, we will be persuaded that this is the right thing to do and that this provision in this bill that deals with an aid package for the Colombia-Andean region is clearly in the best interests of  the United States and is something that we have to do. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference report to the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. This legislation contains important measures that not only will help spur the economies of developing nations in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean Basin, but also will strengthen our ability to retaliate against countries who refuse to comply with WTO trade decisions won by the United States. 
   Sub-Saharan Africa is enmeshed in great economic, human, and political turmoil. The countries of this region are among the poorest in the world. The per capita income averages less than $500 annually, and the average life expectancy is the world's shortest. We have all seen pictures of the desperate conditions--images of starving babies, homeless families, and needless bloodshed seem to be everywhere. And, just today, news stories about the situation in Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe remind us of how truly bleak life in Africa can be. 
   But, Mr. President, despite the killings, despite the political unrest, despite the poverty--the future offers the people of Africa great opportunities for increased trade and investment--opportunities that can restore hope and bring about positive change on the Continent. 
   With a population of more than 700 million, Sub-Saharan Africa represents one of the largest economic markets in the world. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, my own home state of Ohio was the tenth largest exporting state to the region, with $148 million in exports in 1998. Although U.S. exports to Africa are more than 45 percent greater than U.S. exports to all the countries of the former Soviet Union, this export market still represents only about one percent of our nation's total trade. 
   It is time that we establish a new economic framework on which we can build increased trade with Africa. The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act establishes just such a framework by encouraging increased trade and investment by reducing trade barriers. 
   Mr. President, as I said earlier, the legislation before us today, not only affects African nations, but also those within our own hemisphere through the Caribbean Basin Initiative. 
   Over the last decade, the United States has played a vital role in the spread of democracy and the growth of free enterprise throughout the Western Hemisphere. Today, every nation in our hemisphere--except Cuba--has moved toward establishing a democratic government and is opening their economies to free trade. Democratic elections have become the norm--not the exception--and hemispheric trade integration is a common goal. 
   To further consolidate democracies and economic gains in the region, we must move forward to integrate economically with our neighboring countries. The Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act is part of our effort to consolidate democracy and economic stability in our hemisphere. This Act would bring tremendous benefits to the United States and to the Caribbean Basin. It would enhance our economic security, both by opening new markets for American products and by strengthening the economies of our closest neighbors. And, it would create new hope for those left jobless by Hurricanes Mitch and George. 
   The CBI enhancement legislation would extend duty-free treatment to apparel assembled in the Carribean Basin (or assembled and cut in the region) using U.S. fabric made from U.S. yarn. This would help strengthen existing U.S.-CBI partnerships in the apparel industry, because the duty-free treatment will help U.S. apparel manufacturers maintain their competitiveness with the Asian market. 
   The CBI enhancement also would take steps toward creating a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), by promoting the anti-corruption and protection of intellectual property, as well as other forms of cooperation with matters such as counter-narcotics programs. Specifically, the legislation would link CBI benefits more explicitly to the fulfillment of specific obligations in beneficiary countries in such areas as WTO compliance, intellectual property rights, investment protection,  market access, worker rights, narcotics enforcement, corruption, government procurement, customs valuation and comparable tariff treatment. 
   Mr. President, trade integration will occur in this 
   hemisphere, whether or not we are a part of it. So, it is in our national interest to shape that integration process by bringing more countries into bilateral and multilateral trade agreements with the United States. If we fail to seize trade opportunities in Africa and within our own hemisphere, others will take our place of leadership. No country is waiting for us to act first. In the end, the longer we wait, the more we stand to lose. 
   And speaking of losing, currently, our nation continues to be injured by the refusal of the European Union (EU) to comply with WTO rulings in the beef and banana trade disputes. In addition to denying American farmers access to the European market, the EU's actions are undermining the entire WTO Dispute Settlement process. If they are successful in ignoring such decisions, how can we expect other countries to follow trade dispute settlement rulings? How can we expect anyone in the United States to have faith in the WTO? 
   Repeatedly, I have come to the floor to raise my concerns about the EU's flagrant disregard for dispute settlement rulings in the beef and banana cases, which have clearly shown the ``Fortress Europe'' mentality against free and fair trade. Last Fall, during the Senate floor debate on the Africa trade bill, I successfully amended the legislation to create a powerful mechanism--tariff retaliation--to fight ``fortress'' mentalities and to protect our nation from illegal foreign trade practices. Today, I am pleased to say that the conference report before us now still contains my provision to strengthen the one and only weapon in our arsenal to fight WTO noncompliance. 
   The purpose of the provision is simple--to make our retaliation more effective and to compel compliance with the WTO rulings. The measure would specifically require the U.S. Trade Representative to periodically ``carousel''--or rotate--the list of goods subject to retaliation when a foreign country or countries have failed to comply with a WTO ruling. The retaliation list would be carouseled to affect other goods 120 days from the date the list is made and every 180 days, thereafter. The U.S. Trade Representative would retain ample discretion and authority to ensure that retaliation implemented by the United States remains within the levels authorized by the WTO. Also, the provision makes it clear that our Trade Representative is to structure the retaliation lists to maximize the likelihood of compliance by the losing side in trade disputes. 
   Mr. President, the WTO is one of the most important means for American businesses and producers to open foreign markets, liberalize commerce, resolve disputes, and ensure more open and fair trade. American farmers and agribusiness, for example, are major net exporters, posting exports of more than $57 billion in 1997. Of the nearly 50 complaints filed by the United States in the WTO, almost 30 percent involved agriculture. If a country or countries fail to comply with WTO rulings, American agriculture and other U.S. sectors in need of trade relief will suffer greatly. 
   It's time to fight back. While carousel retaliation is tough, it is the right response to chronic non-compliance with WTO rulings. It is the kind of response that will do more to encourage compliance with WTO rules, giving Ohio's farmers and businesses the level-playing field they deserve. 
   Overall, Mr. President, the trade bill before us is a good bill--it is good for Sub-Saharan Africa; it is good for the Caribbean Basin; and it is good for agriculture and business right here at home in the United States. In the end, this bill just makes good sense.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I have come to the floor this evening because I want to draw my colleagues' attention to a very important editorial that appeared in this morning's Washington Post. This editorial concerns international parental kidnapping. I also call my colleagues' attention to a feature article that appeared on the same subject in Sunday's Washington Post. 
   Both Sunday's article and today's editorial are very critical of the way the Federal Government has been handling international parental abduction cases. In fact, the editorial today characterizes the Government's response to these cases as ``incomprehensibly lackadaisical.'' 
   I could not have said it better myself. 
   This is an issue that I have spoken on this floor about on several different occasions. It is a matter on which our committee has held several hearings. But despite those hearings and despite those speeches, I do not think there has been anything that has explained it in as great a detail and in as heartbreaking a way as the article that appeared in Sunday's Washington Post. 
   That story involves the heartbreaking story of Joseph Cooke, who, for the last 7 years, has been unable to retrieve his three children from a German foster home. In Mr. Cooke's case, his German-born wife had taken their three children on what was supposed to be a 3-week vacation to her homeland to visit her parents. 
   One day, though, during the trip, Mrs. Cooke took her children, boarded a German train, and essentially disappeared. She called her husband and only gave him a cryptic explanation as to where she was going and what she was doing with their children. 
   Joseph contacted his wife's parents in Germany, but they gave him little help or information. What Joseph eventually discovered was that his wife had checked into a German mental health facility and had placed their children in the care of the German Youth Authority, who, in turn, put the children in a foster family. And even though Mrs. Cooke eventually left the mental health clinic and returned to the United States, the children remained with the German foster family. 
   With very little information as to the whereabouts of his children, Mr. Cooke tried desperately to get his children back. But despite the fact that the children are U.S. citizens, and were living in the United States when they were taken--despite the fact that Joseph was awarded eventual custody of the children by a U.S. court, and despite the very plain terms of the Hague Convention, an international treaty setting forth a process for the timely return of children wrongly removed or retained from their home country--German courts, in spite of that, ruled that the children were to remain in Germany. 
   The Cooke case is a perfect example of how the Hague Convention, of which I point out Germany is a signatory, just isn't working. It isn't working because the nations that have agreed to it, including the United States, refuse to make it work. 
   The United States complies with the Hague Convention. When another country makes an order, the United States, in over 80 percent of the cases, complies. That is not what I am talking about. What I am talking about is we make no attempt to enforce it. It isn't working--let me repeat--because the  nations that have agreed to it, including the United States, refuse to make it work. 
   Member countries are not complying, and, tragically, our State Department and our Justice Department are not doing anything about it. The State Department is too reluctant to use the appropriate diplomatic channels to encourage foreign nations to comply with the treaty. 
   As the Washington Post article pointed out on Sunday:  
   The State Department says it cannot enforce the Hague convention or interfere in decisions overseas. ``There are no consequences for noncompliance,'' said a U.S. official with the embassy in Germany. ``I look at it as a voluntary compliance sort of thing.'' 
   ``I look at it as a voluntary compliance sort of thing.'' 
   With that kind of attitude on behalf of our State Department, is it any wonder no country pays any attention to us? 
   ``..... a voluntary compliance sort of thing.'' 
   As a Senator and as a parent and as a grandparent, I find that kind of approach to treaty enforcement appalling and unacceptable. The fact of the matter is, international parental abduction goes far beyond Joseph Cooke's tragic situation. 
   Currently, the State Department has on file at least 1,100 cases of international parental kidnapping, when one parent illegally takes his or her child out of the United States and right out of the life of the parent left behind. 
   These kidnappings and ensuing custody battles devastate families. They are devastating not only for the left behind parent but also for the child who is denied what every child should have; that is, the love of one of his or her parents. 
   Equally devastating is that during the media hype surrounding the Elian Gonzalez case, the State Department tried to use that case as a public relations opportunity to boost their own miserable record on getting our kids back from international parental abductions. 
   Amazingly, in one media account a State Department official actually said that in cases of international parental kidnappings: ``We don't take no for an answer.'' That is simply not true. The sad reality is that both our State Department and our Justice Department are, in fact, taking no for an answer. Their actions or inactions are speaking a lot louder than their words. 
   For example, the Justice Department rarely pursues prosecution under the International Parental Kidnapping Act, and, in the last 5 years, just 62 indictments and only 13 convictions have resulted from thousands and thousands and thousands of cases of abductions. 
   Every parent who has been left behind when a spouse or former spouse has kidnapped their children knows that our Government is not making the return of those children a top and immediate priority. The message this Government--our Federal Government--continues to send to these parents is that once their children are abducted and taken out of the United States, they just don't matter anymore. 
   When I have asked the State and Justice Departments about this, when I have asked repeatedly about why they are not doing more to help these parents get their kids back, all I get are excuses. 
   Contrast that message and that inaction toward American children with the dramatic and very different message that those same officials sent by forcing, at gunpoint, the reunion of Elian Gonzalez with his dad. That, indeed, paints a very different picture. 
   The excuses are endless. State and Justice blame their inaction on complicated extradition laws. Other times, they say these cases are private disputes between parents so the Federal Government should be left out of such matters. They figure, too, that these children are really not being kidnapped by strangers --they are with a parent, after all, so what is the big deal? 
   Taken all together, these factors suggest that the State Department is more interested in maintaining positive relationships and diplomatic ties with foreign governments than in helping American parents. In essence, these agencies are saying: You may steal American kids and get away with it. 
   Quite frankly, when it comes to a stolen child, there should be no excuses. Our Federal agencies must make these abductions a top priority. They need to coordinate efforts to offer more assistance to distraught parents seeking a safe return of their children from abroad. They should begin a training program for U.S. attorneys and designate one attorney in each of their offices across our country to be responsible for these international abduction cases. 
   Additionally, I am writing to President Clinton about his upcoming meeting with the German Chancellor and am encouraging him to discuss Joseph Cooke's case, and the other cases that we have pending in Germany, as well as the overall pattern of German noncompliance with the Hague Convention. 
   Further, with regard to the Hague Convention, specifically, in March, I submitted a resolution which now has the support of 35 Senate cosponsors to encourage all of the countries that have signed the Hague Convention, particularly those countries that consistently violate the convention--namely, Austria, Germany, and Sweden--to comply fully with both the letter and the spirit of their obligations under the convention that they signed. 
   This resolution we have introduced urges countries to return children under that convention without reaching the underlying custody dispute and to remove barriers to parental visitation. I am pleased to report that the resolution has been approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and is awaiting floor consideration. 
   Governance is about setting priorities. Policymaking is about setting priorities. Yes, our State Department has a lot to do and, yes, our Justice Department has a lot to do and, yes, there is no real teeth in the Hague Convention, other than international opinion, other than good, hard negotiations between countries. What I am asking the State Department and the Justice Department to do is begin to prioritize these cases. 
   The Attorney General of the United States should say to every U.S. attorney across this country that parental kidnapping cases should be at the top of the list of your priorities. Pay attention and deal with these cases. The Secretary of State should say to our embassies overseas, to our ambassadors, yes, trade is important; yes, immigration issues are important; yes, whatever is the topic of the day is important as you sit down and discuss these issues with the President of the country you are dealing with, or the Prime Minister; these are all important things; but also don't forget the children who have been stolen from their parents in the United States are important, also, and they should have a high priority. 
   So it is not an excuse that should be accepted by the parents of these children, nor by this Senate, by this Congress, nor by the American people, that we just don't have time to do this, or it just can't be enforced or other things are going on. This should be a priority. 
   I am calling on our Government today to make judgments and set priorities. Our children should always be our first priority. I think it is ironic that it is easier today to get our ambassadors and our State Department engaged on a trade matter than it is on a matter regarding the stealing of one of our children. The stealing of our children is important, and it is equally as important, I hope, and would be so considered by the Justice Department and by the State Department as a trade matter or the enforcement or the prosecution of any number of other types of cases. 
   In the end, we are succeeding in bringing parentally abducted children back to their homes in the U.S. Our Federal Government must take an active role in their return. Ultimately, our Government has an obligation to these parents and, more important, to the children who have been kidnapped. It is time our Government agencies put American parents and their children first. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, next week we begin the debate on the Education Opportunities Act. I had the opportunity yesterday to come to the Senate floor and talk about one aspect of that bill. That had to do with the whole issue of supporting our teachers, attracting the best teachers to education. Today I would like to talk about a second component of that bill having to do with safer schools. Good teachers, safe schools: It is really getting back to basics. 
   We have a drug crisis in this country. Drugs are readily available and, tragically, children are using them. In fact, more children today are using and experimenting with drugs than 10 years ago--many, many more. Let's look at the facts. 
   According to the 1999 Monitoring the Future study, since 1992, overall drug use among 10th graders has increased 55 percent. Marijuana and hashish use among 10th graders has increased 91 percent. Heroin use among 10th graders has increased 92 percent. That is just since 1992. And cocaine use among 10th graders has increased 133 percent. 
   With an abundant supply, drug traffickers are looking to increase their sales by targeting younger and younger children, creating a whole new generation of addicts. Drug dealers are now targeting children not only in our urban areas but in every community in our land. 
   The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University issued a disturbing report earlier this year. It had to do with the rapidly rising rate of drug use among youth in the rural areas of our country. The figures are astounding. If anyone thinks it cannot happen in your community--``it can't happen in my community''--take a look at 
   these figures. 
   Their study found that eighth graders in rural America are 34 percent  more likely to smoke marijuana than those in urban areas; 50 percent more likely to use powder cocaine; and 83 percent more likely to use crack cocaine. 
   These statistics represent an assault on our children, on our families, and on the future of our country. Let me point out what is happening on the streets of Cincinnati in my home State. In 1990, there were 19 heroin-related arrests in Cincinnati, OH. Last year there were 464 arrests. Law enforcement officers in Cincinnati understand the reason for this surge. Colombia produces low-cost, high-purity heroin, making it more and more the drug of choice. And because of our Government's inadequate emphasis on drug interdiction and eradication efforts, that Colombian heroin is making its way across our borders, into our country, and into Cincinnati, OH, and Cleveland, OH, and Detroit and Los Angeles. 
   Sure, this is just one urban area we are talking about, Cincinnati, but if there is a heroin problem in Cincinnati, there is a heroin problem in New York and LA and every metropolitan area across our great country. 
   I believe what is happening in Cincinnati and across all parts of America is a result of a national drug control approach that has not emphasized the importance of a balanced attack against drug use. To be effective, our drug control strategy needs to be a coordinated effort that directs and balances resources and support among three areas of attack: domestic law enforcement, international drug interdiction, and demand reduction. 
   When we talk about demand reduction, we are talking about several things. Demand reduction needs to consist of drug prevention, drug treatment, and drug education. We need to involve all levels of government in this three-pronged attack--the Federal, State, and local--as well as nonprofit private organizations, charitable groups, community groups. 
   What all this means is that to effectively stop our kids from getting and using illicit drugs we must balance the allocation of resources towards efforts to stop those who produce drugs, those who transport illegal drugs, and those who deal drugs on our streets, and, yes, even in our schools. 
   Because the threat of violence and drug abuse in our schools is all too real, we must get to our kids before the drug dealers do. We can do this. We can give America's kids a fighting chance through coordinated efforts between our schools and our communities. Next week, when the Senate begins debating the education reform legislation that I referenced a moment ago, we will have a great opportunity to enhance a very important program designed to educate our kids and our communities about the dangers of drug use. 
   This bill includes a section that I helped write to make much needed improvements, the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program. This program, which was originally part of Ronald Reagan's 1986 Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act, is intended to assist every single school district in the country to develop an antidrug program in their respective schools. While well intentioned, this program has been far from perfect. 
   I had the opportunity a few years ago when I served in the House of Representatives to be on the National Commission for Safe and Drug-Free Schools. We looked at how this program had worked. We found many problems connected with it. The bill we have written and will be on the floor next week I believe will go a long way to solving the problems that the national commission pointed out in 1990 and that we have seen since then. These problems need to be corrected, and I believe this bill will go a long way to do that. 
   Since the inception of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program in 1986, we have pumped $6 billion into this program, despite the fact the program has lacked accountability, giving us no real mechanism to determine its effectiveness. Instead, we have seen some of our tax dollars pay for questionable drug use ``prevention'' and ``education'' activities, such as puppet shows, tickets to Disneyland, dunking booths, and magic shows. No matter how well intentioned, these are not effective antidrug education tools. Because there has been little effort to ensure program accountability through research-based measures, the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program has not been as effective as it could have been, or as it should be. 
   It is critical the Senate pass education reform legislation that includes improvements to the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program, improvements that will empower America's families and America's teachers with the information, with the training, with the resources they need to help our children resist the temptation of drugs. That is why our section in this bill would, first and most importantly, increase accountability measures to ensure that assistance is targeted to effective research-based programs. That means programs that actually work and have been tested and measured and we know work. My language will make sure schools and communities assess local problems accurately, apply research-based solutions, measure outcomes with reliable tools, and evaluate program effectiveness. 
   Second, my language would improve the effectiveness of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program by requiring schools to directly work with parents, with local law enforcement agencies, local government agencies, local faith-based organizations, and other community groups to develop and implement antidrug and antiviolence strategies. 
   As we all know, drug abuse and violence among young people is a community problem, it is a local problem, and it requires a local community-based solution. That is why the entire community needs to be involved in the creation and execution of programs to fight youth drug abuse and violence. Our bill requires the schools to reach out to the local community, to work with other people who are fighting drugs, to have a true community-based approach. 
   Speaking of fighting youth drug abuse and violence, no one is fighting harder than the first lady of the State of Ohio, Hope Taft. Hope has been very instrumental in the creation of this section of our bill. I publicly thank her for her great 
   work. She was really instrumental in creating a voice for community-based antidrug organizations. Hope Taft's efforts have raised awareness of the dangers of youth drug abuse and violence in our schools. 
   Also, I am pleased several community groups have indicated their support for our provision in title IV of the bill we will be debating next week. I will name a few: The American Counseling Association, the American School Health Association, the Community Antidrug Coalition of America, the National Network for Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities, and Ohio Parents for Drug Free Youth. These are just a few of the organizations that have helped us craft this bill. 
   Third and finally, our language in title IV would give States greater flexibility on targeting assistance to the schools particularly in need. Each State has unique drug prevention challenges, and this bill provides the States with flexibility to target funds to all of their schools but focus on those schools with the greatest drug violence problems. This flexibility is very significant and very important. 
   Contrast the administration's proposal with our proposal: They want each State to cut by half the number of school districts that benefit from the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Communities Act. Let me make it clear; under the administration's proposal which they sent up to Capitol Hill, half the school districts in the country would lose their funding. I think that is a mistake. Reinvesting in an improved Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program is a critical part of restoring effectiveness and purpose to our national drug policy. 
   Ultimately, if we do not restore effectiveness, more and more children will use drugs, leading to greater levels of violence, criminal activity, and delinquency. Unless we take action now, unless we take the necessary steps to reverse these disturbing trends, unless we restore balance to our drug control policy, we will be sacrificing today's youth and our country's future, and that is just plain wrong. 
   Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I yield the remainder of my time to my colleague, Senator GORTON.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, following morning business, it is expected the Senate will receive the veto message on the nuclear waste bill from the White House. Under the rule, when that message is received, the Senate will immediately begin debate on overriding the President's veto. It is hoped an agreement can be made with regard to debate time so that a vote will be scheduled. 
   As a reminder, the cloture motion on the substitute amendment to the marriage tax penalty bill is still pending. That vote will occur immediately following the adoption of the motion to proceed to the victims' rights resolution. Therefore, votes are possible during this afternoon's session of the Senate. Senators will be notified as those votes are scheduled.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we have a great opportunity ahead of us. Next week, the Senate will begin floor debate on the Education Opportunities Act--a bill that will help America's children by improving the quality of their education. 
   While education policy is primarily a local and State responsibility, the Federal Government does have a role to play. I am looking forward to discussing just what the Federal Government can do to improve the quality of the education our children receive. Few things are more important to our children's future than the quality of their education. 
   Every child in this country, regardless of race, economic status, or where that child lives, deserves the opportunity for a quality education. Yet far too many children, especially in our inner cities and Appalachia, simply are not getting the quality education they deserve. 
   We need more good teachers. We need safer schools. We need college access for all students who want to go to college. 
   We must, as a nation, attract the smartest and the most dedicated of our students to the profession of teaching. Yes, we certainly have to invest in  computers, new books, and new buildings. But we cannot ignore the single most important resource in any classroom--the teacher. 
   I have recalled before on this Senate floor something that my own high school principal, Mr. John Malone, told me 37 years ago. We were about to go into a new building. Everyone was excited; everyone was happy. 
   Mr. Malone came in and said to our class: We are about ready to go into this new building. We are all excited about it. It is a great thing. We have prepared for this for a long time. I want you to always remember one thing: In education, there are only two things that really matter. One is a student who wants to learn; the other is a good teacher. Everything else is interesting, maybe helpful. The only thing that really matters is that teacher and that student. 
   What Mr. Malone told our class 37 years ago was right then, and it is still correct today. We all know a good teacher has the power to fundamentally change the course of our life. Each one of us, if we are lucky, can recall one teacher or two or maybe three or many teachers who fundamentally changed our life, who we think about when we do things, whose voice still comes back to us, whether that is an English teacher telling us how to write or maybe something our history teacher, maybe later on a professor, told us. Each of us can recall that teacher who changed our life. 
   Those of us who are parents know how important a good teacher is. We know what happens when occasionally our child gets a teacher who just doesn't want to teach or who is not so good. We know what impact that has on a child as well. When you get right down to it, good teachers are second only to good parents in helping children to learn. Therefore, any effort to restore confidence and improve quality in education must begin with a national recommitment to teaching as a profession. This bill does that. 
   First, we must recommit ourselves to attracting the best, the most motivated of our students to the teaching profession. That means offering teachers the salaries and, yes, the respect they deserve. Second, we must insist our colleges and our university education departments aggressively reexamine how they prepare our future teachers. Some are doing it; some are changing. But all need to reexamine what they are doing. 
   Third, our teachers must have the resources available to allow them to continue their education after they enter the profession. The teaching profession is no different than any other profession. You continue to learn throughout the years. For example, in my home State of Ohio, in Cincinnati, teachers have access to the Mayerson Academy, which is a partnership with area businesses and the school system to provide teachers with additional training and additional professional development. This kind of support should be available to teachers in every community in this country. 
   That is why, in the bill we will begin debating next week, I have included a provision that would authorize funding for the creation and expansion of partnerships between schools and communities to create teacher training academies such as the Mayerson Academy in Cincinnati. It works in Cincinnati. It will work in other communities. This is the kind of initiative that will help our teachers and our communities work together to improve the quality of teaching and, ultimately then, to improve the quality of education. 
   There are other things we need to do and other things this bill does address. This is a good bill. When Members begin to hear the debate next week, I think they will understand how much work has gone into it and how it will impact the quality of education in this country. 
   We need to make it easier to recruit future teachers from the military, from industry, and from research institutions, 
   people who have had established careers, who have had real-world experience, and then who decide, at the age of 40 or 45 or 50, that they are going to retire from that profession and enter the teaching profession. We need to make it easier for them to do it. 
   Getting this kind of talent in the classroom is easier said than done. For example, if Colin Powell wanted to teach a high school history class or if Albert Einstein were alive today and wanted to teach a high school physics class, requirements in some States would keep these professionals--I would say in most States--from immediately going into the classroom, despite their obvious expertise in their fields. That is why we have included language in this bill to allow the use of Federal funds under title II for alternative teacher certification programs. This provision will allow States to create and expand different types of alternative certification efforts. 
   Additionally, the committee approved a separate amendment that I offered--and that is now part of the bill--that would ensure the continuation of a specific program designed to assist retired military personnel who are trying to enter the teaching profession. This is a great program. It is called Troops to Teachers. It simply helps retiring members of the military gain the State certification necessary to teach. It also helps them to find the school districts in greatest need of teachers. It is a program that has worked. It is a program that is improved in this bill, and it is a program that is continued in this bill. 
   Troops to Teachers has succeeded in bringing dedicated, mature, and experienced individuals into the classroom. In fact, when school administrators were asked to rate Troops to Teachers participants in their own schools, most of the administrators said the former military personnel turned teachers were well above the average and were among the best teachers in their schools. 
   Since 1994, over 3,600 service members, by going through the Troops to Teachers program, have made the transition from the military into the classroom. When we analyze who those people are, who is going into the classroom, who is going through the Troops to Teachers program, what we find is they are just the people we need. They are people with real-world experiences. They are people with expertise many times in math and science, something we desperately need in our schools. They are disproportionate to the population as far as the minority population, so it means we are putting more minority teachers into our classrooms. We are also doing something many professionals tell us we need to do; that is, try to get more males into the primary schools. Troops to Teachers is doing that as well. It is an exciting program that is continued in this bill. It is improved in this bill. It is one of the things that makes this bill a very solid bill. We need to ensure this kind of program, one with proven results, continues well into the future. 
   Separate from the difficulties of the teacher certification process I have described, I am also concerned about the fact that many of our most experienced teachers, the teachers who in many cases are the most senior, are about to retire. The fact is, these experienced teachers are also the best resources in our schools. It is very important that we benefit from their experience before it is too late, before they leave the teaching profession. That is why I included language in the bill that 
   will allow the use of Federal funds for new and existing teacher mentoring programs. New teachers benefit greatly by learning from the knowledge and the experience of veteran teachers. By pairing new teachers with our schools' most experienced and most respected teachers, those who have years of knowledge and expertise and experience in this profession, we can help retain our brightest and talented young teachers. 
   Finally, the bill contains my language to expand the mission of the Eisenhower National Clearinghouse, a national center located at Ohio State University that provides teachers with the best teacher training and curriculum materials on the subjects of math and science. The clearinghouse, which screens, evaluates, and distributes the multiple training and course materials currently available, makes it easy for teachers to quickly and efficiently access material for the classrooms. My provision in title II expands the clearinghouse's mission to go beyond math and science, to now, under this bill, include subjects such as history and English. 
   The bill we will consider next week takes a number of positive steps towards improving the quality of those who make the commitment to teach.  What this bill is about is expanding the support network available to our teachers: support for people in other professions seeking a second career as a teacher; support for teachers seeking to improve subject knowledge or classroom skills; support for teachers seeking new ways to teach math or science or history; and finally, support for new teachers from experienced teachers. 
   In short, with this bill, we provide the kinds of resources that enable the teaching profession to build upon its commitment to teaching excellence. Mr. President, as we debate the merits of the Educational Opportunities Act, the bottom line, I believe, is that we need to get back to basics: good teachers, safe schools. That is what this bill is about--good teachers, safe schools. Parents will not have peace of mind unless they know their children's teachers are qualified to teach, that they are good teachers, and that their children's schools provide safe learning environments. It is that simple. That is what parents expect. 
   Today, I have talked about teaching and what this bill does to assist the teaching profession. Tomorrow, I hope to have the opportunity to talk about the second component of this bill which is safe schools. Good teachers, safe schools. We need to get back to the basics, and that is what this bill does. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today because I am troubled. Guns are falling into the wrong hands. It's killing our children. It's killing our friends and our neighbors. It's creating mayhem in communities across America. That's why I'm introducing Project Exile: The Safe Streets and Neighborhoods Act of 2000. 
   It's no secret that gun control measures are very controversial and are subject to a great deal of debate--as they should be. But, in the heat of that debate, we must not lose sight of the real issue--gun violence. There is nothing controversial about protecting our children, our families and our communities by keeping guns out of the wrong hands--the hands of armed criminals--not law-abiding citizens, Mr. President, but criminals. 
   The Safe Streets and Neighborhoods Act offers a simple, commonsense approach to fighting gun violence. My bill would provide $100 million in grants over 5 years to those states agreeing to impose mandatory minimum 5-year jail sentences on criminals who use or possess an illegal gun. As an alternative, a state can also qualify for the grants by turning armed criminals over for federal prosecution under existing firearms laws. Therefore, a state has the option of having armed felons prosecuted in state or federal courts. Qualifying states can use their grants for any purpose that would strengthen the ability of their criminal or juvenile justice systems to deal with violent criminals. 
   Back in 1991, the Federal Government implemented a program to aim antigun violence efforts at the root of the problem--at criminals. This program--known as project Triggerlock--directed every U.S. attorney to coordinate with federal, state, and local investigators to bring federal weapons charges against armed criminals. Sentences for these prosecutions wee generally more severe than they would have been under state laws. The program was hugely successful. In fact, simply by making gun prosecutions a federal priority, starting in 1991, Project Triggerlock took away over 2,000 guns from violent felons in just 18 months. 
   Tragically, Mr. President, despite the success of Project Triggerlock, the current administration has not aggressively prosecuted all armed criminals. Between 1992 and 1998, for example, the number of gun cases filed for prosecution dropped from 7,048 to about 3,807--that's a 46-percent decrease. As a result, the number of federal criminal convictions for firearms offenses have fallen dramatically. 
   Even worse, some federal firearms laws are almost never enforced by this administration. While Brady law background checks have stopped nearly 300,000 prohibited purchasers of firearms from buying guns, less than one-tenth of one percent have been prosecuted. Similarly, federal criminal prosecutions for possession of a firearm on school grounds numbered just eight in 1998, despite the fact that 6,000 individuals were caught carrying guns to school. There's something wrong with this picture, Mr. President, something terribly wrong. 
   I believe most Americans would agree that we 
   should take guns out of the hands of armed criminals. I believe that most Americans would agree that criminals who possess a firearm or use a firearm during the commission of a violent crime or a serious drug trafficking offense should face severe penalties. And, Mr. President, I also believe that most Americans would favor legislation that offers a single, noncontroversial, commensense approach to fighting gun violence. 
   So, today, I, along with my colleagues, introduce Project Exile: The Safe Streets and Neighbors Act, which builds on the previous success of programs like Project Triggerlock and offers the kind of practical solution we need to thwart gun crimes. 
   This approach works, Mr. President. For example, in 1997, Virginia revived Project Triggerlock under the name ``Project Exile.'' Specifically, the city of Richmond and the U.S. attorney implemented a program based on one simple principle: any criminal caught with a gun serves a minimum mandatory sentence of 5 years in federal prison. Period. End of story. As a result, gun-toting criminals are being prosecuted six times faster, and serving sentences up to four times longer than they otherwise would under state law. Moreover, the homicide rate in Richmond already has dropped 40 percent. 
   It is clear that programs like Project Triggerlock and Virginia's Project Exile work, while at the same time being very simple. But still, federal gun prosecutions have declined considerably during this administration because it has not emphasized these programs. Why? I have repeatedly questioned Attorney General Reno and her deputies about this decline, and their standard response is that the Department of Justice is focusing on so-called ``high-level'' offenders, instead of ``low-level'' offenders who commit a crime with a gun. With all due respect, I consider that response to be bureaucratic nonsense. One thing I learned as Greene County Prosecutor in my home state of Ohio is that any criminal who commits a crime with a gun is a high-level offender. And, I'm willing to bet that any citizen who has ever been a victim of a gun-crime would agree. 
   Furthermore, the idea that there are a lot of so-called ``low-level'' offenders, who commit only one crime with a gun, is just plain wrong. The average armed criminal commits 160 crimes a year; that is an average of three crimes per week. These people are, by themselves, walking crime waves. 
   Along the same lines, Attorney General Reno recently said that she would aggressively prosecute armed criminals, but only if they commit a violent crime. Again, that type of law enforcement policy just does not make sense. Current law prohibits felons from possessing guns--we should enforce the law. We should aggressively prosecute armed criminals before they use those guns to injure and kill people. 
   We need to take all of these armed criminals off the streets. That is how we will prevent crime and save lives. Why wait for armed criminals to commit more heinous crimes before we prosecute them to the full extent of the law? Why wait when we can do something that will make a difference now, before another Ohioan--or any American--becomes a victim of gun violence. 
   Every state should have the opportunity to implement Project Exile in their high-crime communities. The bill that we are introducing today will make this proven, commonsense approach to reducing gun violence available to every state. Programs like Project Triggerlock and Project Exile will take guns out of the hands of violent criminals. They will make our neighborhoods safer. They will save lives. 
   We can take concrete steps toward making our streets and neighborhoods safer from armed criminals by passing the ``Safe Streets and Neighborhoods Act.'' I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support and pass this legislation. It's time to protect our children and our families. It's time to get guns out of the wrong hands. It's time we take back our neighborhoods and our communities from the criminals and take action to stop gun crimes.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution urging compliance with the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Joining me in introducing this resolution are Senators HELMS, WARNER, THURMOND, ROBB, ROCKEFELLER, THOMAS, DODD, LANDRIEU, and HATCH. Congressmen NICK LAMPSON of Texas and STEVE CHABOT of Ohio have introduced a similar measure in the House. 
   The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction sets forth the legal mechanism for returning internationally abducted children to their countries of habitual residence, where custody can then be decided. Fifty-four countries, including the United States are signatories to the Convention. 
   According to the State Department, each year the United States sends an estimated 90% of kidnapped children back to foreign countries. But, the rate at which other nations belonging to the Convention return American children is much lower. A State Department report singles out several countries for their noncompliance with the accord, including Austria, Honduras, Mauritius, Mexico and Sweden. Notably absent from the report, however, was Germany, which also has established a disturbing pattern of noncompliance. According to ``Insight Magazine,'' State Department records show that of the 243 Hague cases filed in Germany, there were only 40 court-ordered returns. 
   Last fall, the General Accounting Office (GAO) testified before the House International Relations Committee on their preliminary review of the federal government's response to international parental child abduction. They cited noncompliance with the Hague Convention on the part of other countries as one of the problems with our federal government's response to international parental kidnappings. According to GAO's testimony: ``The State Department acknowledges that more systematic and aggressive diplomatic efforts are needed to address problems with the Hague Convention.'' The GAO also noted that while increased diplomatic efforts are needed, recommendations developed by the State Department and Department of Justice to rectify the noncompliance problem ``seek to review, study, and explore Hague implementation issues, but fail to identify how these activities will actually help solve Hague implementation problems.'' 
   What we have to remember in any case where a parent abducts a child is that each of these cases involves the  destruction of a family. A good illustration of this is what happened to Tom Sylvester of Cincinnati, the father of a little girl named Carina, whom he has seldom seen since his ex-wife abducted her 
   from Michigan in 1995, and took her to Austria. The day after the kidnapping, Mr. Sylvester filed a complaint with the State Department and started legal proceedings under the terms of the Hague Convention. An Austrian court heard his complaint, and the court ordered the return of Carina to Mr. Sylvester. However, this court order was never enforced and Carina's mother took the child into hiding. Eventually, though, when Carina's mother surfaced with the child, the Austrian courts reversed their decision on returning Carina to her father, finding that Carina had ``resettled into her new environment''--a decision clearly contrary to the terms of the Hague Convention. 
   While the State Department recently has indicated some willingness to work more aggressively through diplomatic channels in individual cases, like that of Tom Sylvester, we must do more to improve compliance with the Hague Convention overall. The resolution we are introducing today encourages all of the contracting parties, particularly those countries that consistently violate the Convention--namely Austria, Germany and Sweden--to comply fully with both the letter and the spirit of their obligations under the Convention. In order to improve compliance rates, the resolution urges all Hague signatories to educate their judges and law enforcement personnel about the Convention. And, finally, this resolution urges countries to return children under the Convention, without reaching the underlying custody dispute, and to remove barriers to parental visitations. 
   Mr. President, as a parent and grandparent, I cannot begin to imagine the nightmare that so many American parents face when their children are kidnapped by a current or former spouse and taken abroad. But, tragically, this is a very real and daily nightmare for hundreds of parents right here in this country. That's why the resolution I have introduced is critical to encouraging the safe return of children to the United States. It gives us an opportunity to help make a positive difference in the lives of children and their families. I urge my colleagues to support it with their cosponsorship.

    Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two pieces of legislation that would impact the lives of many at-risk children living in foster care. In an effort to move forward and figure out what Congress needs to do next to help improve the operation of the child welfare system following the 1997 enactment of the Adoption and Safe Families Act, my friend and colleague Senator ROCKEFELLER and I, as well as Senators LANDRIEU, LEVIN, KERRY, KERREY, WELLSTONE, COLINS, BOXER, CHAFEE, LINCOLN and BINGAMAN, are introducing the strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act and the Training and Knowledge Ensure Children a Risk-free Environment (TAKE CARE) Act. 
   Before I talk about these bills, specifically, it's important to understand how we arrived at where we are today with regard to the child welfare agencies and the court system. Back in 1997, I was very involved in one of the success stories of the 105th Congress: The passage of the Adoption and Safe Families Act. This subcommittee played a critical role in shaping that legislation. This law has many goals: First, it encourages safe and permanent family placements for abused and neglected children; second, it makes it clear that the health and safety of the child always must come first in any decision involving a child in abuse and neglect cases; and third, it decreases the amount of time that a child spends in the foster care system. Specifically, the law requires initiation of proceedings to terminate parental rights for any child who has been in the foster care system for fifteen (15) of the last twenty-two (22) months. 
   The Adoption and Safe Families Act represented a significant change in child welfare laws. Perhaps more important, we were changing the way judges and child advocates looked at child welfare cases. This represented a change in the culture of child welfare, as we know it, and forced the system to stop and rethink its processes and its purposes. 
   We all knew this law was not a quick nor a complete fix--more work would be necessary to make the law a success and to implement a new way of thinking about child welfare--a way of thinking that says that it is no longer acceptable to place a child in long-term foster care without a plan for permanent placement. We knew that a law that simply tells judges that the health and safety of the child must be paramount would not necessarily be reflected in judicial decisions. To get there, training needs to be available so the law effectively becomes a part of judge's decisionmaking process. 
   A tragic local case--the death of twenty-three month old Brianna Blackmond--demonstrates the need for this training. Brianna had been placed in foster care at the age of four months, due to her mother's neglect. In January of this year, Brianna was killed just seventeen days after being returned to her mother from foster care. In the aftermath of this tragedy, DC Superior Court Judges told the Washington Post about the agony they feel in making child welfare decisions. One of the judges quoted in the article said this: ``These cases are, for me, the most difficult thing we do. We feel the least trained and skilled at it.'' 
   These judges are making tough, life-changing decisions for all parties involved. We have a responsibility to make sure they are trained properly and feel confident about those decisions. 
   When we passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act, we also knew that the imposition of reduced timelines would create additional pressure on an already overburdened court system. These timelines, however, are very important to the welfare of the children involved. Foster care, after all, was meant to be a temporary solution--not a way of life. 
   These timelines can work only if the courts are able to process cases in a timely manner. To give you an idea of what the courts are up against, consider this: When the Family Court was established in New York in 1962, it reviewed 96,000 cases the first year. By 1997, the case load had increased to 670,000 cases. The courts must have a manageable case load so that an appropriate decision can be made in every case after all of the facts have been heard. We cannot rush decision making in these cases--a child's life is at risk. 
   We also knew that the courts needed information to make the best possible decision for the child. This problem was demonstrated in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. Until recently, the court had no central clerk's file, so there was no way of tracking the location of a particular file. If the file could not be found on the day of a hearing or review, it would result in a postponement, often adding months to a child's stay in foster care. It is undisputed that children need permanency as quickly as possible. It is simply unconscionable that children should be trapped in foster care by a bureaucratic nightmare of paperwork. 
   We need to move forward and help improve the operation of the child welfare system, and in particular, the courts. The legislation Senator ROCKEFELLER and I are introducing today will help move us in the right direction. Taken together, our bills would provide competitive grants to courts to create computerized case tracking systems, as well as grants to reduce pending backlogs of abuse and neglect cases so that courts are better 
   able to comply with the timelines established in the Adoption and Safe Families Act. These bills also would allow judges, attorneys, and court personnel to qualify for training under Title IV-E's existing training provisions and would expand the CASA program to underserved and urban areas, so that more children are able to benefit from its services. 
   Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that when Congress passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act, I believed it was a good start. Congress, however, would have to do more to make sure that every child has the opportunity to live in a safe, stable, loving and permanent home. One of the essential ingredients is an efficiently operating court system--a system that puts the principles embodied in the law into practice. After all, that's where a lot of delays occur. As well intentioned as the strict timelines of the 1997 law are, mandatory filing dates are not enough to promote child placement permanency if the court docket is too clogged to move cases through the system, or judges aren't changing their routine in a way that reflects the importance of these timelines and the necessity of placing the child's safety first. 
   The critical next step is to help the courts improve administrative efficiency and effectiveness--goals of the Adoption and Safe Families Act. I believe that our legislation can do that. I encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation.

    Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, February is designated as ``Black History Month.'' As part of the celebration of African American achievements and contributions to our country, I would like to draw your attention to the heroic and courageous acts of the African Americans who served in the Ninth and Tenth Horse Cavalry Units of the United States Army. 
   These units were established at the end of the Civil War and composed of former slaves. Their first charge was to maintain trails and protect settlers from Native Americans during the period of westward expansion. The units were called to combative service during the wars against the Native Americans, where they were also given the name of ``Buffalo Soldiers.'' 
   During the Spanish American War, the Buffalo Soldiers were among Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders. In 1916, they crossed into Mexico under the direction of General John J. Pershing. At a time when the majority of the troops fighting in Mexico were from the South, these soldiers faced many internal obstacles and discriminatory actions, even while defending our country. 
   The Buffalo Solders were last called into service during World War II. The soldiers went to North Africa, Iran, and Italy and held various positions as combat engineers and paratroopers, among others. When the Army feared a Japanese invasion, the Buffalo Soldiers were placed along the rugged border terrain of the Baja Peninsula and protected dams, power stations, and rail lines to ensure the safety of crucial war industries in San Diego. 
   Currently, there are twenty-one existing chapters of the 9th and 10th Horse Cavalry associations, one in Germany and twenty in the United States. 
   Mr. President, I am submitting a resolution today to honor these brave men through the creation of a commemorative postage stamp. This stamp is a way to pay tribute to the Buffalo Soldiers' great acts of courage and dedication to our country. It is my hope that this stamp can serve as a reminder of their valor and to help teach future generations about their contributions to our nation. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor not only the birthday of our great nation's first president, George Washington, but all presidents who followed in his foot steps. I am introducing the Presidential Sites Improvement Act of 2000, which would create a new and innovative partnership with public and private entities to preserve and maintain Presidential birthplaces, homes, memorials, and tombs. Our Presidents have contributed so much to our country, and we have much to learn from them. It is fitting that we recognize their contributions as leaders of our country. 
   Mr. President, there are numerous sites across the nation that pay tribute to our nation's chief executives, but the majority of these sites are not owned by the National Park Service. This means that these sites generally do not receive federal support. These sites must rely on donations, state and local assistance, and private endowments to pay for staff, maintenance, and restoration projects. Some of these sites have large endowments for operation expenses. Unfortunately, many other sites have a very difficult time making ends meet. In fact, many of these sites delay necessary capital improvement projects because site managers simply don't have the resources to pay for them. Over time, maintenance neglect will cause these historic sites to slowly fall apart. 
   I have visited many of the Presidential historic sites throughout my home state of Ohio, a state that has been the home of eight presidents. It is disturbing to see at the Ulysses S. Grant birthplace the discoloration throughout the house and falling plaster because of water damage. At the home of President Warren Harding, the famous front porch where then candidate Harding gave his campaign speeches actually began to pull away from the house. Fortunately, we were able to obtain the funding to prevent these two historic treasures from deteriorating further. However, by providing some federal assistance for maintenance projects today, we can help prevent larger maintenance problems tomorrow. 
   Mr. President, these Presidential sites are far too important to let them slowly decay. My legislation would authorize grants, administered by the National Park Service, for maintenance and improvement projects on presidential sites that are not federally owned or managed. A portion of the funds would be set aside for sites that are in need of emergency assistance. To administer this new program, this legislation would establish a five member committee, including the Director of the National Park Service, a member of the Trust for Historic Preservation, and a state historic preservation officer. This committee would make grant recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior. Each grant would require that half of the funds come from non-federal sources. Up to $5 million would be made available annually. 
   With this legislation, we can do more than just set one day aside to honor our country's dedicated leaders. We can make a lasting commitment to preserve their memory and contributions for generations to come. Our children and grandchildren should have the opportunity to understand the richness of our country's history. If we do not make efforts to maintain these Presidential sites, we will lose these treasures forever. The funds given to these sites would be a great tribute to our nation's past and a lasting asset to our nation's future. 
   Our Presidents have shaped this country, so it is fitting that we recognize their contributions as leaders. I invite my colleagues to join me, along with my colleagues from Virginia, Senators WARNER and ROBB, in cosponsoring this legislation.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today with my friend and colleague from Illinois, Senator DURBIN, to introduce legislation that would authorize the issuance of the organ and tissue donation awareness ``semi-postal'' stamp. With 67,000 people on the organ donation waiting list, we have no time to lose in educating the public about the importance of life-giving organ and tissue donations. 
   In August 1998, as a result of strong public and congressional interest, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 32-cent organ and tissue donation commemorative stamp. But, just five months later, the postal rate increased to 33-cents. To use the stamp, that meant purchasers would have to buy an additional one-cent stamp to make up the postage difference. Yet, despite this hassle, more than 47 million of the 50 million stamps originally printed have been purchased, demonstrating the strong demand for an organ and tissue donation awareness postage stamp. 
   Since the U.S. Postal Service does not re-issue commemorative stamps, we are seeking authorization for a ``semi-postal'' stamp. This stamp would sell for up to 25 percent above the value of a first-class stamp, regardless of the price of the first-class stamp, itself. The surplus revenues would be directed to programs that increase organ and tissue donation awareness. The decision to donate an organ or tissue is a life-saving one. However, it is frequently one that family members and loved ones fail to communicate to one another. Every effort we make to remind people that this is a decision that should be communicated before a tragedy strikes is an effort toward saving lives. Whether it is an organ and tissue donation postage stamp or a box that drivers can mark as they renew their drivers' licenses, they are steps that raise awareness of the importance of communicating to family and friends the decision to become an organ or tissue donor. 
   I would like to thank my colleague, Senator DURBIN, for joining me in introducing this legislation, and Senators ABRAHAM, BAUCUS, CLELAND, DODD, and LEVIN for their co-sponsorship. I have appreciated their support for this bill and for their tremendous work on behalf of organ and tissue donation awareness. I would also like to thank a number of organ and tissue donation groups who support this legislation--the Minority Organ Tissue Transplant Education Program (MOTTEP); the National Kidney Foundation (NKF); the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS); Transplant Recipients International Organization, Inc. (TRIO); the Coalition on Donation; Hadassah; the Eye Bank Association of America; the American Society of Transplantation; the American Society of Transplant Surgeons; LifeBanc; and the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations. 
   I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this important legislation. Time is of the essence. The waiting list for organs includes 67,000 people, with a new name added to that list every 16 minutes. Moreover, ten to twelve people die every day waiting for an organ to become available. There is simply no time to lose. Every effort we make to increase, and in this case help generate, funds for organ and tissue donation awareness will help to save someone's life.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, for the past several months I have served as a member of the House-Senate conference on H.R. 1554, the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999, which has been reported as a part of H.R. 3194, the District of Columbia Appropriations Act. The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act is a complicated and technical bill, but at its heart lies a simple premise--to protect interests of consumers by allowing more choices in the market for television providers. The conference agreement does this by allowing satellite companies the same opportunity to provide local signals that cable providers currently enjoy--and this increased competition should lead to better prices and better services for consumers. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the act. 
   As is to be expected in any complex piece of legislation, there were a number of difficult issues, and many public policy goals to be considered. The most important of these public policy goals is to protect the interests of consumers, and we needed to consider two factors in that regard--enhancing consumer choice in television service, and protecting the local television stations that so many rely on for their news, traffic, weather and sports. Accordingly, the conference agreement features a number of compromises that aim to protect both of these consumer interests. 
   Perhaps the best example of this is the so-called ``must carry'' provision. This provision requires that if a multi-channel video provider (for example cable, or satellite) is carrying any broadcast signals in a given market, that provider must carry all broadcast signals in a given market. This requirement protects local television stations by assuring that their signals will be carried, whether consumers are purchasing satellite service or cable service. At first this may limit the number of markets that satellite providers can reach, but as technology and satellite capacity increase we are confident that satellite service, and the benefits of local signal competition, will reach more and more markets. This provision does not go into effect until January 1, 2002, in order to give the satellite companies time to further develop their technology and improve their product for consumers. 
   In the meantime, this act offers a number of other benefits to consumers. It sets the copyright rate for local signals at zero, and cuts the copyright rate for the so-called ``distant local signals'' by as much as 45 percent. It provides a ``grandfather'' clause for a large group of consumers already receiving satellite service, who might otherwise be cut off by a federal court ruling. And it makes it easier for consumers to determine what type of satellite service they are eligible for, a process which in the past has been somewhat difficult. 
   As many of my colleagues have noted, this act may not completely cure the competitive problems faced by consumers in the marketplace for video services. Certain provisions will require further action by the Federal Communications Commission and by Congress. But it is a good step in the right direction. I believe the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 will increase competition in these markets, and it will increase consumer choice. In the short run, and in the long run, this act is good for competition, and good for consumers.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the American Inventors Protection Act of 1999, which is incorporated into the Satellite Home Viewers Act Conference Committee Report. I am a Member of that Conference Committee. Ultimately, the Satellite Home Viewers Act Conference Committee Report will be included in this year's omnibus appropriations bill, the District of Columbia Appropriations Act of 2000. 
   With regard to the American Inventors Protection Act, I am particularly pleased with the Act's inclusion of the first inventor or ``prior user'' defense, created by Subtitle C. Unfortunately, the fact that this Act is being considered by the Senate in the closing days of the legislative session has limited the Judiciary Committee's ability to include a complete legislative history on the Act. As a Member of the Judiciary Committee, my intent is that this statement supplement the Senate's legislative history with regard to Subtitle C of the American Inventors Protection Act. 
   The prior user defense to patent infringement is of great importance to the financial services industry. For years, the financial services industry developed ``back office'' methods and processes that are fundamental to the delivery of many financial services. The House Judiciary Committee Report refers to the breadth of the types of methods and processes used by the financial services industry: ``These financial services may embody methods or processes incorporated into any number of systems including, but not limited to, trading, investment and liquidity management, securities custody and reporting, balance reporting, funds transfer, ACH, ATM processing, on-line banking, check processing and compliance and risk management. In each of these systems, multiple processing and method steps are acting upon a customer's data without its knowledge.'' Minor changes in the bill since it was reported by the House Judiciary Committee do not affect the scope of methods to be considered under this Title. 
   Virtually no one in the industry believed that these methods or processes were patentable. Instead, the only legal protections believed to be available were those granted under trade secret laws. Last year, in State Street Bank & Trust Company v. Signature Financial Group, Inc., the financial services industry was dealt a blow when the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that business methods can be patented. Early this year, the Supreme Court denied certiorari in that case, making it official. After State Street, methods and processes that were developed by the financial services industry years ago are subject to patent. Some of these methods and processes are transparent to the end user of the services and can be ``reverse engineered'' and then easily copied. A later user of the method can now patent a method or process that another inventor had developed and put into use first. The actual inventor would then be prohibited from using his own invention, or be required to pay royalties to the subsequent inventor. 
   This situation is clearly unfair. Fortunately, Subtitle C of the American Inventors Protection Act partially corrects the unfortunate consequences of the State Street decision by adding a new section to the patent code establishing the ``prior user'' defense. Specifically, this provides a defense to a claim of patent infringement where a person has commercially used or made serious preparations to commercially use a process that later becomes the subject matter of 
   a patent issued to another. Under this subtitle, an ``internal commercial use or arm's length commercial transfer of a useful end result'' includes a method or process, the subject matter of which may be directed to an information or data processing system providing a financial service, whether in the form of physical products, or in the form of services, or in the form of some useful results. 
   The term ``method'' should be interpreted broadly so that it includes any ``method of doing or conducting business,'' including a process. The method that is the subject matter of the defense may be an internal method of doing business, a method used in the course of doing or conducting business, or a method for conducting business in the public marketplace. It can be a method used in the design, formulation, preparation, application, testing, or manufacture of a product or service. A method is any systematic way of accomplishing a particular business goal. The defense should be applicable against patent infringement claims regarding methods, and to claims involving machines or articles of manufacture used to practice such methods (if such apparatus claims are included in the asserted patent). In the context of the financial services industry, methods would include financial instruments (e.g., stocks, bonds, mutual funds), financial products (e.g., futures, derivatives, asset-backed securities), financial transactions, the ordering of financial information, any system or process that transmits or transforms information with respect to eventual investments or financial transactions, and any method or process listed as examples by the House Judiciary Committee in its report. 
   Of course, the defense is not a general license; it extends only to the specific subject matter claimed in the patent. A person asserting the defense under this new section has the burden of establishing it by clear and convincing evidence. As used in this title ``person'' includes each parent, subsidiary, affiliate, division, or other entity related to the holder of the defense when they are accused of infringement of the relevant patent. If the defense is asserted by a person who is ultimately found to infringe a patent, and subsequently fails to demonstrate a reasonable basis for asserting the defense, then the court must award attorneys fees under section 285 of Title 35. 
   The first inventors defense is not available if a person has abandoned commercial use of the subject matter. In the context of this Act, abandonment means cessation of use with no intent to resume. In the financial services industry, certain activities are naturally periodic or cyclical. Intervals of non-use because of factors such as seasonal needs, or reasonable intervals between contracts, should not be considered abandonment. 
   Mr. President, subtitle C strikes a balance between the rights of the later inventor who obtains patent protection to enjoy his exclusive rights in the claimed subject matter, and the inherent fairness to the earlier user to continue to use its methods and processes to conduct and, even expand, its business. Thus, by creating a personal, prior user defense, subtitle C would give the patent owner its statutory patent rights enforceable against all except the earlier inventor and commercial user of common subject matter.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as original co-sponsors of the Safe Senior Assurance Study Act of 1999 (S. 818), Senator REID and I wish to express, for the record, our gratification for the language contained in the conference report on H.R. 3194 concerning physician supervision of anesthesia services under Medicare's Conditions of Participation. 
   We read the report as calling upon the Secretary of Health and Human Services to base her determination as to appropriate supervision standards on sound scientific outcome data--a principle which is at the core of S. 818, which was to assure that Medicare beneficiaries will continue to receive the highest quality medical care--one which I am sure is shared by every member of this body--and the Senator from Nevada and I think adoption of the report will help us attain this objective. 
   Preliminary data from recent outcome research has suggested that supervision of anesthesia care by physicians trained in that discipline represents an important factor in anesthesia safety, and we want to be certain that the Secretary takes the final results of this research into account. Medicare beneficiaries have resoundingly said, in response to recent national surveys, that they favor retention of the current supervision rule, and in our view, any change in that rule must be supported by scientific data showing that anesthesia safety for our nation's seniors would not be impaired. We congratulate the committees with jurisdiction over Medicare in the House and Senate for their clear commitment to this view.

    Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, each day, we entrust our lives and the safety of our families, friends, and neighbors to the capable hands of the brave men and women in our local police and fire departments. These individuals have decided that they are willing to risk their lives and safety out of a dedication to their citizens and their commitment to public service. 
   In Congress, we have recognized the dangers inherent in police work by  dedicating federal resources to help local police departments. In fact, this year, Fiscal Year (FY) 1999, the federal government spent $11 billion on law enforcement initiatives, such as the COPS program, to help local law enforcement face the daily challenges of their communities. In contrast, though, the federal government spent only $32 million on fire prevention and training. 
   We ask local firefighters to risk no less than their lives every time they respond to a fire alarm. We ask them to risk their lives responding to the approximately two million reports of fire that they receive on an annual basis. We expect them to be willing to give their lives in exchange for the lives of our families, neighbors, and friends once every 71 seconds while responding to the 400,000 residential fires--fires which represent only about 22% of all fires reported. We count on them to protect our lives and the lives of our loved ones. 
   I believe the Federal Government needs to show a greater commitment to the fire services. So, today, along with my colleague and friend from Connecticut, Senator DODD, I rise to introduce the Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement Act--or, FIRE bill. This bill is very simple. It authorizes, over five years, $5 billion in grants to local fire departments. These grants can be used for just about any purpose--training, equipment, hiring more firefighters, or education and prevention programs. A new office, established by this bill under the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), would be responsible for distributing grants to local departments based on a competitive process, involving needs assessment. To ensure that the funding is not spent solely on brand new state-of-the-art fire trucks, it mandates that no more than 25% of the grant funding can be used to purchase new fire vehicles. Finally, it requires that at least 10% of the funds are used for fire prevention programs. 
   Our bill is supported by the National Safe Kids Campaign, the International Association of Fire Fighters, International Association of Fire Chiefs, national Volunteer Fire Council, International Association of Arson Investigators, International Society of Fire Service Instructors, and the National Fire Protection Association. It is also a companion measure to legislation introduced in the House by Congressmen PASCRELL and WELDON, where almost 200 members of the House of Representatives have cosponsored it. I am proud to introduce this bill with my friend from Connecticut and look forward to working to ensure that the federal government increases its commitment to the men and women who make up our local fire departments. We owe it to them.

    Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce ``America's Law Enforcement and Mental Health Project. This bill is designed to address the impact that the increased deinstitutionalization of America's mentally ill has had on our criminal justice system. This is a serious problem affecting both the health and safety of our Nation. Essentially, the situation we have today in our prisons and jails is the result of over thirty years of cuts in the budgets of mental health institutions, as well as the outlawing of involuntary commitments. Faced with fewer dollars and greater legal requirements, these mental health care facilities began de-institutionalizing America's mentally ill in record numbers. According to one estimate, the number of persons finding treatment in mental health facilities plummeted from 560,000 in 1955 to just 100,000 in 1989. 
   A recent Justice Department study revealed that 16 percent of all inmates in America's State prisons and local jails today are mentally ill. The American Jails Association estimates that 600,000 to 700,000 seriously mentally ill persons each year are being booked into local jails alone. In my own home State of Ohio, 18 percent of all prison inmates were in mental health programs last year. That's the highest percentage in the country. 
   Far too many of our nation's mentally ill persons have ended up in our prisons and jails. In fact, today, the Los Angeles County Jail is the largest mental health care institution in our country. It treats 3,200 seriously mentally ill people every day. The impact on law enforcement has been significant. Institutions and agencies designed to fight crime have had to spend valuable time and scarce resources providing mental health services to prisoners. In Ohio, nearly 1 in 5 prisoners need special psychiatric services or accommodations. 
   Tragically, many mentally ill inmates could have received proper treatment from a variety of private and public sources before they ended up in the prison system. Part of the problem is a serious lack of coordination between our local law enforcement and social service systems. The interaction within law enforcement--between our courts and prisons--is even worse. All too often, the mentally ill act out their symptoms on the streets. They are arrested for minor offenses and wind up in jail, where appropriate treatment simply does not exist. They serve their sentences or are paroled, but find themselves right back in the system after committing further crimes--often more serious--only a short time later. 
   The Justice Department has found that over 75 percent of mentally ill inmates are repeat offenders. In some States, 
   the problem is even worse. California's Department of Corrections, for example, recently reported that 94 percent of mentally ill parolees returned to prison within two years, versus 57 percent of the parolee population at large. 
   Throughout this destructive cycle, law enforcement and corrections spend time and money trying to cope with the unique problems posed by these individuals. Certainly, some mentally ill offenders must be incarcerated because of the severity of their crimes. Many others who commit very minor offenses could receive appropriate care early on, reducing recidivism and unnecessary burdens on our police and corrections officials, as well as many mentally ill offenders, themselves. 
   That's why, Mr. President, I am introducing America's Law Enforcement and Mental Health Project (LAMP), to begin to identify--early--those who are mentally ill within our justice system and to use the power of the court to assist them in obtaining the treatment they need. This will be a step toward making some of the changes necessary to effectively address the issues surrounding the mentally ill in our justice system. 
   This bill would establish a federal grant program to help states and localities develop ``Mental Health Courts'' in their jurisdictions. These courts would be specialized courts with separate dockets. They would hear cases exclusively involving nonviolent of-–  
   fenses committed by mentally ill or retarded individuals. Fundamentally, Mental Health Courts would enable state and local courts to offer alternative sentences or alternatives to prosecution for those offenders who could be served best by mental health services. 
   To deal with the separate needs of mentally ill offenders, these Mental Health Courts would be staffed by a core group of specialized professionals, including a dedicated judge, prosecutor, public defender and court liaison to the mental health service community. The courts would promote efficiency and consistency by centrally managing all outstanding cases involving a mentally ill defendant admitted to the Mental Health Court. 
   The Mental Health Court judge ultimately would decide whether or not to hear each case referred to the court. The Mental Health Court would not deal with defendants unless they are deemed mentally ill by a qualified mental professional or the mental health court judge. Similarly, participation in the court by the mentally ill would be completely voluntary. Once the defendant volunteers for the Mental Health Court, however, he or she would be expected to follow the decision of the court. For instance, in any given case, the Mental Health Court judge, attorneys, and health services liaison may all agree on a plan of treatment as an alternative sentence or in lieu of prosecution. The defendant must adhere strictly to this court-imposed treatment plan. The court must then provide supervision with periodic review. This way, the court could quickly deal with any failure of the defendant to fulfill the treatment plan obligations. In this sense, the Mental Heath Court would function similar to drug courts. 
   Mr. President, the idea of Mental Health Courts is innovative, but not untested. Broward County, Florida, established the nation's first Mental Health Court almost two years ago. This court hears an average of 69 cases per month. Remarkably, Broward's Mental Health Court has been able to link over one-third of all its defendants with community health care providers or private psychiatric help. Notably, less than ten percent of all defendants were deemed inappropriate for mental health court and only eight percent refused community health services. 
   Although a voluntary system, Broward has found that many mentally ill persons do choose to have their cases heard in the Mental Health Court. These defendants don't always know what treatment options are available to them before they fall into the hands of the criminal justice system. A judicial program offering the possibility of effective treatment--rather than jail time--gives a measure of hope and a chance for rehabilitation to defendants. 
   Other jurisdictions across America have studied the Broward County model and have established their own Mental Health Courts or seek to do so, such as Butler County in my state of Ohio. King County, Washington, also has developed a more expansive Mental Health Court this past year. Our nation's communities are trying desperately to find the best way to cope with the problems associated with mental illness. Law enforcement agencies and correctional facilities simply do not have the means, nor the expertise, to properly treat mentally ill inmates in general. Mental Health Courts offer an alternative. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join in support of this legislation.

    Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise to commend the services of David Sweet, who is ending his term of the Northeast-Midwest Institute's Board of Directors. David is a distinguished Ohioan, who has helped to enhance the economic vitality and environmental quality of my State and the Northeast-Midwest region. 
   Dr. Sweet has been dean of the Levin College of Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University since 1978. He has expanded that institution and developed it into a well-respected research center that focuses on public service. Before joining Cleveland State, David served in several high-ranking positions within Ohio's State government. He was a member of the Public Utilities Commission, director of the Department of Economic and Community Development, chairman of the Ohio Energy Emergency Commission, and secretary of the Ohio Developmental Financing Commission. 
   David actually served four 3-year terms on the Northeast-Midwest Institute's Board of Directors, and he was elected chairman from 1995 to 1998. He has provided stable leadership, offered a wealth of ideas, and advanced the Institute's credibility. The Northeast-Midwest Institute provides policy research for the bipartisan Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition and its Great Lakes Task Force, which I co-chair with Senator CARL LEVIN of Michigan. 
   Mr. President, I again want to commend David Sweet for his service on the board of the Northeast-Midwest Institute. He has provided valued counsel and helped increase that organization's reputation and effectiveness.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, it is no secret that drugs and violence destroy lives and families. They also can destroy entire neighborhoods and communities. More and more, our young people--our children--are being exposed to the evils of drugs and the dangers of violence. That is why I am introducing legislation today, along with my colleagues Senators DODD and MURRAY, that would reauthorize the Safe and Drug Free Schools program. 
   This program funds a wide range of drug education and prevention activities. Our bill, which was drafted with the assistance of community anti-drug organization representatives, would give states greater flexibility on targeting assistance to schools in need; increase accountability measures to ensure that assistance is targeted to programs that work; and improve coordination of Safe and Drug Free programs with other community-based anti-drug programs. 
   Mr. President, I have dedicated a great deal of time, both in the House and the Senate, to fighting illegal drug use in this country. Way back in 1990, as a Member of the House of Representatives, I was on the National Commission on Drug Free Schools. From my experience on this Commission, and through my work on drug prevention when I was Lieutenant Governor of Ohio, I learned that school-based prevention efforts must be coordinated  and consistent during a child's school years. Programs must not have gaps that leave our children vulnerable to the lure of drugs. 
   Throughout my efforts, I always have emphasized the importance of a balanced attack against drug use. We must win the fight against people who manufacture and grow drugs, we must put a stop to those who transport illegal drugs into, and through, this country, and we must fight against the dealers who their trade drugs on our streets and yes, even in our schools. 
   There are many fronts in the important battle against drugs. The Safe and Drug Free Schools program is one area where I think we can improve our efforts. I believe we should continue the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program, but increase the accountability of federally funded programs and focus limited resources on programs that demonstrate an actual reduction in drug use. We must provide parents, schools, and local communities with the resources and flexibility they need to reduce drug use among kids. 
   Every child deserves to live and go to school in a drug and violence-free community. Our bill helps ensure that our children have this opportunity. Congress first passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act--the precursor to the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities Act--in 1986. This legislation was the product of an aggressive, ambitious, and comprehensive anti-drug effort, which contributed to a 25% overall reduction in adolescent drug use from 1988 to 1992. Unfortunately, over the course of this decade, much of that success was lost. Youth drug use increased dramatically, including an 80% increase in marijuana use by high school seniors, an 80% increase in cocaine use, and a 100% increase in heroin use. We must reverse this trend. We have an obligation to our kids to reverse this trend. 
   I believe that our children's disturbing acceptance and experimentation of life-destroying drugs is due in large part to the Administration's national anti-drug strategy, which has been neither balanced nor comprehensive. Reinvesting in an improved Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities program is a critical 
   part of restoring effectiveness in and purpose to our national drug policy. Our legislation would be a major assault against drugs and violence in our schools and communities, by coordinating school-based programs with the broader community anti-drug effort. 
   Children spend more time at school than at any single place. A quality education starts with a quality educational environment. Congress can show its commitment to this goal by continuing--and improving--our investment in the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities Program. Specifically, our bill would increase the accountability within the program and ensure that only effective, researched-based programs receive federal funding. Also, it would provide States and Governors with greater flexibility in targeting their grants to prevent youth violence and drug use. Each state has unique drug prevention challenges and this bill provides the states with the flexibility to target funds to all of their schools, focus on those schools with the greatest drug/violence problems, or a combination of these two groups. 
   Our bill would increase community participation in the development and implementation of drug and violence prevention programs. Drug abuse and violence among young people is a community problem and requires a community-based solution. That's why when we drafted this bill, we worked closely with the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of America. Thanks to their input, this bill ensures that the entire community is involved in the creation and execution of programs to fight youth drug abuse and violence. It would maintain a viable program for all schools willing to conduct research-based violence and drug abuse prevention programs. 
   Mr. President, the threat of violence--and the reality of drug abuse--in our schools are all too real. If we get to our kids before the drug dealers do--if we have a policy of zero tolerance on drugs--America's children have a chance. I believe that the Safe and Drug Free Schools program empowers America's families and teachers with the information, training, and resources they need to help our children resist the temptation of drugs. 
   Over the coming months, we will be reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The Safe and Drug Free is an important part of that legislation. I look forward to working on this bill and making this country's schools safer and drug free for our kids. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be entered into the RECORD.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for his courtesy. I say to him and the Senator from California, I plan on speaking probably 12 minutes. 
   Yesterday, I filed an amendment to H.R. 434, the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which amendment would improve our Nation's ability to retaliate against illegal trade practices by foreign governments. Despite efforts to reduce European trade barriers against American agriculture, despite repeated rulings by international trade bodies that European trade barriers are illegal, there still remains a ``fortress Europe'' mentality against free and fair trade. 
   The amendment I have filed is designed to strengthen the one and only allowable weapon in our arsenal against WTO noncompliance, the only weapon we have when a country is found to be in violation of the WTO and repeatedly refuses to comply. The only weapon we have, the only method of forcing compliance, is tariff retaliation. 
   The amendment I filed enjoys widespread bipartisan support. In fact, the bill I filed is similar to the amendment and now has 24 sponsors. It is bipartisan. 
   This amendment has strong backing by our very diverse agricultural community, and this is certainly no surprise. Ask any corn grower or cattle producer or pork producer. They know and understand their well-being depends on expanding our export markets. We have the greatest agriculture in the world. We do it more efficiently and cheaper and better than anyone in the world today. All our farmers say is: Give us a chance to sell; give us a chance to compete. That is what this amendment is about. 
   It is my hope the Senate, by adopting this amendment, will take a stand for our farmers and ranchers and send a strong signal to the European Union that their gross violations of international trade law simply must stop. 
   Specifically, the European Union, despite years of efforts to find a fair solution, continues to defy the World Trade Organization's rulings against its ban on U.S. beef imports and its banana import rules. Both cases are important not just for the specific producers and the distributors impacted by these two cases, but it is important for every American business, particularly small businesses, seeking a fair shot at the European market. 
   To appreciate the magnitude of Europe's current actions against American agriculture, it is important to put it in the context of recent history. Both these specific trade cases took several years to work through the WTO and were undertaken at great expense to the U.S. Government, and the producers in the businesses are at the heart of this dispute. 
   Here are the essential facts. This is the story.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise this evening to, once again, strongly urge my colleagues to vote to ban partial-birth abortion. Three times Congress has voted to pass legislation to ban the barbaric practice of partial-birth abortion--but tragically, at every opportunity, the President of the United States has vetoed the act of Congress to ban this needless and horrific procedure. 
   The words of Frederick Douglass uttered more than 100 years ago I believe are very applicable to this discussion. This is what Frederick Douglass said:  
   Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted.......  
   We must continue our struggle to ban partial-birth abortion in this country. 
   We are debating a national question that in my ways, is not unlike the issue of slavery, in part, because opponents of this legislation are truly using artificial arguments to justify why certain people, in their opinion, have no legal status and no civil, social, or political rights. Those opposing the partial-birth abortion ban imply that the almost-born child has no right to live. Clearly, the vast majority of the American people, and a majority of Congress disagree. 
   Every year the tragic effect of this extreme indifference to human life becomes more and more apparent. We must ban this procedure. We must simply say that enough is enough. 
   In my home State of Ohio, two tragic cases of partial-birth abortions did not go ``according to plan.'' Each reveals, in its own way, the unpleasant facts of this horrible tragedy of partial-birth abortion. 
   On April 6, in Dayton, OH, a woman went into the Dayton Medical Center to undergo a partial-birth abortion. This facility is operated by Dr. Martin Haskell, a pioneer of the partial-birth abortion procedure. Usually this procedure takes place behind closed doors, where it can be ignored--its morality left outside. 
   But, this particular procedure was different. Here is what happened. 
   The Dayton abortionist inserted instruments known as laminaria into the woman, to dilate her cervix, so the child could eventually be removed and killed. This procedure usually takes 3 days. 
   This woman went home to Cincinnati, expecting to return to Dayton for completion of the procedure in 2 or 3 days. But, her cervix dilated too quickly and so shortly after midnight, she was admitted to Bethesda North Hospital in Cincinnati. 
   The child was born. A medical technician pointed out that the child was alive. But apparently her chances of survival were slim. After 3 hours and 8 minutes, this baby died. The baby was named Hope. 
   On the death certificate is a space for ``Method of Death.'' And it said, in the case of Baby Hope, ``Method of Death: Natural.'' That, of course, is not true. There was nothing natural about the events that led to the death of this poor innocent child. 
   Baby Hope did not die of natural causes. Baby Hope was the victim of  this barbaric procedure--a procedure that is opposed by the vast majority of the American people. It is a procedure that has been banned three times by an act of Congress--only to see the ban overturned by a veto by the President of the United States. 
   The death of Baby Hope did not take place behind the closed doors of an abortion clinic. The death of this baby took place in public--in a hospital dedicated to saving lives, not taking them. This episode reminds us of the brutal reality and tragedy of what partial-birth abortion really is, the killing of a baby--plain and simple. 
   And, almost to underscore the inhumanity of this procedure--4 months later, in my home State of Ohio it happened again. This time, though, something quite different occurred. 
   Once again, the scene is Dayton, OH. This time on August 18, a woman who was 25-weeks pregnant, went into Dr. Haskell's office for a partial-birth abortion. As usual, the abortionist performed the preparatory steps for the barbaric procedure by dilating the mother's cervix. The next day, August 19, the mother went into labor, and was rushed to Good Samaritan Hospital. This time, however, despite the massive trauma to this baby's environment, a miracle occurred. By grace, this little baby survived, and so she now is called ``Baby Grace.'' 
   I am appalled by the fact that both of these heinous partial-birth abortion attempts occurred anywhere, but particularly because in my home State. When I think about the brutal death of Baby Hope and then ponder the miracle of Baby Grace, I am confronted with the question--a haunting question that we all face--Why can't we just allow these babies to live? 
   Opponents of the ban on this ``procedure'' say that this procedure is necessary to protect the health of women. We know from testimony that we heard in our Judiciary Committee that that simply is not true. The American Medical Association says that this procedure is never--never--medically necessary. In fact, many physicians have found that the procedure itself can pose immediate and significant risks to a woman's health and future fertility. Clearly, the babies did not have to be killed in the Ohio cases I just cited. No. The babies were both born alive. One survived; one did not. 
   Why does the baby have to be killed? 
   Opponents of this legislation say that this procedure is only used in emergency situations, when women's lives are in danger. Again, from the testimony that we heard in the Judiciary Committee, we know this is absolutely not true. It seems strange that a 3-day procedure would be used and the mother sent home if, in fact, we were dealing with an emergency. Nevertheless, even abortionists say that the vast majority of partial-birth abortions are elective. Dr. Haskell, the Ohio abortionist, stated as follows: ``And I'll be quite frank; most of my abortions are elective in that 20-24 week range.'' 
   Why? Why? Why does the baby have to be killed? 
   Opponents of this bill say that this procedure is necessary when a fetus is abnormal. Now, I do not believe the condition of the fetus ever warrants killing it. But, even abortionists and some opponents of this ban agree that most partial-birth abortions involve healthy fetuses. The inventor of this procedure himself, the late Dr. James McMahon, said ``I think, `Gee, it's too bad that this child couldn't be adopted.' '' 
   So, again, the question: Why does the baby have to be killed? 
   Opponents of this bill say that this partial-birth procedure is rare. But, again, that is not true either. Even the director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers admitted that there are up to 5,000 partial-birth abortion procedures in the United States. 
   Why? Why does the baby have to be killed? 
   Opponents say that this ban violates Roe v. Wade, and so it is unconstitutional. But, anyone who has read the case knows that Roe declined to consider the constitutionality of the part of the Texas statute banning the killing of a child who was in the process of delivery. And, the Supreme Court again declined to decide this issue in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. 
   Again, we must ask, why does the baby have to be killed? 
   Opponents say this bill is unconstitutional because it doesn't have a ``health exception.'' First, the ``health exception'' is defined by Doe v. Bolton so broadly as to make the ban unenforceable--effectively gutting the bill. 
   We know that is how the courts have defined the ``health exception'' in abortion legislation. Both sides of this debate fully understand that. 
   The American Medical Association itself has stated:  
   There is no health reason for this procedure. In fact, there is ample testimony to show that all of the health consequences are more severe for this procedure than any other procedure used.  
   Further, the AMA concluded:  
   The partial delivery of a living fetus for the purpose of killing it outside the womb is ethically offensive to most Americans and physicians. (New York Times, May 26, 1997).  
   I ask my colleagues who wish to continue to allow this heinous procedure by upholding the President's veto, why? Why does the baby have to be killed? Why do babies, inches away from their first breath, have to die? Something is terribly wrong in this country when these babies continue to be killed. 
   With the advent of modern technology, we can sustain young life in ways we could not have just a few short years ago. Those of us who have had the privilege of going into neonatal intensive care units in our States have seen the miracles being worked today with precious, tiny children. Medical science can keep babies alive who are only 22 weeks, 23 weeks, children who before would simply not have survived. 
   While we have this great technology, while we have made such great advances, while we are saving so many innocent children, at the same time we have also perfected and created more and more savage ways of killing other children, other babies who are the same level of development. 
   I think we are destroying ourselves by not admitting as a society that partial-birth abortion is an evil against humanity. I believe there will be more and more horrible consequences for our Nation if we do not ban this cruel procedure. As a friend of mine reminded me, no culture can be demolished without the voluntary cooperation of at least a number of its own members. We must stop and ask, to what depths has the American conscience sunk? When it comes to abortion, is there nothing to which we will say no? Is there nothing so wrong, so cruel that we will not say, as a society, we will not tolerate this; we will not put up with this; this is going simply too far? 
   Partial-birth abortion is a very clear matter of right and wrong, good versus evil. It is my wish that there will come a day when my colleagues and I no longer have to come to the floor, to debate this issue. I hope we have the votes this year to not only pass the partial-birth abortion ban, but also to override the President's veto. We have to do it. It is the right thing to do, because innocent children are dying every day in America because of this horrible, barbaric procedure. 
   Let us ban this procedure which kills our partially born children, and let's do it for our children. 
   I thank the Chair, and thank my colleagues. I congratulate Senator SANTORUM for bringing this matter to the floor, and Senator SMITH, who has so long been a proponent of doing away with partial-birth abortion. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, the current situation in Colombia is a nightmare. Embroiled in a bloody, complex, three decade-long civil war, Colombia is spiraling toward collapse. Since the early 1990s, more than 35,000 Colombians have lost their lives at the hands of two well-financed, heavily-armed guerrilla insurgency groups, along with a competing band of ruthless paramilitary operatives, hell bent on crushing the group of leftist guerrillas. Sadly, many of those killed so far have been innocent civilians caught in the constant cross-fire. 
   The American drug habit is at the core of the Colombian crisis, with drug users and pushers in this country subsidizing the anti-democratic leftists. Americans want drugs. The drug traffickers want money. To ensure their prosperity and to maintain a profitable industry, the traffickers essentially hire the guerrillas and, increasingly, the paramilitary groups to protect their livelihoods. Violence and instability reign. Democracy is crumbling. 
   That's why, Mr. President, today, along with my colleague Senator COVERDELL, we are introducing the Anti-Drug Alliance with Colombia and the Andean Region Act of 1999. This comprehensive bill is designed to promote peace and stability in Colombia and the Latin American region. Our colleague, Senator GRASSLEY also joins us as a co-sponsor. We believe it is time that our government work in conjunction with the government and the people of Colombia to help lessen the growing crisis in the region. 
   The problems in Colombia run deep. There are no easy ``overnight'' solutions. If we are to assist in creating and sustaining long-term stability in Colombia, we must commit the resources to achieving that end. It is in our national interest to support Colombia in its effort to thwart further destabilization. Without a strong Colombia, narco-traffickers will flourish, an abundant and steady flow of illicit drugs will head for the United States, one of our largest export markets in the western hemisphere will continue to falter, and a democratic government will further erode. 
   Just a couple of weeks ago, I met with Colombian President Pastrana during his visit to Washington. We discussed how our two countries can work together--in cooperation--to eliminate drugs from our hemisphere and to begin restoring democracy and the rule of law in Colombia. 
   For more than three decades, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, otherwise known as the FARC, and the National Liberation Army (ELN) have waged the longest-running guerrilla insurgency in Latin America. Both rebel groups have a combined strength of between 15,000 and 20,000 full-time guerrillas. These armed terrorists control or influence up to 60% of rural Colombia. At present, the Colombian military does not appear to have the strength and resources to counter these menacing forces. 
   Well over a decade ago, the biggest threat to stability from within our hemisphere was communism--Soviet and Cuban communists pushing their anti-democratic propaganda in Central America. We overcame that threat. Under the Reagan and Bush Administrations, Democracy prevailed. Today, in our hemisphere, the communists have been replaced by drug traffickers and the rebels they hire to protect their lucrative industry. These drug traffickers also are financing the roughly 5,000 armed paramilitary 
   combatants, whose self-appointed mission is to counter the strength of the leftist guerrillas. If we hope to have any impact at all in eliminating the drugs in our cities, in our schools, and in our homes, we need to attack drug trafficking head on--here and abroad. This is how we can help both the people of Colombia and the people of our own country. 
   With the help of my colleagues, Senators PAUL COVERDELL, BOB GRAHAM and CHARLES GRASSLEY, last year we passed the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. This was a much-needed step toward attacking the drug problem at its core. This Act is a $2.7 billion, three-year investment to rebuild our drug fighting capability outside our borders. This law is about reclaiming the federal government's exclusive responsibility to prevent drugs from ever reaching our borders. This law is about building a hemisphere free from the violent and decaying influence of drug traffickers. This is a law about stopping drugs before they ever reach our kids in Ohio. 
   This bill was necessary because the Clinton Administration, since coming  into office, has slashed funding levels for international counter-narcotics efforts. By turning its back for the better part of this decade on the fight against drugs abroad, this Administration has contributed inadvertently to the growing strength of drug trafficking organizations, as well as the narco-terrorists in the region. 
   If one principle has guided American foreign policy consistently since the dawn of our nation, it is this: The peace and stability of our own hemisphere must come first. That certainly has been the case throughout the last century. The Spanish-American War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the democratization of Central America in the 1980s, and the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s--all of these key events were approached with the same premise: A strong, free, and prosperous hemisphere means a strong, free, and prosperous United States. 
   Consistent with that principle, the United States must take an active role in seeking a peaceful, democratic Colombia. That is why Senator COVERDELL, who just came back from Colombia, and I have developed a comprehensive assistance plan for Colombia. The Alliance Act of 1999 would authorize $1.6 billion over three years to support: 1. Alternative crop and economic development; 2. Drug interdiction programs; 3. Human rights and rule of law programs; and 4. Military and police counter-narcotics operations. Our plan also contains provisions for counter-narcotics assistance and crop alternative development programs for other Latin American countries, including Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Panama, Venezuela, and Ecuador. 
   Our plan not only provides the means to eradicate and interdict illicit drugs, but it also provides the training and resources to strengthen both the civilian and military justice systems to preserve the rule of law and democracy in Colombia. A hemispheric commitment to the rule of law is essential. When I visited with Americans living in Colombia during a trip to the region last year, judicial reform was a central focus of our discussion on ways our nation can better assist Colombia. With our plan, our government would take a leadership role in promoting a strong judiciary and rule of law in Colombia by providing our own technical expertise. 
   Our plan promotes the sanctity of human rights and provides humanitarian assistance to the hundreds of thousands of people who have been displaced due to the violence and instability. 
   We not only focus on the economy of Colombia, but also on the stability of the region, as a whole. We provide support for the front-line states and call on them and the international community to assist and support the Government of Colombia. This is a cooperative effort to help Colombia begin to help itself. 
   Our plan would monitor the assistance to the Colombian security forces, so we can be sure that this assistance is used effectively for its intended purpose and does not fall into the hands of those who engage in gross violations of human rights and drug trafficking. 
   We urge the Colombian government to take a tough stance against the often over-looked paramilitaries. They are a growing part of the problem in Colombia and should not be ignored. 
   Our plan is comprehensive. Our plan is balanced. It demonstrates our commitment to assisting the Government of Colombia and our interest in working together to bring peace and security to the hemisphere. 
   Mr. President, this is not an ``America Knows Best'' plan. We consulted with those who are on the front-lines in Colombia--those who know best what Colombia needs right now. We have talked with the Colombian government, including President Pastrana, to inquire about Colombia's specific needs. We also have consulted with U.S. government officials, who have confirmed our belief that a plan for Colombia must be balanced if we hope to address the complex and dangerous elements of the current situation. 
   Frankly, Mr. President, it is my hope that the Administration will pro-actively work with Congress--and most importantly, Colombia--to turn the tide against those seeking to undermine democracy in the region. We must act now--too much is at risk to wait any longer.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that is very important to our political system. I believe that our current campaign finance system needs serious reform. But, I cannot support the current version of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. I believe the bill's total ban on so-called ``soft money'' is unconstitutional. It is a clear violation of the free speech clause of the First Amendment. 
   Soft money is used by political parties to advocate specific policies or issues, as well as other party-building activities, such as voter registration and get-out-the-vote efforts. The Supreme Court considers these issue advocacy activities to be free speech and has made it perfectly clear through previous rulings that any total prohibition of funds for issue advocacy would be a violation of the First Amendment. 
   That's why I have been working with several of my colleagues, including Senators HAGEL, ABRAHAM, GORTON, and THOMAS, to come up with a campaign finance reform proposal that makes much-needed changes in the system, while still preserving the free speech rights guaranteed under the First Amendment. I believe that by correcting the problems, we can achieve a fair and open system of campaign finance laws, which is a big step toward restoring the people's faith in our democratic government. 
   Our proposal would achieve a number of important goals. 
   First, it would improve our disclosure laws and increase accountability of political candidates and political parties. Our proposal would provide for more disclosure of contributions given to candidates and parties, institute immediate electronic disclosure by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), and require disclosure of the names of those who purchase political advertisements on radio and television. 
   Second, our proposal would impose overall limits on what individuals can provide to both candidates and parties. As I noted earlier, right now, a person can contribute any amount of ``soft'' money he or she wishes to a political party. Under our proposal, a person could give a maximum of $60,000 to national political parties. The proposal also would allow that same person to make individual contributions to candidates of up to $3,000--up from the current $1000 limit. This would bring the total amount that an individual could give to parties, candidates, and other political committees to $75,000. The limitation on contributions to political parties would not take effect until after the Supreme Court has a chance to review any constitutional challenges to these limits. 
   The goal here is to limit one person's or organization's ability to distort the political process through massive cash contributions to parties. In addition, we would like to see more of that limited contribution go toward the candidates, themselves, rather than the parties, because candidates currently face tougher disclosure requirements than the parties. In short, our plan would put a lid on overall contributions and increase accountability of these funds. 
   I know a number of my colleagues and I were looking forward to discussing our proposal and others and how it would bring reform to our political process. We should view today's vote as a demonstration for the need for our proposal--one that will not run counter to the First Amendment, and one that will ensure greater accountability and credibility of our political process.

    Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act (CAPE). This legislation would provide a much-needed increase in funding for the investigation of child abuse crimes, as well as prevention programs designed to prevent child abuse. This bill is similar to the legislation introduced by my Ohio colleague in the House of Representatives, DEBORAH PRYCE, which recently passed overwhelmingly in the House. 
   As a former Greene County, Ohio, prosecutor, and--more importantly--- as a parent, nothing disturbs me more than reports of child abuse and neglect. As a prosecutor, I saw--- first-hand--too many examples of child victimization and abuse. These days, it seems like you can't turn on the local news without hearing about another unforgivable act of violence against a child. Some of these stories have become infamous. Yet, sadly, most stories of child abuse are quickly forgotten. Such stories have become so common, it seems that our collective conscience is seldom even affected any more. 
   The sheer numbers of abusive acts committed against our children are astounding. In my State of Ohio, one incident of child abuse or neglect is reported to authorities every three minutes! What's worse is that these reports of abuse are on the rise. In a study of child abuse, the Federal government found that the number of abused and neglected children in this country nearly doubled between 1986 and 1993. As a result, child protective service agencies across the country are facing more than a million cases of abused and neglected children each year. 
   The Federal government can take meaningful steps--starting now--to help fight child abuse. The Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act would be one meaningful step. Through the use of advanced technology, this legislation would enhance the ability of law enforcement systems to exchange timely and accurate criminal history information with agencies involved in child welfare, child abuse, and adoption services. 
   Every day, State and local child welfare services attempt to ensure that children are cared for properly and living with loving families. It is their job to prevent at-risk children from being left under the same roof with domestic or child abusers. Often, when child welfare agencies conduct child safety assessments, criminal histories and civil protection order information are not always readily available. These agencies may not be getting the full story. The result, in some cases, is that an abused or neglected child is removed from one harmful environment only to be placed in another. To improve access to critical law enforcement information, the bill I am introducing today would amend the Crime Identification and 
   Technology Act (CITA), which I sponsored last year, to allow State and local governments to use CITA grant dollars to enable the criminal justice system to provide criminal history information to child protection and welfare agencies. 
   Our bill also would allow the use of funds from the $550 million Byrne grant program for activities aimed at cracking down on and preventing child abuse and neglect. Since 1986, Byrne grant dollars have been used successfully to provide financial assistance to State and local governments to coordinate government efforts to fight crime and drug abuse. With our bill, State and local agencies could use Byrne grant dollars to train child welfare investigators and child protection workers. The funding also could help build and develop child advocacy centers and hospitals for the abused. These are just a few of many possible uses. 
   Mr. President, our bill would go even one step further to direct resources to fight against child abuse. It would double the amount of funds available to States and localities to assist the victims of crimes against children. Currently, $10 million of the Federal Crime Victims $383 million fund are earmarked for child abuse and domestic assistance programs. This fund is financed not by taxpayer dollars, but through criminal fines, penalties and forfeitures. While the fund has grown since its beginning in 1984, the amount reserved for assistance to victims of abuse has remained stagnant. Our bill would earmark $20 million to help public and nonprofit agencies provide necessary services like rescue shelters, 24-hour abuse hotlines, and counseling to victims of child abuse. 
   Mr. President, this is one piece of legislation that can and should pass the Senate quickly. As I noted earlier, a similar bill was overwhelmingly approved by the House by a vote of 425-2. More than 50 child protection organizations have endorsed this legislation, including the National Child Abuse Coalition; the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children; Fight Crime: Invest in Kids; the Family Research Council and the Christian Coalition; the American Professional Society of the Abuse of Children; and Prevent Child Abuse America. 
   I urge my colleagues here in the Senate to demonstrate their commitment to America's abused and neglected children by supporting this legislation. Let's show some compassion and support our States and local communities in the fight against child abuse.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the agriculture appropriations conference report. First, I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator COCHRAN and Senator KOHL, for their hard work on this legislation. They faced multiple challenges in trying to find funds for so many different and critical areas within agriculture. 
   I support this bill, Mr. President. I support it because it will help provide some immediate relief to our farmers, who, in many states, are facing a twin blow from drought and low commodity prices. I know that in my home state of Ohio--where agriculture is the number one industry--many of our farmers are in serious financial trouble. When you're getting hit from both drought and low commodity prices, it really hurts. 
   I am pleased that the bill we will send to the President today will take an important step toward helping agriculture producers overcome some of the current problems resulting from this summer's drought and low commodity prices. For example, the conference report includes $5.54 billion in emergency assistance for Agricultural Market Transition Act payments (AMTA). This amount will double producers' AMTA payments for 1999 crops. Also, the bill enables farmers to receive AMTA payments at the beginning of the fiscal year rather than in two installments. This is very important for many of Ohio's farmers who are struggling right now to make ends meet. The Senate should get this bill to the President as quickly as possible. Our farmers need relief now--not later. 
   This summer has brought with it one of the most prolonged periods of drought in this century. I have talked to many farmers back home and have driven along the highways and back roads in Ohio--you can see how this summer's drought has severely stunted the growth of corn and other key crops. It's devastating. And this devastation is widespread. Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman has designated all but one of Ohio's eighty-eight (88) counties as natural disaster areas. Of those, Secretary Glickman designated sixty-six (66) counties as primary disaster areas. 
   According to the Governor of Ohio, our state's farmers are expected to lose  $600 million in income due to the drought. Let me repeat that, Mr. President. In Ohio, our farmers stand to lose $600 million. When combined with the current low commodity prices, it is no wonder that many farmers in Ohio are asking themselves--and us--how they and their families are going to make it. 
   In response, the bill we will send to the President today provides approximately $1.2 billion--to assist farmers plagued by the drought. It's a decent start. But, while this assistance will surely help lessen the immediate financial worries of many of our drought-stricken farmers, it doesn't address a fundamental issue here--and that is that our farmers aren't equipped to withstand cyclical economic downturns and natural disasters over which they have no control. As I see it, we have failed to give agriculture producers the tools they need, over the long-term, to manage risks--whether those risks come from the market or nature. There are things that we, in Congress, are trying to do to help get to the root of the challenges facing our farmers today. Let me explain. 
   The United States is the most open market in the world. While our farmers are the most productive in the world, market barriers against the free and fair trade of our agriculture products exist. Dismantling these barriers must be a top priority. Congress can help by giving the President fast track authority to negotiate trade agreements. Fast track authority would allow the Administration to enter into trade agreements with other countries, where we are the most competitive and to negotiate with specific regions of the globe. 
   Failure to pass fast track puts our farmers at a serious disadvantage with global competitors. For instance, the Latin America and Carribean region offers great opportunities for increased agriculture exports. It is one of the fastest growing markets for U.S. exports and will exceed the European Union as a destination for U.S. exports by next year. This market is expected to exceed both Japan and the European Union combined by the year 2010. Other nations already are working to break down barriers in this region. The United States cannot afford to sit 
   on the sidelines--just watching--much longer. We need to get into the game. That would help our farmers. 
   When our foreign trading partners are not trading by international rules, and doing so to the detriment of our farmers, our trade authorities should use all the tools available to them. For example, I introduced bipartisan legislation, the ``Carousel Retaliation Act,'' which would increase pressure on our trading partners to comply with World Trade Organization rules by requiring the U.S. government to rotate targets every six months. 
   What's happening is that our nation--and especially our farmers--are being injured by the refusal of some foreign countries to comply with World Trading Organization (WTO) Dispute Settlement rulings. Noncompliance with Dispute Settlement rulings severely undermines open and fair trade. As many of our farmers, cattle ranchers, and large and small business owners know firsthand, this is having a devastating impact on their efforts to maintain or gain access to important international markets. 
   The ``Carousel Retaliation Act'' would help ensure the integrity of the WTO Dispute Settlement by rotating--or carouseling--the retaliation list of goods to affect other goods 120 days from the date the list is made and every 180 days, thereafter. Currently, the U.S. Trade Representative has the authority to carousel retaliation lists, but is not required to do so. 
   The Carousel bill requires the U.S. Trade Representative to rotate and revise the retaliation list so that countries violating WTO Dispute Settlements cannot merely subsidize the affected industries to recover from retaliation penalties. American farmers are the most efficient and competitive in the world. When given the opportunity to compete on equal footing, they will be the most successful, as well. 
   Besides opening new markets abroad, there are things we can do here at home to help our farmers prosper under the Freedom to Farm Act we passed three years ago. I cosponsored legislation that would allow farmers to open savings accounts into which they can place--tax free--a certain percentage of their profits during good economic times. These funds can remain in their accounts for up to five years. If hard times come along--as we know they do--farmers can withdraw funds from their accounts. The only time these funds would be taxed is when they are withdrawn from the account or after five years. 
   This bill, the Farm and Ranch Risk Management (FARRM) Act, was included in the $792 billion tax-relief package that I supported and Congress passed. That tax relief package had many other provisions helpful to farmers. Besides the FARRM provision, the bill included the elimination of estate taxes, broad-based tax relief, the elimination of the marriage penalty, and the full deductibility of health insurance for the self-employed. Unfortunately, President Clinton vetoed this reasonable tax relief package--that doesn't help our farmers. 
   Most important, we should get the federal government off the backs of our farmers so they can have the freedom to do what they do better than any other country--and that's produce. I have cosponsored the Regulatory Fairness and Openness Act, which would require the Environmental Protection Agency base pesticide use decisions on sound science rather than worst-case scenarios. Also, I have cosponsored legislation that would require the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to base any ergonomic standards on sound science. 
   Mr. President, our farmers need assistance--the kind that is provided through the agriculture appropriations bill and the kind of assistance that comes from pursuing trade and tax policies that would further the economic strength and freedom of American agriculture. 
   I urge the President to sign the appropriations bill immediately so that farmers in Ohio--and throughout the country--can receive short-term relief as quickly as possible. I also urge the President to take a long, hard look at how we can give our farmers the kind of lasting relief they need to stay in business not just this year, but for generations to come.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, we live in dangerous and uncertain times. The global threats to peace and security known well to us during the Cold War have been replaced by terrorist states and rogue nations with growing nuclear arsenals. Historically, existing international arms control agreements have made our nation, and our world, a safer place. The United States has been a world leader to reduce global nuclear tests. Several nuclear test ban treaties already are in effect, including the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT), which banned nuclear blasts in the atmosphere, space, and underwater; the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT), which banned tests on devices above 150 kilotons; and the 1990 Peaceful Nuclear Explosion Treaty. 
   Unfortunately, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will not provide the same protections as these other weapons treaties. That is why I cannot support it. 
   I am against the CTBT for two fundamental reasons: 1. The Treaty does not guarantee us an ability to maintain a safe, viable, and advanced nuclear stockpile; and 2. The Treaty does not provide effective verification and enforcement if other nations violate the Treaty. 
   The Clinton administration has proposed replacing our testing system with a computer simulated Stockpile Stewardship Program. Right now, we simply do not know if this program can serve as a reliable surrogate for testing. We do not know if computer simulations can mimic accurately the functions of actual testing. We do not know if computer simulations can provide adequate information so we can modernize and our devices in response to changing threats and new weapons systems. What we do know is that in order for our own nuclear defenses to be an effective deterrent, they must be able to work. Ratification of the CTBT would close off the only means that currently can ensure the reliability, safety, and security of our nuclear defense stockpile. 
   I also am opposed to the CTBT because it does not provide adequate verification and enforcement mechanisms. Nations will be able to conduct nuclear tests well below the detection threshold of the Treaty's current monitoring system. If a rogue nation, like Iraq, conducts a nuclear test, and the United States insists on an on-site inspection, the treaty first would require 30 of 51 nations on the CTBT executive council to approve the inspection. If approved, the country to be inspected could still declare up to 50 square kilometers as being ``off limits'' from the inspection. How can measures like this ensure other nations will comply with the CTBT? They simply can't. 
   The national security of our nation would not be served with the adoption of the current CTBT. I believe ratification of the CTBT could compromise our national security. The Senate should defeat its ratification.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I rise to support the Durbin-DeWine pediatric asthma amendment. This amendment would appropriate $10 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, to award grants to local communities for screening, treatment, and education relating to childhood asthma. 
   On May 5th of this year, the Allergy and Asthma Network's Mothers of Asthmatics organized an asthma awareness day to educate everyone about asthma. As most of you probably know, asthma is a chronic lung disease caused by inflammation of the lower airways. During an asthma attack, these airways narrow--making it difficult and sometimes impossible to breathe. Fortunately, we have the ``tools'' to handle asthma attacks once they occur. The most common way, of course, is to use an asthma inhaler that millions of us use every day. We also know a lot about how to prevent asthma attacks in the first place--through drug therapy and by avoiding many well-known asthma triggers. 
   With asthma prevalence rates--and asthma death rates--on the rise, especially in inner-city populations, it is important for us to raise national awareness, so we can educate families on how to detect, treat, and manage asthma symptoms. Of the more than 15 million Americans who suffer from asthma, over five million are children.  The American Lung Association estimates that in my home state of Ohio, 212,895 children under the age of 18 suffer from asthma. That's about two percent of the entire population in Ohio. Asthma is the most common chronic illness affecting children and is the leading cause of missed school days due to chronic illness. 
   Asthma is hitting the youngest the hardest. Nationwide, the most substantial prevalence rate increase for asthma occurred among children 4 years-old and younger. Hospitalization rates due to asthma were also highest in this young age group, rising 74 percent between 1979 and 1992. These increases in hospitalization rates are especially affecting the inner city populations, where asthma triggers, like air pollutants, are more concentrated. 
   An August 29 Akron Beacon Journal article cites statistics from the CDC that show the ratio of children under age four with asthma increased from one in forty-five in 1980 to one in seventeen in 1994. Every year, more than 5,000 Americans die from this disease--these are PREVENTABLE deaths. A July 27 New York Times article described the results of a study performed by a team at the Center for Children's Health and the Environment at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. This study found that hospitalization rates were as much as 21 times higher in poor, minority areas than in the hardest-hit areas of wealthier communities. The article quotes Dr. Claudio, an assistant professor in the division of neuropathology at Mount Sinai, who said, ``The outcomes in the poor Latino and African-American areas, especially among children, are tragic.'' This Mount Sinai report cited previous studies that suggest that poor African-American and Latino children are suffering at higher rates because the poor often rely on care in emergency rooms, where doctors have little time to educate families on how to control the disease and where there is little follow-up care. Without receiving adequate care and medication, the asthma victims eventually suffer such severe attacks that they need immediate hospitalization. 
   Those are some of the reasons why I joined my colleague, Senator DURBIN, in introducing S.805, the ``Children's Asthma Relief Act.'' This bill will help ensure that children with asthma receive the care they need to live normal lives. It provides grants that will be used to develop and expand asthma services to children, 
   equip mobile health care clinics that provide diagnosis and asthma-related health care services, educate families on asthma management, and identify and enroll uninsured children who are eligible for, but not receiving, health coverage under Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program. By requiring coordination with current children's health programs, this bill will help us identify children--in programs such as supplemental nutrition programs, Maternal and Child Health Programs, child welfare and foster care and adoption assistance programs--who are asthmatic, but might otherwise remain undiagnosed and untreated. 
   By increasing local asthma surveillance activities through legislation, such as S.805, and by better educating the public on the importance of asthma awareness and management through events like Asthma Awareness Day, we can help reverse the distressing increase in hospitalization rates and mortality rates due to asthma. As a person with asthma, and as the father of 3 children with asthma, I know first-hand how important diagnosis, treatment, and management are to ensuring that this manageable disease will not prevent children and adults from carrying on normal lives. We can make a big difference. 
   Asthma is a serious health concern that simply must be addressed. 
   I commend my colleague, Senator FRIST, for the outstanding children's health hearing that his Public Health Subcommittee held on September 16. A very articulate 13-year old named Robert Jackson from South Euclid, OH, testified at that hearing. He described how important early diagnosis and treatment plans are for children who suffer from asthma. According to Robert, doctors at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland explained to him how he could avoid asthma ``triggers''--like cigarette smoke and strong odors like bleach--to avoid having serious asthma attacks. By learning how to manage his asthma through an asthma treatment plan, Robert now plays sports, attends school regularly, and maintains a newspaper route. 
   At a time when States, like Ohio, finally are passing laws that allow students to take their asthma inhalers to school, we need to provide the federal public health dollars to the CDC for childhood asthma screening, treatment, and education. The states gradually are realizing the severity of this disease and the need for children to access their inhalers to manage their asthma. It is now time for the Federal Government to help local communities stem the rising prevalence of the worst chronic health problem affecting children. 
   I commend my colleagues for supporting this very important amendment as it will help the nearly 5 million children who have been diagnosed with asthma, as well as those children who suffer from asthma, but remain undiagnosed and--sadly--untreated.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator SPECTER, and his subcommittee, for the tremendous job they have done in putting together this $312 billion bill. It is not easy to work within tight budget caps and fund so many agencies and institutes at levels that will make all members--and constituents--happy. I'd like to take this opportunity to especially thank Senator SPECTER for his hard work and dedication in providing start-up funding for the Ricky Ray Fund. Even though we would have all liked to have seen full funding, I realize that Senator SPECTER and his subcommittee performed a monumental task in funding $50 million to make the Ricky Ray Fund a reality. I look forward to working with my colleagues next year to finish the job we are beginning in this appropriations bill and fund the remaining amounts for the Ricky Ray Fund that we authorized last year. 
   As for the appropriations bill that is before us, I would like to ask my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator SPECTER, to clarify the ``Pediatric Research Initiative'' provision that is on page 138 of the Committee Report. It is my understanding that the Report should state that the ``Committee further encourages the Director of NIH to expand extramural research directly related to the illnesses and conditions affecting children.'' The Report currently states that the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) should expand extramural research, but it should state that the Committee encourages the Director of NIH to expand extramural pediatric research--is that correct?

   Mr. DEWINE. The Committee Report also currently states that the Committee also encourages the Institute to provide additional support for institutional and individual research training grants for medical schools' departments of pediatrics. It is my sense that the Report should state that the Committee encourages the NICHD to provide additional support for institutional and individual research training grants for medical schools' departments of pediatrics.

   Mr. DEWINE. I share the concerns of the Senator from North Dakota about the proposed funding level for vocational education. As the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee that had the responsibility for reauthorizing the Perkins Act, I can assure my colleagues that the reauthorization of this law, which Congress enacted last year with strong bipartisan support updated the Perkins programs. The authorized funding level for the Perkins Act was increased by $10 million from $1.14 billion to $1.15 billion. Now that this work is done, now is the appropriate time to increase funding for vocational education.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, yesterday my colleagues in the Senate, Senator HELMS, Senator ENZI, Senator VOINOVICH, Senator Tim HUTCHINSON, and Senator NICKLES, introduced a bill that would establish new criminal penalties for anyone injuring or harming a fetus while committing another Federal offense. By providing a Federal remedy, our bill, the bill we are calling the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, will help ensure that crimes against unborn victims are in fact punished. The House passed their version of this bill yesterday by a vote of 254 to 172. 
   Tragically, unborn babies, perhaps more than we realize, are the targets--sometimes intended, sometimes otherwise--of violent acts. That is why we need to pass this bill. 
   Let me give several very disturbing real-life examples. 
   In 1996, Airman Gregory Robbins and his family were stationed in my home State of Ohio at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. At that time, Mrs. Robbins was more than 8 months pregnant with a daughter whom they would name Jasmine. 
   On September 12, 1996, in a fit of rage, Airman Robbins wrapped his fist in a T-shirt to reduce the chance he would inflict visible injuries and then savagely beat his wife by striking her repeatedly about the head and the stomach. Fortunately, Mrs. Robbins survived this violent assault, but, sadly and tragically, her uterus ruptured during the attack, expelling the baby into her abdominal cavity, causing this little child's death. 
   A prosecutor sought to prosecute the airman for the little girl's death, but neither the Uniform Code of Military Justice nor the Federal code makes criminal such an act, such an act which results in the death or injury of an unborn child. So they had to look outside the Federal code, outside that law. The only available Federal offense actually was for the assault on the mother. That, of course, is a Federal offense. 
   This was a case in which the only available Federal penalty obviously did not fit the crime. So prosecutors looked outside Federal law, used Ohio law, and then bootstrapped--if we can use the term--the Ohio fetal homicide law to convict Mr. Robbins of Jasmine's death. This case is currently pending appeal. We certainly hope justice is done. It is being appealed under the theory that if it was not in fact a Federal offense, you could not use the assimilation statute to bring this into the court using the Ohio law. 
   If it weren't for the Ohio law that is already in place and that the Presiding Officer of the Chamber was very instrumental in getting passed and signed into law, there would have been no opportunity to prosecute and punish Airman Robbins for the assault against baby Jasmine. 
   We need a Federal remedy to avoid having to bootstrap State laws and to provide recourse when a violent act occurs during the commission of a Federal crime, especially in cases when the State in which the crime occurs does not have a fetal protection law in place, because there are some States that simply do not. 
   There are other sickening examples of violence against innocent unborn children. An incident occurred in Arkansas just a few short weeks ago. Nearly 9 months pregnant, Shawana Pace of Little Rock was days away from giving birth to a child. She was thrilled about the pregnancy. Her boyfriend, Eric Bullock, did not share her joy and did not share her enthusiasm. In fact, Eric wanted the baby to die. So he hired three thugs to beat her, and to beat her so badly that she would lose this unborn child. During the vicious assault against mother and child, one of the hired hitmen allegedly said--and I quote--Your baby is going to die tonight. 
   Tragically, the baby did die that night. Shawana named the baby Heaven. We all should be saddened, we all should be sickened, by the sheer inhumanity and brutality of this act of violence. 
   Fortunately, the State of Arkansas, like Ohio, passed a fetal protection law which allows Arkansas prosecutors to charge defendants with murder for the death of a fetus. Under previous law,  such attackers could be charged only with crimes against the pregnant woman. That is under the old law, as in the case of Baby Jasmine's death in Ohio, but for the Arkansas State law, there would be no remedy--no punishment--for Baby Heaven's brutal murder. The only charge would be assault against the mother. 
   Another example: In the Oklahoma City World Trade Center bombings--here, too--Federal prosecutors were able to charge the defendants with the murders of, or injuries to, the mothers --but not to their unborn babies. Again, Federal law currently only provides penalties for crimes against born humans. There are no Federal provisions for the unborn, no matter what the circumstances, no matter how heinous the crime. This clearly is wrong. 
   Within the Senate, we have the power to do something about this, to rectify this wrong, to change the law. That is what our bill is intended to do. 
   It is wrong that our Federal Government does absolutely nothing to criminalize violent acts against unborn children. We must correct this loophole. I think most Americans would look at it that way and say that is a loophole that should not exist. Congress should change this. We must correct this loophole in our law, for it allows criminals to get away with violent acts--and sometimes even allows them to get away with murder. 
   We, as a civilized society, should not, with good conscience, stand for that. That is why our bill would hold criminals liable for conduct that harms or kills an unborn child. It would make it a separate crime under the Federal Code and the Uniform Code of Military Justice to kill or injure an unborn child during the commission of certain existing Federal crimes. 
   Our bill, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, would create a separate offense for unborn children. It would acknowledge them as the victims they are. Our bill would no longer allow violent acts against unborn babies to be considered victimless crimes. At least 24 States already have criminalized harm to unborn victims, so this is not a new concept. Another seven States have criminalized the unlawful termination of a pregnancy. 
   In November of 1996, a baby, just 3 months from full term, was killed in Ohio as a result of road rage. An angry driver forced a pregnant mother's car to crash into a flatbed truck. Because the Ohio Revised Code imposes criminal liability for any violent conduct that terminates a pregnancy of a child in utero, the prosecutor successfully tried and convicted the driver for recklessly causing the baby's death. Our bill would make an act of violence such as this a Federal crime. It would make sure it was always covered. This is a very simple step, but one that will have a dramatic affect. It is, quite frankly, a question of justice. 
   Let me make it clear to my colleagues in the Senate that we purposely drafted this legislation very narrowly. For example, it would not permit the prosecution for any abortion to which a woman consented. It would not permit the prosecution of a woman for any action--legal or illegal--in regard to her unborn child. That is not what the intent of this legislation is all about. This legislation, further, would not permit the prosecution for harm caused to the mother or unborn child in the case of medical treatment. The bill would not allow for the imposition of the death penalty under this act. 
   It is time we wrap the arms of justice around unborn children and protect them against criminal assailants. Those who violently attack unborn babies are criminals. The Federal penalty should, in fact, fit the crime. I strongly urge my colleagues to support our legislation. We have an obligation to our unborn children. This bill will bring about justice. It is the right thing to do. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
   Ms. LANDRIEU addressed the Chair.

    Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, today I rise to speak on behalf of unborn children who are the victims of violence. I am here to be their voice; I am here to fight for their rights. 
   We live in a violent world, Mr. President. Sadly, sometimes--perhaps more often than we realize--even unborn babies are the targets, intended or otherwise, of violent acts. I'll give you some disturbing examples. 
   In 1996, Airman, Gregory Robbins, and his family were stationed in my home state of Ohio at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton. At that time, Mrs. Robbins was more than eight months pregnant with a daughter they named Jasmine. On September 12, 1996, in a fit of rage, Airman Robbins wrapped his fist in a T-shirt (to reduce the chance that he would inflict visible injuries) and savagely beat his wife by striking her repeatedly about the head and abdomen. Fortunately, Mrs. Robbins survived the violent assault. Tragically, however, her uterus ruptured during the attack, expelling the baby into her abdominal cavity, causing Jasmine's death. 
   Air Force prosecutors sought to prosecute the Airman for Jasmine's death, but neither the Uniform Code of Military Justice nor the Federal code makes criminal such an act which results in the death or injury of an unborn child. The only available federal offense was for the assault on the mother. This was a case in which the only available federal penalty did not fit the crime. So prosecutors bootstrapped the Ohio fetal homicide law to convict Mr. Robbins of Jasmine's death. This case currently is pending appeal, and we do hope that justice will prevail. 
   Mr. President, if it weren't for the Ohio law that is already in place, there would have been no opportunity to prosecute and punish Airman Robbins for the assault against Baby Jasmine. We need a federal remedy to avoid having to bootstrap state laws and to provide recourse when a violent act occurs during the commission of a federal crime--especially in cases when the state in which the crime occurs does not have a fetal protection law in place. A federal remedy will ensure that crimes against unborn victims are punished. 
   There are other sickening examples of violence against innocent unborn children, Mr. President. An incident occurred in Arkansas just a few short weeks ago. Nearly nine months pregnant, Shawana Pace of Little Rock was days away from giving birth. She was thrilled about her pregnancy. Her boyfriend, Eric Bullock, however, did not share her joy and enthusiasm. In fact, Eric Bullock wanted the baby to die. So, he hired three thugs to beat Shawana so badly that she would lose the unborn baby. 
   During the vicious assault against mother and child, one of the hired hitmen allegedly said: ``Your baby is going to die tonight.'' Shawana's baby did die that 
   night. She named the baby Heaven. Mr. President, I am saddened and sickened by the sheer inhumanity and brutality of this act of violence. 
   Fortunately, the State of Arkansas, like Ohio, passed a fetal protection law, which allows Arkansas prosecutors to charge defendants with murder for the death of a fetus. Under previous law, such attackers could be charged only with crimes against the pregnant woman. As in the case of Baby Jasmine's death in Ohio, but for the Arkansas state law, there would be no remedy--no punishment--for Baby Heaven's brutal murder. The only charge would be assault against the mother. 
   In the Oklahoma City and World Trade Center bombings--here too--federal prosecutors were able to charge the defendants with the murders of or injuries to the mothers--but not to their unborn babies. Again, federal law currently only criminalizes crimes against born humans. There are no federal provisions for the unborn. 
   This is wrong. 
   It is wrong that our federal government does absolutely nothing to criminalize violent acts against unborn children. We must correct this loophole in our law, for it allows criminals to get away with violent acts--and sometimes even murder. 
   We, as a civilized society, should not--with good conscience--stand for that.  
   So, today, I am introducing legislation, along with my distinguished colleagues, Senator TIM HUTCHINSON and Senator ABRAHAM, to provide justice for America's unborn victims of violence. Our bill, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, would hold criminals liable for conduct that harms or kills an unborn child. It would make it a separate crime under the Federal code and the Uniform Code of Military Justice to kill or injure an unborn child during the commission of certain existing federal crimes. 
   The Unborn Victims of Violence Act would create a separate offense for unborn children--it would acknowledge them as individual victims. Our bill would no longer allow violent acts against unborn babies to be considered victimless crimes. At least twenty-four (24) states already have criminalized harm to unborn victims, and another seven (7) states criminalize the termination of pregnancy. 
   Mr. President, in November of 1996, a baby, just three months from full-term, was killed in Ohio as a result of road rage. An angry driver forced a pregnant mother's car to crash into a flatbed truck. Because the Ohio Revised Code imposes criminal liability for any violent conduct which terminates a pregnancy of a child in utero, prosecutors successfully tried and convicted the driver for recklessly causing the baby's death. Our bill would make an act of violence like this a federal crime. It would be a simple step, but one with a dramatic effect. 
   Mr. President, we purposely have drafted this legislation very narrowly. For example, it would not permit the prosecution for any abortion to which a woman consented. It would not permit the prosecution of a woman for any action (legal or illegal) in regard to her unborn child. This legislation would not permit the prosecution for harm caused to the mother or unborn child in the course of medical treatment. And, the bill would not allow for the imposition of the death penalty under this Act. 
   Mr. President, it is time that we wrap the arms of justice around unborn children and protect them against criminal assailants. Those who violently attack unborn babies are criminals. The federal penalty should fit the crime. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation. We have an obligation to our unborn children.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a very important issue concerning the Department of Energy and its ability to secure nuclear information. Nuclear security is imperative to this nation, and after the scandals in the last year, Americans have questioned the ability of the Department of Energy to keep nuclear information secure. As a result, Senator WARNER, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee and Ranking Member LEVIN included legislation in the Defense Authorization Conference Report that creates a new division within the Department to restore nuclear security. I applaud their efforts. 
   However, Mr. President, I am concerned about the potential for unintended consequences as a result of the Department of Energy reorganization. Specifically, the attorneys general of 46 states, including the State of Ohio, wrote to Congress stating that the 1992 Department of Energy reforms which clarify that states have regulatory authority of the Department of Energy's hazardous waste management and cleanup could be undermined by this legislation. The attorneys general believe that this legislation could allow the Federal Government to abandon its commitment to ``environmental, health and safety requirements'' at Energy Department facilities nationwide. This is troubling for the State of Ohio, which has three former Department of Energy nuclear facilities--the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant, Fernald, and the Mound Nuclear Facility. Each facility is at a different stage of cleanup, and recent revelations of plutonium contamination at the Portsmouth facility only emphasize the need for strong environmental, health, and safety requirements at these DOE facilities. 
   While I have heard the concerns of the attorneys general, I am assured by the Armed Services Committee that the intent of this legislation is not to exempt nuclear facilities from state environmental regulations and requirements or worker safety and health regulations. I am further assured that if there are any unintended consequences, Congress will rectify these problems.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me first thank my friend from Missouri, Senator BOND, and my colleague from Maryland, Senator MIKULSKI. They have produced, I believe, under some very tough, difficult circumstances, a very excellent, very fair, and very balanced bill. Members of the Senate are certainly indebted to them for the tremendous work they have put in and the product they have produced. 
   The amendment I have just sent to the desk is a very commonsense amendment. In fact, I believe it really builds upon the very commonsense language included in the VA-HUD appropriation bill committee report. That part of the committee report states the committee is concerned about the duplication of work being performed throughout the NASA field centers. It instructs NASA, by April 15 of the year 2000, to produce a preliminary action plan to map out what each of the field center's future roles and responsibilities will be. 
   The most important part of this report language states:  
   NASA should identify where a center has or is expected to develop the same or similar expertise and capacity as another center, including justification for this need.  
   I do not believe, at a time when NASA's overall funding is increasing, NASA should be duplicating any capabilities that already exist at one center at a different center. It just makes no sense. This really defies logic. My amendment would simply prevent NASA from spending any money to duplicate capabilities that already exist. 
   Let me say in conclusion, I appreciate that the authors of this bill are willing to accept this amendment. Let me pledge to the authors of the bill, I will continue to work with them and continue to work with NASA to resolve this issue.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon on behalf of my colleague, Senator HAGEL, as well as Majority Leader LOTT, Senator AKAKA, Senator INOUYE, Senator ROBERTS, Senator BUNNING, Senator VOINOVICH, Senator DORGAN, and Senator CONRAD, to introduce the Carousel Retaliation Act of 1999. This bill would create a powerful mechanism to protect our Nation from illegal foreign trade practices. 
   These are the facts. Today, our Nation is being injured by the refusal of  some foreign countries to comply with World Trade Organization, WTO, dispute settlement rulings. Let me repeat that. Other countries are failing to comply with the rulings of the WTO. As many of my colleagues know, the WTO has a very detailed process for handling trade disputes between member nations. Unfortunately, some member nations are simply undermining this entire process by refusing to comply with the final dispute settlement decision, even after losing their cases on appeal. 
   Noncompliance with dispute settlement rulings severely undermines open and fair trade. As many of our farmers, cattle ranchers, and large and small businessowners know firsthand, this is having a devastating impact on their efforts and attempt to maintain or gain access to important new international markets. 
   In an effort to secure compliance, the dispute settlement process provides the winning nation the authority to retaliate. The winning nation, after a decision has been made, can legally retaliate. That is what the provision is; they can retaliate against that losing nation. They can do so if, at the end of a reasonable period of time, the losing country does not abide by the final decision. Retaliation usually begins with the estimation of damages caused by the refusal, followed then by WTO authorization to impose penalty duties on the offending country's exports. However, even with retaliation, some nations are still refusing to comply. 
   The European Union has made it clear that it is willing to live in perpetuity with the present U.S. retaliation lists, which is why the WTO ruled in both the pending beef and banana trade cases that the United States can impose retaliatory tariffs on European imports. We are doing that. Moreover, they are entertaining the possibility of subsidizing their affected domestic targets to counter our WTO-authorized action. Not only are they ignoring what the ruling was, not only are they ignoring our retaliation, now they are turning around and preparing to subsidize these particular products. Both of these trade cases that I have mentioned took several long years to work through the dispute settlement system and were undertaken, frankly, at great expense to the U.S. Government and to the private sector in our country. 
   The European Union's actions are establishing a very dangerous precedent. If they are successful, then other nations can be expected to follow a similar course. Something simply must be done. Something must be done to increase the likelihood of compliance, or we risk losing more than a WTO case; we risk losing American jobs. Therefore, it is important that the WTO's dispute settlement process be strengthened. That is what this bill does, and that is what we are talking about today. 
   Our proposed Carousel Retaliation Act will help ensure the integrity of the WTO settlement dispute process because it will provide a powerful mechanism that will place considerable pressure on noncompliant countries to comply. The measure will shake these noncompliant countries up and it will complicate any effort they undertake to counter U.S. retaliatory measures. Specifically, our bill would amend the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 by requiring the U.S. Trade Representative to periodically carousel--or rotate--the list of goods subject to retaliation when a foreign country or countries have failed to comply with a WTO ruling. Let me add that this is very clearly consistent with WTO rules. 
   Under our bill, the retaliation list would be carouseled, or rotated, to affect other goods 120 days from the date the first list is made, and then every 180 days thereafter. The bill provides the U.S. Trade Representative the authority to make exceptions. The representative would not have to do this if, 1, it could be determined that compliance is imminent; or, 2, if both the U.S. Trade Representative and the affected petitioners agree that carouseling in that particular case is not necessary. Currently, the U.S. Trade Representative has the authority to carousel retaliation lists, but is not required to do so. What our bill does is change the law and requires the Trade Representative to do this. 
   The WTO is one of the most important means for American businesses and producers to open foreign markets, liberalize commerce, resolve disputes, and ensure more open and fair trade. American farmers and agribusiness, for example, are major net exporters, posting exports of more than $57 billion in 1997. But frankly we can do more and better, and we must. Of the nearly 50 complaints filed by the United States in the WTO, almost 30 percent involved agriculture. If countries fail to comply with WTO rulings, American agriculture and other U.S. sectors in need of trade relief will suffer greatly. The American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the American Meat Institute, the U.S. Meat Export Federation, and the Hawaii Banana Industry Association support the bill. 
   The ``Carousel Retaliation Act,'' candidly, is tough, but it is meant to be tough. It is the right response to chronic noncompliance with WTO rules. 
   Again, I commend my colleague, Senator HAGEL, who is on the floor at this moment, and Senators LOTT, AKAKA, INOUYE, ROBERTS, BUNNING, VOINOVICH, DORGAN, and CONRAD for their dedication to this issue. 
   I urge my colleagues to join this effort to protect our Nation from illegal foreign trade practices and cosponsor the ``Carousel Retaliation Act.'' 
   I thank the Chair. 
   I see my colleague from Nebraska is on the floor. I suspect he would like to talk about this bill as well. 
   Thank you very much. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk for a few moments about the Transportation appropriations bill we just passed and about one major component of that bill, and that is the U.S. Coast Guard. 
   I rise this afternoon to make one point very clear. The U.S. Coast Guard needs our help and needs our support. The future of the Coast Guard depends on a continued congressional commitment to provide adequate resources to the Coast Guard to carry out its very important mission. 
   Now, Congress--only in the last few years, with the leadership of a number of my colleagues--has begun to devote resources toward rebuilding the readiness of the Coast Guard. But we have to understand that this is a continuous process. These investments we have made have come at a time when we have seen the missions of this important agency increase and expand. 
   Let me pause to congratulate Senators SHELBY, LAUTENBERG, and the rest of the committee. They have been very supportive of the Coast Guard and have worked very hard to come up with the very scarce dollars that are needed for the Coast Guard. I appreciate their work. I understand very well that they know and understand the challenges the Coast Guard faces. They have supported investments in the Coast Guard and understand the important role it plays in fighting drug trafficking. 
   I also know that in crafting the Transportation appropriations bill, my colleagues were faced with very difficult budget constraints. It is essential, however, that our overall investment in the Coast Guard keeps pace with the demands we are now placing on the Coast Guard and that we build on the recent successes we have seen in regard to the Coast Guard. We simply, as a Congress and as a Nation, in very tough and difficult budget times, must make funding for the Coast Guard a top priority. 
   It is obvious why a Senator from Ohio would have an interest in the Coast Guard. In my home State of Ohio, the Ninth Coast Guard District performs many vital functions critical to human safety and economic development. With more than 2.3 million of America's 11.5 million recreational boaters residing in the Great Lakes region, the Ninth Coast Guard District search and rescue units handle close to 7,500 cases annually, saving hundreds and hundreds of lives. 
   Further, to facilitate commerce on the Great Lakes during the winter months, Coast Guard cutters work closely with the Canadian Coast Guard to clear the way for approximately $62 million worth of commercial cargo annually. This Ninth District also maintains more than 3,300 buoys, navigational lights, and fixed aids throughout this critical shipping region. 
   In addition to this role of the Coast Guard in my State of Ohio, it plays a significant role in the international drug fight. This may not be what people have historically thought about regarding the Coast Guard, but let me tell you, based on my own experience in going out with the Coast Guard and seeing what they do, if we give them the money, if we give them the resources, they are not only capable but they are willing and eager to go out and fight our antidrug battle for us. 
   To quantify it, because of the Coast Guard, each year close to $3 billion worth of drugs never reach our neighborhoods, never reach our schools, and never reach our children. They are stopped before they get there, and they are stopped by our Coast Guard. 
   I have spoken on the Senate floor on several occasions in the past about U.S. counternarcotics policy. I have spoken about the Coast Guard's ability to enforce that policy. As I have said before, I believe we need a balanced program to attack the drug problem on all fronts. We need to invest in domestic reduction and law enforcement programs. But we also need to invest in international programs to increase interdiction and reduce production of illegal narcotics, and we need to do our best to stop drugs from ever reaching our shores. 
   A balanced program means international drug interdiction. It means domestic law enforcement. It also means prevention, education, and treatment. We have to do all of these, and we have to do all of them all the time. 
   Sadly, though, for the last 7 years this administration has pursued an antidrug strategy that I believe is clearly out of balance--a strategy that has failed to reverse a dramatic rise in youth drug use and a strategy that has allowed drug trafficking organizations to become a dominant source of political instability in Latin America and countries to our south. 
   Before the Clinton administration took office, almost a third of our entire antidrug Federal budget was committed to stopping drugs from ever getting into our borders--international drug interdiction and eradication. We invested in a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week antidrug operation in the Caribbean. It worked. Drug prices increased and drug consumption went down. 
   But tragically this all changed in 1993 when the Clinton administration came into power and began to change things. Our counternarcotics budget dedicated to international eradication and interdiction efforts went from one-third of the total budget in the late 1980s and early 1990s to less than 14 percent by 1995. This change in policy meant significant cuts in the Coast Guard. In fact, Coast Guard funding for counternarcotics decreased from $443 million in 1992 to $301 million in 1995, almost a one-third reduction. As a consequence, the number of ship days that were devoted to overall counterdrug activities declined from 4,872 in 1991 to 1,649 in 1994--a huge decrease. 
   As a result, with the reduced Coast Guard presence, more and more drugs are making their way into our country through the Caribbean. That is the main reason why drugs are more affordable. It is also one of the reasons why youth drug use in this country is dramatically higher now than at the beginning of the Clinton administration. 
   Last year, as I have shared with Members of the Senate before, I saw firsthand what the Coast Guard can do. I went with the Coast Guard to see the counterdrug operations off the coast of Haiti, off the coast of the Dominican Republic, and off the coast of Puerto Rico. These personal visits convinced me that the Coast Guard can do more if we simply provide the right levels of  material and manpower to fight drug trafficking. They are ready to do it. They just need the resources. These visits also convinced me that this Congress had to address the state of drug-fighting readiness in our country. 
   Thanks to the majority leader, Senator LOTT, thanks to the 
   Senate Appropriations Committee, and thanks to my colleagues, Senator COVERDELL, Senator GRAHAM of Florida, Congressman MCCOLLUM, and Speaker HASTERT, who all share my dedication to fighting drugs, we passed, last year, the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. This act authorizes a $2.7 billion, 3-year investment to rebuild our drug-fighting capability outside our borders to stop drugs, quite frankly, where it is easiest to stop them--at the source and in transit. 
   This new law that Congress passed is about reclaiming the Federal Government's sole responsibility to prevent drugs from ever reaching our borders. Last year, Congress made an $800 million downpayment for this initiative, including $375 million for the Coast Guard. 
   Why is it significant? It is significant because international drug interdiction--stopping drugs at the border, stopping them on the high seas, stopping them at the source--is the sole responsibility of the Federal Government. It is not a shared responsibility with the States or the local communities. Every other facet of our antidrug effort--whether it is treatment, prevention, education, or domestic law enforcement--are all shared responsibilities between us in Congress, the President, the Federal Government, and the local communities. But when we are talking about stopping drugs on the high seas, when we are talking about funding the Coast Guard, that is solely the responsibility of this body, the House, and the President of the United States. 
   This year, thanks to this added investment that Congress made last year for the Coast Guard, we are seeing results. 
   Just this week, the national media has focused, highlighted, and put considerable attention on the Coast Guard's successful use of force capability to disable the drug trade's ``go-fast'' boats. These are boats I have talked about before on the Senate floor. These ``go-fast'' boats are souped-up motorboats capable of outrunning most ships in the Coast Guard fleet. They now carry more than 85 percent of all maritime drug shipments--85 percent goes in these ``go-fast'' boats. These boats typically carry drug shipments from the northern coast of Colombia, for example, to the southern tip of Haiti, to the southern tip of that great island, Hispaniola. Drug traders use the boats along the coasts of the United States to pick up drugs dropped into the ocean by small aircraft. 
   The Coast Guard traditionally has been cautious in using lethal airpower to stop these boats due to the high likelihood of casualties. But thanks to a combination of technology and funding from this Congress, the Coast Guard has now demonstrated success in being able to target precisely the engines of ``go-fast'' boats and forcibly disable them, thus allowing the capture of the perpetrators and the ceasing of the illicit cargo, all while minimizing the risk to human life. It is because of these and other operations that cocaine seizures are now at an all-time high of 53 tons, with a street value of $3.7 billion. 
   We must continue to invest in Coast Guard readiness if we are to see this kind of success over the long run. It has been a challenge for Congress, given the fact the administration has not made readiness and well-being of the Coast Guard a national priority. 
   The fact is, despite the recent successes, readiness remains a problem. According to Adm. James Loy, Commandant of the Coast Guard, the Coast Guard is being stretched very thin. 
   Aircraft deployments have more than doubled, with helicopter deployments increasing by more than 25 percent. These increases did not happen with extra manpower and resources. These increases were achieved by working existing crews harder. In some cases, crews were working continuous 72-hour shifts. The Pacific area alone increased its temporary duty travel by 70 percent just to maintain the pace of routine operations. 
   So what we are saying is that we are asking the Coast Guard to do more. We began to give them significant resources last year. They are doing more. They are having successes. But unless we continue to support the Coast Guard, unless we continue to give them the resources they need, they will not be able to do the job we are asking them to do. It is as simple as that. 
   In placing these additional demands upon our service members, we have to worry about safety. I understand lost workdays and shore injuries are up 29 percent and aircraft ground mishaps are up almost 50 percent from previous years. This is something we need to be concerned about. We are talking about human lives. Further, downtime of air and marine craft is on the rise. 
   The demands on the Coast Guard are simply not decreasing; they are increasing. They have to have our support. This is why I will continue to call for the strongest investment possible for our Coast Guard. I applaud my colleagues who worked with me, including the Senator from Georgia, Mr. COVERDELL, and the Senator from Florida, Mr. GRAHAM, who stepped up to the challenge to gain additional investments last year. They and others in the House and the Senate and our Appropriations Committee particularly in the Senate deserve a great deal of the credit for the recent successes we are seeing in drug interdiction. These successes simply would not have happened but for what Congress did last year. 
   However, this is not a one-shot deal. This is not something we can do in 1 year and think it is done. We have to continue year after year. The additional 1999 funding is simply not the sole cure. It is just the downpayment. 
   We must have a sustained, multiyear effort if we expect our Coast Guard to be able to meet daily challenges and if we expect them to provide the critical services the American people expect and demand. Unless we continue with the investments we began least year, we will be sending a signal to the drug lords that this is just a temporary, maybe even a headline-grabbing effort, a politically expedient exercise. In fact, the writing is on the wall. If we fail to maintain and build on our support for the Coast Guard, these drug dealers will not believe we are serious 
   and the Coast Guard will not be able to continue the current level of counterdrug operations in the future. 
   The bottom line is we need to continue more resources. I applaud the efforts of my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee. I know they tried to allocate a more sizable portion of the budget. They were faced with daunting challenges. As a Congress and as a people we must do more. We have to. As further opportunities in this Congress present themselves, we must take those opportunities and try to provide additional funds. As I said, adequate funding for the Coast Guard should be a top national priority. So much hinges on it. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in sending a message to all of the hard-working men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard that we do not take them for granted. We will continue to make sure they have the tools necessary to accomplish the many demanding missions we ask of them on behalf of our country.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am troubled today. I am troubled because I find myself standing on the Senate floor once again raising an issue that cuts to the very core of human cruelty and moral disregard. I have stood here before, many of my colleagues have stood here before, repeatedly speaking about my strong belief that the partial-birth abortion procedure is wrong. Not only is it wrong, it is evil. The procedure is a reprehensible act of human violence, violence against a human being. 
   I recently stood here not too many weeks ago and told Members of the Senate about a helpless baby named ``Hope.'' On April 6, 1999, Baby Hope's mother entered a Dayton, OH, abortion clinic with the intention of having her pregnancy terminated through a partial-birth abortion. However, the abortion did not succeed. 
   Here is what happened: Dr. Haskell, who we have heard so much about on the Senate floor, the infamous Dayton abortionist, started the procedure as  usual by inserting instruments known as laminaria into the woman and by applying seaweed. This process is supposed to slowly dilate the cervix so the child eventually can be removed and killed. That is the procedure. That is what they do. 
   After this initial step, in this particular instance, Dr. Haskell sent the woman home because it usually takes 2 or 3 days before the baby can be removed from the womb and the abortion completed. Expecting to return in 2 or 3 days, this woman followed the doctor's orders and went home to Cincinnati. 
   Soon after she left the abortion clinic, her cervix started dilating too quickly, causing her to go into labor. Shortly 
   after midnight, on the first day of the procedure, she entered the hospital and gave birth to a very much alive but very tiny baby. The neonatologist determined that Baby Hope's lungs were too underdeveloped to sustain life without the help of a respirator. Baby Hope, however, was not placed on a respirator. Instead, the poor, defenseless creature was left to die only a little more than 3 hours after birth. 
   I am back on the floor again today because we now, tragically, have another example of a partial-birth abortion in Ohio that did not go according to the abortionist's plan, this one occurring on August 19, a couple of weeks ago. 
   The Dayton Daily News reported this incident. The procedure was again at the hands of Dr. Haskell. Here, too, he started the barbaric procedure by dilating the mother's cervix. Similarly, this woman went into labor only 1 hour later, was admitted to Good Samaritan Hospital, and gave birth to a baby girl a short time later. This time, however, a miracle occurred. This little baby lived. 
   A medical technician appropriately named this precious little ``Baby Grace.'' After her birth, she was transferred to a neonatal intensive care unit at Children's Hospital in Dayton. The Montgomery County Children's Services Board has temporary, interim custody of little Baby Grace. She likely will face months of hospitalization and possible lifelong complications, we don't know, all resulting from being premature and the induced abortion. 
   I am appalled and sickened by the fact that both of these partial-birth abortions occurred anywhere. I am particularly offended by the fact they occurred in my home State of Ohio. But wherever they occur, it is a human tragedy. 
   I have said this before and I will say it again; the partial-birth abortion should be outlawed. Partial-birth abortion should be outlawed in our civilized society. 
   When we hear about the brutal death of Baby Hope and we think about the miracle of Baby Grace, we have to stop and ask, to what depths have we sunk in this country? Partial-birth abortion is a very clear matter of right and wrong, good versus evil. It is my wish there will come a day, I hope and pray, when I no longer have to come to this Senate floor and talk about partial-birth abortions. Until that day arrives, the day when the procedure has been outlawed in our country, I must continue to plead for the protection of unborn fetuses threatened by partial-birth abortions. 
   In the name of Baby Hope, let's stop the killing. In the name of Baby Grace, let's protect the living. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan. I join in his comments. We have heard talk on the floor about the environment. I want to talk, though, about another aspect of this, and it is the aspect my friend from Michigan has just been talking about. That is the question of highway safety. 
   I vehemently oppose this amendment. We are dealing with a question of lives. The basic facts are that heavier cars, heavier vehicles are safer, and the statistics are absolutely abundantly clear. 
   I will share some statistics with the Members of the Senate so everyone knows exactly on what we are voting. 
   An analysis by the Insurance Institute shows that cars weighing less than 2,500 pounds had 214 deaths per million vehicles per year. That is almost double the rate of vehicles that weigh 4,000 pounds or more. For vehicles that weigh 4,000 pounds or more, the death rate was 111 per million. For cars weighing less than 2,500 pounds, that was 214 deaths per million. It is double, absolutely double the figure. 
   The reality is that the majority of car fatalities in this country today occur in single vehicle crashes. To determine what costs lives and what does not, it is essential and important to look at single car weights and death rates. 
   I share another statistic with my colleagues, again, to emphasize what we are saying. 
   This is not just an ``environmental issue.'' This is not just an ``easy environmental vote.'' This is a question of life and death that we can measure. 
   Among utility vehicles, the results are even more pronounced. For those weighing less than 2,500 pounds, the death rate per million was 83. That was almost double the rate of 44 for cars weighing 4,000 pounds or more. So again, under 2,500 pounds for utility vehicles, the death rate was 83 per million; but for cars weighing 4,000 pounds or more, it was only 44 per million. Again, it is double the rate. 
   In the lightest utility vehicles, the occupant death rate was 199; again, in this case, more than 3 times the rate of 65 for utility vehicles weighing 4,000 pounds or more. 
   In conclusion, I join my colleague from Michigan. He is absolutely correct. This vote is about a lot of different things. I am sure we can talk about the environment, we can talk about many things, but the one thing we know is that lighter vehicles mean more people die; heavier vehicles mean more people live. It is as simple as that. 
   So if the Congress makes this decision and says we should artificially mandate and tell the American consumer, you need to be driving in lighter cars because Washington knows best, when we do that, when the arm of the Federal Government comes in and does that, it is not an academic exercise. It is not just the freedom to choose a car or a vehicle that people lose; what we lose are human beings. 
   Make no mistake about it. If this resolution prevails, ultimately, through the Congress, more people will die. The statistics are absolutely abundantly clear. And that is exactly what this vote is about. It is not an academic exercise. It is not an academic vote. It is not a free environmental vote one way or the other. This is about people living. This is about people dying. 
   I thank my colleague from Michigan and yield the floor.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I thank Senator GORTON and Senator BYRD, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Interior Appropriations for their hard work. As they both know, last year I sponsored the authorizing legislation for the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom. This new law directs the National Park Service to review hundreds of Underground Railroad sites in Ohio and around the country, identify the most notable locations, and produce and disseminate appropriate educational materials. I believe the history of the Underground Railroad is a part of the American story that we should be proud of. Last year, the Chairman and Ranking Member worked with me to fully fund the program in Fiscal Year 1999. I made a similar request this year. I would like to ask for clarification of some language contained in the Committee Report. Specifically, the Committee provided $1,245,891,000 to the National Park Service for park management. Is it the Chairman's intent that this figure includes $500,000 for the implementation of the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom?

    Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to introduce The Older Americans Act of 1999--a bill that will reauthorize some of the most important, vital, and successful programs the Federal government provides to senior citizens. 
   The Older Americans Act created and is responsible for: 
   Programs that provide nutrition both at home and at senior community centers; 
   Programs that protect the elderly from abuse, neglect, and unhealthy nursing homes; 
   Programs that offer valuable jobs to seniors; 
   Programs that furnish transportation; and 
   Programs that render in-home services such as assistance with house-hold tasks.  
   As we approach the new millennium, these services and many others become more and more important--in fact, essential--to the continued well-being and prosperity of our nation's senior community. We are an aging nation. Today, 12.7% of the United States' population is over the age of 65. By the year 2030, that number will grow to 20%, and there is no indication that this trend will subside. Americans are living longer; many of them are healthier, wealthier, and better educated than Americans from two generations or even one generation ago. 
   The Older Americans Act is a key component in ensuring not only valuable supportive services to lower-income older Americans, but also in establishing new and reliable services from which every older American can benefit. 
   First, I want to focus on the services this reauthorization guarantees will continue--and for which, we hope, it will secure additional funding. The largest, and one of the most important, portions of the Older Americans Act has always been nutrition programming. There are two essential and equally important parts of the Act's nutrition programming: meals served in senior citizens centers, and meals delivered to individuals' homes. 
   Providing meals in congregate settings allows people to eat with friends, take advantage of other social or informative opportunities, and be assured of a healthy diet. 
   Home delivered meal programs give homebound individuals similar assurances of a healthy diet. Additionally, programs such as Meal-On-Wheels also often give homebound seniors their only contact with the community. Those who deliver meals will also often help with minor chores and make sure that the senior they are visiting is in good general health. 
   Under this reauthorization, congregate meal funding is protected by maintaining the law's language allowing a State to transfer no more than 30% of its congregate meal funding to home-delivered programs. Likewise, States will receive increased flexibility, through a waiver process, to request that any necessary amount be moved from congregate meal funds to meet the growing needs of homebound seniors. 
   Another established service that would be improved by this bill is advocacy and protection. After a hearing that the Subcommittee on Aging dedicated to the issue of elder abuse, we made sure to include protection for elders not only from physical abuse and neglect, but also from financial abuse and exploitation. We also tied State and local advocacy and protection services directly to State and local law enforcement agencies as well as to the court system. 
   During another of the Subcommittee on Aging's several hearings, we discussed the Senior Community Employment Service Program--the only Federally funded jobs program geared specifically for older Americans. The bill makes sure that the initial focus of the program, to provide seniors opportunities in community service jobs, stays intact. However, in light of the changing demographics among many senior communities and more and more seniors staying very active and capable for longer periods of time, the bill creates another focus: employment in the private sector and in a wider array of jobs. 
   To do this, the bill creates strong links between the recently passed Workforce Investment Act and the Senior Community Employment Service Program. This will allow qualified seniors easy access to their State's workforce investment system and enhance their 
   opportunity to choose which jobs they want. Likewise, these links will provide seniors in the State workforce investment systems easy access to the Senior Community Employment Service Program. 
   Mr. President, as I mentioned, in addition to highlighting and improving the essential services that the Older Americans Act has provided so well for so long, this reauthorization also establishes new and equally reliable services from which every older American will be able to benefit. 
   I thank Senator GRASSLEY, and the Senate's Special Committee on Aging, for all his work, hearings, research, and help in developing two such services. The first is the National Family Caregiver Support Act, and the second is the Older Americans Act's new Pension Counseling program. 
   The National Family Caregiver Support Act, through a network of Area Agencies on Aging and service providers, will provide family members--nonprofessional or informal caregivers--valuable information and assistance about how to begin and continue caring for an aging relative. During another of our Subcommittee hearings, we heard moving testimony from a woman who decided that instead of placing her mother in a costly nursing home that would provide questionable care, she would bring her mother home and give her the care and attention she believed her mother needed and deserved. 
   She did this at no small cost to herself. She had to discontinue her doctorate program. She had to find a job that had more accommodating hours and unfortunately with lower pay. She found that the State agency on aging and other bureaucratic ``assistance'' were more trouble than they were worth. 
   She needed advice about lifting her mother, feeding her mother, medications, and many other challenges. Most of all, however, she said she just needed a break. The critical part of the National Family Caregiver Support Act would give her that break in the form of respite care; someone to take over for her for a weekend, a day, even a few hours so she could shop for herself, complete some overtime work, or just rest. 
   The Caregiver Support Act also introduces an inter-generational element. During the Subcommittee's field hearing in Cleveland, we heard from grandmothers who, for any number of reasons, were now caring for their grandchildren. In some cases, their own children were addicted to drugs or in prison. Rather than relinquish their grandchildren to foster care, they took on the responsibilities of raising them. These women, and many other older Americans who now are raising children for the second time around, also need help. They need guidance, information, and respite care. Our bill would do that. 
   Another new initiative is the Pension Counseling program. This program would provide desperately needed assistance to retirees who are in jeopardy of losing their pensions or are having difficulty receiving their pensions payments. As more and more individuals retire with more complicated pension, cost sharing, and IRA retirement plans, this will become an invaluable service. 
   Mr. President, the Older Americans Act of 1999 will accomplish some long overdue changes. Reauthorizing this Act is a key step toward preparing this nation for the aging boom of the next few decades. However, I want to emphasize that as promising as this legislation is--and as encouraged as I am by its introduction--it is still a work in progress. There are outstanding issues that need further attention and that require additional compromise. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to resolve these issues throughout the August recess. 
   I would like to thank Senator MILKULSKI, the Subcommittee's ranking member, for all her work, expertise, and assistance in developing this bill. I would also like to thank Senator GREGG for establishing the ground work as the Subcommittee's previous Chairman and for his expertise and input. Thank you also to Senators HUTCHINSON, JEFFORDS, MCCAIN, KENNEDY, and WYDEN for all they and their staffs have contributed to the bill. 
   I look forward to continuing our work on this bill, to quickly resolving any outstanding concerns, and moving on to final passage of a new and long awaited Older Americans Act.

   Mr. DeWINE. The Senator from Missouri is exactly right. It is perhaps difficult to imagine just how concerned parents must be when they discover that their child has been exposed to a substance that might have damaging health effects. They don't know what type of harm might happen to their child--or whether any harm will happen. But the possibility is there--and to a parent, that threat can truly be frightening. In these emergency situations, the poison control center experts can quickly help parents determine the appropriate response. They might tell the parents that whatever substance that child has been exposed to doesn't pose a health threat at all. Other times, that threat is real, and the poison control center can help parents administer immediate treatment at home or provide treatment advice until the parents can get the child to the nearest emergency room. Either way, the poison control center is absolutely essential in responding to the emergency by providing immediate treatment advice when the emergency is real and providing peace of mind for the parents and reducing unnecessary healthcare and hospitalization when the exposure does not pose a health threat to the child.

   Mr. DeWINE. This bill makes clear that the establishment of a national toll-free number to access poison control centers should not be interpreted as prohibiting the establishment or continued operation of any privately funded nationwide toll-free number used by agricultural pesticide companies, consumer products companies, pharmaceutical companies, and other groups who fund their own toll-free customer service numbers in the event of a poisoning or accidental exposure involving one of their own products. We also make clear that none of the funds that this bill authorizes may be used to help private companies fund their own toll-free numbers. We just want to clarify that this bill neither funds nor prohibits private entities from funding their own toll-free customer service numbers. I thank my colleague for his comments and for his strong support of this bill.

    Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would authorize the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods, otherwise known as ``ICCVAM.'' This bill would permanently establish ICCVAM, which currently only exists as a ``standing'' committee--so, it could be dismantled at any time. This bill would make it more permanent, thus giving companies and Federal agencies a sense of certainty, and encourage them to make the long term research investments that are required to develop alternative animal toxicology test methods for ICCVAM to review. This will decrease, and may ultimately lead to the end of, the use of animals in testing cosmetics, shampoos, detergents, and other products. 
   ICCVAM was created pursuant to the 1993 National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act's mandate that the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) recommend new processes for Federal agencies' acceptance of alternative toxicology tests using animals. ICCVAM is composed of representatives of 13 Federal agencies that use animals in toxicology research. 
   ICCVAM evaluates and recommends improved testing methods and makes it possible for more uniform testing to be adopted across Federal agencies. This legislation maintains the current practice of leaving the ultimate decision of whether or not to adopt the new test method up to each individual Federal agency. For example, a new lab test using a skin substitute has been evaluated and accepted by ICCVAM so that potentially toxic substances can first be tested on this ``substitute skin'' rather than on an animal. The test is a measure of the ability of a chemical to burn the skin. If the substance tests positive (i.e., burns or irritates the ``substitute skin''), then it could be considered to produce skin burns and no animal would be used in further testing. If the substance does not irritate the ``artificial skin,'' then the substance might then be tested on an animal. Ultimately, ICCVAM streamlines the test method validation and approval process by evaluating methods of interest to multiple agencies. By having the same method in place in multiple agencies, it aids in reducing the need to perform multiple animal tests to meet the requirements of various federal agencies. This bill and ICCVAM do not apply to regulations related to medical research. This bill is supported by the Humane Society of the United States, the Doris Day Animal League, Procter & Gamble, the American Humane Association, Colgate-Palmolive Company, the Gillette Company, and the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would ensure the future success of international micro-enterprise grant and loan programs. Many members of Congress have seen the success of micro-enterprise programs around the world. These programs reach the poorest of the poor with small loans to help them work their way out of poverty. These have proven to be very worthwhile and successful programs administered worldwide by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). 
   Unlike other assistance programs, we do not give funds away. Instead, we lend these funds to people once considered credit risks. The record of these programs boasts a client repayment rate of between 95% to 98%. Micro-enterprise programs are proof that with access to credit, the poor can and do better their lives while repaying their loans. 
   To ensure the future of these programs and provide continued hope to others seeking to build out of poverty, I introduce today the Micro-Enterprise for Self Reliance Act of 1999. I am pleased to be introducing the legislation along with Senators SNOWE, TORRICELLI, COLLINS, DURBIN, FEINSTEIN, MIKULSKI, SCHUMER, BINGAMAN, CHAFEE and KENNEDY. This bill would strengthen the foundations of these programs to ensure their survival and provide the mechanisms necessary for their continued success as financial institutions. First, it would provide grant assistance to micro-enterprise programs to increase availability of credit and other services. We also target half of all micro-enterprise resources to support programs that serve the poorest of the poor with loans of $300 or less. This is a key provision of the bill and would give strong direction to USAID to work with sections of society that respond best to micro-lending programs. 
   Second, this bill would authorize credits to micro-lending programs. These credits generally are used to expand already successful programs. Further, we seek to guarantee these programs' survival by establishing a facility to help rescue micro-lending institutions that are imperiled by war, currency movements or natural disasters. The facility would provide for loans to successful institutions to help them get back on their feet. 
   Finally, we are interested in encouraging the future development and stability of these programs. Our bill calls for a report by USAID that would recommend other steps that could be taken to further the development of micro-lending institutions such as networks, regulations, a federal charter, financial instruments and coordination with multilateral institutions. 
   We believe that this investment in micro-enterprise programs now will reduce the need for foreign assistance in the future. Congress now has the chance to ensure the future of these very successful programs, and help provide a sense of hope and a future of possibilities for the poor in developing countries. I thank my fellow cosponsors for their support for this legislation and look forward to working with them to gain congressional approval.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Georgia for yielding the floor. I commend him for all his tireless efforts in finding ways to combat the drug war. Mr. President, I previously gave a floor statement on the importance of the role of the Drug Enforcement Administration in keeping drugs off our streets. I have traveled with the DEA to various countries throughout the hemisphere and have seen them first hand in action. the DEA does a tremendous service to our country both inside and outside our border and should be commended. I agree with Senator COVERDELL on the need for additional funding for the DEA. I too believe that the DEA is underfunded and should receive increased funding, particularly if there are additional resources available at a later date. 
   Mr. President, I see the Chairman of the Commerce, State, Justice Subcommittee on the floor. I speak for Senator COVERDELL when I say that it is my hope that we can work together with the Subcommittee leadership to help provide additional funding for the DEA during conference, or in the future even that there may be additional available funding.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his time. In the state of Ohio the Bureau of Criminal Justice Services uses aircraft for drug eradication efforts. Under current law Ohio is forced to use private planes for this mission at a considerable cost, rather than their own surplus aircraft. Mr. Chairman is it your assessment that current law defining public aircraft places unnecessary restrictions and costly burdens on law enforcement agencies who operate public aircraft?

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, as the Senate reaches the conclusion of the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill, I would like to speak a moment about an important US law enforcement agency funded in this bill--an agency dedicated to keeping drugs off our streets. I am specifically talking about the Drug Enforcement Administration. 
   Mr. President, in 1998, the DEA seized more drugs and arrested more traffickers than ever before. With limited funding, and unlimited hard work and dedication, DEA human resources are a vital source not just for our law enforcement activities, but for other nations as well. The DEA does its job without a heavy reliance on big ticket items like ships and aircraft. On the contrary, this agency relies primarily on manpower. Their manpower and skill are what makes them such an effective organization both inside and outside our borders. 
   Fortunately after 2 years of almost stagnant funding levels, the Republican Congress has been working to increase its investment in the DEA. Last year Congress provided the DEA with $1.4 b illion in Fiscal Year 1999, an increase of roughly $60 million. This increase was possible largely through legislation Senator COVERDELL and I introduced and Congress passed last year--the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. However, we need to do more. 
   Congress should continue its support of the DEA. Increasing our investment in DEA, which will in turn increase the strength and ability of our counter-narcotics strategy, is the only way to continue to increase the numbers of drug arrests and seizures. 
   Let me give you some examples of where more DEA resources have and can continue to make a difference. Mr. President, I have visited Haiti numerous times and have visited the Dominican Republic as well. It is truly unfortunate that roughly twenty per cent of the drugs entering the United States travel through these two countries. The Haiti-Dominican Republic transit route has become increasingly popular for drug traffickers because both governments do not present a real threat to drug traffickers. What makes matters worse is that our resources devoted to preventing drugs from reaching this island have been minimal at best. 
   When I visited Haiti back in March 1998, I was astonished to find out that there was only one DEA agent stationed in Haiti. When I visited the Dominican Republic on the same trip, I was disappointed to find out there were only two DEA agents stationed there. How can our government keep drugs from entering our country if we do not make a commitment to seize drugs along a major international route on the drug trafficking highway? When I returned from that trip, I worked with the DEA and the Attorney General to get additional agents assigned to both countries. I received a commitment to station seven DEA agents in Haiti and six agents in the Dominican Republic. The process has been slow in getting the agents to Haiti--because of language training in particular--but the increase in agents has already made a tremendous difference. 
   Since that trip back in March 1998, I have returned to Haiti and the Dominican Republic, and visited with the DEA agents stationed there. As a result of our increased DEA presence on the island, the DEA, in conjunction with the US Customs and with the Haiti and Dominican governments, has pursued several counter-drug operations. Their presence also has helped increase cooperation between the two nations. 
   I had the opportunity to visit the Haitian-Dominican border last November to observe a DEA-Customs counter-drug initiative called Operation Genesis. Until that time, there was virtually no cooperation between the two nations at the border. This lack of cooperation is a major reason why the island became a popular drug trafficking route. The objective of Operation Genesis was to help both countries better coordinate and cooperate with each other to prevent drugs from transiting the border. 
   The enhanced Haitian-Dominican cooperation through overall DEA efforts has proven successful. For example, last February, the Haitian National Police in coordination with the DEA, arrested relatives of the Coneo family--a well known Colombian drug trafficking family with connections in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Heriberto Coneo's wife, son and his brother-in-law were arrested in Haiti for carrying false Dominican passports. Haiti later expelled them to the Dominican Republic, where they were arrested and placed in prison. This was a major victory. 
   Another example of this enhanced cooperation was the recent arrest of a Haitian National Police Division Chief who had fled to the Dominican Republic after his involvement in the deaths of more than 11 Haitians. The coordinated efforts by the DEA with these two countries resulted in the Dominicans arresting the police official and expelling him to Haiti. 
   The DEA also has helped train the Haitian National Police counter-drug unit. With DEA assistance, our Embassy in Port-au-Prince reports that the Haitian police has seized more than $1 million in money being smuggled out of the country in large sums. 
   I also have seen the DEA in action in South America, specifically in Peru and in Colombia. I walked through poppy fields in Neiva, Colombia where I saw first hand the source of the serious heroin problem plaguing our country today. We were in a region only 20 miles from the Colombian demilitarized zone. The DEA has been instrumental in working and training the Colombian National Police to seize drugs and arrest drug lords. 
   While, I have described a few success stories, I need to remind my colleagues that the DEA is producing incredible returns on a very small investment. 
   Imagine what more the DEA could do if they had more personnel. The fact is the DEA simply does not have the resources to meet their demanding and necessary tasks. With more resources, border initiatives like the one in Haiti and the Dominican Republic could be expanded, allowing for a greater reduction in the heavy trafficking that occurs between the two countries. With more resources, additional DEA agents can be sent overseas to assist law enforcement officials in learning ways to stop drug trafficking. That kind of investment--to build anti-drug operations in other countries--will build even more barriers to drugs outside our borders.  
   Mr. President, last March, Senator COVERDELL and I, along with a number of our colleagues--Republican and Democrat--sent a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator GREGG and Senator HOLLINGS, calling for building on this year's investment in the DEA and requesting additional funding for 300 additional DEA agents, analysts and support personnel, and for other DEA initiatives. This request would enable the DEA to carry out specific initiatives outlined in the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act, a three year initiative for enhanced international drug eradication and interdiction efforts. 
   I recognize the serious budget challenges facing this Subcommittee and other Appropriations subcommittees as well. Chairman GREGG and Senator HOLLINGS were extremely gracious in accommodating our request. Specifically, the Subcommittee earmarked $17.5 million for new DEA agents, analysts, and support staff for both international and domestic posts. 
   Mr. President, this is an important first step. It is my hope that as this bill moves to a conference with the House, the conferees will work to increase our overall investment in the DEA, so that specific priority requirements are not funded at the expense of other important DEA programs. 
   Again, Mr. President, since 1995 Congress has made great progress last year to increase our investment to revive our international counter narcotics strategy. Last year's passage of the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act was the latest example of this progress. Not only did Congress pass legislation, but we also provided an $800 million down payment for the bill. 
   Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration is not showing a similar commitment. The President's Budget for Fiscal Year 2000 provided zero funding for provisions outlined in the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. In fact, it calls for more than $100 million less than our total anti-drug funding for 1999. The Coast Guard received zero funding for the acquisition of air/maritime assets; the Drug Enforcement Agency received zero funding for new agents; our Customs Service received zero funding for procurement of maritime/air assets and zero increases for U.S. Customs inspectors. This Administration has not demonstrated a commitment to fund a real, coherent international counter-drug strategy. What good is it to have tough drug laws here at home and a tough international counter narcotics policy at and beyond the border if you do not have the resources to enforce them? 
   Mr. President, I have repeatedly expressed my concerns that the Administration has not been doing enough in the fight against drugs. When the Clinton Administration took over, the DEA workforce dropped from 7,277 in 1992 to 7,066 in 1994. However, since the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994, we have fought to boost the workforce from 7,066 to more than 9,000. The Administration's latest action, or lack of action, only reinforces my belief that more can be done. There has been an increasing number of reports of outrageous amounts of drugs being distributed throughout our country that originates internationally and domestically. Why is that? Only the federal government can devote the resources to seize drugs outside our country. It is unfortunate that the Clinton Administration continues to fail to fully support this exclusive federal responsibility. 
   With increased DEA funding, we have the opportunity to eliminate one of the most glaring omissions in the President's budget. It is my hope that we will continue to search for additional funding to the DEA so that they can hire these new agents, analysts, and support personnel without having to sacrifice other important programs. These agents would work hand-in-hand with international law enforcement authorities to provide the intelligence, expertise, and even the manpower required to arrest the drug traffickers. 
   Mr. President, I have seen the DEA at work throughout the region. The agency is a group of hard-working dedicated individuals who risk their lives to create a healthy environment for democracies to flourish, while at the same time get the drugs off the streets of America. They do so much good with the limited resources they have. It is now time for us to pass this amendment, give the DEA additional resources and once again watch the number of arrests and seizures increase causing the flow of narcotics into our country to sharply decrease. 
   Mr. President, it is time to renew drug interdiction efforts; time to provide the necessary personnel and equipment to our drug-enforcement agencies, and time to make the issue a national priority once again. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to thank Senator GREGG, the Chairman of the Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations Committee, as well as Senator HOLLINGS, for their full support of the Crime Identification Technology Act in this appropriations bill. Their support represents a strong commitment to anti-crime measures that really work to reduce crime. 
   This Act is a bipartisan law that Congress passed unanimously last year. The Crime Identification Technology Act is based on the recognition that technology is the key to the future of police work. We can no longer continue to ask law enforcement to fight increasingly mobile and sophisticated criminals with outmoded twentieth-century Technology. 
   The Crime Identification Technology Act will help state and local justice systems update and integrate their anti-crime technology systems and support their overburdened forensic crime laboratories. CITA authorizes $250 million to states and local governments each year, for five years, for crime technology. This effort is fully funded in this appropriation bill. 
   State and local governments are at a crucial juncture in the development and integration of their criminal justice technology. This bill provides for system integration, permitting all components of the criminal justice system to share information and communicate more effectively, on a real-time basis. 
   This is one of the wisest investments we could possibly make. I would like to emphasize three reasons for this. First, crime technology, in itself, is crucial to making significant reductions in the crime rates in our communities. Second, we can use this opportunity to leverage the Federal Government's investments in national anti-crime systems that require state participation, such as the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System, the National Criminal Information Center 2000, and the National Integrated Ballistics Information Network. We have literally invested billions of dollars in national systems. That is a key reason why so many organizations have applauded the appropriators' support of anti-crime technology, including the International Association of Police Chiefs, National Governor's Association, National League of Cities, American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors, the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, and our states' information repository directors in the National Consortium of Justice & Information Statistics. 
   Third, but certainly not last, there is a tremendous need to consolidate the patchwork of Federal programs, which have funded specific areas of anti-crime technology to the exclusion of others. A recent GAO report identified more than $1.2 billion in direct and indirect support to state and local governments; however, the absence of coordination and integration of both systems and funding means that if we continue the current system of disparate funding streams, there will never be enough money or integration. Too many existing Federal programs mandate specific technology spending, instead of allowing states the flexibility to meet their respective anti-crime technology needs within the type of broad framework which the Crime Identification Technology Act. CITA offers a dedicated, coordinated stream of funding to help states develop and upgrade their anti-crime technology from the patchwork of existing programs, and utilize the technical assistance of agencies who have developed technological expertise. I believe that this will greatly increase accountability and efficiency. 
   The bottom line for me, based on my more than 25 years in law enforcement, is that fully employing our anti-crime technology today will help law enforcement solve more crime, more rapidly, and pursue increasingly sophisticated, mobile criminals. 
   Again, I want to thank Chairman GREGG, and Senator LEAHY and Senator HATCH for their strong support of the Crime Identification Technology Act and its appropriation. I would also like to extend my personal thanks to Senator GREGG's staff, particularly Jim Morhard and Eric Harnschteger for making the best of a very difficult funding situation. 
   I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

   Mr. DeWINE. I am delighted to again join with my distinguished colleague from the State of Maine to try to give some relief to colleges and universities. As she has pointed out, this burden placed by Congress was unintended. I  seriously doubt if anyone thought that aspect of the legislation through or fully understood what kind of costs this would impose on our colleges. 
   The Senator has indicated that Maine, for example, has already been hit with over $100,000 in costs. We could multiply that around the country for every university and every college. This ultimately, of course, will go where all costs go, to the students and the parents. 
   This is something we should deal with and we should deal with very quickly. I join this morning with my colleague from Maine to introduce the Higher Education Reporting Relief Act. As she has indicated, this is the second time she and I have introduced legislation to provide some very much needed paperwork relief for the colleges and universities of our country. 
   A compromise version of the legislation we introduced last year was passed by Congress as part of the IRS reform bill. Senator COLLINS and I are here today to complete that very important work and to do what has remained undone from last year. 
   As my colleague from Maine has indicated, what prompted the need for this legislation was the Hope scholarship and the Lifetime Learning tax credit. This legislation required colleges and universities to comply with very burdensome and costly regulations. Schools were required to issue annual reports to students and the Internal Revenue Service detailing the students' tuition payments. The IRS planned to use the reports to monitor the eligibility of students who apply for the education tax credits. These reporting requirements require colleges and universities to spend millions of dollars to implement and maintain. 
   The legislation Senator COLLINS and I were able to pass last year eliminated many of the most burdensome reporting requirements, yet there are burdensome requirements that still remain law. It is time, we believe, to finish the job we started last year. 
   Our bill will further reduce the reporting requirements by making two very commonsense changes to our Tax Code. First, the IRS will be prohibited from imposing any new reporting requirements on colleges and universities prior to the year 2002. No school of higher education should have additional IRS requirements imposed while it is still developing its reporting system. 
   Second, the IRS will be required to update its computer system by the end of 2002. The IRS computer system would be updated to make it capable of matching the IRS taxpayer identification number of the student with the person claiming this child as a dependent. This update would greatly reduce the reporting burden of the Hope scholarship. 
   After this update, when a parent uses the Hope scholarship, the IRS will be able to electronically verify that a family was qualified to use this deduction. This process will eliminate a great deal of costly and time-consuming paperwork for the colleges and universities of our Nation. This legislation brings a simple, fair, commonsense solution to the unintentional barriers created by the reporting requirements of the Hope scholarship and the Lifetime Learning tax credit. It would represent significant savings to our colleges and to our universities. 
   I certainly hope the Senator from Maine and I will once again be successful this year, as we were last year, in bringing relief to institutions of higher education. I invite my colleagues in the Senate to join as cosponsors. 
   I, once again, thank my colleague from Maine for her leadership on this legislation. She is a true leader in the area of education and has done a great deal of work in this area. This bill is one more example of her true understanding of how the real world works--what happens in our home States when Congress takes actions that, frankly, result in unintended consequences. The unintended consequences in this case are added burdens on our colleges, costs that our colleges have to bear, costs that our colleges then have to turn around and impose on parents and students. 
   Again, I thank my colleague from Maine for once again being a true leader in this area.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to address a little known but very important issue within the Department of Veterans Affairs. The legislation would correct an injustice suffered throughout this decade by a workforce of 39,000 dedicated nurses who devote their careers toward the caring of our nation's veterans. Due to an unintentional use of federal law, the VA has allowed nurses to go up to five years in a row without a single raise. In some cases, VA nurses have received pay cuts by as much as eight percent in a single year, or received a token raise of one-tenth of one percent. I am today, along with Senators DODD, SNOWE, LANDRIEU, REID, BOXER, INOUYE, SARBANES and KENNEDY, calling on Congress to put an end to this practice by passing the VA Nurse Appreciation Act. 
   We find ourselves in this situation because of unintended consequences. In 1990, Congress passed the Nurse Pay Act, which allowed VA medical center directors to give VA nurses higher annual pay raises than other federal employees on the General Schedule (GS). At the time, this well intentioned bill was needed to address a national nursing shortage in VA hospitals. However, after the shortage eased, many medical center directors used the discretion given to them by the law to provide minimal raises and even pay cuts. In my own state of Ohio, from 1996 to 1998, VA nurses in Columbus took a 2.8% pay cut, while federal employees in the same area received pay raises ranging from 2.4% to 3%. This clearly was not what Congress had in mind when it passed the 1990 Nurse Pay Act. 
   Unfortunately, the problem is widespread and knows no geographic boundaries. From 1996-1999, nurses at sixteen different VA medical centers had their pay rate cut by as much as eight percent, while other federal employees received annual GS increases ranging from 2.4% to 3.6% or more. In addition, from 1996-1999, no raises were given to Grade I, II or III nurses at approximately 80 VA medical centers around the country. 
   To address this wrong, the VA Nurse Appreciation Act. This bill would ensure that Title 38 nurses would be eligible to receive the same annual GS increase plus locality pay provided to all other federal employees in their area. The bill would preserve the essential purpose of the 1990 Nurse Pay Act by giving the VA Secretary the discretion to increase pay, or delegate this authority to VA medial center directors if they have trouble recruiting or retaining quality nurses. 
   Mr. President, what message are we sending to our veterans when we are not willing to pay the nurses that provide their daily care the same pay increases that every federal employee now receives. Congress should be dedicated to providing our veterans the  best possible health services, and putting an emphasis on top quality nursing care is a right step in that direction. This bill would end the practice of discriminatory pay cuts by directors of VA medical facilities and provide the assurance of at least the GS raise received by all other federal employees. This bill is really about fairness. It would help those dedicated workers who have not been receiving regular pay raises for years. If we can pass this bill quickly, we can insure all VA nurses will receive a much-deserved pay raise in January 2000. 
   This bill is companion legislation to H.R. 1216, introduced by my colleague and friend from Ohio, Congressman LATOURETTE. It has the support of the American Nurses Association (ANA), the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE) along with various veterans groups, including the Disabled American Veterans and the Paralyzed Veterans of America. The LaTourette bill has bipartisan support from more than 70 House members, including 11 members of the House committee on Veterans' Affairs. 
   Congress now has the chance to right a wrong and show VA nurses that their compassion and dedication are appreciated. I urge my colleagues to support and cosponsor the VA Nurse Appreciation Act.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as debate draws to a close on managed care reform, I want to talk about a few of the key provisions that I strongly support in the comprehensive legislation developed by the Republican Health Care Task Force and my colleagues on the Senate Health Committee. 
   All throughout the process of developing responsible managed care reform legislation, I have shared the same overall policy goal held by most of my colleagues: to reform the managed care system without reducing quality, without increasing cost and without adding to the ranks of Americans who cannot afford health insurance. These are important issues for individuals and families. 
   Just as important to them, and to me, is the impact of managed care on the quality of health care provided to children. That issue, perhaps more than any other, governed how I examined and worked on this very important legislation. 
   Working with my friend and colleague from Tennessee, Senator BILL FRIST, I worked to ensure that the bill approved earlier this year by the Senate Health Committee protected the interests of families with children. The bill approved by the Committee and included in the Task Force bill provides for direct access to pediatricians. For any family, this is common sense. Pediatricians are general practitioners for children. Why should parents have to take their child to a primary care physician in order to be given permission to have the child see a pediatrician? This ``gatekeeping'' role is just not necessary. 
   That's why Senator FRIST and I worked to include language in the Committee-passed bill that lets parents bypass the gatekeeper. Under this bill, parents can take their child straight to the pediatrician. The Task Force bill also includes this language. 
   The larger debate concerns pediatric specialists. My view on this, based, I might add, on considerable personal experience, is that children are not simply a smaller version of adults. Fortunately, for the most part, children are proportionately healthier than adults. This means that for the small number of children who suffer from illnesses and conditions, they are the exception to the rule. To a parent who loves them, however, this is no consolation. Not only is their child suffering, but treatment can also be extremely expensive. 
   Children who suffer from cancer, to take one example, should be able to see a pediatric oncologist, not an oncologist who was trained to treat adults. That is why Senator FRIST and I worked to include in the Committee-approved bill an amendment that would require the practitioner, facility or center to have, and I quote from our amendment, ``adequate expertise (including age-appropriate expertise) through appropriate training and experience.'' By requiring age-appropriate expertise, we are saying that a child will see a pediatric specialist and an elderly patient will see a geriatric specialist. We are ensuring that the most vulnerable people--the youngest and  the oldest--within our population are referred to the specialists who are trained to treat their particular age group. We have also clarified this language to ensure ``timely'' access to such specialty care. 
   Mr. President, let's not lose sight of our bottom line goal: to ensure quality health care without compromising access to care. We already have 43 million Americans who are without any health care coverage. Excessive mandates on the quality of care will only drive up the cost of providing care, and could price health care out of the range of affordability. Our legislative efforts must not add to the uninsured. Mr. President, employer-provided health insurance is strictly voluntary--employers do not have to offer health insurance to their employees. So, we are walking a fine line between ensuring that our nation's health care quality remains high, while still keeping such care affordable. 
   In my home state of Ohio alone, 1.3 million of 11 million Ohioans are uninsured--they have no health care coverage at all. Worse still, in Ohio we have 305,000 children who have no health insurance coverage. With health care costs estimated to increase by 7-8 percent due to inflation alone, it is clear that we should not add to this cost increase. 
   On this score, there is serious cause for concern. A Lewin Group study found that for every one percent rise in premiums, 300,000 more people become uninsured. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the Daschle-Kennedy Patients' Bill of Rights bill would increase health care premiums by 6.1 percent. That means an additional 1.8 million Americans would lose health insurance if that particular bill becomes law. Based on data provided by the CBO, that bill would add $355 each year to the average worker's health care premium. If that is not enough to drive Americans to the ranks of the uninsured, it will certainly add to the cost of living for American families. 
   I support the Task Force legislation, which CBO estimated would raise premiums by only 0.8 percent--that's eight-tenths of one percent. This legislation also would provide direct access to pediatricians and access to specialty care. This legislation would provide for an independent external review process for all adverse coverage decisions that are based on a lack of medical necessity or investigational or experimental nature of the treatment. This process will better protect everyone, including children and the elderly, because it would ensure that the independent external reviewer assigned to review an adverse coverage determination has expertise (including age-appropriate expertise) in the diagnosis or treatment under review. All of these patient protections are included, while still keeping health care affordable. 
   I also support this legislation because it would help 317,000 Ohioans and close to 9 million other Americans nationwide who are self-employed, but can only currently deduct 45 percent of their health care costs. The self-employed are mainly farmers, family-owned and operated businesses, and independent business people and entrepreneurs. They represent the heart and soul of our economy, but the tax code treats these first-class workers like second-class citizens. 
   Mr. President, in the last several years, I have voted for legislation that would move this important tax break to full deductibility, which large corporations already have. By making such health care costs 100 percent deductible for the self-employed, we have the opportunity to reduce the ranks of the uninsured. We would be making health insurance more affordable, and more accessible for our country's self-employed workers and their families. 
   These are just some of the provisions that would improve our managed care system--improvements that would not compromise affordability and accessibility. That is why I will vote for the Task Force bill later today.

   Mr. DEWINE. I thank my friend. 
   Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Lautenberg amendment. 
   This is a commonsense amendment. 
   What are the essential facts? The essential facts are that underage drinking is a huge problem in this country. If you are worried about your child dying, this is a good place to start. 
   Statistics are absolutely unbelievable. The life expectancy of those between the age of 16 and 24 or 25 is not good. One of the main reasons it is not good is underage drinking. Most of the fatalities are connected with underage drinking. 
   Let me also state some other essential facts. 
   Advertising works. We all know it works. We know it works on campaigns. Where does the majority of the money that we raise for our campaigns go? It goes to advertising. Advertising is how we communicate with people. We know it works. 
   If we are serious about dealing with this problem, then we need to spend the money and we need to do the advertising. 
   One of the statistics that has been cited on this floor is very telling. It goes back to my question. If you are serious about this problem, if you are serious about protecting your kids, what do you do? 
   Here is one statistic. One study indicates that underage abuse of alcohol certainly has serious consequences. According to the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, underage drinking killed an estimated 6,350 young people between the age of 12 to 20. That was for the year 1994. All other illicit drugs killed 980 youth. 
   If these statistics are true--based on my experience as county prosecutor and someone who has been involved in this issue for many years, I think it is true--alcohol kills six times as many children than all other illicit drugs combined. 
   This is a very modest proposal because it does not compel the drug czar to spend money. What it simply says is that the drug czar spend some of the money that they have that has been set aside for advertising. They can, in fact, spend it on this horrendous problem. 
   All you have to do to see this problem is to go to the hospital and talk to an emergency room physician. Ask an emergency room physician how often alcohol is related to what they see. They will tell you that on any Friday night, or any Saturday night, it dominates the emergencies; that the vast majority of the emergencies they see, particularly the serious ones, are alcohol related. 
   This is a leading killer of our young people. To say that we are not going to use this money that is available for advertising, which we know is effective, for this horrendous problem, frankly, makes absolutely no sense. 
   I appeal to my colleagues. While reasonable minds can differ--and I think my colleagues on the other side of this issue have made some very interesting and some good arguments--I believe that the statistics clearly indicate that alcohol is the drug of choice among young people. 
   For those who are underage, alcohol is the drug of choice. It is the most serious drug in this country, and it is also a gateway drug, which simply means it is the drug that most young people start with, and then they ``advance'' to other drugs. 
   To be able to mount a successful and a good advertising campaign--to take the words from the amendment, the message of ``discouraging underage alcohol consumption,'' that is what this amendment would allow. 
   I urge my colleagues to allow this permissive use of the money. I believe it will save lives. I believe it is the right thing to do.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise to offer this amendment on behalf of myself and Senators ABRAHAM, BROWNBACK, SANTORUM, HELMS, ASHCROFT, MCCAIN, NICKLES, and HAGEL. 
   This amendment would maintain in force the current law restricting Federal funding for abortions only to cases of rape, incest, or life of the mother. Specifically, my amendment would maintain the status quo that limits Federal employee health plans to cover abortions only in the case of rape, incest, and threat to life of the mother. 
   This is the same amendment that was accepted during the debate for fiscal year 1999 Treasury-Postal appropriations, the same amendment agreed to by this body during the debate for fiscal years 1996 and 1997. In fact, this is the same language that has been consistently supported by a bipartisan group of Senators and Representatives from 1983 to 1999, with the exception of only 2 years. 
   I mention all of this to make it very clear to the Members of the Senate that this amendment stakes out no new ground. This amendment maintains the status quo. This amendment has been voted on time and time again by this body, and time and time again this body has accepted it. 
   The principle is a very simple one--one that goes beyond the conventional pro-choice/pro-life debates that we hear on this Senate floor. I think my colleagues know I am pro-life and, therefore, I wish to promote the values protecting innocent human life. However, I point out that the vast majority of Americans on both sides of the abortion issue strongly agree that they should not pay for someone else's abortion. That really is what this debate is about. 
   Fairly stated, this amendment is not about the morality of abortion or the right of a woman to choose abortion. Rather, this is a very narrowly focused amendment that answers a key question: Should taxpayers pay for these abortions? 
   This Senate, this Congress, has consistently answered no. Congress has consistently agreed that we should not ask taxpayers to promote a policy, in essence, of paying for abortion on demand by a Federal employee. My amendment would maintain the status quo that limits Federal employee health plans to cover abortions only in the case of rape, incest, and threat to the life of the mother. 
   The vast majority of Americans oppose subsidizing abortions. Employers, as a general principle, determine the health benefits employees receive. Taxpayers are the employers of Federal employees, and a large majority of taxpayers simply do not want their tax dollars to go to pay for abortions. Taxpayers provide a majority share of the funds to purchase health insurance for the Federal civilian workforce. This provision addresses the same core issue and simply says that the Federal Government, as the employer, is not in the business of funding abortions. Abortion is certainly a contentious issue, and we should not ask the taxpayers to pay for it. 
   In conclusion, this issue has been debated time and time again on the Senate floor. Current law limits abortion availability in Federal employee health care plans to cases of rape, incest, and to save the life of the mother. That has been the position of the Senate, that has been the position of the House, and that was approved last year and the year before as well. We should not involuntarily take the money of Americans--many of whom find abortion abhorrent--to pay for abortions.  We should not go against the will of the people of this country. We should uphold current law, and that is very simply what this amendment does. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time. 
   Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me just briefly respond to some of the comments that have been made. This matter has been debated many times on the Senate floor. I seriously doubt there will be any new points that I or anyone else will raise. 
   Sometimes the obvious must be stated: This amendment does not stop abortions. This amendment does not say to any woman what she can or cannot do. This simply says taxpayers are not going to pay for it. It is that simple. It is that basic. 
   We have to understand, on the average health plan in the Federal Government, 73 percent of the cost is paid for by the Government, which means 73 percent of the cost is paid for by the taxpayers. 
   We get back to the issue, should the American people, on an involuntary basis, through their taxes, have money taken out of their pay to be used to pay for abortions when many people believe very adamantly that this is wrong? I think the answer is absolutely not, we should not have this money involuntarily taken from taxpayers to pay for abortions, which violates the conscience of many taxpayers. 
   This is one Senator who doesn't quote polls too often on the Senate floor, but I think it has some relevance about what the American people expect us to do as far as how their taxes are spent. A Fox poll in 1998 asked: Do you think health care plans should pay for any of the cost of an abortion? That answer? Sixty percent said no. The question specifically had to do with the Federal Government paying for these Federal health care plans. Sixty percent said no; 28 percent said yes. 
   I think it is very clear, with the Federal Government paying almost three-fourths of the cost of these plans and taxpayers paying three-fourths of the cost, we understand what is at stake and what the issue is. It has nothing to do with whether or not a person has a legal right to an abortion. That is a debate for a different day.

   Mr. DeWINE. Two seconds? 
   Mr. President, this matter has been debated out, and I believe everyone knows what the issue is. It is really not a question, though, of taking anything away from Federal employees. As I pointed out earlier, my amendment simply maintains the status quo. It keeps the current law. It keeps the law that has been in effect virtually for the last decade, with the exception of a 2-year period of time. It does not take anything away. 
   It simply says taxpayers' dollars will not be used to subsidize the payment for abortions. The vast majority of the American people do not believe their tax dollars should be used to pay for someone else's abortion. Poll after poll has disclosed that. That is all this amendment does. 
   My amendment would maintain the status quo that limits Federal employee health plans to cover abortions only in the case of rape, incest and threats to the life of a mother. That is what the amendment does. It is very simple. We have voted on it time and time again. 
   I simply ask my colleagues to follow the will of the American people. The American people are the employer in this case. As my colleague from Utah pointed out so very eloquently a moment ago, that is the way every other health plan is determined. The taxpayers of this country have the right to determine this plan, and they have the right to say their tax dollars will not be used to fund abortions.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss yet again one of the key problems I have been addressing, as a U.S. Senator, over the last four years. The problem is the inflow of illegal drugs into America. I have heard it said that if we eliminate demand, if we address the domestic side of drug abuse, we really don't have to worry about illegal narcotics producers and importers, because they would then have no market for their drugs. 
   Mr. President, this argument makes sense on a superficial level, but it does not reflect reality. I have been, throughout my career as a local, state and Federal elected official, a strong supporter of domestic efforts to reduce drug demand. But I have always believed--and continue to believe--that we need a balanced program to attack the drug problem on all fronts. We need to invest not only in domestic demand reduction and law enforcement programs, but also in international programs to increase interdiction and reduce production of illegal narcotics. We need to do our best to stop drugs from ever reaching our borders. 
   Mr. President, for nearly a year, I have expressed my belief that this Administration is not doing its best to address this problem. Little seems to have changed in one year. 
   Before this Administration took office, almost one-third of our counter narcotics resources were committed to stopping drugs outside our borders. Today, that figure is less than 14 percent. Although overall funding for counter narcotics programs has increased dramatically in the last decade, from $4.5 billion to $17.8 billion, statistics show an increase in drug use among our youngest citizens. I am disturbed by how easily and how cheaply illegal drugs can be purchased. I am disturbed that the Administration is not taking seriously the initiatives Congress passed last year as part of the bipartisan Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. 
   Mr. President, President's Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2000 provided ZERO funding for any of the initiatives in that Act. In fact, the President's overall anti-drug budget for next year is $100 million less than what Congress provided in 1999. The Coast Guard received no funding to acquire additional ships and planes to stop drug trafficking in the Caribbean; the Drug Enforcement Administration received ZERO funding for new agents; the US Customs Service received ZERO funding to acquire maritime/air assets, and ZERO increases for inspectors. 
   In addition, the Administration has also ignored other key initiatives sought by Congress, including mycoherbicide research and development, and eradication and alternative crop development assistance to our Latin American neighbors, particularly, Colombia and Bolivia. I very much appreciate the efforts of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations in working with me on these issues. They have done a remarkable job to incorporate a key anti-drug initiative that was not sought by the President. 
   Specifically, Mr. President, I commend the managers of the bill for accepting the amendment offered by the Senator from Montana, Senator BURNS, to fund the mycoherbicide program which we began funding last year under the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. Mycoherbicide technology is a new and promising eradication technique for coca, poppy, and marijuana. The concept is to employ a natural disease that only attacks a specific narcotics plant without harming neighboring vegetation. Mycoherbicides can be applied through aerial spraying and will remain in the soil to prevent future growth of the narcotics crops in that area. Mr. President, this has the potential to be a very cost-effective and low-risk way to drastically reduce drug production at its source. We must pursue this technology and fund the additional research and testing necessary to bring about a deployable product as soon as possible. 
   Mr. President, let me now turn to the subject of eradication and alternative crop development assistance to Colombia and Bolivia. I am particularly concerned about the lack of resources made available by this Administration for what I consider to be our most urgent foreign assistance project--counter narcotics funding. I fear that we are sending a signal abroad that the United States is not entirely serious about the fight against drugs. 
   The report language accompanying this bill makes special mention of the progress made in the drug fight by the Government of Bolivia, and I want to add my voice to the committee report as well. Since coming to power in August of 1997, the Government of President Hugo Banzer and Vice President Jorge Quiroga has undertaken an ambitious plan to remove Bolivia from the illegal narcotics trade by the time they leave office in 2002. 
   Mr. President, many, myself included, were skeptical that this goal could be reached in the time allotted. Now, nearly two years into their ``Dignity Plan,'' the Bolivian Government has shown that this goal can be reached. Since taking office, the Banzer Government has successfully reduced Bolivia's cocaine production potential by a remarkable 40 percent. This has been accomplished by an effective eradication program and an aggressive and successful program of interdiction and control of the chemical precursors which go into cocaine production. 
   The Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill makes mention of Bolivia's success, and its financial needs. I am deeply concerned that we are not providing sufficient support to the historic effort of the Bolivian Government. They have moved tens of thousands of farmers out of the illegal coca fields and it is absolutely imperative that we help to provide viable commercial alternatives for these farmers and their families. It would be a great tragedy to be within sight of a major victory in the drug war and to lose it for want of resources. The anticipated level of funding in this Bill falls far short of what is required to finish the job in Bolivia in the next two years. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to working with the Senator from Alaska, Senator STEVENS, the Senator from Georgia, Senator COVERDELL, and the Senator from Iowa, Senator GRASSLEY, to help Bolivia and other countries in their fight against drugs. We will work with the appropriators during conference to provide the highest possible level of funding for this effort. This is a key investment in the future safety of our own streets--and it will bring us closer to the drug-free America our children deserve.

   Mr. DeWINE. If I might add something to the comments of my distinguished colleague from Georgia. Last year, the Congress added significant new money into our international and interdiction efforts. This was in part a down payment on the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act, that I introduced in the 105th Congress. It is important that we ensure that the effort begun then is sustained. Having seen first hand the positive benefits of this program in this region. I strongly believe that increased funding for INL should be strongly considered in conference.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I have a long standing interest in Haiti. I have made seven trips to this island nation in the past four years. I have spoken often about the developments in that country here on the Senate floor. I am here today because I am extremely concerned about the tumultuous conditions in Haiti. And, I feel the United States must understand the immediacy and vast importance of the present situation in order to act in an appropriate way. 
   Mr. President, the serious political and financial circumstances leave Haiti at a crossroads. In order to survive, Haiti must act decisively, and the global community must respond accordingly. 
   It is of vital importance that Haiti holds Parliamentary elections this year, and that we respond with our technical and security resources to support and strengthen this process. In addition, the U.S. Governments' policy on limiting financial assistance, which in the past I have whole heartedly embraced and which has been effective, should now be re-thought. 
   Haiti has a heritage of political turmoil and unrest. To understand the present situation, one must first comprehend the series of events in the two years which have led to this unfortunate circumstance. 
   The seriously flawed April 6, 1997 elections, which attracted less than 5 percent of the Haitian electorate, provoked the resignation in June 1997 of Prime Minister Rosney Smarth. For twenty months, a political deadlock existed between President Rene Preval and the majority party in Parliament over the contested April 1997 elections and over President Preval's nominee for Prime Minister, Jacques Edouard Alexis. The political crisis virtually paralyzed the government and delayed millions of dollars in international aid to Haiti. 
   Mr. President, in January of this year, Haiti's drawn out crisis took a very troubling turn when President Preval announced that the Haitian National Assembly's term had expired and that he would proceed to install a government by ``executive order.'' What happened in essence, of course, was that President Preval chose to ignore Haiti's Parliament and rule by decree. Tragically, President Preval effectively disbanded the Parliament and stripped them of their power. 
   Even though Prime Minister Alexis was approved by both Houses before the Parliament was dissolved, the new Prime Minister does not yet have any authority to govern because his cabinet has not been approved by the Parliament. And since there is no functioning Parliament, there can be no confirmation of the Prime Minister's cabinet. We have gone from a long period without a Prime Minister in Haiti to a period now without a governing Parliament. 
   While the political crisis in Haiti deepens, there has been some progress made. In March of this year, President Preval and the opposition political parties agreed on a Provisional Electoral Council, charge with establishing fair and equal elections. And the Council has been effective. Specifically, the Council recently made a brave and bold move by announcing the annulment of the April 1997 elections. Mr. President, I applaud this recent action. We need to support this recent overture and take it to the next level. We must urge the Haitians to have parliamentary elections. 
   We know that the present political vacuum must be filled with a credible government or else, we may risk it being filled by a de facto dictatorship. The global community has the responsibility to take action now. 
   First, the Haitians must have Parliamentary elections before the end of this year. A balance of power is fundamental to an effective democracy. The election of a new Parliament prior to Presidential elections in December 2000, begins establishing this foundational balance, which is in the best interest of Haiti. 
   The United States and the international community have the ability and resources to help in two specific ways, through technical assistance and security reinforcement. In order to ensure that the Haitians hold free, fair, open, and credible elections , the United States, in partnership with the international community, must leverage all available assets in a coordinated effort to support the election process. 
   The United States should provide resources in support of the election process to include the encouragement of political coalition building. The technical assistance can be coordinated by the other countries who are involved in Haiti that can also provide substantial financial help. 
   In addition to the technical assistance, Haiti's security must be  strengthened in order for the elections to be held in a safe environment. We must increase support to the Haitian National Police. In addition, provisions should be made so that United Nations Civilian Police--known as the CIVPOL--can continue it's important mission through this election period. There should also be a large and significant presence of international observers during the six to eight weeks prior of the elections. These basic actions taken quickly and with authority will demonstrate that the United States is committed to democracy in Haiti. 
   Second, we need to re-assess U.S. policy on financial assistance to Haiti. 
   For the past several years, the U.S. Government has conditioned assistance to the Haiti due to the Haitian Government's ineptness. While the United States has tried to help Haiti sustain democracy, unfortunately, the Haitian Government has lacked political will. The Haitian Government has not taken action to resolve a number of extrajudicial and political killings in Haiti and there have been numerous human rights violations. The Government has also been extremely slow in privatization of its government owned enterprises, and it has not been accountable in maintaining government institutions through their constitutional and electoral processes. 
   Let me be clear when I say that the objective in our conditioning of assistance to Haiti was to urge the Haitian Government to take the necessary steps to overcome these concerns and challenges. Our conditioning of assistance has produced some positive change in Haiti. With the upcoming Parliamentarian elections in Haiti, however, it is important that we provide flexibility in our assistance to assure that these very important and needed elections are transparent. 
   Today, Mr. President, I am suggesting that the U.S. Government focus its appropriation policy on accountability. While the Congress is not losing the opportunity to review and perform oversight of our appropriated funds to Haiti, this new language sets congressional priorities. Specifically, the top areas include: First, aggressive action to support the institution of the Haitian National Police; second, steps to ensure that any elections undertaken in Haiti with U.S. assistance are full, free, fair and transparent; third, a program designed to develop the indigenous human rights monitoring capacity; fourth, steps to facilitate the continued privatization of state-owned enterprises; and fifth, a sustained agriculture development program. 
   We have also incorporated reporting requirement language so that the Administration can give U.S. a detailed assessment of each benchmark. This new language was drafted by several Senators including myself and Senators HELMS, DODD, and GRAHAM.  
   The ideological and financial crossway that is before Haiti is of national and global importance. The U.S. national interest is served by a stable, democratic, prospering Haiti that cooperates with U.S. counter-drug efforts. We can help ensure this end through our technical and physical support of immediate Parliamentary elections and through lifting the limitations on financial assistance. Our Nation's eyes have been so focused across the Atlantic that I fear we may have forgotten our responsibility in our own hemisphere. But, now is the time to act in order that democracy may take her proper place in this hemisphere.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we have just concluded the foreign operations bill, and I congratulate Senator MCCONNELL, Senator LEAHY, and others who have worked so very diligently on this difficult and tough bill. Contained in the bill we just passed, among other things, was a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. This sense-of-the-Senate resolution was proposed and offered by myself and by my colleague from Georgia, Senator COVERDELL. It deals with the situation in Colombia and the United States relationship to that troubled country. 
   I want to talk this evening about that sense-of-the-Senate resolution and about the situation in Colombia. 
   For the past several months, United States foreign policy has really been dominated by the crisis in Kosovo. Certainly we have to continue to work with the NATO alliance and Russia to help bring the Albanian Kosovars back to their homeland and to bring a stable peace to the region. But tonight I want to discuss another compelling and very serious foreign policy crisis that is taking place right in our own hemisphere. 
   Like Kosovo, it is a crisis that has displaced hundreds of thousands of people, more than 800,000 since 1995, and instead of a small province being ethnically cleansed by its own government, this democratic country is fighting multiple conflicts--a war against two threatening and competing guerrilla groups, a war against paramilitary organizations, and, finally, a war against drug lords who traffic in deadly cocaine and in heroin. 
   I am, of course, talking about the four wars that are taking place tonight in Colombia. While a 19-nation NATO alliance struggles to prevent the disintegration of a small province, the disintegration of an entire nation is going practically unnoticed by our own Government in Washington. The decade-long struggle in the Balkans is being duplicated in Colombia, which is fracturing into politically and socially unstable ministates and is posing a significant threat to our own hemisphere. Colombia is shaping up to be the Balkan problem of the Americas. 
   More than 35,000 Colombians have been killed in the last decade. More than 308,000 Colombians were internally displaced in 1998 alone. In Kosovo, 230,000 people were displaced during this same period of time before NATO took action. And like the Albanian Kosovars, Colombians are fleeing their country today in large numbers. More than 2,000 crossed into Venezuela in a matter of a few days recently. A Miami Herald article recently reported a growing number of Colombians leaving for south Florida. 
   Our Nation has a clear national interest in the future of the stability of our neighbor to the south, Colombia. In 1998, legitimate two-way trade between the United States and Colombia was more than $11 billion, making the United States Colombia's No. 1 trading partner, and Colombia is our fifth-largest trading partner in the region. 
   In spite of this mutually beneficial partnership, the United States simply has not devoted the level of time nor resources nor attention needed to assist this important democratic partner as it struggles with drug problems, with violent criminal and paramilitary organizations, and guerrilla insurgents. 
   In fact, in December 1998, a White House official told the Washington Post that Colombia, quote, ``poses a greater immediate threat to us than Bosnia did, yet it receives almost no attention.'' 
   Attention is needed--now more than ever. According to the State Department, Colombia is the third most dangerous country in the world in terms of political violence, and accounts for 34 percent of all terrorist acts committed worldwide. The Colombian National Police reported that Colombian rebels carried out 1,726 terrorist strikes in 1998--that's 12 percent more than in the previous year. 
   Kidnapping is also a significant problem. Approximately 2,609 people were kidnapped in 1998, and there have been 513 reported kidnappings in the first three months of this year. Guerrillas are responsible for a high percentage of these incidents. 
   The wholesale acts of violence that have infected this country are symptoms of four wars that are going on in Colombia. Any single one of them would pose a significant threat to any country. Together, these wars represent a threat beyond the borders of Colombia. Let me describe them in detail. 
   For more than three decades, the guerrilla groups known as Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces--the FARC--and the National Liberation Army--the ELN--have waged the longest-running anti-government insurgency in Latin America. 
   Determining the size of these guerrilla organizations is an inexact science. Most open sources range their combat strength from about 10,000 to 20,000 full-time guerrillas. However, irregular militias, part-time guerrillas, and political sympathizers also play a role that is hard to quantify. 
   The insurgents have their own armament capabilities and are manufacturing high-quality improvised mortars. Organized crime links also have long been suspected. The Chief of the Colombian National Police, General Jose Serrano, has reported in the past that the FARC has completed guns-and-cash-for-drugs deals with organized crime groups in Russia, Ukraine, Chechnya and Uzbekistan. A Colombian army study recently stated that the two main leftist guerrilla groups had raised at least $5.3 billion from 1991 to 1998 from the drug trade, abductions, and extortions to fund their long-running uprising against the state. 
   According to the State Department's 1998 Human Rights Report, the FARC and ELN, along with other, smaller groups, initiated armed action in nearly 700 of the country's 1073 municipalities, and control or influence 60 percent of rural Colombia. Although these  groups have had no history of major urban operations, a number of recent guerrilla-sponsored hostage takings recently have taken place. 
   Colombian President Pastrana is trying to make peace at all costs with FARC rebels, who have little incentive to agree to any peace deal. Throughout these negotiations, the FARC has continued to assault and kill dozens of Colombian military and police. 
   The current prospects for peace are dismal. If Pastrana were to accept the demands of the FARC and ELN for political and territorial autonomy, he would have to splinter his country into Balkan-type factions. The effects of this would be increased paramilitary violence and increased regional instability. 
   In fact, one of the FARC conditions already agreed to by President Pastrana was the creation of a temporary, demilitarized zone the size of Switzerland. All Colombian Armed Forces and Police were ordered out of the area. Despite this enormous concession on the part of the Colombian government, the FARC has not agreed to any cease-fire and has made no concessions. In fact, they made it clear to the Colombian Government that they should expect continued guerrilla operations and attacks. 
   ``Farclandia'' is the name some local residents have given to this odd state-within-a-state. The area has over 90,000 residents. Despite its creation as a temporary demilitarized zone, the FARC appear to be cementing control and taking steps to ensure that expulsion from the zone would be extremely difficult, particularly if the talks break down. 
   According to the Catholic Bishop residing in the DMZ area, residents are required to feed the FARC, which is simply a form of taxation. The FARC has attempted to expel a Catholic priest for being an ``enemy of peace.'' The priest argued the FARC is violating human rights, usurping the locally elected government, interfering with economic activity, imposing labor duty, and recruiting minors, teenagers, and married men. The bottom line is that FARC fighters are using their armed stranglehold on the zone to abuse Colombian citizens. 
   In April, FARC leaders asked Pastrana to extend rebel control over another zone in southern Colombia--approximately 7,600 square miles--that is allegedly the home to some of the most concentrated cocaine-production facilities in the world. The Pastrana Government agreed to place the request on the negotiating table. While the additional zone was not approved, Pastrana agreed to allow FARC rebels to have continued control over the DMZ. This is the second time, since November 1998, that President Pastrana has extended the DMZ to the FARC during the talks. 
   This decision provoked outrage within Colombian military ranks, particularly since military officers had been humiliated by the creation of the original zone. That earlier decision required the withdrawal of hundreds of police and army troops. By the end of May, Colombian Defense Minister Ricardo Lloreda announced his resignation. 
   Following his announcement, dozens of military officers resigned in solidarity with Lloreda. Of the total of 30 Colombian army generals, reports indicate that between 10 and 17 resigned in solidarity with Lloreda. With the exception of Lloreda's resignation, Pastrana did not accept any other resignations. However, as a result of this mass protest, Pastrana agreed that the FARC zone would be demilitarized for only six more months and that a retired general would be included in the negotiating team for the talks. 
   In another important development, the Colombian Congress too is beginning to express its doubt in the peace process. Earlier this month, the Congress rejected a bill that would have given Pastrana sweeping powers to grant political concessions--including an amnesty for convicted guerrillas. 
   Lloreda's resignation was truly unfortunate. I met Defense Minister Lloreda in Colombia last November. Lloreda, described by 
   his peers as someone who could help bring about needed reform in the military, was just beginning to gain some ground. He had already begun rebuilding the army, a difficult task given its record of human rights violations. In fact, he had forced the resignation of Colombian military officers suspected of human rights violations and had others arrested. 
   Lloreda had also lifted the morale among the military, having suffered significant defeats by the FARC forces. According to the Economist magazine, the defense budget has doubled this year to $1.2 billion. In March, the army even managed a successful offensive, which left 50 guerrillas dead. 
   The resignation, however, threw Pastrana's 10-month-old government into crisis and placed the future of the nation's fragile process in doubt. It has also left open important questions about the future of the Colombian military. 
   Mr. President, Colombian military operational mobility is widely acknowledged to be a shortcoming. Colombia is a very large country. One of their departments is as large as the nation of El Salvador. In fighting an insurgency, the state has to defend many critical areas, but also has to have the capability to mass and economize forces to attack guerrilla formations when they present themselves. Colombia's army has barely 40 helicopters for a territory the size of Texas and Mexico combined. El Salvador, 1/50th the size of Colombia, had 80--twice as many--during its civil war. 
   Although the Army has 122,000 soldiers, most of them are 1-year conscripts. Approximately 35-40% are high school graduates not assigned to combat duties by law. At any time, about 30% are undergoing basic training. A large portion of the remaining force (50-60%) is assigned to static defense of key economic or isolated municipal outposts. That leaves approximately 20,000 soldiers remaining for offensive combat operations. These are the veterans or volunteers that constitute--apart from the officer corps-- the only true repository of combat experience in their army. Now consider that the active guerrilla combatants alone number between 11,000 and 20,000. You do the math. It doesn't look good. It is conceivably a one to one ``fighting'' ratio. How can a military, with limited resources, fight two guerrilla movements which have virtually unlimited resources from drug trafficking, kidnappings, extortion and arms trafficking? 
   The Colombian Army has already suffered a string of military defeats. In 1998, the Colombian Armed Forces suffered three major blows in March, August, and November. In fact, the FARC executed one of its major blows against the military just as President Pastrana was meeting with FARC leaders on the peace talks. 
   The FARC currently holds over 300 military and police POW's. And according to Jane's Intelligence Review, Colombian guerrillas killed 445 soldiers during 1998. If you include Colombian National Police, the figure would rise to 600. The CNP too has experienced significant losses. Over 4,000 policemen have been killed in Colombia in the past decade. 
   As if the FARC weren't enough of a problem, let me complicate this situation further by discussing the war with the ELN. The ELN has been envious of the attention the FARC has been getting, 
   particularly at the negotiating table. As a result, the ELN has resorted to a series of recent hostage takings. Shortly after Pastrana and the FARC announced in April that formal negotiations would take place in the summer, the ELN hijacked a Colombian commercial airliner in mid-April, kidnapping 41 passengers and crew. 
   Then, shortly after Defense Minister Lloreda's resignation, about 30 ELN guerrillas invaded a church service in an upper-class neighborhood in Cali and abducted over 140 worshipers. In response, the Government deployed more than 3,000 soldiers and policemen to locate them. While some hostages have been released from the hijacking and church incidents, approximately 50 are still being held including two Americans. 
   I have outlined, Mr. President, the two main guerrilla groups which are a significant threat to Colombia. Unfortunately, however, I have not yet spoken of another ongoing war which poses an additional and substantial threat--the Colombian paramilitaries. In fact, the Colombian paramilitaries are also seeking a role at the negotiations table. 
   The Colombian paramilitaries are an umbrella organization of about 5,000 armed combatants. Their mission has  been to counter the grip of leftist guerrillas. Carlos Castano, the powerful leader of the paramilitary umbrella organization United Self-Defense Groups of Colombia, has been quoted defending the strategy of killing villagers who are guerrilla supporters and sympathizers. 
   The paramilitaries are funded by wealthy landowners and, in some cases, cocaine traffickers. They exercised increasing influence during 1998, extending their presence into areas previously under guerrilla control. 
   The presence of paramilitary groups have driven a wedge in the peace talks because the FARC leadership refuses to negotiate until the government effectively clamps down on the right wing gunmen. The problem is that the government also has a problem in trying to control the paramilitaries. 
   In an attempt to become a player at the negotiating table, Castano's organization kidnapped a Colombian Senator last month. In fact, Castano said shortly after the abduction that his aim was to gain political recognition and a place at the negotiating table for his movement. The Senator was freed after being held for two weeks. The Senator later commented that Pastrana should eventually include Colombia's paramilitary forces in negotiations to end the 35 year civil war. Since the leftist rebels vehemently oppose their participation in the peace talks, prospects for the peace negotiations are complicated even further. 
   Before I talk about the increasing drug threat from Colombia, let me spend a few minutes on the general violence in Colombia. 
   According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Colombia led the world in kidnappings in 1998, and may be the most likely place in the world to be abducted. The country averages five people a day snatched by guerrillas or other criminals. Guerrillas from the FAR, ELN and the smaller Popular Liberation Army accounted for approximately 1,600 kidnappings of the 2,609 reported in 1998. 
   A report issued by the Colombian Government's anti-kidnapping office in May calculated that at least 4,925 people have been 
   abducted since January 1996, with the largest total coming in 1998. The problem with this statistic is that many families and businesses prefer to deal directly with kidnappers and not report abductions to the police. Hence, this figure is only the official one. It is understandably difficult to count how many kidnappings truly occur in Colombia. 
   Imagine, if you will, living in a country where you can't send your child on school field trip; where you can't decide to go out of Bogota for the weekend to visit relatives in a nearby city. In fact, the situation is so grave that you think twice about going to the grocery store or even to a movie. 
   A recent New York Times article described the lives of Colombians and the precautions they must take on a daily basis. The article stated that Colombians are refusing to fly on any airplane that is not a jet. They cite the example of ELN hijacking of a prop plane. The Colombian quoted in the article commented that it is almost impossible for guerrillas to take over a big jet and make it land at some little airstrip out in the jungle. 
   In the week before Easter, a traditional vacation time throughout Latin America, travel within Colombia was down 40% over last year, according to a Colombian civic group. With increasing regularity, the five million residents of Bogota are canceling trips to towns that are barely a two hour drive away, while traffic on highways to the Caribbean coast has also dropped significantly. 
   Kidnapping is such a significant threat that a Colombian government study made public estimates that the country's three main guerrilla groups have obtained more than $1.2 billion in kidnapping ransoms in recent years. 
   Mr. President, the situation in Colombia has gotten so bad that the State Department recently issued a warning, advising Americans to not travel to Colombia. You see, Colombians are not the only targets in their country. There have been U.S. casualties as well. 
   In late 1997, the State Department added the FARC to its list of terrorist organizations. 
   In January 1999, guerrillas announced that all U.S. military and law enforcement personnel in Colombia would be considered legitimate targets to be killed or captured. In late February, the FARC viciously murdered three U.S. human rights workers. This horrific execution met with no reaction from the Clinton Administration. A resolution was recently introduced in the House, calling on the Colombian government to pursue the killers, members of the FARC and extradite them to the U.S. 
   Colombian terrorists continue to target Americans, kidnapping over a dozen U.S. citizens in 1999 so far--this is double the total amount for 1998. The 1998 State Department Terrorism Report also suggests that terrorists also continued to bomb U.S. commercial interests, such as oil pipelines and small businesses. 
   There has also been much concern that the civil war in Colombia could spill over into neighboring countries--including Venezuela, where President Chavez is alleged to have had contacts in the past with the ELN. A spill-over into Venezuela would be disastrous for the United States, given that Venezuela is our number one--let me repeat this--number one supplier of foreign oil. The situation is so grave that Venezuela has sent 30,000 troops to the border with Colombia. 
   There has been a recent exodus of Colombians into Venezuela. In a two day period recently, over 2,000 Colombians began their exodus to Venezuela after death squads massacred about 80 people near a border town. Many of the Colombians were said to be coca farmers. 
   At first, Venezuelan President Chavez said Venezuela was prepared to offer the Colombians temporary refuge until they could return safely to their homes. However, only one day after the recent cross-over began, Venezuela had already started repatriating Colombians back to Colombia. And within a few days, all Colombians have been repatriated. 
   Colombian-Venezuelan relations have been tense. For example, while Chavez has agreed to play a role in the negotiations, in mid-May Chavez announced he was seeking a direct meeting with FARC commander Manuel Marulanda. In fact, two months earlier, he angered President Pastrana by suggesting that the FARC's armed struggle was legitimate and declaring that Venezuela remained ``neutral'' in the conflict. 
   There has also been some concern of a spillover of the conflict into Ecuador, another nation bordering Colombia. In fact, Ecuadoran government officials indicate that rebel forces have crossed over to their nation, primarily for rest and relaxation. With the end of its border dispute with Peru, Ecuador is in the process of relocating 10,000 troops to the Colombian border. In addition, Ecuadoran intelligence has reportedly periodically taken down some guerrilla supply routes. 
   Colombia also borders Panama, which should be of significant concern to our nation. It is a known fact that Colombian rebels have been infiltrating the Darien province in Panama for quite some time in search of supplies. 
   In late May, hundreds of Panamanians fled their homes near the border with Colombia, fearing a violent clash between Colombian guerrillas and paramilitary bounty hunters. Witnesses claim that there were about 500 FARC rebels in Panama. 
   Mr. President, this rebel crossing is occurring just 250 miles southeast of the Panama Canal. And let me remind you that U.S. military forces are departing from Panama. 
   The United States should be extremely concerned. The departure of U.S. forces could encourage Colombian rebel groups to become more active in the deep, inaccessible rainforests of Panama's Darien region. And while Panama has increased a border police force to 1,500, they are no match to the Colombian rebels. Panama has no military, and our total U.S. troop presence is scheduled to depart Panama by the end of this year. We just closed down operations out of Howard Air Force Base in May, and we are about to turn over the Panama Canal and remaining military facilities at the end of this century. 
   Mr. President, while the United States is complying with the Panama Canal Treaties, in terms of giving Panama the Canal at the end of this year, the treaties state that the United  States has the continued responsibility to protect and defend the Panama Canal. And the duration of this treaty is indefinite. In the event that something happens to the Panama Canal, just a few hundred miles from Colombia, how would the United States respond then? 
   I have spent most of my time talking about the worsening civil strife in Colombia. But I cannot end this speech without talking about the final war in Colombia. It's the war Americans probably have heard the most about--the war prompted by the fact that Colombia is the world's most important cocaine producer and a leading producer of heroin. 
   According to our State Department, over 75% of the world's cocaine HCL is processed in Colombia. 1998 marked the third consecutive year of significant increase in Colombia coca crop size; recent statistics indicate that about 75% of the heroin seized in the northeast United States is of Colombian origin. Colombian heroin is so pure--roughly 80% to 90%--that in 1998, the number of heroin overdose cases in the United States went up significantly. In fact, in 1998, the number of heroin overdoses in Orlando surpassed the number of homicides. 
   Drug trafficking is profitable, and provides the FARC with the largest share of its income. Sixty percent of FARC fronts are involved in the drug trade. About 30% of ELN war fronts are likewise engaged in drug trafficking. This includes extortion/taxation of coca fields and yields, precursor chemicals and security of labs and clandestine air strips. The insurgents control the southern rural terrain of Colombia where the largest density of cocaine fields and production is found. 
   Mr. President, I have outlined a deteriorating situation in Colombia. I have spoken to you about Colombia's ongoing and escalating four wars. These are significant issues that have a direct impact on our hemisphere and our Nation. The future of Colombia as a unified country, and the stability of an entire hemisphere is at risk. The sad reality is that our country is not yet making an adequate response to this crucial foreign policy challenge. We are simply not paying attention, nor are we adequately responding. 
   U.S. leadership in this Colombian crisis is needed. This is no time to keep our backs turned. Continued inattention will only contribute to continued instability. Like Kosovo, the U.S. should mobilize the international community to play a role in resolving the Colombian conflict. 
   Certainly we should pledge our support to the democratically elected Government. We should also be ready to provide other types of support such as training, equipment, and professional development to help Colombia overcome these threats to democracy and freedom. 
   Finally, we must continue to work to disrupt and dismantle the drug trafficking organizations and to reduce their financial control of antidemocratic elements in Colombia. 
   We are doing some things in Colombia. I had the opportunity to see those myself when I traveled there a few months ago. But we simply have to do more. We have to become more engaged. 
   I remember President Ronald Reagan's profound wisdom in negotiating from a position of strength in his efforts to strengthen our military. This strategic vision led to the crumbling ultimately of our adversaries. Unfortunately, this dynamic has not yet taken hold in Colombia. 
   Because of the Colombian Government's weakness, no incentive appears to exist for its multiple adversaries to respect and to adhere to any agreements. Their only incentive is to extract further concessions from the Government and to further attempt to weaken the Colombian Government. 
   Before I close, let me quote a passage from a report in Time magazine. I quote:  
   The six members of the presidential peace commission did not know where they were headed when their Bell 212 helicopter took off from Bogota at dawn. The pilot had been given the top-secret coordinates minutes before takeoff, but not even he was sure of the destination. Suddenly, the flag of the FARC, the oldest, largest and bloodiest of the country's numerous anti-government guerrilla groups, was sighted in the jungle below. This time, however, the flag signified the making of history, not war. In a small clearing in the Alto de la Mesa rain forest, FARC guerrillas and the government's representatives met to sign a momentous eleven-point cease-fire agreement. 
   While this article seems to depict the present situation in Colombia in terms of peace talks, the fact is that it does not. The main reason is that there has not yet been a cease-fire agreement as a result of this latest round of talks. 
   Let me repeat that. There has not yet, to this day, been a cease-fire agreement as a result of this latest round of talks. 
   The article I quoted appeared in Time magazine's issue dated April 16, 1984. 
   In April 1984, the then-Colombian President triumphantly announced on national television his Government's formal acceptance of that pact with the FARC guerrillas. He thought that he had negotiated an end to the guerrilla conflict with the FARC leadership. 
   Let me note that there have been numerous other accounts by other Colombian Presidents throughout the years to negotiate a resolution to the guerrilla wars in Colombia. Each time the peace talks have failed, and each time the guerrilla groups have been further strengthened. 
   While the current President of Colombia is negotiating with the very same FARC leader, a few things have changed over the last 15 years. Back in 1984, the Time article reported that the FARC consisted of 2,050 guerrillas backed by an additional 5,000 people in ``civil defense cadres'' spread mainly throughout the countryside. But today the FARC has about 10,000 to 15,000 active combatants--quite a change. 
   In 1994, the ELN had roughly 200 men and the Popular Liberation Army had about 275. The ELN today has between 5,000 and 7,000 troops. 
   It is simply amazing to me what a difference 15 years has made in Colombia, a difference, unfortunately and tragically, for the worse. We have gone from seeing Colombia's combat-ready guerrilla number in the 2,000 range--2,000 is what it was--to a situation today where there is likely a guerrilla combatant rebel for every Colombian military combatant person available, a 1-to-1 ratio. 
   My question to this Congress and to this administration is, How can we expect Colombia to overcome these multiple wars? The rebel personnel resources have significantly increased since the mid-1980s and are one of the main reasons behind this rise in the alliance between the guerrillas and the drug traffickers. 
   This strategic alliance, in which each party benefits from the other's involvement, makes it very clear that it is extremely difficult to separate the drug war from guerrilla and paramilitary wars. That is why the United States must play a role to help Colombia overcome all of its wars--not just the drug dealers. We must understand that our drug consumption only further exacerbates the Colombian crisis. And we must be involved in helping them resolve the four wars I have described. 
   In the 1980s, the United States made a major investment in the struggle for democracy and human rights in Latin America. We pretty much succeeded. We basically went from a situation a generation or two ago where half the countries were democratic to a situation today where every country save one is democratic, or is at least moving rapidly towards democracy. We have succeeded. 
   But if we want Latin America to continue to evolve into a stable and peaceful trading partner and a friend of the United States, we will have to make a more serious commitment to Colombia. No one wants to see Colombia devolve into a criminal narcostate. But unless we act soon in partnership with the democratically elected Government of Colombia, unless we act soon to reverse this democratic death spiral, it is only a matter of time before Colombia ceases to exist as a sovereign nation with democratic principles. 
   President Ronald Reagan showed profound wisdom in leading this hemisphere toward democracy and toward free markets. We must do all we can to make sure that this positive tide is not rolled back for our neighbors to the south. 
   I thank the Chair for his indulgence.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this bill has great significance to my home State of Ohio. Ohio produces and processes more steel than any other State in the Nation. Ohio steel companies--115 of them at last count--produced and processed steel valued at $5.3 billion in 1996. Ohio is second only to Pennsylvania in the number of employed steelworkers. At last count we had 35,400 steelworkers in the State of Ohio. 
   We are here today because foreign steel producers have illegally dumped millions and millions of tons of steel into the United States. In 1998, 41 million tons were dumped. That represents on average an 83-percent increase. 
   Ohio steel production from the first quarter of 1999 was down significantly. Ohio steel shipments during the first quarter of 1999 were also down nearly 16 percent from the same period in the previous year. 
   Members of the Senate, all of this is no accident. All of this was the result of illegal dumping of steel into the United States. 
   Our steel industry, despite being a highly efficient and globally competitive industry, is in trouble. I have heard from and I have talked directly to steelworkers and their families about this issue. It is estimated that 10,000 steelworkers have already lost their jobs. The Independent Steelworkers predict job losses of as many as 165,000 if steel dumping is not stopped. 
   It is time for the Senate to take action. All eyes are on us. 
   The question is, Will we respond to this crisis? 
   Adopting this bill tells our steel industry, our steelworkers, and the world that we support our industry, we support trade laws, and we will simply not tolerate dumping or subsidization. 
   The bill is tough. It directs the President to impose quotas, tariff surcharges, or negotiate enforceable voluntary export restraint agreements in order to ensure that the volume of imported steel products during any month does not exceed the average volume imported from the 3-month period preceding July 1997. 
   I am a free trader. I believe free trade, though, does not exist without fair trade. Free trade does not mean free to dump, free to subsidize, free to distort the market. However, that is exactly what is happening today. 
   A strong and healthy domestic steel industry is vital to our Nation and vital to our national defense. Let us resolve today to debate and then pass H.R. 975. The House has already done so. I believe it is in our interest and the interest of the country to do so. 
   I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator SANTORUM, for his leadership, as well as Senator ROCKEFELLER and the other Members who have worked so hard on this bill.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico. I will try to be brief. 
   I rise today to support the bill my colleague from New Mexico, Senator DOMENICI, and Senator BYRD, have brought to the floor. This bill has great significance in my home State, but I think it also has great significance for this country. 
   I rise today to express my strong support for this bill. Our steel industry today is in trouble. Why? I think as we engage in this debate we need to start at the beginning of the story. 
   To my colleagues who have risen on the floor this afternoon opposed to this bill, I would point out one thing that I think their comments have failed to reflect; that is, we are here today because of illegal activity. We are here today because of illegal dumping of  steel into the United States. That is an uncontroverted fact. That is what the truth is. That is what the finding has been. Steel has been dumped repeatedly, month after month after month, and it has been dumped illegally. That has been the findings. That is why we are here today. 
   Last year, U.S. steel producers had to withstand an onslaught of illegally imported steel. In 1998, 41 million tons were dumped. That represented an 83-percent increase of imported steel for the previous 8 years. In other words, if you took the previous 8 years and looked at the amount of imported steel on the average for those 8 years, what you would find is that when we got to 1998, and compared 1998 to the previous 8 years, it went up 83 percent. That is a phenomenal increase in the importation of steel. It is no accident. This was clearly dumped. 
   Many steel companies are, obviously, reporting financial losses, most attributable to the high levels of illegal steel imports. It has been estimated that 10,000 Americans--10,000 workers, 10,000 families--have already lost their jobs because of this illegal dumping. The Independent Steelworkers predict job losses as high as 165,000, if steel dumping is not stopped. 
   I introduced a bill. Some of my colleagues in the Senate have introduced other bills--Senator BYRD, Senator ROCKEFELLER, Senator SPECTER, Senator SANTORUM. It is legislation that we will be taking up shortly. I believe it is time for action. All eyes of this country and the world are today on the Senate. The question is, Will we respond to this crisis? 
   Certainly a good first step would be the adoption of the bill before us, Senator BYRD's steel emergency loan guarantee program. This loan program is designed to help troubled steel producers that have been hurt by the record levels of illegally imported steel. For many companies, this program is the only hope they have to keep their mills alive and their workers working. 
   Specifically, the program would provide qualified U.S. producers with access to a 2-year $1 billion revolving guarantee loan fund. In order to qualify, steel producers would be required to give substantive assurances that they would repay the loans. 
   A strong and healthy steel industry is absolutely vital to our country. It is vital to our national defense. This bill has a lot to do with national defense. It is essential, if we are going to have the national defense we want--if we are going to have the security we want in this country--that we always have a vibrant, energetic, tough steel industry. This bill speaks to that issue. 
   This bill also has to do with an even bigger issue; that is, whether or not in this country we are going to continue to make things and manufacture things and be producers. 
   There are some people who have been quoted--some people even in this administration who have been quoted--saying things which would give you the impression they really do not care if we produce things anymore, that being a service-driven economy and an information-driven economy is enough. While service is good and information is good, and they produce jobs, we still have to produce. We still must be a manufacturing country, if we are going to retain our greatness. 
   Fortunately, today, our steel industry is a highly efficient and globally competitive industry. It wasn't too many years ago that the critics of the steel industry, sometimes very correctly, would criticize the industry. They would say: You are fat, you are flabby, you are not tough enough, you are not lean enough, you have to invest, you have to modernize, and you have to do things differently. 
   As a result of that, and as a result of some very tough times in the 1970s and 1980s, the steel industry in this country did that. They did it. They invested billions of dollars. They modernized. They made the tough and the hard decisions that they had to make to be efficient. Yes, the workers made sacrifices as well. The unions made sacrifices as well. Everyone knew they had to pull together. It was not always easy, but the result is that we have a steel industry today in this country that is better than any steel industry in the world. 
   If you strip away the subsidies by other countries that are subsidizing their steel industries, you will find that we can compete with any company in the world--with any country in the world--in the production of steel. 
   Yet, despite all of this great effort, despite this modernization, our steel producers face a number of unfair trade practices and market distortions that are having devastating impacts in Ohio and other steel-producing States. That is not just MIKE DEWINE speaking. Those are the findings that have been made. 
   I have heard about this crisis firsthand from industry and labor leaders. In fact, I have looked into the eyes of steelworkers, whether it be in Steubenville, OH, or in Cleveland, OH, or in other places. All they want is a fair chance to compete and a fair chance to recover from the illegal dumping that has already taken place. 
   One of the things I point out is that one of the reasons for this bill, despite our other bills that we hope to pass in this session, is they do not in any way stop the illegal dumping that has already taken place, and has taken place for well over a year. So this bill is needed to rectify some of the problems that have been created by this illegal dumping. 
   Many steel companies are in serious trouble and are in desperate need of immediate assistance. The short-term loans that would be provided under this program will provide that very assistance without burdening taxpayers, because if steel plants close, if workers lose their jobs, taxpayers would be forced to pay for unemployment compensation, food stamps, Medicaid, housing assistance, Medicare, and on and on and on, all of which will certainly exceed the total cost of this program. 
   Again, the steel companies are required to repay the loan within 6 years, provide collateral, and pay a fee to cover the cost of administering the program. 
   I am a free trader. I believe free trade, though, does not exist without fair trade. Free trade does not mean free to subsidize. Free trade does not mean free to dump. Free trade does not mean free to distort the market. That is exactly what has been taking place month after month after month. 
   Our trade laws are designed to enforce these basic principles. However, the current steel crisis underscores flaws and weaknesses in our current laws. I am, therefore, pleased the majority leader has indicated he has reserved time within the next several weeks to deal with many of these other problems, and to look at some of the remedies, proposed remedies that I and some of my colleagues have proposed. 
   The House has already acted. I believe it is time for us to act. Today we have an opportunity to help an industry that throughout its long and illustrious history has been there for our country, has been there for our national defense. 
   We should pass this bill and commit to adopting meaningful legislation to deal with the steel import crisis. 
   I thank my colleague, Senator DOMENICI, for his leadership on this bill, Senator BYRD for his tireless efforts, Senator ROCKEFELLER and the other members of the Senate steel caucus who have worked on this issue. 
   This bill will help. This bill will save jobs. This is about our national security. 
   I emphasize how important I think it is as our colleagues consider the merits of this bill that they remind themselves of one basic fact: We are in the Senate today to consider this bill because illegal dumping took place and it took place month after month after month after month. 
   The steel companies, the steelworkers did nothing wrong; they did everything right. They modernized, they made the sacrifices. They want the opportunity to compete. Given that free opportunity, they will not only compete, they will win. 
   I thank my colleague for yielding time to me.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, the Fernald site in Cincinnati, OH, has done a truly remarkable job of working with the Department of Energy in carrying out critically important environmental clean-up and restoration missions. More specifically, the clean-up at Fernald has garnered broad-based stakeholder support and is moving along ahead of schedule. More important, the Fernald site has pioneered the accelerated 10 year clean-up plan, which will save taxpayers several billion dollars. All of this has been accomplished while managing the site at or below the Department's appropriated budget for the project. I see the distinguished Chairman of the Energy and Water Subcommittee on the floor and wanted to be sure he is aware of the efforts underway at Fernald.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the bill before us today, and specifically the ``Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program'' provision authored by our distinguished colleague Senator ROBERT BYRD. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to Senator BYRD for his hard work, determination, and persistence in bringing this important measure to the floor. 
   Our steel industry is in trouble. Since last year, U.S. steel producers have had to withstand an onslaught of illegally imported steel. In 1998, 41 million tons were dumped--an 83 percent increase over the amounts imported for the previous eight years. Many steel companies are reporting financial losses, most attributed to the high levels of illegal steel imports. It is estimated that approximately 10,000 steelworkers have lost their jobs. The Independent Steel Workers predict job losses of as many as 165,000 if steel dumping is not stopped. I, along with many of my Senate colleagues like Senators BYRD, ROCKEFELLER, and SPECTER, have introduced legislation to help our steel industry. It is time for action. All eyes are on the U.S. Senate to respond to the crisis. 
   A good first step would be the adoption of Senator BYRD's Steel Emergency Loan Guarantee Program. This loan program is designed to help troubled steel producers who have been hurt by the record levels of illegally imported steel. For many companies, this program is the only hope they have to keep their mills alive. Specifically, the program would provide qualified U.S. producers with access to a two-year, $1 billion revolving guaranteed loan fund. In order to qualify, steel producers would be required to give substantive assurances that they will repay the loans. A board chaired by the Secretary of Commerce would oversee the program. The program will cost $140 million, all of which has been fully offset with other reductions in spending. 
   A strong and healthy domestic steel industry is vital to our nation. Fortunately, our steel industry is a highly efficient and globally competitive industry. Yet, despite this modernization, our steel producers face a number of unfair trade practices and market distortions that are having a devastating impact in Ohio and other steel-producing states. I have heard firsthand from industry and labor leaders about the crisis. Many steel companies are in serious trouble and are in desperate need of immediate assistance. The short term loans that would be provided under Senator BYRD's program will provide that assistance without burdening taxpayers. If steel plants close, taxpayers will be forced to pay for unemployment compensation, food stamps, Medicaid, housing assistance, child care, community adjustment assistance, and worker retraining--all of which will exceed the total cost of this program. Again, the steel companies are required to repay the loan within six years, provide collateral, and pay a fee to cover the costs of administering the program. The Commerce Department has identified 10 companies that may qualify for the program. 
   I am a free trader. And I believe free trade does not exist without fair trade. Free trade does not mean free to subsidize, free to dump, free to distort the market. Our trade laws are designed to enforce those principles. However, the current steel crisis underscores flaws and weaknesses in those laws. I am pleased that the Majority Leader has scheduled time next week to deal with the issue of steel dumping. The House has already acted. It is time for us to act. 
   Today, we have an opportunity to help an industry that throughout its long and illustrious history has been there for our country. Let us pass this bill and commit to adopting meaningful legislation to deal with the steel import crisis. 
   I thank Senator BYRD for his tireless efforts in standing up for Steel. I cannot think of a more dedicated champion on this issue. I know my colleagues in the Steel Caucus as well as the hard-working steel producers and steel workers across America are very proud of his efforts.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few remarks about a serious threat to my home state of Ohio and to thank the honorable chairman and ranking member of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee and Senator LEVIN for helping me to address this threat. 
   Mr. President, sometimes big problems come in small packages. Today, Lake Erie--and just about every other body of water in the Midwest--are threatened by a very small and unwanted intruder, the zebra mussel. This small but prodigious mussel is just one of the many invasive species that have entered this country and which threaten to degrade the natural resource capital of virtually every U.S. waterway and coastal area. Free of their natural predators and other limiting environmental factors, alien species like the zebra mussel often cause grave economic harm as they foul or otherwise damage public infrastructure. 
   In the late 1980s, the zebra mussel was discovered in Lake St. Clair, having arrived from eastern Europe through the discharge of ballast water from European freighters. The species spread rapidly to 20 states and as far as the mouth of the Mississippi River. U.S. expenditures to control zebra mussels and clean water intake pipes, water filtration equipment, and electric generating plants and other damages are estimated at $3.1 billion over 10 years. 
   In Ohio, the zebra mussel poses a particular threat to public water intake systems. Ohio has more than 1,900 facilities that collectively withdraw over 10 billion gallons of water per day. The costs to remove or prevent infestations of zebra mussels in large surface water intakes can exceed $350,000 annually. 
   The mussels threaten native wildlife in Ohio by competing for the food of native fish by filtering algae and other plankton from the water. They have also been shown to accumulate contaminants which can be passed up the food chain. During the summer of 1995, they were implicated as the probable cause of a large bloom of toxic algae in the Western Basin of Lake Erie. The frequency of these large and destructive blooms has increased as the mussels spread through the lake. Since 1988, zebra mussels in Ohio have spread to 10 inland lakes and 6 streams. 
   Mr. President, along with my esteemed colleague and co-chairman of the Great Lakes Task Force, Senator LEVIN, I urged funding for the effective implementation of a program to help mitigate the impact of zebra mussels in United States waters. Today, I want to thank Senator DOMENICI and Senator REID for continuing to fund important research to control the damage caused by the zebra mussel. 
   While other agencies work to limit the introduction of new species into U.S. waters, the Army Corps of Engineers has the responsibility under the National Invasive Species Act (NISA) of developing better means for managing those pest species already established. NISA expands existing authority for the Army Corps to research, develop and demonstrate environmentally sound techniques for removing zebra mussels and other aquatic  nuisance species from public facilities, such as municipal water works. 
   As the range of the zebra mussel expands, control is being undertaken by more and more raw water users. Without the benefit of this research, the control methods chosen may be less efficient, and less environmentally sound than necessary. With the help of Senators DOMENICI and REID and LEVIN I am glad to say that this bill will provide $1.5 million to continue this important work. 
   The National Invasive Species Act of 1996, which I cosponsored and which reauthorized and expanded the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act, received strong bipartisan and multi-regional support in both chambers, and the full support of the administration, the maritime industry and environmental community. Funding for NISA programs is essential if the benefits of the law are to be realized. 
   Mr. President, again I want to thank Senator DOMENICI and Senator REID for their attention to this matter.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this amendment, which I offer along with Senator VOINOVICH, would fix an unintended oversight in veterans' educational benefits. This amendment is similar to legislation I introduced along with my distinguished Ohio colleague in the House of Representatives, Congressman BOB NEY, who is the leader of this effort. 
   Currently, the law allows qualified veterans to receive their monthly educational assistance benefits when they are enrolled at educational institutions during periods between terms, if the period does not exceed 4 weeks. This allowance was established to enable enrolled veterans to continue to receive their benefits during the December/January holidays. 
   The problem with the current time period is that it only covers veterans enrolled at educational institutions that operate on the semester system. Obviously, many educational institutions, including several in Ohio, work on the quarter system, which can have a vacation period of eight weeks between the first and second quarters during the winter holiday season. As a result, many veterans unfairly lose their benefits during this period because of the institution's course structure. 
   Mr. President, it is my understanding that some educational institutions that have a sizable veteran enrollment frequently create a one credit hour course on military history or a similar topic specifically geared towards veterans in order for them to remain enrolled and eligible for their educational benefits. It is my understanding that, the cost of extending the current eligibility period to eight weeks would have a minimal, if not negligible, cost. 
   The Department of Veterans' Administration has recognized the need to correct this oversight and assisted in the drafting of this legislation and has given it their full support. 
   I have no doubt that this very simple fix will be well-received by our veterans and the educational institutions that operate under the quarter system. I already know that Wright State University, Bowling Green State University, Ohio University and Methodist Theological School in Ohio have expressed their support for this legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this common sense fix and allow all veterans to receive the uninterrupted educational assistance they earned.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, last year the Congress provided an $800 million down payment to restore viability to our counter drug eradication and interdiction strategy in the region. This funding was the first installment of the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act, which was passed as part of last year's omnibus appropriations bill. Our goal is to reduce significantly the flow of cocaine and heroine flowing into the United States. This would be done by driving up drug trafficking costs, reducing drug availability, and ultimately keeping these horrendous drugs out of the reach of our children. 
   We made great progress last year to secure the funds for an enhanced counter-drug strategy. Today, I am seeking additional resources for this important national security interest. 
   Today, Senator COVERDELL and I are offering an amendment that would authorize more funds for Defense counter-drug programs. This amendment is taken from a provision contained in S. 5, the Drug Free Century Act, which I introduced with seven of my Senate colleagues. 
   Mr. President, since the late 1980's, the Department of Defense has been called upon to support counter narcotics activities in transit areas in the Caribbean, and these dedicated members of our armed services have done an extraordinary job. Unfortunately, we in the Congress, and those all over the United States, are keenly aware that the Armed Forces of the United States are being stretched too thin. With the ongoing hostilities against Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and the enormous air campaign against Slobodan Milosevic in Kosovo, material and manpower dedicated to the interdiction of drugs entering our country have been diverted to these ``higher priority'' duties, leaving the drug transit areas vulnerable and unguarded. 
   In addition, this year we have seen the closure of Howard Air Force Base in Panama, which causes the United States to lose a premier airfield for conducting counter-drug aerial detection and monitoring missions. Without this aerial surveillance of the coca fields and production sites in Colombia, and the major transit areas for bringing cocaine into the United States, timely and actionable intelligence cannot be relayed to the Colombian government forces in time for seizure and eradication actions. 
   Fortunately, the current bill already would authorize $42.8 million for the creation of forward operating locations to replace the capability lost with the closure of Howard Air Force Base. These sites will be critical to the continuing ability of the U.S. Armed Forces and law enforcement agencies to effectively detect and interdict illegal drug traffic. However, it will take time to get these sites identified and operational. 
   Mr. President, that is why this amendment is timely and important. Our amendment would shore up deficient funding in the critical areas of intelligence gathering, monitoring, and tracking of suspect drug activity heading toward the United States. 
   This amendment would provide authorization for an additional $59.2 million in counter-drug intelligence gathering and interdiction operations. 
   We need to have a reliable and efficient means of monitoring, identifying, and tracking suspect traffickers before assigning interdiction aircraft or marine craft to intercept. The key to our success is accurate intelligence. Without accurate intelligence, we are wasting time and valuable resources. 
   This amendment would enable such intelligence gathering technologies as a CONUS-based, over-the-horizon radar that could be used in detecting and tracking both air and maritime targets in the eastern Pacific and Mexico. This technology would greatly enhance the ability of law enforcement agencies of both the United States and Mexico to interdict and disrupt shipments of narcotics destined for the United States. 
   This amendment also would authorize funds for enhanced intelligence capabilities such as signals intelligence, collections, and translation that would significantly improve the overall effectiveness of the counter drug effort. 
   Mr. President, it is time to renew drug interdiction efforts, provide the necessary equipment to our drug-enforcement agencies, and make the issue a national priority once again. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and help turn the tide of the drug crisis in our country.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation that will increase our nation's investment in pediatric research. 
   Despite the medical breakthroughs that have been made by health researchers in recent years, it is obvious that health care research is under funded. I have joined with many senators to express support for doubling the budget at HIH for biomedical research. I will continue to fight for this increased funding so that NIH can expand its research efforts. An increase in funding is especially needed to improve our knowledge about illnesses and conditions affecting children. 
   Children under age 12 represent 30 percent of the population--and yet, NIH devotes less than 12 percent of its budget to their needs. There has been a growing consensus that children's health deserves more attention from the research community. 
   The bill I am introducing today would help us begin to remedy the need for stronger investment in children's health research. I thank Senator BOND for joining with me in sponsoring this important legislation. This bill would authorize the Pediatric Research Initiative within the Office of the Director of National Institutes of Health (NIH) to encourage, coordinate, support, develop, and recognize pediatric research. 
   The bill would authorize $50 million annually for the next three years. During the last three years, I worked with my colleagues to fund this important Initiative and as a result, it received $5 million in fiscal year (FY) 1997, $38.5 million in FY 1998, and at least $38.5 million in FY 1999. I look forward to working with my colleagues again to continue on the path toward reaching the necessary funding level. 
   Under this bill, the Initiative would provide $45 million over the next three years to encourage new initiatives and promising areas of pediatric research. It would also promote greater coordination in children's health research. Today, there are some 20 Institutes and Centers and Offices within NIH that do something in the way of pediatrics. In my view, we need to bring some level of coordination and focus to these efforts. 
   In developing this Initiative, I have made sure that it would give the Director of NIH as much discretion as possible. The money has to be spent on outside research, so that the dollars flow out to the private sector--but it can go toward basic research or clinical research. 
   This bill does not create any new Office, Center, or Institute. I would simply authorize funding for more research and better research coordination for children--not infrastructure. 
   In addition to authorizing the Initiative, the legislation would authorize new funding, through the National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), for pediatric research training grants to provide a major increase in support for training additional pediatric research scientists. We need to strengthen our national investment in pediatric research training. 
   The supply of pediatrician scientists needs to increase if we are to fulfill the new NIH policies that require the participation of children in NIH-funded clinical trials and the new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) policies that require the testing of drugs for use by children before they can receive FDA approval. 
   The number of pediatricians training to become subspecialists--the potential supply of future pediatrician scientists--is declining. The number of medical school pediatric departments that receive significant NIH research training grant support is limited--fewer than half receive any NIH research training grants. Many pediatricians in training have little or no exposure to research. 
   Together, the Pediatric Research Initiative and the pediatric research training grants are crucial investments in our country's future--and will produce great returns. If we focus on improving health care for our children, we'll set the stage for them becoming healthy adults. 
   This important legislation has the support of the pediatric research community in children's hopsitals and university pediatric departments all over the country, including the National Association of Children's Hospitals, Association of Medical School Pediatric Department Chairmen, American Pediatric Society, and Society for Pediatric Research, as well as the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International, March of Dimes, Association of Ohio Children's Hospitals, and many more

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, all of us agree we need to do a better job of keeping track of guns that might fall into vulnerable young hands. That is why I support the amendment offered by the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, which contains several measures that I have developed that would help to achieve these goals. 
   Mr. President, the most effective method to assure that gun sellers and dealers are selling their products to law-abiding 
   citizens is the background check. In 1993, Congress passed the Brady bill, which is designed, in part at least, to move us toward the National Instant Check System for gun sales. Due to this initiative, we have expanded and made more accessible the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, also known as NICS. Now, could this system be improved? The answer is, yes, it could be. For example, today, handgun checks are ``name only'' checks, which frequently come back inconclusive because a potential purchaser may have a similar name as a convicted offender, or that potential purchaser could be using a false name, or an alias. When this happens, a manual check has to be performed. 
   Mr. President, one way we can improve the instant check system is through technology that is now available, which can check a purchaser's fingerprint against a single print database. The time has come for this idea; it is an idea worth exploring. Our amendment would direct the Attorney General of the United States to study the feasibility of creating a single print instant check system and database to enable a voluntary, rapid, and accurate search of potential gun purchasers. Currently, there are 40 million fingerprint cards in the master criminal fingerprint file from which convicted offender prints could be placed online for an instant search. With a single print database, firearm dealers could facilitate the completion of a gun sale. A single print system could reduce the potential for felons to obtain firearms through the use of false identification. It would close a major loophole. 
   Mr. President, we can also improve the system by ensuring that our records are accurate and up to date. I have often said that type of information is absolutely critical and vital to good police work. Information can and does save lives. Mr. President, our background check system is only as good as the information that is in it. The unfortunate fact is that serious record backlogs exist in many States. Many of our State databases are simply incomplete, and many are very inaccurate. We have improved it over the years but we have a long way to go. Since the instant check system became effective last November, over 900 individuals who have been convicted for class one felonies--murder, rape, serious assaults--were able to buy guns because the appropriate records were simply not available. 
   Mr. President, States desperately need financial help to eliminate this dangerous records gap and to plug this loophole. Our amendment would provide $25 million to central repository directors to facilitate logging in, dispositions, including assistance to courts to automate their current records systems. 
   Everybody will benefit from this more-thorough criminal history--law enforcement and the public, in general. We can improve our background check system by expanding it to include records of those who have not broken the law, but who are still prohibited under current law from possessing firearms. These people include involuntary commitments to mental health institutions and those subject to domestic restraining orders. Those are the people who, many times, are also falling through the cracks of our current system. 
   This amendment would direct the Attorney General of the United States to develop procedures by which nonconviction and other data can be available for the instant check system, stopping people who are currently prohibited from possessing a firearm, but who the current system is not watching. This amendment would fully fund the National Instant Check System to pay for the operation costs of background checks. The FBI would be provided operations costs of performing instant checks, and also States serving as point of contact States will be reimbursed by up to $7 per background check. 
   Finally, we need to better provide information not just on the lawbreakers, but on the guns they use to commit crimes. To accomplish this goal requires a strong investment in the national integrated ballistic identification network. This system combines the ballistic and forensic capabilities of the FBI and ATF to create one enhanced ballistic system for State and local law enforcement agencies. This amendment before us would provide funds, much-needed funds, to expedite this process. 
   Mr. President, a greater investment of innovative thinking and resources is urgently needed to improve the National Instant Check System. This amendment would provide that investment. It would make the system more responsive, more accurate and, yes, more thorough. Most important, it would make our efforts to keep guns out of hands of children and criminals more effective. Mr. President, this amendment will save lives. 
   I yield the floor.

   It was a great privilege for me to serve with Oliver Ocasek in the State Senate, and I can tell you from personal experience he was an extremely valuable legislator throughout his 28 years in the Senate. 
   He realized then, and realizes now, that one of the most important things we can do--as legislators, parents and citizens--is reach out to young people. That was a keystone of his Senate career, and indeed has been a central part of his whole life. 
   In addition to his work in the Senate, he has also been a distinguished professional educator, serving as teacher, principal, superintendent, college professor, and member of the State Board of Education. 
   Mr. President, I join all Ohioans in paying tribute to Oliver Ocasek on the occasion of this richly deserved award.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in strong support of the amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas, Mr. BROWNBACK, and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH. I want to discuss one of the provisions of this amendment. This provision is similar to legislation Senator BROWNBACK and I introduced in the last Congress, and that bill was S. 539, the Television Improvement Act. We introduced that bill in the last Congress, along with the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. LIEBERMAN, and my friend and ranking member of the Antitrust Subcommittee, Senator KOHL. 
   This amendment will create an exemption from antitrust liability to allow the entertainment industry to develop and agree upon voluntary guidelines designed to alleviate the negative impact of numerous forms of entertainment--broadcast programming, movies, music lyrics, video games, and Internet content. 
   In other words, this amendment will remove a legal obstacle that arguably could prevent decisionmakers in the entertainment industry from getting together to make responsible decisions about the products they produce. Specifically, this amendment will allow them to agree voluntarily to limit the amount of violence, sexual content, criminal behavior, and profanity that exists in their various mediums. It will also, equally important, give them an opportunity, if they chose to take it, to promote and provide entertainment that is educational, informational, or otherwise beneficial to children. In other words, it will allow them to come together to agree to limit the bad things, but it will also allow them to come together to try to improve the quality of product they are putting out and specifically when they are dealing with products for children. 
   I emphasize that the purpose of this amendment is to allow the entertainment industry to voluntarily come together to address the American people's growing concern about the negative influence of television, movies, and other forms of entertainment on our children. Rather than mandate Government restrictions on programming content, this amendment is designed to give industry leaders the opportunity to improve on their own the quality of television programs, music, movies, videos, and Internet content. 
   In the past, the television industry has had such a code of conduct. In fact, for most of its history, the television industry utilized the code in order to help it make programming decisions. But in recent years, many of the entertainment industry have expressed concern that such a code might expose them to legal liability and they, therefore, have abandoned it. 
   As chairman of the Antitrust Subcommittee, I studied this matter in the last Congress, and I came to the conclusion that a code of conduct would be appropriate and legal under current antitrust laws. However, just to be sure and to remove any doubt, I am supporting this amendment exemption. 
   This amendment exemption will remove any lingering doubts those in the industry might have. Quite candidly, quite bluntly, this will say to the entertainment industry: You have no excuse--no excuse--not to come together and try to improve programming for children. You have no excuse not to come together and try to limit the bad things that are on, to limit the things that the American people find so objectionable. 
   Acting on this legislation gives the Senate the opportunity to urge entertainment providers to work together and to cooperate to ensure our children's best interests are, in fact, 
   protected. 
   This amendment encourages voluntary, responsible behavior. It will not give any Government agency or entity any new authority to regulate or control the content of television programs or the content of movies, music, video games, or the Internet. It merely gives those in the entertainment industry the freedom to regulate themselves and to do the right thing. 
   I recognize that entertainment, like almost everything else in our economy, is driven by competitive pressures. Often in the heat of competition, those in the industry may believe they are offering a product that is of lower quality than they might like, but they may feel they have to do that. This amendment offers a way out of the situation. 
   The amendment basically calls for a cease-fire among cable stations and the networks, the movie studios, the record companies, the video game industry, and the web sites. This is a cease-fire so they can try to work out an industry-by-industry response to the legitimate demands of millions of American parents for more family-oriented entertainment. 
   When I look at this amendment, I look at it as I think many parents do. I am worried about what is happening in this country. There was a time, not too many years ago, when parents did not have to worry about what was on television during the so-called family hour. That is not true anymore. There really is not a family hour anymore. We have all seen the steady decline in the quality of television over the last few years. 
   In addition, we all know music lyrics have become more graphic and more violent and, in recent years, video games and the Internet are providing more violent and sexually explicit material than we ever imagined possible. 
   It is beyond dispute that these television shows, movies, records, and video games are having an effect. For a young person, for a teenager, popular music is really the sound track of their lives. Movies and television provide a lot of the context for their relationships. Video games and the Internet provide a great deal of their entertainment. 
   As these movies become more violent, more sexually explicit, as these songs show more and more disrespect for life and for the rights of others, some of our children are starting to believe this behavior is acceptable and normal. Some are starting to believe this make-believe world of music and movies is the real world with sometimes very tragic consequences. 
   I understand it is not the role or the responsibility of the entertainment industry to raise our kids or to protect them from the violence of the real world. That is our job as parents and as citizens. It is time that the entertainment industry did its fair share. That is what this amendment is calling for. 
   I hope the entertainment industry takes the opportunity that is offered by this amendment and makes a commitment to provide the kind of entertainment of which we can all be proud. 
   Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for offering this very important and, I think, timely amendment. I yield the floor.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this evening in strong support of the bill before us. This juvenile justice legislation is a product of bipartisan work and bipartisan compromise. I believe it is a very valuable and long overdue measure that will tackle a major national problem. 
   Last week I spoke on the Senate floor on the need to find ways to reach out to young people and to hopefully save young lives. I said at that time that youth violence presents us with very difficult issues, really, for a public official to talk about because people, once you start talking about this issue, may think you, as the person who is talking, believe that you have ``the'' answer. So let me say again, right up front, I do not claim to have the answer. Evil is a mystery that exists deep in the human heart. 
   But if we do not have all the answers for the problems we see--what we saw happening in Littleton, for example--that should not stop us from trying to do something. I believe the juvenile justice bill we have before us, as well as many of the amendments which will be offered, will in fact save lives. The fact, the brutal fact of human existence, that we cannot come up with the answer does not excuse us from our moral responsibilities--our moral responsibilities, as legislators, as parents, as citizens. In fact, it increases our responsibilities. If we do not have ``the'' answer, we have to work harder to find answers, things we can do to make a difference, child by child by child. 
   This juvenile justice bill provides the Senate the opportunity to find some of these answers. Some of the things in the bill before us are certainly not glamorous, but I believe they will all be helpful. I believe they will save lives. In 
   essence, the bill before us is designed to make sure our juvenile justice system and those who make decisions in that system have the tools they need to meet the challenge of a juvenile population that, tragically, is becoming more violent. I will focus briefly on some of the provisions I have been most involved in in putting together this bill and highlight how I believe they will make a real difference, addressing real problems facing juvenile justice systems across this country. 
   First, Senator SESSIONS and I have worked long and hard, along with the chairman, to provide $75 million to help States upgrade their juvenile felony record systems. I believe this is an especially important provision. As a former county prosecuting attorney, I can tell you, the decisions made by judges in our juvenile courts on juvenile offenders are only as good as the information on which they are based. The same is certainly true for judges in our adult criminal system. The problem is, the information that is available is not as complete, many times, as it should be. In fact, many times the information about the offender, about what the offender has done in the past, is simply nonexistent. 
   What am I talking about? We have had a tradition in this country that juvenile courts would all operate behind closed doors and the records of those courts would never be available. The reason, the rationale, was we wanted to protect young people; that young people could change and they should have a second chance, sometimes a third chance. All that makes sense and there is nothing wrong, even today, 1999, with that basic philosophy. 
   That philosophy, though, does not work when we are dealing with a 17-year-old, who is still a juvenile, who has committed a violent crime--let's say a rape--or a 16-year-old who has committed an aggravated robbery. It makes no sense to say that information about that individual will always be hidden. 
   Let me give Members of the Senate, my colleagues, a specific example. Let's say a 15-year-old in Xenia, OH, commits a serious offense. Let's say it is a violent offense. That 15-year-old is dealt with by the court and later moves, at the age of 17, to Adams County, Ohio. That juvenile then commits another offense. Under our current system, there is really no effective central depository of that information. There is one, but there is very little information in it. So the arresting officials in Adams County might not know that individual, several years before, had committed a serious offense in Greene County. 
   Let's take another example. Let's say the juvenile is 16 and commits an offense in Cincinnati, OH; several years later moves to Indiana and, as an adult, commits another violent offense in Indiana. The Indiana authorities may not necessarily know that juvenile--the person who was a juvenile, who is now 18, an adult--committed a violent crime several years before across the State line in bordering Ohio. 
   What this bill does is commit $75 million to local law enforcement agencies, to States to help them develop their criminal record system for juveniles. 
   We are not, by this provision, saying what a State should do. What we are saying, though, is that the State, by putting that information into a central computer system, will enable another State where that juvenile shows up, 2, 3, 5, or 10 years later, to be on notice as to what type individual this is, or at least they will know what crime, what serious crime, what violent crime this juvenile has committed. It simply makes sense. 
   It has been my experience that when we read about what I call horror stories in the newspapers, where we see someone who has been picked up by the police, and he is let out on bond, or she is let out on bond, and that person commits another offense or has been charged with an offense and has been convicted and gets a light sentence, and they commit another offense, most of those horror stories come from the fact that the police or the judge or the probation officer or the parole officer did not have the available information, didn't know what they were dealing with, didn't know what the criminal record was of that individual. Our bill goes a long way to address this problem. It gives local law enforcement the tools, it gives the judge the tools, so he or she can make a rational decision about bond or a rational decision about sentencing. 
   We need to make these records more accessible so law enforcement can keep closer track of kids who have been convicted of violent crimes. The tracking  provision I wrote, along with Chairman HATCH and Senator SESSIONS, will help do this. 
   If a State uses Federal funds to upgrade their juvenile records under this bill, all records of juvenile felonies will have to be accessible from the National Criminal Information Center. When it comes to making key decisions about juvenile offenders, judges, probation officers, police officers, need to make judgments based on the best possible information, and that is what this bill will give them. 
   One of my key priorities as a Senator, and as someone who started his career as a county prosecuting attorney in Greene County, Ohio, one of my priorities is to make sure the Federal Government does more to help law enforcement. That is where the action is. Mr. President, 95 to 96 percent of all Federal prosecutions is done at the local level by counties and States. They are the ones who do it--the police, the sheriffs' deputies, the local prosecutors. Anything we can do to help them will make a difference. 
   Helping set up a good system of records, good information on juvenile felons is one of the most important things we can possibly do to help them do their jobs more effectively, and this bill does it. 
   Let me turn to a second provision. We need to provide incentives to local governments to coordinate the services they offer to the kids who are most at risk, kids who may have already gotten into a little trouble, but who we believe can still be saved. This is prevention, and it is very, very important. 
   Here is the problem. Many times, juveniles who find themselves in juvenile court have multiple problems. Some of these problems may not come to the attention of the juvenile court judge, or if they do come to his or her attention, many times that judge does not have the resources, does not have the ability to treat that young person. 
   For example, a child may have both a psychiatric disorder and a substance abuse problem. A child may have been sexually abused, a child may have been physically abused, or any combination of four or five things. Many times, juvenile courts do not have the resources to detect or appropriately address these types of multiple problems. As a result, for too long, many children have been falling between the cracks of the court system. Many times these children are identified as the ``juvenile court's child.'' Many times we refer to them as a ``children services' child,'' or a local protection services agency child or maybe the child is under the auspices of the mental health system and sometimes the substance abuse system. 
   What we aim to do under this provision is allow the local community to come together with the juvenile judge and coordinate all of these services so that we can help these children. It is cost-effective and it is the right thing to do. 
   My proposal, which is included in this bill, will promote all across this country an approach that has been very successful in Hamilton County, Ohio, near Cincinnati; an approach that gives our most problematic children the multiple services they need under the overall coordination of the court system. These kids should not fall victim to bureaucratic turf conflicts. All of these children are our children. 
   The purpose of this initiative is to leverage limited Federal, State and local agencies and community-based adolescent services to help fill the large unmet need for adolescent mental health and substance abuse treatment in the juvenile justice system. 
   One of the things I learned when I started as a county prosecutor was that there is, in fact, many times a turf battle. There is a turf battle that occurs between the criminal justice system, in this case the juvenile justice system, the judge, his probation officer or her probation officer, and the social services agency--children's service is what we call it in Ohio--that protects children, or maybe the local mental health 
   agency or maybe the local substance abuse agency. We have made progress in breaking down these walls, but what our provision in this bill does is accelerates that process and that progress. 
   If you talk to the judges, if you talk to the substance abuse counselors in most counties, they tell you there is a finite number of children who they have already identified who are the most problematic, who have the most problems, who need the most resources, who, if we do not deal with them now at the age of 13 or 14 or 15, are going to grow up and graduate into our adult system and are going to pose monumental problems for society for the rest of their lives. 
   Bringing the resources of the community together in a coordinated fashion to address the needs of these children is the right thing to do. We will not save all of them. We know that. But many of them can, in fact, be saved, and they can be saved if we care and if we approach this issue from an intelligent point of view. 
   The juvenile judge is key because the juvenile judge has the ability to get the attention of that young person. The juvenile judge has the ability to use the carrot and the stick in the sense of simply saying to the young person: Fine, if you don't want to go into drug treatment, I am going to commit you to the department of youth services for an indefinite period of time; I am going to put you, in essence, in prison. Or that judge can say to that young person: If you don't stay free of drugs for the next 2 years, and we are going to monitor you every 2 weeks and we are going to know whether you are on drugs or not on drugs --that type of approach where the juvenile court works with the substance abuse people, the experts in the field, or works with the mental health people. That coordination is absolutely essential when we deal with our most problematic children. 
   The idea for this, as I indicated, came from Hamilton County, Ohio. They have tried this. It works. They have identified 200, 300, 400 of the most problematic children. They meet regularly to talk about these kids and what they can do to get services to them. There is only so much money available. There are only so many services that can be provided. What we do with this provision is encourage local communities to get together and use that money in the most efficient and most effective way. It is the right thing to do. It is the most cost-effective thing to do. 
   In bringing this piece of legislation to the floor--and I congratulate Senator HATCH, Senator LEAHY, Senator SESSIONS, Senator BIDEN, and all those who have worked on this bill--we are making an important contribution to meeting a major challenge facing our communities. 
   I have mentioned just two key initiatives that will help our communities meet these challenges. Over the last several days, I have been working with several of my colleagues, including the Senator from Colorado, Mr. ALLARD; the Senator from Alabama, Mr. SESSIONS; the Senator from Idaho, Mr. CRAIG, and others on other initiatives that will help these children. These initiatives will be offered in the form of amendments over the next few days. These amendments will help, I believe, those people who are closest to troubled children--parents and teachers in particular. 
   I look forward to working on this bill and passing it and seeing it signed into law. Will it solve all the problems with juveniles? Of course not. Will it prevent all the Littletons 
   that may occur or other tragedies that we have seen? No, there is no guarantee of that, but we do know, just to take one statistic, that the Littletons are replicated every single day in this country, quietly, silently, but tragically, because on average 13 children die every day just because of contact with guns. Most of them are homicides, a few of them are suicides, and some are accidents. That does not include all the other children who die violent deaths. 
   Our objective in this bill should be to try to reduce the number of children who die and who die needlessly. I believe we can do it. I believe we can make a difference. 
   We should not judge this bill, nor every amendment that is offered, by the test of would it have prevented one of the tragedies that is foremost in our minds. Some of the amendments would have, I think, but we will never know. 
   A more rational approach and more logical approach is simply this: Will the amendment that is being debated or the provision we are talking about or the bill itself save lives? I think the evidence is abundantly clear that this bill, as is written right now, will save lives. It will make a difference. I think we can improve it in the course of the next several days.  
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about probably the most important thing we do as a society--educating our children. This week is National Teacher Appreciation Week, and it gives us a good opportunity to recognize the crucial role teachers play in our children's lives. After parents and families, America's teachers play the most important role in helping our children realize their potential. No teacher can replace the role of loving and attentive families, but once our children leave their homes and enter America's schools, it is the responsibility of federal, state and local elected officials to provide every possible opportunity for a child to realize his or her full potential. 
   The way to do that, Mr. President, is to see that every child learns from a qualified educator in a safe school environment. 
   As the Senate begins to consider education legislation, we should take time to listen to the lessons learned by America's best classroom teachers--teachers like Ohio's Teacher of the Year, Ellen Binkley Hill. Ohio is fortunate to have teachers like Ellen, and the thirty two other finalists for Ohio's Teacher of the Year. 
   Ellen teaches second grade at New Vienna Elementary School in Clinton County, Ohio. Over the past year I have had the pleasure of talking with Ellen on two occasions--and I want to take a moment to read how Ellen describes the role of a teacher, because I think her words capture what it means to be a great educator. 
   I quote: ``Teachers must be living examples of the transforming power of education. We must lead extraordinary lives filled with insight, rich with experiences, and tempered with compassion. It is every teacher's responsibility to serve each child, empowering all children to reach their potential, and then to reach higher.'' End of quote. 
   Mr. President, as a father, I want my children to learn from teachers like Ellen Binkley Hill. As a Senator, I would like to see all of the nation's children being taught 
   by teachers like Ellen Binkley Hill. 
   A qualified, highly trained teacher is the most important education resource in any classroom. Across America today, in classrooms around the country, tomorrow's business leaders, tomorrow's inventors, tomorrow's doctors, tomorrow's Presidents, and even tomorrow's teachers are building their foundation of learning, their foundation of experiences that will shape their lives forever. They are being led through this process by our neighbors, friends and family members who make up America's 2.7 million-member teaching force. 
   Mr. President, in the spirit of this important week, I am introducing four bills that I believe will help our teachers realize their highest potential in our classrooms, and ensure that our children have the best possible educator at the front of their classroom. 
   The first bill is the Teacher Mentoring Act. America's teaching force is aging, a situation that offers both benefits and challenges. The average school teacher is 43 years old, an increase of 3 years over the average age in 1987. Nearly a quarter of our teachers are over 50 years old and nearing retirement. 
   These seasoned veterans are the backbone of many schools across the country. Many are also leaders in their schools and their communities, taking on the added challenges of educating the most difficult students and mentoring their younger peers. As these experienced educators near the end of their careers, we must ensure that the practical hands-on knowledge they have accumulated is passed on to those teachers following in their footsteps. 
   Mr. President, new teachers entering today's challenging classrooms need the close support of these veteran teachers, particularly during their first few years on the job. Unfortunately, more than 25 percent of new teachers leave the job in their first three years and I believe mentoring programs are one way we can help stabilize the ranks of our new teachers. 
   The Teacher Mentoring Act, which is the companion to a bill written by my friend Congressman RICK LAZIO [LA (as LAdder)-ZEE-OH] of New York, would establish a $10 million competitive grant program. This 
   program would encourage states to implement training programs, or support existing programs that utilize our experienced classroom veterans as mentors to new teachers. Ohio is currently operating a mentoring program that assigns each new teacher to a mentor. These mentors provide classroom teaching advice, as well as an experienced shoulder to lean on when they first enter their new school. 
   The second bill I am introducing today is the Alternative Certification and Licensure of Teachers Act. This bill would improve the supply of well-qualified elementary and secondary school teachers by encouraging and assisting States to develop and implement programs for alternative routes to teacher certification or licensure requirements. After all, the most important and effective education resource in any classroom is a highly trained and dedicated teacher. 
   There are many talented professionals who have demonstrated a high level of subject area competence outside the education profession who wish to pursue careers in eduction, but have not fulfilled the requirements to be certified or licensed as teachers. Alternative certification can provide an opportunity for these people to become teachers--so they can share their knowledge and experiences with children in the classroom. 
   The legislation would provide $15 million to the States for either new or pre-existing alternative certification programs or fund pre-existing programs. Last year's Higher Education Act endorsed alternative certification as a means to enlarge the pool of quality teachers--but I believe we need to go further. We need to continue to open alternative certification routes to attract teachers who would otherwise not enter the classroom. 
   The third bill I am introducing today is the Teacher Quality Act. 
   We have learned from various studies that the most effective teacher training programs have some things in common. Both teachers and teaching program evaluators agree that the most effective teacher training programs are intensive; are of reasonable length, and provide an avenue for teachers to update their skills. The Teacher Quality Act would help improve the quality of teachers in elementary and secondary schools--and 
   provide teachers the opportunity to learn new technologies and increase subject matter knowledge.  My bill would establish a competitive grant program that will give school districts the opportunity to establish teacher training facilities. 
   The idea for this legislation is based on the model established by the Mayerson Academy in Cincinnati, Ohio. This Academy was established in 1992 as a partnership between the Cincinnati business community and its schools. Their mission: to provide the highest quality training and professional development opportunities to the men and women responsible for educating the children of Cincinnati. 
   The program is a great success. This school year the Academy will provide 160,000 hours of training to teachers. The Mayerson Academy is separate from the school system in order to ensure independent evaluation of its results and a consistent base of support. This status also allows it to benefit from the perspectives and experience of the business leadership. 
   Finally, I am introducing the Eisenhower National Clearinghouse Improvement Act. 
   Collecting and effective disseminating the best teacher training practices is an important responsibility of the federal government. The Eisenhower National Clearinghouse, or ENC, is the nation's repository of K-12 instructional materials specifically related to math and science education. This information is made available in a user-friendly format for educators. The Ohio State University is currently home to the Clearinghouse. 
   Since 1992, ENC has distributed over 3.67 million CD-ROM's and print publications. Products are distributed to schools, colleges of education, and various education groups and professional organizations across the country. ENC has received over 40 million hits on their web site since its creation in 1994. In addition, ENC has established over 100 Access Centers across the country to expand direct service to more teachers. 
   While this program has proven its value, there is room for improvement. The bill I am introducing today would expand ENC's jurisdiction to include Language Arts and Social Studies, with a particular emphasis in all curriculum areas on effective use of 
   educational technology. 
   With thousands of teacher training programs available, it is becoming increasingly difficult for educators to find out which programs have been proven effective and which have not. My legislation would require ENC to gather a sampling of the best evaluations on the materials they collect and provide easy access to these evaluations. ENC will not be permitted to conduct evaluations directly, but would be required to create a ranking for materials and programs based on the reviews they collect and make these reviews easily accessible to teachers who utilize their service. 
   All four of these bills would help improve the quality of education. I look forward to working with my colleagues on these and other important education measures. Before I close, let me mention one other key issue affecting the education of our kids--school violence. 
   The threat of violence--and the reality of drug abuse--in our schools are all too real. We must ensure that America's families and teachers are empowered with the information, training and resources to help our children overcome these obstacles. This year, as a member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee I will be working with the other members of the committee to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which includes the Safe and Drug Free Schools Act. The recent tragic events in Colorado are a painful reminder that we need to do everything we can to improve our violence and drug abuse prevention efforts and these reauthorizations, as well as the upcoming debate on the juvenile justice reform legislation, provide us with excellent opportunities for this Congress to make a positive difference in the name of school safety.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few comments regarding the tragic shootings in Littleton, CO. 
   Thirteen days after this tragedy occurred, our Nation is still really in shock. The hearts of my own family and all Ohio families, and, of course, all Americans families, go out to the families who have lost loved ones. There is nothing that you can say that  can take the pain away. Anyone who has lost a child understands that. The loss these families have suffered cannot be repaired. But it is important that these families know that there are people--many of us far away from Colorado--whose thoughts and prayers are with them at this terrible time. 
   What went wrong? Could the shootings have been prevented? What should we do to prevent other tragedies such as this from occurring in the future? 
   These are all very difficult questions--difficult issues for a public official to talk about, because when you do, people will think that you are claiming to have ``the answer.'' Let me say flat out that I don't claim to have ``the answer.'' 
   What happened in Littleton will always to some extent remain a mystery, and why it happened. Evil is a mystery that exists deep in the human heart. But that brutal fact of human existence that we can't come up with ``the answer'' does not excuse us from our moral responsibilities--our responsibilities, as legislators, as parents, as citizens. In fact, it increases our responsibilities. If we don't have ``the answer,'' we have to work harder to find answers--things we can do to make a difference child by child by child. Some of the things we have to do may not be glamorous, but they will all be helpful. They will save lives. 
   Fred Hiatt pointed out in a powerful Washington Post article recently that 13 children a day--13 children a day--are killed by guns in this country--in effect, the Littleton massacre every day. Statistically, of these 13 children who die every day, 8 are murdered every day; 4 tragically commit suicide every day, and 1 dies accidentally every day. 
   Mr. President, maybe we can't prevent a massacre such as the one in Colorado, but we can work on initiatives that would save some of the 13 children a day who are dying in gun-related deaths. 
   What I would like to do this afternoon is talk briefly about a few of those initiatives that I believe would save lives. We don't know whose lives they would save, but I have had, I think, enough experience in this area to say that they would save some lives, and, therefore, we should do this. 
   No. 1, I have a bill, which is now included in the juvenile justice bill, that we will be considering in just a few days. 
   This provision provides incentives to local governments to coordinate the services they offer to the kids who are the most at risk in their county, or their area. I am referring, for example, to the children who have been duly diagnosed as having both maybe a psychiatric disorder and a substance abuse problem, or some other combination of problems. For too long, kids have been falling between the cracks of the court system, the children's services system, the mental health system, and the substance abuse system. Other kids are misdiagnosed or don't get access to all the services that they need. My proposal would promote an approach that has been successful in Hamilton 
   County, OH--in the Cincinnati area--an approach that gives our most problematic kids the multiple services they need, under the overall coordination of the juvenile court system. These kids should not fall victim of bureaucratic turf conflicts. All of them are our kids. 
   No. 2, parents, teachers and local service agencies need to explore ways to reach out and provide appropriate services to at-risk youth before they end up--before they end up--in the juvenile court system. That is the essence of prevention--to find ways to keep children from ever coming in contact with a juvenile court. That is why a renewed investment in mental health diagnosis and treatment is so vitally important with our children. 
   We have to as a country, as a people, make a more serious investment in diagnosing and treating these kids with psychological problems. Throughout the whole system, everybody--teachers, probation officers, everyone--will tell you that we do not now have enough resources. 
   I have talked to so many juvenile court judges who look at these kids they have in front of them, and who know they have mental health problems, and yet who do not have the resources, and try to reach these kids and turn them around, to cure them before it becomes too late. We need to get these kids early. 
   A third suggestion of things that are, I think, practical and that we could very easily do is keep closer track of kids who have been convicted of violent crimes. The tracking provisions I, along with Senator SESSIONS, have written into the juvenile crime bill we will be considering in just a matter of a few days will help do that. 
   When a young person commits a crime, and then, let us say, moves to another State and commits another crime, local law enforcement officials and judges many times do not have the available information. They do not know this person has committed a violent crime, and the reason they don't is because we don't have a good nationwide tracking system for juveniles, and we should. We should do it with juveniles who have already demonstrated that they will commit and can commit and may in the future commit a violent crime. 
   When it comes to making key decisions about juvenile offenders, judges and probation officers need to make judgments based on the best possible information. That is what my provision would give them. 
   No. 4, we need to get serious about background checks on gun purchases. Everybody talks about the Brady bill. But very few people realize that the Brady background checks are only as effective as the information that goes into them. That is why I have been fighting for almost 15 years for improved law enforcement information systems. That means good criminal records, knowing who has done what. 
   Last year, I wrote a bill on crime technology. Senators GREGG and HOLLINGS were very helpful in the appropriations process in getting the money for that. 
   The fact is that 60 percent of the States have criminal records that are less than 80 percent complete. In other words, our criminal record system isn't as good as it should be. The Brady bill will only work as well as the underlying criminal justice system it is based on. We need to fix it and do a better job. 
   No. 5, we need to get serious about confronting our cultural problems. I thank our colleagues, Senators MCCAIN and LIEBERMAN. I think they were right when they encouraged the President to call a summit meeting of the leaders in the media community--TV, radio, movies, video games and the recording industry--to talk about the responsibility in shaping the messages that we are sending kids. 
   We can't force them not to air trash that is harmful to people. The first amendment doesn't allow that. I hope the President's summit is a success. The fact is, the President does have, as Theodore Roosevelt said, a bully pulpit, and he needs to use it on this issue. We need to be upfront about the costs of excessive violence in the media--the price paid not just in lives lost in tragic events such as the shooting in Littleton, but also in the day-to-day harm that occurs in the emotional lives of children. 
   Many have blamed the toxic culture for the shootings in Littleton. I personally have no doubt that if the culture were 
   not as coarsened as it is today, those kids very well may not have committed this crime. We will never be able to prove it or know for sure. It is too simplistic to say the culture caused the shootings; but to deny a connection would also be simplistic, and, I believe, naive. The culture that thrives on cruelty and hatred did not create these killers, but it offered them an outlet, a particular way of self-expression, that ended up devastating a whole community. 
   We need to work on creating and promoting the alternative to a culture based on death and violence, a culture based, rather, on the value of life, on the principle that every human life is unique, priceless, and worth defending. 
   We can't ban movie and video games we don't like. But there are things that we can do. I think there are positive steps the media could take to improve our culture and protect children to some extent. 
   The most important measure of all is parental involvement. Parents are the most important teachers for their kids. They should be their most important influence. 
   We need to reach out to our children. We need to listen to them. We need to pay attention. It is not a cliche to say  that tragic events are a cry for help. It is the simple truth. 
   In conclusion, there is no bill we can pass to make any of this happen. For this we have to look inside ourselves. In the meantime, those who are in public life need to do everything they can to make this task just a little bit easier. I mentioned five ideas that I have. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and concerned people at the local community level in Ohio and across our Nation to make sure we are doing all that we can. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am very proud to join my distinguished colleague, Senator SANTORUM, in introducing this legislation to ban one of the most barbaric practices ever tolerated in a civilized society. The Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act is a measure we have already passed twice, only to see it overturned by Presidential vetoes. Enactment of this bill into law is long overdue. 
   A recent tragic event in my own home state of Ohio brings home yet again the need for this ban. 
   On April 6, a young woman went into the Dayton Medical Center in Montgomery County, Ohio, to undergo a partial-birth abortion. This is a procedure that usually takes place behind closed doors, where it can be ignored, its moral status left unquestioned. 
   But this particular procedure was different. In this procedure, on April 6, things did not go as planned. Here's what happened. 
   The Dayton abortionist, Dr. Martin Haskell, started a procedure to dilate her cervix, so the child could eventually be removed and killed. He applied seaweed to start the procedure. He then sent her home--because this procedure usually takes two or three days. In fact, the patient is supposed to return on the second day for a further application of seaweed--and then come back a third time for the actual partial-birth abortion. 
   So the woman went home to Cincinnati, expecting to return to Dayton and complete the procedure in two or three days. But her cervix dilated far too quickly. Shortly after midnight in the first day, after experiencing severe stomach pains, she was admitted to Bethesda North Hospital in Cincinnati. 
   The child was born. After three hours and eight minutes, the child died. 
   The cause of death was listed on the death certificate as ``prematurity secondary to induced abortion.'' 
   True enough, Mr. President. But also on the death certificate is a space for ``Method of death.'' And it says, in the case of this child, quote, ``Method of death: natural.'' 
   Now that, Mr. President, may well be true in the technical sense. But if you look at the events that led up to her death, you'll see that there was really nothing natural about them about them at all. 
   The medical technician who held that little girl for the three hours and eight minutes of her short life named her Baby Hope. Baby Hope did not die of natural causes. She was the victim of a barbaric procedure that is opposed by the vast majority of the American people. A procedure that has twice been banned by act of Congress--only to see the ban repeatedly overturned by a Presidential veto. 
   The death of Baby Hope did not take place behind the closed doors of an abortion clinic. It took place in public--in a hospital dedicated to saving lives, not taking them. It reminds us of the brutal reality and tragedy of what partial birth abortion really is. 
   When we voted to ban partial-birth abortions, we talked about this procedure in graphic detail. The public reaction to this disclosure--the disclosure of what partial-birth abortion really is--was loud and it was decisive. And there is a very good reason for this. The procedure is barbaric. 
   One of the first questions people ask is ``why?''  
   ``Why do they do this procedure? Is it really necessary? Why do we allow this to happen?'' 
   Dr. C. Everett Koop speaks for the consensus of the medical profession when he says this is never a medically necessary procedure. Even Martin Haskell--the abortionist in the Baby Hope case--has admitted that at least eighty percent of the partial-birth abortions he performs are elective. 
   The facts are clear. Partial-birth abortion is not that rare a procedure. What is rare is that we--as a society--saw it happen. It happened by surprise, at a regular hospital, where it wasn't supposed to. 
   Baby Hope was not supposed to die in the arms of a medical technician. But she did. And she cannot easily be ignored. 
   This procedure is not limited to mothers and fetuses who are in danger. It's performed on healthy women--and healthy babies--all the time. 
   The goal of a partial birth abortion is not to protect somebody's health but to kill a child. That is what the doctor wants to do. 
   Dr. Haskell himself has said as much. In an interview with the American Medical News, he said--and I quote--``you could dilate further and deliver the baby alive but that's really not the point. The point is you are attempting to do an abortion. And that's the goal of your work, is to complete an abortion. Not to see how do I manipulate the situation so that I get a live birth instead.'' Unquote. 
   Dr. Haskell admitted it. Why don't we? 
   Again, let's hear Dr. Haskell describe this procedure. Quote: ``I just kept on doing D&Es (dilation and extractions) because that was what I was comfortable with, up until 24 weeks. But they were very tough. Sometimes it was a 45-minute operation. I noticed that some of the later D&Es were very, very easy. So I asked myself why can't they all happen this way. You see the easy ones would have a foot length presentation, you'd reach up and grab the foot of the fetus, pull the fetus down and the head would hang up and then you would collapse the head and take it out. It was easy.'' 
   It was easy, Mr. President. Easy for him. He doesn't say it was easy for the mother, and I suspect he doesn't care. His goal is to perform abortions. Is he the person we're going to trust to decide when abortions are necessary? He's got a production line going--and nothing's going to stop him from meeting his quota. 
   Dr. Haskell continues: ``At first, I would reach around trying to identify a lower extremity blindly with the tip of my instrument. I'd get it right about 30-50 percent of the time. Then I said, `Well gee, if I just put the ultrasound up there I could see it all and I wouldn't have to feel around for it.' I did that and sure enough, I found it 99 percent of the time. Kind of serendipity.'' End of quote. 
   Serendipity, Mr. President. 
   Let me conclude. 
   We need to ask ourselves, what does our toleration of this procedure say about us, as a nation? 
   Where do we draw the line? At what point do we finally stop saying, ``I don't really like this, but it doesn't really matter to me, so I'll put up with it?'' 
   At what point do we say, unless we stop this from happening, we cannot justly call ourselves a civilized nation? 
   Mr. President, when you come right down to it, America's moral anesthetic is wearing off. We know what's going on behind the curtain--and we can't wish that knowledge away. We have to face it--and do what's right. 
   We have to make the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act the law of the land. Twice in the last three years, Congress has passed this legislation with strong, bipartisan support, only to see it fall victim to a Presidential veto. Once again, I am confident Congress will do the right thing and pass this very important bill. 
   But that's not enough, Mr. President. Passing this legislation in Congress is not enough. It will not save any lives. For lives to be saved, the bill must become law. 
   If something happens behind the iron curtain of an abortion clinic it's easier to pretend that it doesn't happen. But the death of Baby Hope has torn that curtain, revealing the truth of this barbaric procedure. Let people not ask about us fifty years from now, ``How can they not have known?'' and ``Why didn't they do anything?'' 
   Because, Mr. President, the fact is: We do know. And we must take action.

    Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the ``Violent Offender DNA Identification Act of 1999,'' with my colleague Senator HERB KOHL. Existing anti-crime technology can allow us to solve many violent crimes that occur in our communities--but in order for it to work, it has to be used. 
   I have been a longtime advocate for use of the Combined DNA Indexing System (CODIS), a national DNA database, to profile convicted offender DNA. In fact, during consideration of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1996, I proposed a provision under which Federal convicted offenders' DNA would be included in CODIS. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice never implemented this law, though currently all 50 states collect DNA from convicted offenders. 
   One of the purposes of this legislation is to expressly require the collection of DNA samples from federally convicted felons, and military personnel convicted of similar offenses. Collection of convicted offender DNA is crucial to solving many of the crimes occurring in our communities. Statistics show that many of these violent felons will repeat their crimes once they are back in society. Since the Federal government does not collect DNA from these felons, however, law enforcement's ability to rapidly identify likely suspects is retarded. Collection of such data is critical. 
   The case of Mrs. Debbie Smith of Virginia underscores the importance of collection of DNA from convicted offenders. Debbie Smith was at her home in the middle of the day when a masked intruder entered her unlocked back door. Her husband, a police lieutenant, was upstairs sleeping. The stranger blindfolded Mrs. Smith and took her to a wooded area behind her house where he robbed and repeatedly raped her. After warning Mrs. Smith not to tell, the assailant let her go. She told her husband, who reported the incident, then took her to the hospital where evidence was collected for DNA analysis. 
   Debbie Smith's rape experience was so terrible that she contemplated taking her own life. She continued to live in constant fear until six-and-a-half years later when a state crime laboratory found a CODIS match with an inmate then serving in jail for abduction and robbery. In fact, the offender was jailed on another offense one month after raping her. There are thousands of other crimes the DNA database can solve. With CODIS we can grant countless victims, like Mrs. Smith, peace of mind and bring their attackers swiftly to justice. 
   We need to do everything we can to make sure law enforcement has access to these tools. A major obstacle facing state and local crime laboratories are the backlogs of convicted offender samples. The Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that there are about 450,000 convicted offender samples in state and local laboratories awaiting analysis. Increasing demand for DNA analysis in active cases, and limited resources, are reducing the ability of state and local crime laboratories to analyze their convicted offender backlogs. While I introduced, and Congress passed, the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998 to address the long-term needs of crime laboratories, many crime laboratories need immediate assistance to address their short-term backlogs that will help law enforcement solve crime. 
   This bill would provide about $30 million, over 4 years, to help state and  local crime laboratories address their convicted offender backlogs. We are asking the FBI to work with private, state and local laboratories to organize regional laboratories to analysis backlogged State and local convicted offender samples. While we have considered many ways to address the backlog of convicted offender samples in state and local laboratories, we believe that the approach outlined in this legislation provides the fastest, most cost-effective and efficient method of eliminating the backlog. 
   Violent criminals should not be able to evade responsibility simply because a state lacks the resources to analyze their DNA samples, or because a loophole excludes certain Federal offenders from our national database. This legislation would be a huge asset for our local law enforcers in their day-to-day fight against crime. I thank Senator KOHL for his efforts.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to salute a truly great American on the occasion of his eightieth birthday. Carl Lindner is an important figure in the history of American business--he is also a good man and a dear friend. 
   The Carl Lindner story is a genuine, old-fashioned American success story. He came from a modest background. He started out delivering milk--and ended up owning an ice cream company. And many other companies besides! 
   He was born in Dayton, Ohio, on April 22, 1919. He grew up in the small town of Norwood, in Hamilton County. And he brought the values he learned there to the creation of a huge business empire--United Dairy Farmers, American Financial Corporation, Chiquita Brands, Penn Central Corporation, Great American Communications Company. 
   And throughout all of this, Carl Lindner remains today a kind, unassuming family man--with the values of a businessman beloved by his friends in a small town. A man who cares about others--and about the welfare of his whole community. 
   It has been said that just about everybody who grows up in southwest Ohio spends at least some time working for one of Carl Lindner's companies. He is certainly one of the key employers in the entire Tristate area, if not the country. 
   But he doesn't just help people by employing them. He is also one of the most generous philanthropists in America. He is a quiet man with a heart of gold--and he works tirelessly to improve the health and education of the people of Ohio, our nation, and the whole world. 
   Mr. President, America gave Carl Lindner the opportunity to work hard and achieve a great deal. And he has given a lot back to this country. His most important contribution--is his example. He proves that the most important thing in a man's life is not how much money he makes, but what he does for people. 
   He is not a man who clamors for attention; this week, he is in the headlines because of his purchase of the Cincinnati Reds. But the real Carl Lindner--the one I know--is a man whose most important priority is helping people. 
   To Carl Lindner, on his eightieth birthday, the people of Ohio say congratulations, and a deep and heartfelt thank you from all of us whose lives you have touched!

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, one of the key virtues of living in a free society such as our own is that it's harder  for injustice to remain hidden and unreported. Unlike Communist and fascist countries--countries where the government can control access to information, and cover up genocide and war crimes for years--in our country, people are allowed to stand up and tell the truth. They can reveal inconvenient and unpleasant facts about moral evils that are taking place in our society. 
   To speak the truth--to distinguish right from wrong, you don't have to be a President, or a Senator, or a famous human rights crusader like Martin Luther King, Jr. You can be anybody. You can be a medical technician in Cincinnati, OH. 
   Mr. President, let me tell you a story about how--very recently, in my home State of Ohio--some disturbing truths were revealed that many Americans simply wish would go away. 
   On April 6, a young woman went into an abortion clinic in Montgomery County, OH, to undergo a procedure known as partial-birth abortion. This is a procedure that usually takes place behind closed doors, where it can be ignored, its moral status left unquestioned. 
   But this particular procedure was different. In this procedure, on April 6, things did not go as planned. Here's what happened. 
   The Dayton, OH, abortionist, Dr. Martin Haskell, started a procedure to dilate her cervix, so the child could eventually be removed and killed. He applied seaweed to start the procedure. He then sent her home--because this procedure usually takes 2 or 3 days. In fact, the patient is supposed to return on the second day for a further application of seaweed--and then come back a third time for the actual partial-birth abortion--a 3-day procedure. 
   So the woman went home to Cincinnati, expecting to return to Dayton and complete the procedure in 2 or 3 days. But her cervix dilated far too quickly. Shortly after midnight on the first day, after experiencing severe stomach pains, she was admitted to Bethesda North Hospital in Cincinnati. 
   The child was born. After 3 hours and 8 minutes, this little girl died. 
   The cause of death was listed on the death certificate as ``prematurity secondary to induced abortion.'' 
   True enough, Mr. President. But also on the death certificate is a space for ``Method of death.'' And it says, in the case of this child, ``Method of death: natural.'' 
   I do not mean to quarrel, talk about whether this is true in the technical sense. But if you look at the events that led up to her death, you'll see that there was really nothing natural about them at all. 
   The medical technician who held that little girl for the 3 hours and 8 minutes of her short life named her Baby Hope. Baby Hope did not die of natural causes. She was the victim of a barbaric procedure that is opposed by the vast majority of the American people. A procedure that has twice been banned by act of Congress--only to see the ban repeatedly overturned by a Presidential veto. 
   The death of Baby Hope did not take place behind the closed doors of an abortion clinic. It took place in public--in a hospital dedicated to saving lives, not taking them. Her death reminds us of the brutal reality and tragedy of what partial-birth abortion really is. 
   When we voted to ban partial-birth abortions, we talked about this procedure in graphic detail. The public reaction to this disclosure--the disclosure of what partial-birth abortion really is--was loud and it was decisive. And there is a very good reason for this. The procedure is barbaric.

   Baby Hope was not supposed to die in the arms of a medical technician. But she did. And this little baby cannot be easily ignored. We cannot turn our back on this reality. 
   This procedure is not limited to mothers and fetuses who are in danger. It is performed on healthy women--and healthy babies--all the time. 
   The goal of a partial-birth abortion is not to protect somebody's health but to kill a child. That is what the abortionist wants to do. 
   Dr. Haskell himself has said as much. In an interview with the American Medical News, he said:  
   You could dilate further and deliver the baby alive but that's really not the point. 
   The point is, you are attempting to do an abortion, and that is the goal of your work, is to complete an abortion, not to see how do I manipulate the situation so I get a live birth instead.  
   Now Dr. Haskell has admitted what the reality is. Why don't we? 
   Again, let's hear Dr. Haskell in his own words, a man who performed this abortion on Baby Hope. This is what Dr. Haskell says about this ``procedure.'' 
   These are Dr. Haskell's words:  
   I just kept on doing the D&E's [dilation and extraction] because that is what I was comfortable with, up until 24 weeks. But they were very tough. Sometimes it was a 45-minute operation. I noticed some of the later D&Es were very, very easy. So I asked myself why can't they all happen this way. You see the easy ones would have a foot length presentation, you'd reach up and grab the foot of the fetus, pull the fetus down and the head would hang up and then you would collapse the head and take it out. It was easy.  
   It was easy, Mr. President. Easy for Dr. Haskell. He does not say it was easy for the mother, and he certainly does not say it was easy for the baby. I suspect he doesn't care. His goal is to perform abortions. But is he the person we are going to trust to decide when abortions are necessary? Dr. Haskell has a production line going in Dayton, OH. Nothing is going to stop him from meeting his quota. 
   Dr. Haskell continues. Again, the words of Dr. Haskell:  
   At first, I would reach around trying to identify a lower extremity blindly with the tip of my instrument. I'd get it right about 30-50 percent of the time. Then I said, ``Well, gee, if I just put the ultrasound up there, I could see it all and I wouldn't have to feel around for it.'' I did that and sure enough, I found it 99 percent of the time. Kind of serendipity.  
   Serendipity, Mr. President. 
   Let me conclude. We need to ask ourselves, what does our toleration in this country of this ``procedure'' say about us as a nation? Where do we draw the line? At what point do we finally stop saying, ``Well, I don't really like this, but it doesn't really matter to me, so I will put up with it''? When do we stop saying that as a country, Mr. President? At what point do we say, ``Unless we stop this from happening, we cannot justly call ourselves a civilized Nation''? 
   When you come right down to it, America's moral anesthetic is wearing off. It really is. We know what is going on behind the curtain, and we cannot wish that knowledge away. We have to face it, and we have to do what is right. 
   This week, some of my colleagues and I will be reintroducing the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Twice in the last 3 years, Congress has passed this legislation with strong bipartisan support, only to see it fall victim to a Presidential veto. Once again, I am confident Congress will do the right thing and pass this very important legislation. But that is not enough. Passing this legislation in Congress is not enough. For lives to be saved, the bill must actually become law. 
   Mr. President, if something happens behind the iron curtain of an abortion clinic, it is easier to pretend it simply did not happen. But the death of Baby Hope in Cincinnati, OH, in the last few days has torn that curtain, revealing the truth of this barbaric procedure. 
   Let people not ask about us 50 years from now: How could they not have known? or ask: Why didn't they do anything? because, Mr. President, the fact is, we do know and we must take action. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I join with my colleague, Senator DURBIN, in introducing the ``Children's Asthma Relief Act of 1999.'' This bill would authorize $50 million for each of 5 years for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to eligible entities to develop and expand projects to provide asthma services to children. These grants may also be used to equip mobile health care clinics that provide asthma diagnosis and asthma-related health care services, educate families on asthma management, and identify and enroll uninsured children who are eligible for but not receiving health coverage under Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). The ability to identify and enroll children in these programs will ensure that children with asthma receive the care they need. 
   Research supported by the NIH has shown that the combination of cockroach waste, house dust mites, molds, tobacco smoke, and feathers (among other allergens) contribute to asthma-related illness and hospitalization. Children living in urban areas are especially susceptible. 
   Asthma is the most common chronic illness that forces children to miss school. From 1979 to 1992, the hospitalization rates among children due to asthma increased 74 percent. Estimates show that more than 7% of children now suffer from asthma. Hospitalization rates were highest for individuals 4 years old and younger. According to 1998 data from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) my home state of Ohio ranks about 17th in the estimated prevalence rates for asthma. Nationwide, the most substantial prevalence rate increase for asthma occurred among children aged 4 years old and younger. 
   I believe that an important component of this bill is that it requires those receiving grants to coordinate with current children's health programs such as the Maternal and Child Health Program, Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, supplemental nutrition programs, and child welfare, foster care and adoption assistance programs. This type of coordination with other children's programs will help to ensure not just a better targeting of funding, but also will help to identify children in these programs who are asthmatic and may otherwise remain undetected and untreated. 
   This bill would authorize $5 million for each of 5 years for the Secretary of HHS to award matching grants to states that develop plans to carry out asthma-related programs for children according to NIH guidelines through the state children's health insurance programs. 
   Since research shows that children living in urban areas suffer from asthma at such alarming rates and that allergens such as cockroach waste contribute to the onset of asthma, this bill adds urban cockroach management to the current preventive health services block grant which can currently be used for rodent control. To reduce roach allergens, this block grant could be used to cover the costs of structural rehabilitation of public housing, schools, and other public facilities to control roach infestation, while minimizing or avoiding the use of pesticides. 
   This bill would require that NIH give the National Asthma Education Prevention Program (within NIH) an additional $5 million for each of 5 years to develop a federal plan for responding to asthma and to submit recommendations to Congress on ways to strengthen and better coordinate federal asthma-related activities. 
   To better monitor the prevalence and determine which areas have the greatest incidences of children with asthma, this bill would require CDC to conduct local asthma surveillance activities to collect data on the prevalence and severity of asthma and to annually publish data on the prevalence rates of asthma among children and on the childhood mortality rate. This surveillance data will help us better detect asthmatic conditions so that more children can be treated and we can ensure that we are targeting our resources in an effective and efficient way to reverse the disturbing trend in the hospitalization and death rates of children who suffer from asthma. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this very important initiative to help the nearly 5 million children who have been diagnosed with asthma and to help those who suffer from asthma but who remain untreated.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the ``Safe Seniors Assurance Study Act of 1999.'' I am joined in this effort by my colleague, Senator REID from Nevada. This bill would require that the Secretary of Health and Human Services conduct a study and analyze the impact of physician supervision, or lack of physician supervision, on death rates of Medicare patients associated with the administration of anesthesia services. Since the  Medicare program began, the Health Care Financing Adminstration's (HCFA) standards for hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers have required that a physician either provide the anesthesia care or supervise the anesthesia care provided by nurse anesthetists. This requirement has also applied to the Medicaid program. 
   The very old and the very young, both covered by these two federal insurance programs, represent the segments of our population that, on average, face the highest anesthesia risks. The two programs cover over 40 million Americans. 
   In December 1997, HCFA proposed changes to its standards for hospitals and surgical centers. Included in these proposed changes was the elimination of the physician supervision requirement, leaving to state governments the decision whether physician supervision of nurse anesthetists was necessary. In issuing its proposed changes, HCFA offered no scientific data indicating that anesthesia safety would not be impaired as a result of the changed rule, and has offered no such data to this day. 
   In 1992, HCFA considered a similar change, but rejected it. After reviewing the studies available at the time showing anesthesia outcomes, HCFA concluded: ``In consideration of the risks associated with anesthesia procedures, we believe it would not be appropriate to allow anesthesia administration by a non-physician anesthetist unless under supervision by an anesthesiologist or the operating practitioner.'' HCFA also declined to adopt as a ``national minimum standard of care, a practice that is allowed in only some states.'' 
   In the only comparative anesthesia outcome study published since 1992, researchers found that outcomes were better in hospitals having Board-certified anesthesiologists on staff. In the Fall of last year, an abstract of a University of Pennsylvania study of 65,000 Medicare surgical cases indicated that mortality and `failure to rescue' rates significantly improved when a nurse anesthetist was supervised by an anesthesiologist rather than the operating surgeon. This latter study is expected to be published in final form later this year. 
   The Conference Report on the Fiscal Year 1999 Omnibus Appropriations measure recommended that HCFA ``base retaining or changing the current requirement of physician supervision.....on scientifically valid outcomes data.'' The Report suggested ``an outcome approach that would examine, using existing operating room anesthesia data, mortality and adverse outcomes rates by different anesthesia providers, adjusted to reflect relevant scientific variables.'' 
   A bill was introduced in the House in early February by Representatives DAVE WELDON and GENE GREEN that would require HCFA to undertake the congressionally-recommended outcome study of Medicare patients, and complete it by June 30, 2000. That bill currently has about 37 cosponsors--Republicans and Democrats. This is not a partisan issue, but an issue about safety. The bill that I am introducing with my colleague, Senator HARRY REID today, is very similar to the Weldon/Green bill in the House. Our Senate version would only require that the Secretary of HHS consider the results of the June 2000 study in deciding whether or not to implement its 1997 proposal. 
   Physician anesthesiologists personally provide, or supervise anesthesia administration by a qualified non-physician, 90% of the anesthesia care in this country. In the rest of the cases, supervision is provided by the operating practitioner. Under the Medicare program, there is no additional cost for having an anesthesiologist provide or supervise the anesthesia care versus having a non-physician provide the anesthesia under the supervision of the operating practitioner. The proposed HCFA rule change does not, therefore, generate any cost savings. 
   Anesthesiologists are physicians who, after four years of pre-medical training in college, have completed eight years of medical education and specialized residency training. This is in contrast to the 24 to 30 months of training received by nurse anesthetists after nursing school--in fact, about 37% of nurse anesthetists have not graduated from college. 
   The American Medical Association's House of Delegates last December approved a resolution supporting legislation requiring that an appropriately licensed and credentialed physician administer or supervise anesthesia care. National surveys of Medicare beneficiaries performed by the Tarrance Group in January 1998 and 1999 show that 4 out of 5 seniors oppose the elimination of the current physician supervision requirement. 
   Let's err on the side of safety and caution by requiring that the Secretary of HHS conduct a study on the mortality and death rates of Medicare patients associated with the administration of anesthesia care by different providers. Analyzing the impact of physician supervision on anesthesia care and requiring the Secretary to simply consider the results of that study in determining whether or not to change current regulations to allow unsupervised nurse anesthetists to administer anesthesia services, is the very least we can do to ensure that we are making safe changes to existing regulations--changes that HCFA rejected in 1992 when studies of anesthesia outcomes were up-to-date and available. 
   If HCFA is going to now change its policy in 1999, we should ask HCFA to show us the scientific and clinical data behind its decision to ensure that the safety of our most vulnerable populations--our children and our elderly--are adequately protected. None of us--including HCFA--is in a position to judge the merits of this proposed rule change without first gathering and then analyzing up-to-date scientific evidence. Only then can patients be confident in the safety and quality of their anesthesia care. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator SESSIONS, to reintroduce legislation that would close the loopholes that permit civilians accompanying the Armed Forces and those serving with the Armed Forces from evading punishment for crimes they committed while abroad. Under current law, many illegal acts committed abroad by dependents, civilian employees, and those servicing with the Armed Forces go substantially unaddressed by either military or civilian courts. Administrative punishments have proven equally inadequate to address this problem. 
   When civilians accompany the Armed Services outside the United States, they are not subject to prosecution under Federal criminal law or the Uniform Code of Military Justice. This has proven to be a double-edged sword. While foreign nations frequently have no interest in vindicating crimes committed by American civilians against other Americans, despite the extreme seriousness of the offense, there have been instances where the United States has had to turn over American civilians to host countries for potentially harsh punishment because of the absence of appropriate enforcement action. Unfortunately, this problem is likely to worsen as there are a large number of dependents overseas, and the number of civilian employees of the Armed Services overseas is increasing. As for those serving with the Armed Forces, criminal prosecutions by the military court or administrative alternatives sometimes simply discharge the individual and send them home, rather than imposing any serious punishment for a crime. 
   The case that has united Senator SESSIONS and me behind this legislation is that of an Ohio resident, Amy McGough, who was stationed in Germany, along with her husband who is from Alabama. Mrs. McGough's 8-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter were repeatedly raped and molested by a neighbor boy who was supposed to be baby-sitting them. While the Criminal Investigations Division of the Army found sufficient facts, neither the Army nor Federal prosecutors had jurisdiction to prosecute the case, and the German government would not intervene because of the age of the perpetrator. 
   In such cases, our bill would guarantee that civilians, or those serving with the Armed Forces in certain circumstances, who commit an illegal act punishable under the Federal law by more than a year's imprisonment, will be subject to the special maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States for prosecution by a military court or for Federal criminal prosecution. Neither civilians connected with the Armed Forces nor those serving with the Armed Forces abroad accused of rape, child molestation or some other serious felony will simply be allowed to resign or leave the foreign country to avoid punishment. They will be subject to Federal prosecution.  
   We need to make sure that an appropriate criminal process exists in these circumstances. Letting these individuals back on America's streets does little to hold them accountable, and nothing to protect our communities here at home. I appreciate the efforts of my colleague, Senator SESSIONS, who is also a member of the Armed Services Committee, in working with me to introduce this legislation to address our mutual concern.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my distinguished colleague from New Mexico, Senator BINGAMAN, to introduce this amendment, which would once again put this Senate on record in support of restoring our nation's military science and technology base. Specifically, our amendment expresses the Sense of the Senate that the budgetary levels for the Defense Science and Technology program should be consistent with the 2% real increases in the budget request called for by Congress in last year's Defense Authorization Act. 
   Without question, our nation has built the most technologically superior military force in the history of mankind. During our recent demonstration of resolve against Saddam Hussein, the men and women who participated in Operation Desert Fox were virtually untouchable. The results of their efforts were amazing: we attacked over 100 separate targets in an effort to degrade Saddam Hussein's military infrastructure. We totally destroyed 85 percent of these targets, and partially damaged the remainder, all without so much as a scratched airplane. 
   Why are our aircraft so overwhelmingly dominant and untouchable on the battlefield? The answer: the Air Force made an investment many years ago in science and technology research and we are now reaping the returns of that investment. 
   Unfortunately, in recent years, the Air Force, as well as our other service branches, have made significant reductions in its investment in scientific research which may cast a long, dark shadow on the success of tomorrow's military. Over the last 10 years, the Air Force, for example, has reduced the S&T workforce by 2,375 people. A large number of these talented individuals came from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. And unless we in Congress take action, Wright-Patterson and other similar bases across our country will continue to lose this unrivaled expertise. 
   Mr. President, this should be of great concern to all of us. Continued investment in Defense S&T research is crucial if we are to meet the challenges ahead. Yes, our nation's central security concern of the past half century--the threat of communist expansion--is gone. However, the world is far from being a safe place. Every day, our nation faces more and more diverse and complex challenges--as highlighted by recent events in the Middle East, Kosovo, international terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them, and the flooding of illegal drugs into our country. These threats to stability and security require an enduring commitment to diplomatic engagement and military readiness. In both instances, science and technology research plays a critical role. 
   Today we lead the world in virtually every measure of technological development, but we can't rest on our recent successes. To remain the best we have to continue to offer the best technology and employ the best scientists,  engineers, technicians, and innovators. The brave men and women of tomorrow's military will have to fight with the technology we invest in today--what we do today will have a direct impact on our success tomorrow. 
   Since the founding of our great nation, scientific discovery and technological innovation have advanced our military capabilities and economic prosperity, ensuring the United States' position as a world leader. I must confess a great deal of personal pride in the dedicated men and women at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base--the Defense Department's largest research site--who play no small part in this endeavor. 
   Wright-Patterson, founded in 1917 and formerly known as McCook Field, has given the nation technological advancements too numerous to count. These include advanced lightweight aerodynamic designs, advanced jet engines, hypersonic lifting bodies, development of the first ``smart weapons,'' and many, many others. 
   It is doubtful we will see that kind of achievement in the near future. My colleagues and I are here offering this amendment because we are very concerned that the proposed level of funding for Defense S&T programs for next year is nearly $400 million below the level Congress provided this year. 
   I am very troubled about the Air Force's proposal to use Air Force S&T resources to fund the Space Based Laser and Discoverer II (space-based radar) program beginning in FY 2000. It is our understanding that these previously non-S&T programs were inserted into the FY 2000 Air Force late in the budget process, while providing no additional funding to cover the costs of current S&T programs. This represents a significant reduction in our Air Force S&T investment in FY 2000 and the outyears, and unless Congress acts, will result in drastic cuts in critical Air Force research programs, severe reductions in force, and weaken our overall Air Force technology base. In fact, earlier this month, the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) announced it would lose 163 civilian positions as a result of the Air Force's proposed FY 2000 S&T budget. 
   Now that Congress has agreed to address emerging readiness issues and increase our investment in our national defense, our long term readiness requires Congress to reverse the dangerous decline in S&T funding. Last year, Congress recognized this downward trend in our S&T investments and passed legislation that called for an increase in the budget for Defense S&T programs in all the Services by at least two percent above the rate of inflation for each year for the next nine years. 
   Rebuilding Defense S&T is more than in investment in programs, but in people as well. Simply restoring funding for S&T will not automatically bring that lost expertise back. It has to be built up over time. In order to take advantage of next generation technology, we need to begin recruiting the next generation of innovators. 
   For these reasons, it's important that we pass a long-term budget plan that is consistent with the goal we set last year to rebuild our Defense S&T programs and personnel. We can start that effort by passing the amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico. If we abide by the commitment embodied in this amendment, we will give tomorrow's military the tools it needs to ensure our national security needs are met. In addition, by investing in highly qualified personnel, we are making it possible to devote the best minds toward developing the best technology. We must invest now so our children can enjoy the peace and prosperity that comes with being second to none in military technological superiority. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer an amendment along with Senators, ABRAHAM, COVERDELL, BURNS, SANTORUM, SMITH of Oregon, GRAMS, BAUCUS, and ASHCROFT to the budget resolution on the importance of counter-narcotic funding. I offer this amendment because I want to make it crystal clear that this budget, and this Congress, should make a serious investment in anti-drug activities. 
   This amendment expresses a Sense of Senate that funding for federal drug control activities should be at a level higher than that proposed in the President's Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2000 and that funding for federal drug control activities should allow for investments in programs authorized in the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act and in S.5, the proposed Drug Free Century Act, which I introduced earlier this year. 
   Mr. President, history has proven that a successful anti-drug strategy is balanced and comprehensive in three key areas: demand reduction--such as education and treatment; domestic law enforcement; and international supply reduction. 
   This is why last year, I introduced the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act, a $2.6 billion authorization initiative over three years for enhanced international eradication, interdiction and crop alternative programs. 
   Two factors motivated me to launch this bi-partisan effort: a significant rise in teen drug use and a significant decline in our investment to seize drugs outside our borders. This dramatic decrease in our international efforts is one of the reasons why drugs have become more available and more affordable. 
   This wasn't always the case. The budget numbers tell an alarming and undeniable story. In 1987, the federal government's drug control budget of $4.79 billion was divided as follows: 29% for demand reduction programs; 38% for domestic law enforcement; and 33% for international supply reduction. This funding breakdown was the norm during the Reagan and Bush Administrations' efforts against illegal drugs, from 1985-92. 
   And during that time, our investment paid off. From 1988-1991, total drug use was down 13%. Cocaine use dropped by 35%. Marijuana use was reduced by 16%. 
   After President Clinton took office in 1993, this Administration pursued an anti-drug strategy that upset this careful funding balance. And by 1995, the federal drug control budget of $13.3 billion was divided as follows: 35% for demand reduction programs; 53% for domestic law enforcement, and only 12% for international supply reduction. The share of our anti-drug investment dedicated to stopping drugs outside our country dropped from 33% in 1987 to 12% in 1995. 
   Mr. President, our country is paying the price for this unfortunate change in strategy. Since 1992, overall drug use among teens aged 12 to 17 rose by 70 percent. Drug-abuse related arrests more than doubled for minors between 1992 and 1996. And the price of drugs also decreased during this time period. 
   Last year we passed the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act and also provided a down payment of $829 million to get this initiative started. 
   Today, however, it is clear that the Administration is not yet ready to exercise the leadership Congress demanded on this Act. First, the Administration's Fiscal Year 2000 budget would invest less in our anti-drug efforts than what Congress provided this year. Second, regardless of repeated efforts to work with the Administration to get serious about eradication and interdiction, not one of the top priorities outlined in our bi-partisan Act were funded in the Administration's proposed budget. 
   So, once again, it is up to us in Congress to set the example and provide the leadership to ensure we implement a serious and balanced drug control policy. 
   Let me conclude by thanking the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, and his staff, for their efforts to make sure this budget resolution represents the commitment we must make if we are truly serious about reducing drugs. It will take that kind of commitment to help us achieve  once again a comprehensive and balanced drug control strategy. Most important, it will put us back on a course toward ridding our schools and communities of illegal and destructive drugs. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important and timely amendment.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act of 1999, a bill to improve the administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the juvenile and family courts, as well as the quality and availability of training for judges, attorneys and guardian ad litems. I am joined in this introduction by Senator ROCKEFELLER, and I thank him for all of his hard work on behalf of abused and neglected children and I look forward to working with him as we move forward with this legislation. 
   I have been involved with children's issues for over two decades, not just as the father of eight, but also as a local county elected official. I know the kinds of problems that exist at the ground level, and I think it's very important that we work together to address them. 
   This is especially true today, as opposed to a couple of years ago, because the child welfare agencies and the  courts have an important new task--the implementation of the Adoption and Safe Families Act. 
   Almost one and a half years ago, Congress passed this historic piece of legislation, which was designed to encourage safe and permanent family placements for abused and neglected children--and to decrease the amount of time that a child spends in the foster care system. With this law, we make it clear that the health and safety of the child must come first when making any decision for a child in the abuse and neglect system. This law shortens the time line for children in foster care. Specifically, the law requires initiation of proceedings to terminate parental rights for any child who has been in the foster care system for 15 of the last 22 months. 
   These timelines are very important. Foster care was meant to be a temporary solution--but for too many children foster care has become a way of life. However, the institution of these timelines has created additional pressure on an already overburdened court system. 
   To give you an idea of the burden that already exists, consider this: When the Family Court was established in New York in 1962, it reviewed 96,000 cases the first year. By 1997, the case load had increased to 670,000 cases.

    Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution on El Salvador along with Senators COVERDELL, GRAHAM and DODD. This resolution congratulates the government and the people of El Salvador on successfully completing free and democratic elections on March 7, 1999. 
   On March 7, 1999 the Republic of El Salvador successfully completed its second democratic multiparty election since the signing of the peace accords in 1992. These elections, like the legislative elections in 1997 and the Presidential elections in 1994, were deemed free and fair by domestic and international observers. Moreover, the elections were conducted in an environment of peace, where all parties contested for the right to govern in a spirited political campaign. 
   This resolution today commends the government of El Salvador and most importantly the people of the country, who thought their participation in the political process have demonstrated the strength and diversity of El Salvador's democratic expression. It also congratulates Mr. Francisco Flores, President-elect, and Vice President-elect, Mr. Carlos Quintanilla-Schmidt for their electoral victory and for their  commitment to democracy and to the continued progress of El Salvador. 
   This election further consolidates El Salvador's dramatic transformation in the seven short years since the signing of the peace accords. Today, El Salvador has moved from a country racked by civil war into a stable multiparty democracy. The country has attained a balance of power among the Executive, Judicial and Legislative Branches. It has enacted measures to guarantee the full respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and has adopted policies that strengthen municipal governments and provide much-needed social services to local communities. 
   The country has also undergone an equally dramatic economic transformation. Its economy, which suffered decades of decline, has become one of the fastest growing economies in the region. For the past eight years, the GDP in El Salvador has averaged 5.3 percent. Inflation, which averaged above 20 percent prior to 1992, now tops at 1.5 percent. El Salvador's privatization program is one of the most successful in the region. Moreover, it is considered today one of the best sovereign credit risks in Latin America. 
   All of these accomplishments are testament to the will of the Salvadoran people to put their past behind them and focus on creating a future of social stability and economic prosperity. It is also a testament to the political leadership of the Salvadoran government. When President Calderon Sol took office five years ago, he had the responsibility to assure full compliance with the peace accords, as well as keep the economy of El Salvador on the path of economic reform. He deserves today to be applauded by this body of Congress for his accomplishments and for leading his country successfully into the 21st century. 
   El Salvador's dramatic transformation is not unlike the changes that have taken place across Central America. Today marks the first time in the history of the region that all of Central America is at peace, implementing free market reforms and led by Democratic governments. For those of us who were in Congress during the 1980s, we know what a remarkable feat this is and how significant it is that we can today, in a bipartisan fashion, applaud the consolidation of democracy in El Salvador. 
   We should not take the strides that the region has taken for granted. The devastation brought by Hurricane Mitch has dealt a severe blow to the fortunes of the region. History has shown that natural disasters can be the breeding grounds for civil and political unrest and the erosion of civil liberties. I urge my colleagues to support the emergency aid package to the region that is currently on the Senate floor for debate. In addition, IO ask that we also pass the CBI enhancement bill so that these countries also have the opportunity to help themselves. 
   Mr. President, I congratulate and commend the people of El Salvador for continuing to move forward in a way that will bring our hemisphere together--and increase the likelihood that for all of us, the 21st century will be a time of peace, freedom, and prosperity.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators COVERDELL, BREAUX, and GRAMS in introducing the Federal Facilities Clean Water Compliance Act of 1999. This legislation would  hold the Federal Government accountable under the Nation's Federal water laws. Today, states, local governments and the private sector must all comply with each and every Federal, State, and local water requirement. The Federal Government does not. 
   Although Congress included provisions requiring Federal facilities to comply with the Nation's water pollution laws in 1972, the United States Supreme Court ruled that State governments could not impose certain fines and penalties against Federal agencies for violations of the Clean Water Act. While other legislation has forced the Federal Government to comply with other environmental statutes, Congress has not yet brought Federal facilities into compliance with the requirements on the prevention and control of water pollution. 
   This legislation, however, guarantees that the Federal Government is (1) held to the same enforcement mechanisms under the Clean Water Act as private entities, states, and localities; (2) complies with all of the Federal, State, and local requirements on the prevention and control of water pollution; and (3) is responsible for the payment of reasonable service charges. 
   The Clean Water Act celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary two years ago. As a result, the entire nation has benefitted from cleaner water. In the interests of fairness, the Federal Government should not be granted immunity from the Nation's clean water laws any longer. For the sake of fairness, public safety and health, and environmental protection, the Federal Government should be held to the same standards for water pollution prevention and control as states, local governments and the private sector.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I join my colleague and friend, Senator VOINOVICH, in paying tribute to one of the leading figures in the history of journalism in the State of Ohio. My good friend Dave Cooper is retiring after 22 years as editor of the editorial and opinion pages of the Akron Beacon Journal. 
   David B. Cooper began as a reporter with a genuine love for political journalism. After reporting for the Raleigh (North Carolina) News and Observer and Winston-Salem Journal and Sentinel, he joined the Detroit Free Press--where he moved over to the writing of editorials. 
   In 1977, the Akron Beacon Journal hired Dave to run its editorial and opinion pages. In that capacity, he has been more than just a principled observer and commentator on the political life of Ohio and America--he has also been a powerful force in the cultural life of his community. 
   Indeed, some of his best writing has been on music. In fact--since 1994--he has hosted a weekly jazz program on radio station WAPS. 
   The same feeling that infuses his writing and commentary on jazz is present in his political writing. Dave knows that if all you want is accuracy, you have merely to know your subject. And believe me, Dave knows the stuff he writes about! But he also knows that if you want to go beyond that--beyond mere accuracy toward the kind of deep understanding that goes to the heart of an issue--you must not just know, but love, your subject. 
   That's the kind of work that creates positive change in a community. It is the type of work that Dave has done. 
   Dave Cooper says his pet peeve is ``politicians who are pompous.'' And that really reflects Dave's personality--he doesn't do what he does for his own ego; he does it to help people understand things. He does it to make a real difference. And that's why he holds people in public life to the same high standard. 
   I am proud to call Dave Cooper my good friend, and I wish him and Joanne well as they begin a new life. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, for quite some time, I have worked with the organ and tissue donation community to help educate others about donation and transplant issues. With each organ that is successfully transplanted, a gift of new life is given to the recipient. 
   Today I rise to offer the Immunosuppressive Drug Coverage Act of 1999 to help ensure that those receiving Medicare covered transplants will be able to afford the drugs necessary to keep their bodies from rejecting their new organs. The current 36-month Medicare coverage limit is arbitrary, and frankly, sorely inadequate. We are not talking about a car lease, but about a new lease on life. This coverage can mean the difference between life and death for some, and at the very least, the difference between a Medicare transplant recipient having to experience the pain of an organ rejection, a return to dialysis--for kidney recipients--and the return to a very long waiting list for another organ. 
   These organs are a precious investment, and it simply defies logic that Medicare covers the initial transplant, the life-long extensive medical treatment that is needed if the organ is rejected, and a second transplant (if that person is fortunate enough to find a second organ)--but not the drugs that can help prevent the rejection of the initial transplanted organ beyond 36 months. Many Medicare transplant recipients are not able to afford these immunosuppressive drugs, so they may ration their use of the drugs or they may stop taking them altogether. Let's give them a third alternative--to keep taking the drugs and to keep their organs.

    Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act of 1999. These poison control centers need our help. The unstable sources of funding for these centers have resulted in many of them having to close. This unfortunate decline can be reversed and cost savings can be achieved by the efficient use of these centers. I would like to thank my colleague, Senator ABRAHAM, for his efforts on behalf of this bill and I'd also like to thank my colleagues on the Congressional Prevention Coalition, Senators CHAFEE and GRAHAM of Florida, for their support of this legislation. 
   This bill establishes and authorizes funding for a national toll-free number to ensure that all Americans have access to poison control center services. This number will be automatically routed to the center designated to cover the caller's region. By having to only remember one national phone number, parents will be able to call this number in the event their child accidentally swallows a poisonous substance while they are away from home on vacation, and be routed to the closest poison control center for treatment advice. This system will improve access to poison control center services for everyone. It will simplify efforts to educate parents and the public about what to do in the event of a poisoning exposure. 
   Each year, more than 2 million poisoning are reported to poison control centers throughout the United States. More than 90% of these poisonings happen in the home--and over 50 percent of poisoning victims are children under 6 years of age. By providing expert advice to distraught parents, babysitters, poisoning victims, and health care professionals, poison control centers decrease the severity of illness and prevent deaths. 
   These centers serve cost-effective public health services. For every dollar spent on poison control center services, $7 in medical costs are saved by reducing the inappropriate services. Most importantly, we can save lives by ensuring that stabilizing funding sources for these centers. My home state of Ohio, for example, has 3 poison control centers--one in Columbus, Cincinnati, and Cleveland--that rely on an uncertain patchwork of federal, state, local, and private funding sources. The federal dollars that will be provided by this legislation may be used to supplement, NOT replace, existing federal, state, local, and private funds that are invested in these centers. For those states that have recently experienced the closure of the only existing poison control center in the area, this grant funding can be used to open a new center--provided it can meet certification requirements. It is essential for us to act now to prevent further closures of such valuable resources.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of this concurrent resolution, S. Con. Res. 5. This resolution expresses the strong disapproval of the U.S. Senate to any proposed or contemplated Palestinian state that is created, not through negotiation, but rather through unilateral declaration on the part of the Palestinian Authority. 
   I strongly support and have cosponsored this resolution because I believe in the Middle East process. Brave Israeli leaders have taken great risks for peace. So have Arab leaders. And so, importantly, have the people of the Middle East. I believe this process still offers the most promising approach for an enduring peace in the region. 
   Palestinian Chairman Arafat made a fundamental commitment at Oslo that, in his words, ``all outstanding issues relating to permanent status will be resolved through negotiations.'' I am here on the Senate floor today to call for a reassertion of that very policy. To move away from the Oslo process and take refuge in unilateralism would put the whole region at risk of destabilization. That is simply the wrong direction. I do not believe that a lasting peace can be built on the basis of unilateral declarations. Negotiations remain the single best way to secure the two pillars of a secure peace--addressing Israel's security concerns and creating a sustainable framework for preserving the human rights and political self-determination of the Palestinians. 
   The American people want security for Israel in the context of human rights for Palestinians. A unilateral declaration of independence by the Palestinian Authority would only delay the fulfillment of these goals. So I am proud to join my colleagues today in supporting this very important resolution.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 280, the Education Flexibility Act. This legislation will give greater responsibility, flexibility, and control to local schools. That's where the students, parents, and teachers are. That's where the education happens. 
   That's where the control ought to be. I have been fighting for our teachers and local school administrators for many years, and I think one of the most important things we can do for them is liberate them from Federal red tape--so they can do what they do best: Teach our kids. 
   In offering this bill, our distinguished colleague from Tennessee, Senator FRIST, is striking a blow for freedom in American education. 
   This bill would expand an existing pilot program to all eligible states. It is a good deal for the states--in this bill we offer to free the states from the burden of unnecessary, time-consuming Federal regulations. In return, all states have to do is comply with certain core principles, such as civil rights, and establish a system of accountability. The bill also would require states to have a system of waiving their own regulations. 
   My own home state of Ohio has been one of the pilot programs and has provided over 200 waivers for local schools. For example, the Eisenhower teacher training program only supported math and science training. Using ed-flex, Ohio waived this requirement--and today schools can use this program for training teachers in other subjects such as reading and social studies. 
   The Ohio Department of Education, in its annual report to the Secretary of Education, reached the following conclusion, and I quote: ``The greatest benefit to having Ed-Flex authority is that it, combined with the ability to waive State rules and statutes, establishes a school-planning environment unencumbered by real or perceived regulatory barriers. This environment encourages creativity, thoughtful planning, and innovation.'' 
   Mr. President, that's as true everywhere else in America as it is in Ohio. And that's why this Ed-Flex bill has such strong bipartisan support. 
   But I should note that while Ed-Flex is an important step forward, it is just a single step. We need to do more. Over the next year, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, on which I serve, will be working on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1999--which will deal with almost all of the federal programs that impact K-12 grade education. When the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was passed in 1965, it was 30 pages long, today it is more than 300 pages long. As a member of that committee, I will be looking to empower parents, support local control, promote effective teacher training programs, recognize and reward excellent teachers, and send more money back to the states and local schools with no strings attached. 
   Remember: The Federal Government provides only 6 percent of local school funding, but demands 50 percent of the paperwork that burdens local teachers and administrators. That burden demands nearly 49 million hours each year--or the equivalent of 25,000 school employees working full time--on paperwork, not kids. There are over 700 separate federal education programs spread across 40 separate federal bureaucracies. 
   Mr. President, I am concerned about the quality of our children's education. The Third International Math and Science Study recently reported that out of 21 countries, the U.S. ranked 19th in math and 16th in science, barely ahead of South Africa. Verbal and combined SAT scores are lower today than they were in 1970. Businesses spend more than $30 billion annually in retraining employees who cannot read proficiently. Nearly 30 percent of college freshmen need remedial classes. 
   Mr. President, these are disturbing statistics. As we move forward to improve our children's education, I urge my colleagues to remember that the most important education tool in any classroom is a qualified, highly trained teacher. After parents and families, America's teachers play the most important role in helping our children realize their potential. Our current teachers are doing a good job--indeed, a great job--given the resources they have to work with. Clearly, it's time to change the way we allocate resources. It's time that today's teachers get more support and training and less paperwork from the federal government. 
   I want to thank the sponsor of the Ed-Flex legislation, Senator FRIST, for his work with all members to improve this bill. The manager's amendment that we accepted last week addresses many of the concerns that have been raised about this legislation. Without going into the details of the amendment, I would simply point out that it will strengthen accountability measures currently in the bill, require states to coordinate their Ed-Flex applications with state comprehensive plans, emphasize school and student performance as an objective of Ed-Flex and add additional provisions for public notice and comment regarding Ed-Flex proposals. 
   Ultimately, our children's success in education depends on the support they receive at home and in the classroom. Our focus in Washington should be to take every opportunity to empower parents and then free local schools from regulations that prevent improvements and innovations in local schools. 
   Mr. President, that's why I strongly support this bill.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Veterans' Education Benefits Equity Act. A similar bill has already been introduced in the House of Representatives by my distinguished Ohio colleague, Congressman NEY. 
   This legislation would fix an unintended oversight in veterans' educational benefits. Currently, the law stipulates that qualified veterans can receive their monthly educational assistance benefits when they are enrolled at educational institutions during periods between terms, if the period does not exceed 4 weeks. This time period was established to allow enrolled veterans to continue to receive their benefits during the December/January holidays. The problem with the current time period is that it only covers veterans enrolled at educational institutions on the semester system. Obviously, many educational institutions work on the quarter system, which can have a vacation period of eight weeks between the first and second quarters during the winter holiday season. Consequently, many veterans unfairly lose their benefits during this period because of the institution's course structures. 
   It is my understanding that some educational institutions which have a sizable veteran enrollment frequently create a one credit hour course on military history or a similar topic specifically geared towards veterans in order for them to remain enrolled and eligible for their educational benefits. Consequently, the cost of extending the current eligibility period to eight weeks would have a minimal, if not negligible, cost. 
   The Department of Veterans' Administration has recognized the need to correct this oversight and assisted in the drafting of this legislation and fully supports this bill.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that would designate the Fallen Timbers Battlefield and Fort Miamis as National Historic Sites. 
   Mr. President, the Battle of Fallen Timbers is an early and important chapter in the settlement of what was then known as the Northwest Territory. This important battle occurred between the U.S. army, led by General ``Mad'' Anthony Wayne, and a confederation of Native American tribes led by Tecumseh, in 1794. More than 1,000 Indians ambushed General Wayne's troops as they progressed along the Maumee River. Despite an unorganized defense, U.S. troops forced the tribes to retreat. The Treaty of Greenville was signed in 1795, and it granted the city of Detroit to the United States as well as secured the safe passage along the Ohio River for frontier settlers. 
   The Battle of Fallen Timbers began Ohio's rich history in the formation of our country. And the citizens of Northwest Ohio are committed to preserving that heritage. The National Register of Historic Places already lists Fort Miamis. In 1959, the Battle of Fallen Timbers was included in the National Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings and was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1960. In 1998, the National Park Service completed a Special Resource Study examining the proposed designation and suitability of the site and determined that the Battle of Fallen Timbers Battlefield site meets the criteria for affiliated area status. So it remains only for Congress to officially recognize the national significance of these sites. 
   My legislation would recognize and preserve the 185-acre Fallen Timbers Battlefield site. It would uphold the heritage of U.S. military history and Native American culture during the period of 1794 through 1813. It would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide assistance in the preparation and implementation of the Plan to the State, its political subdivisions, or specified nonprofit organization. 
   Mr. President, the people of Northwest Ohio are committed to preserving the heritage of their community, the State of Ohio, and the United States. Therefore, the Fallen Timbers Battlefield and Fort Miamis sites deserve national historical recognition for the history that they represent. For these reasons, I am proposing this important piece of legislation today.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr President, over the course of the last year, we have heard more and more evidence that the readiness of our nation's military force is slipping. It became a key issue when our military leadership began to warn of shortages of personnel in key specialties, gaps in weapons maintenance, disparities between military and civilian pay, and a high pace of military operations. These and other similar issues have a serious effect on our ability to respond quickly and effectively to military conflicts. In my view, the time has come to restore our nation's military readiness, starting with the morale of our troops. 
   When the military talks about readiness, it is referring in part to the weapons, equipment, bases and support infrastructure needed to carry out its missions. A declining defense budget since 1989 is the prime source of today's problem; it forces our military commanders to make some tough choices. For example, underfunding of real property maintenance and facility operations has often led commanders to reallocate funds meant for training to meet urgent repair needs. Weapons maintenance requirements have also been underestimated on a regular basis. Finally, our continued presence in the Persian Gulf, Bosnia, and potential new responsibilities in Kosovo, to  name just a few, have stretched our military forces and our military budget even further. 
   But readiness isn't just about hardware and property. It's about manpower and morale. The men and women who make up our armed forces represent the best fighting force ever assembled in human history. But shortfalls in personnel recruitment and retention have made it increasingly difficult to ensure full manning of deployed units. Reversing these negative trends in military pay, retirement benefits, and recruitment must be a top priority in the 106th Congress. 
   Fortunately, the U.S. Senate is off to a good start. One of the first bills we will pass this year is S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act which was offered by my friend and colleague from Virginia, Senator WARNER, the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill. 
   The purpose of S. 4 is simple: to improve the readiness and morale of the troops who so selflessly defend our country. The first, and most needed, reform included in this bill is a pay raise of 4.8% beginning January 1st, 2000. The bill also would institute an annual pay raise equal to the Employment Cost Index plus 0.5%. This will help close a military to civilian pay gap of over 13 percent. 
   Amazingly, there are members of our military whose paycheck is so low they qualify for food stamps. For them, S. 4 would provide a monthly ``special subsistence allowance'' of $180. This initiative is designed to dramatically improve the ``quality of life'' for the youngest and most economically vulnerable military families. 
   Mr. President, when I visit Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, I often hear concerns about ``eroding benefits,'' especially concerning retirement pay. Currently, our military personnel fall under several separate retirement plans depending upon the date they initially entered active service. The original military retirement plan called for retirement pay, after 20 years of service, of 50 percent of their basic pay per month. This percentage would then increase by 2.5 percent for each additional year of service up to a maximum of 75 percent of basic pay at 30 years of service. 
   However, in 1986, a new retirement plan was adopted that was intended to increase the incentive for our troops to remain longer on active duty. This plan, commonly called ``Redux'', lowered the percentage from 50 percent after 20 years to 40 percent, but increased the yearly increases for years of service above 20 years, from 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent per year up to a maximum of 75 percent after 30 years of service. 
   The ``Redux'' retirement plan is very unpopular among our military personnel. S. 4 would try another approach. It would give military personnel on ``Redux'' the opportunity of accepting a one-time bonus of $30,000 to remain on the ``Redux'' retirement plan, or to elect to revert to the original retirement system. 
   Finally, S. 4 would create a Thrift Savings Plan. This plan allows for a ``before tax'' contribution of up to 5 percent of the member's basic pay. The member can also elect to add any part of any special or incentive pay to their Thrift Saving Plan. In addition, the Service Secretaries would be authorized to make contributions to a member's Thrift Savings Plan if that member serves in a specialty designated as critical to the service. These contributions require the member to remain on active service for an additional six years. 
   Mr. President, since the end of the Cold War, our military forces have been stretched to the limit, having to manage their resources and mission with an ever tightening budget. Our single most important resource always has been our troops, and like any resource, we have to continue to invest in them. I would like to commend the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER, for bringing S. 4 before the Senate. It is bipartisan legislation. It is legislation that literally puts people first; in this case I'm referring to the men and women in our military. The Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act represents a much-needed, long-overdue investment in the people who are asked to do so much for our country and make such dramatic sacrifices while defending our country. I plan to see that Congress makes good on this vital readiness investment in 1999 by working to ensure enactment of this important legislation.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, on behalf of myself and Senators COCHRAN and VOINOVICH, to introduce the ``Employment Security Financing Act of 1999.'' 
   As you may know, our nation's employment security system was established as a federal-state partnership more than 60 years ago. This system has not undergone major restructuring since its inception; however, a ``temporary'' .2% surtax was enacted in the 1970's. Today, this system overtaxes and overburdens employers, shortchanges states, and, most importantly, underserves those who need it most--the involuntarily unemployed. 
   Two separate payroll taxes fund the employment security system. The most onerous and inefficient of these is the FUTA (Federal Unemployment Tax Act) tax. FUTA is a payroll tax collected by the IRS, dedicated to provide administrative funding for states through allocation from the Department of Labor (DOL). Unfortunately, FUTA taxes sent to Washington rarely find their way back to the states. In Fiscal Year 1997, DOL estimated that states sent more than $6 billion in FUTA taxes to Washington, but received only $3.1 billion in return. 
   Mr. President, reform of the unemployment insurance program is essential to a state like Ohio, which receives less than 39 cents of each employer FUTA dollar. This shortfall in funding has led to the closing of 22 local employment service offices during the last four years. In order to make up for  the shortfall of FUTA dollars, the Ohio legislature has appropriated more than $50 million during the last four years to pay for the administration of employment services, something that should be funded by FUTA taxes. This appropriation of state tax dollars forces Ohio taxpayers to pay twice to fund these services. 
   Ohio is not alone. Since 1990, less than 59 cents of every FUTA dollar has been sent back to the states. In fact, in 1997, states received a paltry 52% return on their FUTA tax dollars. As a result, many states are being forced to make up the shortfall from their own general funds, and cut back on other services provided to the unemployed. 
   For businesses, the system's consequences are equally severe. Employers are forced to pay two separate taxes. The current FUTA net tax rate is .8%, or a maximum of $56 per employee. In addition, employers must pay a similar state payroll tax to finance unemployment benefits. It is estimated that the nation's 6 million FUTA-paying employers spend a total of $1 billion annually simply complying with FUTA reporting requirments. 
   Mr. President, the Employment Security Financing Act is designed to address the problems the current system has imposed on the states and FUTA taxpayers. Specifically, it would: reduce the tax burden by repealing the ``temporary'' .2% FUTA surtax; streamline filings by transferring responsibility for collection of the FUTA tax from the IRS to the states; improve administration by ensuring that states get a greater return on their employers' FUTA tax dollars; improve services with an emphasis on reemployment; and combat fraud and abuse. 
   This is an important issue that Congress needs to consider. I look forward to working with others on legislation that can meet the budget rules, yet still achieve necessary reform of the unemployment insurance program.

    Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of important legislation that would create an endowment for a public-policy institute in Columbus. This institute will embody the spirit of our recently-retired U.S. Senator, the Honorable John Glenn. 
   The bill would create an endowment fund for the John Glenn Institute for Public Service and Public Policy at the Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The bill also creates endowment funds for the Mark O. Hatfield School of Government at Portland State University, the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University, and the Howard Baker School of Government at the University of Tennessee. 
   Mr. President, I have long believed that the study of politics would benefit greatly if more statesmen were to contribute their hands-on expertise. And not only that; it is the example of their supremely practical idealism that we really need if we are to understand and solve the problems confronting tomorrow's America. 
   We in Ohio are proud to host the Glenn Institute, which will serve many purposes: (1) ``To sponsor classes, internships, community service activities, and research projects to stimulate student participation in public service, in order to foster America's next generation of leaders.''

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. Chief Justice, my friends in the Senate, each of the articles before us contains numerous examples of conduct, any of which as alleged would constitute grounds for the President's removal from office. I have determined that most of these allegations have not been proven by clear and convincing evidence. 
   Let me now turn to the three, at least for me, remaining allegations. First is the allegation that the President obstructed justice. When? After his Paula Jones deposition, he had his two, by now very famous, conversations with Betty Currie. The facts are familiar, but they are telling. On January 17, 1998, the President gave his deposition in the Paula Jones case. The Jones lawyers zeroed in on the relationship between Monica Lewinsky and the President. It was clear that the Jones lawyers had specific knowledge of the details of this relationship. In the President's answers, he referred repeatedly to Betty Currie. Further, counsel for Ms. Jones questioned the President in detail about Betty Currie, about her job, her hours at work, et cetera. 
   I submit that any first year law school student who attended that deposition would know that Paula Jones was a prospective witness or would know that Betty Currie was a prospective witness. In fact, 5 days after the deposition Betty Currie was subpoenaed by the Jones lawyers. When the President returned to the White House after the deposition, he knew Betty Currie was a prospective witness. 
   Sure enough, within 3 hours of the conclusion of the deposition, the President called Betty Currie at home on a Saturday night and asked her to come to the White House the next afternoon, Sunday. During the course of that Sunday afternoon meeting, the President informed Betty Currie that Monica's name came up during the deposition. According to Betty Currie's testimony, the President said to her--and we are all, of course, familiar with this--``You were always there when Monica was there, right?'' ``We were never really alone, right?'' ``Monica came on to me and I never touched her, right?'' ``You could see and hear everything, right?'' ``She wanted to have sex with me and I couldn't do that.'' 
   We are all familiar with that, but I think most significantly, and to me the most telling thing, is that 2 or 3 days later the President again spoke to Betty Currie and again made the same statements and used the same demeanor. 
   The President does not dispute that he made these statements to Betty Currie. He explained he was just trying to refresh his memory about what the facts were. The President's explanation is simply not credible. It defies logic. Why would the President make five declarative statements to Betty Currie to ``refresh his memory'' when he knew that Betty Currie could not possibly know whether most of these statements were true? In fact, we know and the President knew that the statements were false. 
   Betty Currie was a key potential witness who could contradict the President's sworn testimony in the Paula Jones deposition. She was also the President's subordinate. On two separate occasions the President made blatantly false statements to her to try to corrupt the due process of justice and with the intent to corruptly persuade her with the intention to influence her testimony. This charge of obstruction of justice, I believe, has been proven by clear and convincing evidence, and I might add it has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 
   Let me now turn to the second allegation, the allegation that the President committed perjury on August 17, 1998, when he testified about these two post-deposition meetings with Betty Currie. I know there may be some who are still struggling with the perjury charge. I simply say this: If you believe, as I do, that the obstruction of justice charge is made based on the statements made to Betty Currie, then any fair reading of the grand jury testimony will indicate to you that you also have to find he committed perjury. 
   Here is what he said:  
   What I was trying to determine is whether my recollection was right and she [Betty Currie] was always in the office complex when Monica was there and whether they thought she could hear any conversation we had, or did she hear any. I thought what would happen is it would break in the press, and I was trying to get the facts down. I was trying to understand what the facts were.  
   He also says, the President:  
   I was not trying to get Betty Currie to say something that was untruthful. I was trying to get as much information as quickly as I could.  
   I submit if the President is guilty of obstruction of justice in his statements to Betty Currie, then clearly, clearly, he also must be guilty of perjury in his account of these events to the grand jury. The two findings are inextricably connected. One cannot reach the first conclusion without reaching the second. I believe it has been proven by clear and convincing evidence that the President committed perjury. And I might also add, I believe it has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence clearly shows that the President obstructed justice and then lied under oath about this obstruction in his grand jury testimony. 
   Now, on the third charge, I believe the evidence shows that the President further perjured himself in the grand jury to avoid a perjury charge in his prior deposition. This perjury had to do with the nature and details of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. 
   I know that many people have come to the well and have expressed concern about how we got here, what brings us here today. I share some of those concerns. Congresses, beginning with this one, will have to deal with the aftermath of this sorry affair: court cases  that have weakened the Presidency, a discredited independent counsel law. 
   You will forgive me if I point out that I was one of the 80-some Members of the House who voted against the independent counsel law when it came up--please forgive me for that aside. I voted against it because I share some of the same concerns we have heard expressed here today and yesterday. We also will have to deal with the Secret Service that is now vulnerable to subpoenas and Presidents who are vulnerable to civil right suits while in office. 
   These are important issues, but I submit they are issues not for today but rather for another day. None of us wanted to be here, but we are where we are, the facts are what they are, and we know what we know. What we know is that the President obstructed justice and committed perjury. What must we do with this President who has obstructed justice and then committed perjury? 
   Obstruction of justice and perjury strike at the very heart of our system of justice. By obstructing justice and committing perjury, the President has directly, illegally, and corruptly attacked a coequal branch of Government, the judiciary. It has been proven by clear and convincing evidence that the President of the United States has committed serious crimes. 
   But while I have found specific violations of law, it is not insignificant, in my final decision, that these specific criminal acts were committed within a larger context, a larger context of a documented pattern of indefensible behavior--behavior that shows a reckless disregard for the law and for the rights of others. 
   I have concluded that the President is guilty of behaving in a manner grossly incompatible with the proper function and purpose of his office. In 1974, the House Judiciary Committee used those precise words to define an impeachable offense. 
   I have also concluded that the President is guilty of the abuse or violation of a public trust. Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist No. 65, used those precise words to define an impeachable offense. What the President did is a serious offense against our system of government. It undermines the integrity of his office and it undermines the rule of law. 
   Here is what Thomas Paine said about the rule of law:  
   Let a crown be placed on the law by which the world may know that, so far as we approve of monarchy, in America the law is king.  
   The law is indeed king in America. There isn't one law for the powerful and one for the meek. That is what we mean when we say we are a ``nation of laws.'' We elect a President to enforce these laws. In fact, the Constitution commands that the President ``take care that the laws be faithfully executed.'' 
   How can we allow a man who has obstructed justice and committed perjury to remain as the chief law enforcement officer of our country? How can we call ourselves a nation of laws and leave a man in office who has flouted those laws? We define ourselves as a people not just by what we hold up, not just by what we revere, but we also define ourselves by what we tolerate. I submit that this is something we simply, as a people, cannot tolerate. 
   Mr. Chief Justice, I will vote to convict the President on both counts and to remove him from office.

    Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, today, it is with distress that I rise to submit and seek the Senate's approval on a concurrent resolution to express the deep concern of Congress over the deteriorating situation in Haiti. My colleagues from Florida, Senator GRAHAM; North Carolina, Senator HELMS; and Georgia, Senator COVERDELL have joined me in co-sponsoring this important and timely resolution. The Chairman of the House International Relations Committee, BENJAMIN GILMAN and Chairman of the House Select Intelligence Committee, PORTER GOSS intend to introduce this same resolution in the House very soon. 
   Mr. President, twelve days ago, Haiti's drawn out crisis took a very troubling turn when Haitian President Rene Preval announced that the Haitian National Assembly's term had expired and he would proceed to install a government by ``executive order.'' What he means, of course, is to ignore Haiti's parliament and rule by decree. 
   To understand the present situation, one must first comprehend the series of events in the past year and a half which have led to this unfortunate circumstance. The seriously flawed April 6, 1997 elections, which attracted less than 5 percent of the Haitian electorate, provoked the resignation in June 1997 of Prime Minister Rosney Smarth. For twenty months, a political deadlock has existed between President Preval and the majority party in parliament over the contested April elections and recently over President Preval's nominee for Prime Minister, Jacques Edouard Alexis. The political crisis has virtually paralyzed the government and delayed millions of dollars in international aid to Haiti. 
   During this period, the President dispatched a series of high-level emissaries, including the Secretary of State and the First Lady, to help defuse the crisis. Former National Security Advisor Anthony Lake has undertaken many missions to help mediate among the parties; most recently in the days leading up to the January 11 announcement. 
   Only on December 16 did the Haitian Senate ratify Mr. Alexis' credentials. On December 18, the Chamber of Deputies followed suit. Negotiations for the final approval of Mr. Alexis as Prime Minister, however, proved fruitless. President Preval and Mr. Alexis either failed or refused to secure agreement on a cabinet that would allow the prime minister to present his program to parliament for a vote of confidence. 
   This much is clear: Despite the extraordinary efforts of the Administration's emissaries, President Preval refused to accept any solution to this crisis that left Haiti's parliament in place. The present moment in Haiti is fraught with danger. Micha Gaillard, a Haitian social democrat who was closely associated with the internal efforts to restore then President Aristide to power in the early 1990's following the coup attempt against him wrote on January 16 that:  
   What is going on today, according to those who were there, is the same as happened in the years 1963-64 when Francios Duvalier was maneuvering to be proclaimed president-for-life. [This] ..... formula has been reviewed and updated. Here it is important that we ..... disavow and condemn far and wide the means employed--usurpations of power, intimidation, violence, and corruption--to subvert the functioning of all the democratic institutions, which are the sole guarantee against dictatorship.  
   The resolution I submit today puts the United States Congress on record that the irregular interruption of the democratic political institutional process in Haiti must, without further delay, be addressed through Organization of American States Resolution 1080. 
   In 1991 at Santiago, Chile, the Organization of American States approved Resolution 1080 specifically to deter irregular interruptions of the democratic political institutional process within countries having democratically elected governments. When invoked, a meeting of the Permanent Council of the OAS and the foreign ministers of the OAS member countries is in order to consider joint actions to bring about a return to democracy in that country. 
   Resolution 1080 has been invoked several times in the past decade. The OAS invoked the resolution in 1991 to determine appropriate actions in response to the coup d'etat against Haiti's elected President Aristide. It was also invoked in Guatemala in 1993 when Guatemala President Jorge Serrano dissolved the Parliament and the courts; in Paraguay in 1996 when a Paraguayan general attempted a coup d'etat against Paraguayan President Wasmosy; and in 1992 in Peru after President Alberto Fujimori announced the dissolution of the Congress and the courts. 
   Mr. President, I have visited Haiti seven times in the past three years. I am extremely concerned about the current situation there. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support and pass this important resolution.

   Mr. DEWINE.  Mr. President, it is an honor for me, today, to be introducing the Drug Free Century Act. This bill is cosponsored by Senator ABRAHAM, Senator ASHCROFT, Senator COVERDELL, Senator CRAIG, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, and the chairman of the Caucus on International Narcotics Control, Senator GRASSLEY. This legislation is truly a team effort. There are over a dozen Members of the Senate who have worked very extensively on this bill and I appreciate very much their work. This is really a team effort. This bill is a comprehensive approach to our antidrug effort, and it really is a continuation of the great work that was begun by Congress last year. 
   This legislation represents the continuation of those efforts that we began last year, a continuation of the efforts to reverse the dangerous trend of rising drug use in our country, particularly among our young people. According to data prepared as part of the Monitoring the Future Program funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, from 1992 to 1997 we saw an 80-percent increase in cocaine use among high school seniors, and a 100-percent increase in heroin use among high school seniors. 
   Other very serious trends related to drug use highlight the problems that have increased over the course of the last decade. Drug abuse related arrests for minors doubled between 1992 and 1996. Emergency room admissions related to heroin jumped 58 percent between 1992 and 1995. And, in the first half of 1995, methamphetamine related emergency room admissions were 321 percent higher compared to the first half of 1991. 
   This increase in drug use and criminal activity virtually wiped out the gains made in the previous decade. Just in the 4 years prior to 1992, the Office of National Drug Control Policy--the drug czar's office--reported a 25-percent reduction in overall drug use by adolescent Americans, and a 35-percent reduction in overall drug use. 
   Last year, Congressman BILL MCCOLLUM and I and other Members of the Senate and House took a close look at why our increasing investment in antidrug programs was not resulting in a decline in drug use among young people. One immediate problem that we found was a clear decline in resources and manpower devoted to reducing illegal drug imports by our Customs Service, the Coast Guard, and the Defense Department. In other words, our drug interdiction effort had been falling farther and farther behind. It had become less and less a percentage, a smaller percentage of our budget year after year. 
   As we all know, reducing drug use is a team effort at all levels of government: the Federal Government, the State government, the local government. However, international drug reduction, seizing or disrupting the flow of drugs before these drugs reach our country, is solely our responsibility. It is solely the Federal Government's responsibility. Over a 5-year period beginning in 1993, the Federal Government solely abdicated this responsibility. Fewer and fewer resources and man-hours were devoted to stopping drugs at the source or stopping them in transit. As a result, the volume of drugs coming into our country has never been higher, making illegal drugs too easy to find and too easy to buy. 
   To reverse this trend and to correct the imbalance, Congressman MCCOLLUM and I last year led a bipartisan, bicameral effort to pass the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. We passed it and the President signed it. We were joined in this initiative by Congressman and now Speaker DENNY HASTERT, by Senator COVERDELL, Senator GRAHAM of Florida, and many, many others. This new law provides a 3-year, $2.6 billion investment in our drug-fighting capabilities abroad. Through crop eradication and drug interdiction we will reduce the amount of drugs entering our country and, in turn, increase the price of drugs on the streets of America. 
   An even larger goal of this new law is to restore a balanced antidrug strategy, one that makes a clear commitment to all the elements of our strategy--treatment, education, domestic law enforcement, and drug interdiction. A balanced drug control strategy worked before, and we are ready to make it work again. 
   The Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act that we passed last year was one of several key initiatives passed by the Republican Congress. There is no doubt we are determined to turn the corner on drug use. Congressman ROB PORTMAN of Cincinnati, Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY, myself, and others worked to pass the Drug Free Communities Act, which directs Federal funds to community coalitions that educate children about the dangers of drugs. The 105th Congress also passed the Drug Demand Reduction Act, which will streamline existing Federal education and treatment programs and make these programs more accountable. We also passed the Drug Free Workplace Act, which provides grants to assist nonprofit organizations in promoting drug-free workplaces, 
   and encourages States to adopt cost-effective financial incentives, such as a reduction in worker's compensation premiums for drug-free workplaces. 
   Today, with the Drug Free Century Act that we are introducing, we will continue to make oversight and reform of our antidrug policies a top priority of this Congress. This bill is the beginning of a critical and comprehensive examination of our entire antidrug strategy. While we devoted most of last year to correcting the resource imbalances that we found in this strategy, we intend to devote the next 2 years to looking at the effectiveness of the very programs themselves. We also need to change current laws to crack down on the elements within the illegal drug industry.  
   The Drug Free Century Act is the first phase of this effort. It addresses all elements of our antidrug strategy, and it is a comprehensive strategy that we are presenting today--education, treatment, law enforcement, and drug interdiction. 
   It is my hope that as we examine our drug strategy through meetings and hearings, we will build on the foundation of the legislation that we are introducing this morning. 
   First, the Drug Free Century Act contains much-needed reforms in our international criminal laws. It would improve extradition procedures for those who flee justice for drug crimes by prohibiting fugitives from benefiting from fugitive status. It would crack down on illegal money-transmitting businesses. It would punish money launderers who conduct their business through foreign banks. And it would enable greater global cooperation in the fight against international crime. 
   Mr. President, these provisions, advocated by the chairman of our caucus on international narcotics control, Senator GRASSLEY, are designed to disrupt and dismantle the drug lords' criminal infrastructure. And like the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act we passed in the last Congress, these provisions would make the drug business far more costly and far more dangerous. 
   Our legislation also authorizes additional funding for our eradication and interdiction operations and calls on the administration to meet the funding goals we set last year in the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. The new interdiction initiatives outlined in this bill are designed to supplement last year's legislation and came about as a direct result of my visits and the visits of other Members of the Senate and the House to the transit zones in the Caribbean, as well as the source countries--Peru and Colombia. These visits reconfirmed, in my mind, what statistics had already told us: Seizing or destroying a ton of cocaine outside our borders is more cost effective than seizing the same quantity at the point of sale. It just makes good common sense. 
   Our legislation also addresses domestic reduction efforts. It would increase penalties for certain drug offenses committed in the presence of a child. It would call on the Drug Enforcement Administration to develop a plan for the safe and speedy cleanup of methamphetamine laboratories in the United States. I know this latter issue is of great concern to my colleague from Missouri, Senator ASHCROFT, who was successful last year in increasing penalties for those involved in meth labs here in the United States. 
   Mr. President, the bill also includes Senator ABRAHAM's legislation to increase mandatory minimum sentencing 
   requirements for powder cocaine offenses. 
   Our bill sets a foundation for what I hope will be a comprehensive initiative to reduce the demand for drugs, especially among our young people. The bill includes Senator COVERDELL's initiative to protect children and teachers from drug-related school violence and Senator GRASSLEY's legislation to strengthen the parent and family movement to teach children and society about the dangers of drugs. 
   This bill, frankly, is a first step. I expect we will see other important antidrug bills that we would want to roll into this larger comprehensive bill, and we will do that as the time comes. For example, I am working on legislation to clarify that juvenile facilities should be eligible for jail-based and aftercare drug treatment programs and provide coordinated services for early mental health and substance abuse screening for juveniles. The latter initiative is based on an effort underway in Hamilton County, OH, an initiative and effort I have personally looked at on a number of occasions. In Hamilton County, OH, the courts are working with all the relevant county agencies to offer a coordinated service delivery system for at-risk youth. By bringing these resources together, Mr. President, we can ensure that young people in need of help will get the right kind of assistance. 
   I believe in a balanced counterdrug strategy. I made it clear in the past Congress that I strongly support our continued commitment in demand reduction and law enforcement programs. We need to invest in all these elements to have success, and that is why we are today introducing this bill--to demonstrate that we intend to find ways to improve all elements of our comprehensive antidrug strategy. 
   Combined with the efforts begun last year, the Drug Free Century Act represents a turning point in a decade of increased youth delinquency and drug use. With this legislation, we are sending a clear signal that we intend to change course and begin the next decade and, yes, the next century, on the road to eliminating the scourge of illegal drugs in this country.

   Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, today I join with Senators ABRAHAM, SANTORUM, SPECTER, HOLLINGS, BYRD, HUTCHINSON and others to introduce the Continued Dumping or Subsidy Offset Act. This legislation is designed to ensure that our domestic producers can compete freely and fairly in global markets. This bill is a top priority for me and my fellow cosponsors--not only because we believe it is good policy, but also because it is needed to respond to the current import dumping crisis in our steel industry. 
   As my colleagues know, the Tariff Act of 1930 gives the President the authority to impose duties and fines on imports that are being dumped in U.S. markets, or subsidized by foreign governments. Our bill would take the 1930 Act one step further. Currently, revenues raised through import duties and fines go to the U.S. Treasury. Under our bill, duties and fines would be transferred to injured U.S. companies as compensation for damages caused by dumping or subsidization. 
   We believe this extra step is necessary. Current law simply has not been strong enough to deter unfair trading practices. In some cases, foreign producers are willing to risk the threat of paying U.S. antidumping and countervailing duties out of the profits of dumping. 
   Current law also does not contain a mechanism to help injured U.S. industries recover from the harmful effects of foreign dumping and subsidization. These foreign practices have reduced the ability of our injured domestic industries to reinvest in plant, equipment, people, R&D, technology or to maintain or restore health care and pension benefits. The end result is this: continued dumping or subsidization jeopardizes renewed investment and prevents additional reinvestment from being made. 
   The current steel dumping crisis is the latest sobering example of why our legislation, among others, is needed to better enforce fair trade. Because of massive dumping, steel imports are at an all-time high. According to the American Iron and Steel Institute, 4.1 net tons of steel were imported in the month of October--that's the second highest monthly total ever, and is 56% higher than the previous year. 
   This surge in imports is having a direct impact on our own steel industry. In November, U.S. steel mills shipped nearly 7.4 million net tons of steel in November of last year--more than one million tons below what was shipped one year earlier. We have seen U.S. steel's industrial utilization rate fall from 93.1% in March of 1998 to 73.9% in January of 1999. And most troubling of all, approximately 10,000 jobs have been lost in our steel industry since last year. More layoffs are certain. Whether these jobs will ever be restored is uncertain. This is a genuine crisis for the communities in the Ohio River Valley and in other communities across the country. 
   This is not a case of being on the wrong side of a highly competitive market. Today's U.S. steel industry is a lean, efficient industry--a world leader thanks to restructuring and millions of dollars in modernization. U.S. steelworkers are the best and most productive in the world. In fact, America's workers devote the fewest manpower hours per ton of steel. 
   Simply being the best is not enough against foreign governments that either erect barriers to keep U.S. steel out, or subsidize their exports to distort prices. That's why we have trade laws designed to promote fair trade. However, it's clear that our current trade policies aren't working. Current law did not deter foreign steel producers from dumping their products in our country. These foreign producers have done the math. They have made a calculated decision that the risk of duties is a price they are willing to pay in return for the higher global market share they have gained by chipping away at the size and strength of our nation's steel industry. 
   It's time we impose a heavier price on dumping and subsidization. The Continued Dumping or Subsidization Offset Act would accomplish this goal. It would transfer the duties and fines imposed on foreign producers directly to their U.S. competitors. Under our bill, foreign steel producers would get a double hit from dumping: they would have to pay a duty, and in turn, see that duty go directly to aid U.S. steel producers. 
   In order to counter the adverse effects of foreign dumping and subsidization on U.S. industries, Congress 
   should pass this bipartisan bill. 
   The steel crisis also has amplified the need for additional improvements in our trade laws, as well as tougher enforcement of existing laws. Last October, many of us in Congress came together to offer an early New Year's resolution for 1999: to stand up for steel. 
   Any crisis requires leadership. That's why Congress asked the President to make a New Year's Resolution of his own--one that would honor a pledge he made in 1992 to strongly enforce U.S. antidumping laws. Specifically, Congress asked the President for an action plan no later than January 5th--a plan that would end the distortion and disruption in global steel markets, as well as the disappearance of jobs and opportunity in U.S. steel plants. It was a call for presidential leadership.  
   On January 8th, the President released a plan that fell far short of what we hoped. It was a plan that showed a reluctance to fully utilize our laws to ensure free and fair trade. It did not recommend any trade legislation to better protect U.S. industry from dumping. As a result, it sends a dangerous signal to foreign governments that dumping will not meet with a swift response from the United States. 
   I am concerned the President has not fully grasped the magnitude of this problem. In the past few months, I have visited with Ohio Valley steel producers and workers, including a number of the hundreds laid off because of foreign dumping. Their message was the same: the surge in steel imports represents a crisis of historic proportions.  
   The root of the current import crisis is the financial distress that plagues Asia and Russia, which has created a worldwide oversupply of steel. While foreign consumption of steel has nearly dried up, America's strong economy and open markets have made the United States a prime target for exporters. We are dedicated to assisting these economies--so we can avoid a global downturn. But turning a blind eye toward our steel workers is the wrong way to do it. We simply cannot afford to sacrifice the US steel industry and thousands of American jobs in a desperate attempt to prop up faulty foreign economies. This approach simply will not work.  
   Although the Commerce Department has initiated an investigation that could result in duties imposed against foreign steel, the President could pursue a number of options to reduce steel imports: He could begin serious and aggressive bilateral negotiations with countries that dump steel; initiate a ``201'' petition with the International Trade Commission if he believes steel imports pose a substantial threat to domestic industry; or take unilateral trade action, including quotas and tariffs, under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. 
   The President's plan does not take any of these options. Instead, it treats the symptoms of dumping--declining profits and unemployment--rather than attack the disease itself. The damage from this disease has already been done. Absent tough action to address this dumping directly makes it more difficult for U.S. producers to regain their declining market share, and most important, to restore the jobs that have been lost. 
   Congress can insist on tough action by the President by passing legislation that will further discourage unfair trade practices. Passing the Continued Dumping or Subsidization Offset Act would be a good start. In addition, I will be joining with Senator ARLEN SPECTER of Pennsylvania to introduce legislation that would lower the statutory threshold for the International Trade Commission (ITC) to find injury caused by imports and establish a steel import permit and licensing program, allowing domestic industry access to critical import data more quickly. 
   Ultimately, we cannot achieve free and fair markets on a global scale unless our laws work to encourage all competitors to play by the rules. And ultimately, congressional action alone is no substitute for presidential leadership. That's why Congress and the American steel community need to keep the pressure on. In fact, thousands of steel workers from the Ohio Valley are arriving in our nation's capitol in a massive call for presidential leadership. It's time our President took a stand for fair trade. It's time for our President to stand up for steel.

   Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, recently Major General Richard C. Alexander of Ohio retired as the Adjutant General of the Ohio National Guard. I rise today to pay tribute to this remarkable individual and dedicated public servant. 
   General Alexander's military career began in 1954 when he joined the Marine Corps and served honorably until 1958, when he was discharged with the rank of Sergeant. As a native of Cleveland, General Alexander returned to Ohio and enlisted in the Ohio National Guard and served in Battery C, 1st Missile Battalion, 137th Artillery. 
   Continuing his career, General Alexander completed the National Guard State Officer School and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant on May 6th, 1965. Following the completion of many advanced military education courses including graduating from the U.S. Army War College and U.S. Army Command and General Staff Course, General Alexander rose through the ranks within the Ohio National Guard and was selected to serve as the Ohio Adjutant General in December 1987. 
   When I was the Lieutenant Governor of Ohio, I became aware of how fortunate the citizens of Ohio were to have an individual such as Richard Alexander serving as the Adjutant General of the Ohio National Guard. During his tenure as the Adjutant General, he has met many challenges that have tasked the full scope of his ability to manage a citizen soldier force in a world environment of uncertainty and changing global priorities. 
   The Ohio National Guard has found itself a witness, participant and beneficiary to the many changes and successes that occurred under the leadership of General Alexander. During the Persian Gulf War, more than 1,600 Ohio National Guard members were activated in support of military operations. In 1993, the Ohio National Guard was called upon to respond to an inmate riot at the Lucasville Prison. Since that time Ohioans repeatedly have called upon the services of the Ohio National Guard to respond to various natural disasters involving flood recovery and various levels of snow emergencies. I have seen first hand the tremendous service and professionalism of the National Guard when I toured areas of the state that were damaged by the rain and flooding in the Spring of 1997. 
   In addition to assistance at the local level, defense officials repeatedly have called upon the services of Ohio National Guard members to supplement and support our national military defense in a variety of missions throughout the world. The strong leadership that has been provided by General Alexander has benefitted not only the Ohio National Guard, it has benefitted all Ohioans and our Nation. These leadership skills were recognized by the National Guard Association of the United States, which appointed General Alexander to the position of President of the association in 1996. 
   It is with a degree of sadness that I find myself saying ``farewell'' to such a strong leader and personal friend. General Alexander has served his country ably and honorably for the past forty-four years. The positive impact he has had on the lives of Ohioans is immeasurable and his compassion for people and pride in serving in the military epitomize the true meaning of the words--Duty, Honor, Country. 
   I join with all Ohioans in expressing my appreciation for a job well done to Major General Richard C. Alexander. I wish General Alexander, his wife, LaVera, and his entire family all the very best. Indeed, General Alexander deserves the very best because he gave the very best--to his family, his state, and his country.
