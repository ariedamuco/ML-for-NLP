    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize and honor the two-month anniversary of the death of Mark Lewis Gillming, who passed away Sunday, October 8, 2000, in a car accident in Springfield, Missouri, on his way to church with his cousin, John Lingo. 
   Mark Gillming grew up in my home town of Springfield, Missouri, and was a senior at Hillcrest High School to be graduated with the class of 2001. As a student, he excelled in both academics and athletics, becoming an honors student and being involved in track and football. Mark exhibited a great presence on the Hillcrest High football team, both in action and in spirit. 
   Mark's life touched many lives, far beyond his school into his community. He was well liked by his peers and had great influence on those who knew him during his short life. His positive outlook enriched those around him. 
   Mark was the son of Pastor and Mrs. Kenneth D. Gillming. He was a member of Cherry Street Baptist Church where his father is a pastor. Mark was a leader in their youth ministry. His Christian faith was a central part of his life. He loved his family, friends and most important of all, he loved Christ. Today, I join his family and friends in remembrance of Mark Gillming, whose demeanor and character were a blessing to those who knew him. He will be missed greatly.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is with a sense of deep gratitude that I have this opportunity to speak on the Senate floor for one last time before I conclude my term in the Senate. There are few compensating factors for the lame duck session in which we find ourselves, but one is the opportunity for one who has lost an election to come back and make a few last remarks. This sort of makes this like home. At home I always have the last word--``Yes, dear.'' And to have a last word here is a pleasing thing for me. 
   Obviously, I am deeply grateful, and, as I think about the opportunity I have enjoyed to be in the Senate, it is a set of thoughts that are characterized by gratitude. I am grateful to God that we are created as individuals with the capacity to shape the tomorrows in which we live. If freedom has a definition, it is that--that we can change things. And, obviously, we want to change things for the better. 
   America respects that understanding of the creation and how we act as individuals with a Government that represents the people as agents of change, making decisions about the kind of community we want to have. Any of us who has the opportunity to represent fellow citizens obviously is in a position to do great things and to enjoy the ability to fulfill what God has destined for us to do, and that is to shape the tomorrows in which we live. 
   I want to thank the citizens of Missouri first. It is a community that I love and that I respect. Janet and I live in Missouri, obviously because I was raised there, but by our choice. I have had the opportunity to serve the people of Missouri for 33 years. I began teaching in Southwest Missouri State University as a way of serving the people of the State of Missouri. And then, one of the most important mentors in my life, and one of the individuals who perhaps represents what Missouri is and what Missouri stands for more than any other single individual, the senior Senator of this State, Senator KIT BOND. 
   He accorded me the opportunity to serve as the State auditor of Missouri when he vacated that office upon his election as Governor. I had first offered myself to the people of Missouri to serve in the U.S. Congress, and they had expressed their profound affection for me, indicating that I should stay in Missouri and not go to the Congress. KIT BOND, recognizing that, appointed me to be the State auditor of Missouri. 
   It began a marvelous set of opportunities for me for which I am grateful in every respect. I served as the State auditor for 2 years. I later served as the attorney general of Missouri after a short period of time as an assistant attorney general in Missouri, and that was a notable experience. I had the wonderful privilege of sharing an office with a now Justice of the Supreme Court, Clarence Thomas. We were in the same room together for 16 months. That is a historic item that I did not understand the history of at the time, but I certainly do now. 
   I had the chance, after serving 8 years as attorney general, of going on to be Governor of the State of Missouri for 8 years. What a marvelous opportunity it was to work with the community, to work with people, to shape our community in a way which was constructive and reinforced the things in which we believed. 
   This past election obviously was a disappointment for me, but I am not disappointed in the people of Missouri. The tragedy of this election, the death of my opponent and his son in a plane crash of unspeakable disaster, was one that the Missouri community responded to with two values and virtues that I cherish about our community--the value and virtue of compassion. I want America and Missouri to be a place of compassion. 
   What a tremendous and wonderful thing it is when people are compassionate and share the feelings of each other, and the value of respect, particularly respect for those who have gone on and have been of service. In expressing those values, the people of Missouri decided they would honor the deceased Governor by voting in his behalf and in his stead in the election rather than voting for me, and I respect them for that and I honor them for that. It is a great community. They are a community to be loved and respected, and I profoundly love and respect them. 
   I wish well Mrs. CARNAHAN who will succeed me in this seat in the Senate. I thank her for coming by my office yesterday. I hope she is treated with kindness. I told her yesterday that I was pleased to see her and have the opportunity to communicate with her, and I reminded her yesterday that 30 days from now she will be my Senator, and I want her to do well. 
   I thank, in addition to Missourians, my staff. I am delighted the Senate has agreed to allow them all to be here on the floor of the Senate during these remarks. When I came to the Senate, my staff and I decided there were values and principles we wanted to honor in everything we did. We wanted those values and principles to transcend circumstances. We wanted them to be controlling factors of our conduct. So we spent some time together. 
   Early in my time in the Senate, I came to the floor of the Senate and placed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD this statement of service, commitment, and dedication that each member of my staff joined me in formulating. This one hangs near the desk of  Annie Billings in my office. I asked each staff member to sign 
   this commitment and then I signed the commitment, too, so each one of these items contains the signature both of the staff, the real workers of the Senate, and the Senator, at least in this case, who relied so heavily on their work. 
   I did not want to set the standards for my office absent the staff's participation because I believed the staff would help me reflect profoundly the values of the people of Missouri--and, indeed, they did. Each member of my staff took the pledge, the pledge that is contained in this statement of service, commitment, and dedication--high standards of service. 
   Our pledge states, and I will read part of it:  
   We dedicate ourselves to principled public policy. We believe that Americans are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, and among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The power we exercise is granted by Missourians and the American people; we serve to secure their rights. Our commitment is to respect diverse political views and serve all people by whose consent we govern. 
   As people of liberty reach for opportunity and achieve greatness, our Nation prospers. A government that lives beyond its means and reaches beyond its limits violates our basic liberties, and the Nation suffers. We dedicate ourselves to quality service. America's future will be determined by the character and productivity of our people. In this respect, we seek to lead by our example. We will strive to lead with humility and honesty. We will work with energy and spirit. We will represent the American people with loyalty and integrity. Our standard of productivity is accuracy, courtesy, efficiency, integrity, validity, and timeliness. We hold that these principles are a sacred mandate. We take responsibility for these standards.  
   I thank my staff for helping me formulate that format for our service, and I thank them for, in every instance I know, pursuing the fulfillment of that format and formulation for public service. It is an honor to serve with individuals who are in pursuit of principle, and my staff has been consistent in that respect. 
   We have literally in the last Congress had over 550,000 constituent contacts with our office, to which we have made millions of responses because frequently we can acknowledge the contact and then provide additional service or otherwise follow up. There have been 110,000 specific cases in which individuals had dealings with the Federal Government, and we were able to facilitate those dealings. So I thank the staff. I thank them for their dedication to principle and for understanding that working with humility and integrity and industry and timeliness is a way of fulfilling a sacred trust in the people of my State. 
   I thank the Members of the Senate. This is an institution that is unique. The function of the Senate is a very frustrating one, and real fulfillment probably is found in the friendships of the Senate more than in the function of this body. I have to say that this opportunity for my service in the Senate has been one that has been a fulfilling experience, in sum because we have been able to achieve things that are very important, in other respects as a result of the relationships that come with the friendships in the Senate. 
   I have the very pleasing opportunity to think of myself as a friend of each Member of the Senate, and I am grateful for that. I am particularly grateful for the leadership that has been kind to me. For Senator LOTT--and, of course, I have had a lot of fun with Senator LOTT as a Singing Senator. That has ruined more than 1 day for other people--but the leader has been kind to me in every respect. His demeanor in leading this body is one of kindness to every Member. 
   Senator NICKLES--I had the privilege of nominating him as assistant majority leader, and I respect greatly his contribution. 
   I see my friends in the Senate today--Senator GRAMM, Senator MCCONNELL, in addition, of course, to the senior Senator from Missouri about whose service I have already remarked, and my colleague, Senator SANTORUM, with whom I have had the opportunity to fight for things in which we believe. These are all very pleasing items. 
   In particular, I thank Members of the Senate for participating in very important legislative achievements that are a part of what I believe has been important for me to do while I have been here. 
   I had the privilege of filing legislation to protect the Social Security trust fund, called the Social Security lockbox legislation. I believe I was the first to do that in the Senate. Senator ABRAHAM, Senator DOMENICI, Senator SANTORUM, and I worked awfully hard for that concept. It is now part of the Senate rules, and it has guided the way in which we have appropriated resources. 
   The Medicare lockbox passed the Senate. I am grateful for that opportunity and was grateful that Senator CONRAD, on the other side, was interested in making sure we put the right framework around the Medicare trust fund so that it was not raided for other purposes. 
   An effort to repeal the Social Security earnings tax--the test on the Social Security earnings--which we were able to achieve in April of this year under the leadership of Chairman ROTH, and signed by the President, I had the privilege of being the Senate sponsor of that measure. There were about 45 Senators who joined together, but there was even overwhelming help from people on the other side of the aisle, such as Senators LANDRIEU, FEINSTEIN, BAUCUS, DORGAN, LIEBERMAN, and LINCOLN, in addition to members of this caucus. 
   A big problem in the State of Missouri has been methamphetamines. Over and over again, I have worked to strengthen the law regarding methamphetamines, both with my colleague, the senior Senator from Missouri, KIT BOND, and with others who have also been concerned about this problem. 
   Senator FEINSTEIN's State of California, similarly, has been afflicted with the curse of methamphetamines, and she was always helpful in this respect. And we could not have done it without Senator HATCH, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, on which I have had the privilege of serving. 
   May I digress for just a second to say I have had the privilege of serving under Chairman HATCH. I respect him and am grateful for his leadership on the committee. There are a tough set of circumstances that always involves us in the tensions of give-and-take, and he has masterfully negotiated the shoals in that particular arena. 
   Of course, I should mention as well JOHN MCCAIN's leadership on the Commerce Committee, on which I have had the privilege of serving, and his graciousness to me and kindness to me and his direction in a committee which has achieved massive revisions in the kind of liberating renovation which has provided tremendous energy to American industry. The revision in the telecommunications law which we were able to achieve is a result of excellent leadership. It has changed the dynamics of the world's economy, not to mention the United States. 
   But I go back to some of the specific legislation. 
   This year, we enacted legislation to provide funding so that the survivors of slain law enforcement officers could have the opportunity to get education and training so that they could in some way begin to undertake an effort on their own behalf, which the law enforcement officer, slain in the line of duty, was otherwise prepared to help them with. I am thankful to Senator SPECTER and Senator COLLINS and Senator BIDEN for working and being so helpful to me in that respect. 
   Tougher penalties for gun crimes: When I put the amendment into Senator HELMS' law, which was moving through this body, for tougher criminal penalties for those who use guns in the commission of a crime, it could not have happened without 
   Senator HELMS' measure. Of course, as the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, on which I have had the opportunity to serve, I have learned to respect Senator HELMS, his gentlemanly character, and his generous and judicious approach to running the committee. 
   I worked with BILL FRIST on curtailing weapons in schools and making sure we could provide penalties for those who carried guns into schools or maintained guns at schools. It could not have happened without him. 
   I think of the late Senator Paul Coverdell and his efforts on education flexibility, sending resources to the State. I was thrilled to have the opportunity to work with him and Senator WYDEN and Senator FRIST on that legislation. It was very important legislation across the aisle, but it would have an impact across America.  
   Then on the legislation to end food and medicine embargoes, I think this is a major step forward for America--good foreign policy, good farm policy, and expresses the values of the people of this country. Working with Senator DODD and Senator DORGAN, and on our side, Senator HAGEL and Senator ROBERTS--and Senator WELLSTONE joined in that effort--the Senate overwhelmingly worked together to get that done. Now that it is a part of the law of this country, I think it is a major step in the right direction. 
   I was pleased to be able to work with TOM DASCHLE, the minority leader of the Senate, to make sure that the U.S. Trade Representative had a full-time, permanent ag ambassador so agricultural interests were not neglected when negotiations were made regarding trade. 
   Over and over again, I think of things that happened this last year, such as when HCFA, the Health Care Financing Administration, announced new rules for reimbursing cancer care treatments. I thought of the millions of people around the country who lived in rural areas who would find their care curtailed. Senator MACK of Florida worked with me to make sure we were able to begin the process of changing the law. And the process was so successful that HCFA changed its rules and regulations. Sometimes that is the way we make progress. 
   There are the big things we have done. Some of these are a litany of things that are more incidental. There are the things such as welfare reform. I think of PHIL GRAMM's work, Senator GRASSLEY's work, and Senator ROTH's work there. This was early during my term. I had the opportunity to craft a provision called charitable choice that welcomed nongovernmental agencies into the process so that we could begin to remediate the pathology of welfare in the country, abusive welfare, by making sure that we helped all of America address this problem, not just America's government. 
   It was a wonderful thing to see its broad bipartisan acceptance. It was very pleasing to see in this last Presidential election that Governor George W. Bush of Texas made this a point of what he would provide in the welfare arena, as did Vice President GORE.  
   I had the privilege of chairing several subcommittees. I am grateful for the opportunity to have done so. In particular, with Senator FEINGOLD, I chaired two subcommittees. I chaired the Africa Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee and the Constitution Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
   I have to say, I have never had a better working relationship with any individual than with Senator FEINGOLD in that respect. Never did he ask me to do something that I thought was unfair and that I could not do and that I would not do. In each instance, when I offered him an opportunity to participate in a broad range of what the subcommittees were doing, he fulfilled his responsibilities with fairness, with dignity, with respect, and with the public interest as the uppermost criteria. I am grateful for that. 
   Obviously, I do not want to overstate what it means to have been a Singing Senator, but it was a tremendous opportunity to spend time on Tuesday mornings, before the workday began, rehearsing and seeking perfection--elusive perfection--which never attended our efforts. But we never lost our faith for it. 
   I thank the Singing Senators for allowing me to be a part. We did travel over a good bit of the United States from one time to another. We raised, I think, well over a half million dollars for the Alzheimer's research effort. It is one of those things that otherwise provided a little squirt of WD-40, where the friction might otherwise have made things less pleasant. It lubricated the relationships and gave us a great opportunity. 
   I have recited a lot of important things that went into law. I am very close to concluding my remarks. I just want to say this: I do not want anyone to think the law is the most important thing in America. 
   What happens in families, in churches and civic organizations, the values people believe in their hearts, is more important than the laws we write on the books. 
   I don't want anyone to ever believe the laws are not important. We do have to have laws that tell us what the baselines are of our culture and, if you fall below those, we will punish you, what the framework is in which we operate. But no culture ever really achieves greatness by everyone just being at the baseline. Cultures achieve greatness not when people just stay out of jail but when they soar to their very highest and best, not when they just accommodate our threshold of the lowest and the least. 
   The greatness of this great Nation is to be found in the hearts of the American people more than in the books of the American Government. But those items of policy and framework that we have put there guard the opportunity for greatness that comes from the heart of the American people. So our law and Constitution and the decisions we make are fundamentally important. It has been a great privilege for me to be involved. 
   I thank one last group of people, and that is my family. If we didn't believe in these very important principles, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to ask them to make the sacrifices they have made. My wife Janet has been willing to dislocate her career time after time when changes in my life have moved me from one place to another. She has taught at Howard University in Washington, DC, on the faculty for the last 5 years now. I am grateful for that. My son, when I first came to the Senate, was still in high school, and we divided our family for that year so he could finish. A high school senior generally likes a dad around. I am not sure I would say he always wants me around, but there was a little bit of a dislocation of the family. 
   But dislocations are worth our effort. Perhaps the most important thing my father taught me was that there were more important things than me, and the ability to make sacrifices to get good things done is important. When we understand there are some things that are more important than we are, we have a willingness to make sacrifices. I thank my family profoundly--my wife Janet, my sons Jay and Andy, my daughter Martha, my son-in-law Jim, and my grandson Jimmy. I thank them for being willing to understand that when there are things more important than we are, we can sacrifice those things and recognize in our lives our willingness to set aside our personal agenda for the public good. 
   It is my hope that if and when I ever have an opportunity to serve again, I will be able to serve in accordance with those principles, with the values that my staff and I had the privilege of developing, always understanding that the public good is an objective well worth pursuing, not just pursuing but well worth sacrificing for, because when we sacrifice for each other, we communicate the most important values of our culture, that we love and respect one another. 
   I thank the Chair for the opportunity. I know he has foregone the time limit on my behalf. I thank each Member of the Senate, this very important body in preserving liberty, for its courtesy and kindness to me and for this last opportunity to speak.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Kennerly Elementary School, in St. Louis, MO. Kennerly is one of nine schools to be named recently to the 2000 National Schools of Character in recognition of its exemplary work to encourage the social, ethical and academic development of its students through character education. 
   Sponsored by the Character Education Partnership, National Schools of Character is an annual awards program recognizing K-12 schools and districts demonstrating outstanding character education initiatives and yielding positive results in student behavior, school environment, and academic performance. Kennerly exemplifies its school motto ``Friends Learning Together'' by involving students, teachers, parents, and the community. Included in Kennerly's character education programs are a Character Plus Team, a Character Club, and a Character Cabinet. 
   As a strong supporter of character education, I am pleased to see that Kennerly's Character Education program has produced great results, both in academics, and in the social climate of the school. Academic performance has increased, and discipline problems have decreased. I have fought to increase the amount of funding available for character education because schools like Kennerly have demonstrated that character education programs increase the value of education for all our children and enhance our communities. It is truly a privilege for students to attend schools like Kennerly. 
   So, I extend my congratulations to Kennerly Elementary School in St. Louis, Missouri, for its outstanding character education programs.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, issues surrounding possession and ownership of firearms have been some of the most divisive in this legislative session and political season. Americans hold a wide range of differing opinions regarding gun rights and responsibilities, and the proper balance of those rights against the need for public safety. But, despite the larger differences, most Americans agree that there are common sense actions that can be implemented to protect the rights of law-abiding citizens while preventing those with criminal records or histories of violent behavior from access to firearms. 
   I support the provision in federal law that prohibits certain people from owning or possessing firearms. Under current law, certain categories of persons are unable to purchase guns. These include felons, fugitives from justice, illegal aliens, the mentally incompetent, and persons convicted of crimes of domestic violence. These proscriptions protect law-abiding citizens from those who have demonstrated they cannot use firearms responsibly. This law protects law-abiding gun owners because the fewer people who criminally misuse guns, the less sentiment that there will be to impose more restrictions on lawful gun owners. 
   In 1994, the Congress passed the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act that instituted a system to check whether a prospective gun purchaser, prior to the transfer of a firearms, is ineligible to possess a gun because he or she falls into one of the nine prohibited categories. The permanent phase (phase II) of the Brady Act--that went into effect November 30, 1998--requires an instant background check be done on the buyer when a firearm is purchased from a licensed dealer. Either the State or the Federal Government conducts this check. This is to ensure that those prohibited by federal law from owning guns do not purchase them. It makes sense, and although the legislation was passed before I arrived in the Senate, I support the instant background check. 
   Since the implementation of the Brady Act in 1994, through the end of calendar year 1999, 22 million background checks have been conducted on potential firearms purchasers. Of that 22 million, more than 536,000 individuals were determined ineligible. And since phase II of the Brady Act went into effect in 1998--mandating Instant Background Checks in place of checks with a mandatory waiting period--more than 8.6 million requests for instant checks were received, with 2.4 percent of applicants being denied. 
   I would note that unfortunately, this Administration has chosen not to prosecute those felons for attempting to buy a gun, which is a federal crime. Federal prosecutions have fallen at the same time background checks have given law enforcement a reliable tool for tracking down and locking up criminals trying to buy guns. In 1993, the Clinton-Gore Administration prosecuted 633 people for trying to illegally purchase a gun. That fell to 279 in 1997 and rose to 405 in 1999. From 1994 to 1999, the Administration prosecuted an average of 404 defendants for violations of the gun purchasing law annually--a 36-percent drop from 1993. Obviously, we 
   need to prosecute felons who are attempting to illegally buy guns. 
   But there is another hole in the current law. While the federal database of state criminal records is fairly comprehensive, the same cannot be said of  mental incompetency records. Forty-one states, including the State of Missouri, do not permit records of the criminally insane to be searched prior to a firearm sale. This is a travesty. The result of this loophole is that individuals prohibited from purchasing firearms because of mental impairment are allowed to slip through the cracks--often with tragic results. 
   In April of this year, the New York Times did a series of four articles on what they termed as ``rampage'' killings--multiple-victim killings that were not primarily domestic or connected to a robbery or gang. The New York Times examined 102 killers in 100 rampage attacks in a computer-assisted study including the shooting in 1999 at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, a day-trading firm in Atlanta, and a church in Fort Worth, Texas. The New York Times study found that at least half of the killers showed signs of serious mental health problems, and at least eight had been involuntarily committed. These articles highlight the difficulty of enforcing the provision of our gun control laws that prohibits people who have been involuntarily committed to mental institutions from buying a handgun. 
   For example, Gracie Verduzco, was a 35-year-old paranoid schizophrenic who believed she had a transmitter in her left ear that received messages from a satellite and had been involuntarily hospitalized in Arizona twice. In addition, she had been committed to a mental hospital by a judge in the District of Columbia after she had threatened President Clinton. Despite three involuntary commitments, she was able to buy a .38-caliber revolver at a pawnshop in Tucson, Arizona by lying on her gun application. She used it to kill one person and wound four others there on May 21, 1998. 
   According to the Justice Department, about 150,000 people a year are committed to mental institutions by court order in the United States. In total, there are now perhaps 2.7 million people who have been involuntarily committed at some point in their lives and are therefore barred by the federal law from buying a handgun. In response to some of the highly publicized cases, authorities in nine states have allowed law enforcement agencies some form of access to mental health records. And the number of ineligible individuals who attempt to purchase guns has been alarming. According to the Illinois State police, 3,699 people were turned down in Illinois from 1996 to 1998, when records showed they had been either voluntarily or involuntarily committed within the last 5 years, the legal test under Illinois law. An additional 5,585 people who were hospitalized from 1996 to 1998 were found to already possess gun permits, which as a result, were revoked. 
   The New York Times reported, ``But at the national level, as in most states, there has been no comparable effort to create access to court commitment records for gun checks. That lack of action is in stark contrast to the long effort by gun control groups and the Clinton administration in winning enactment of the Brady law to create databases screening out convicted felons, who like the involuntarily committed, were barred by the 1968 law from handgun purchases.'' 
   If we are serious about reducing the criminal misuse of firearms, this has to change. Federal law already makes the purchase or possession of firearms illegal for people the courts deem mentally incompetent, but the law is difficult, if not impossible to enforce because mental-health information is not currently part of computerized, instant background checks. That's why today I introduce the Records Access Improvement Act, to encourage states to make certain mental health information available to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). 
   At present, the instant check system is administered jointly by the states and by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In 15 states, state agencies serve as points of contact (POCs), and conduct full background checks for both long guns and handguns. In 11 states, state agencies conduct partial background checks for handguns only. In POC states, federal firearm licensees contact the state agency, rather than the FBI. In non-POC States, Federal firearm licensees contact the FBI directly through the NICS system. Over half of the applications for firearm transfers were checked directly by the FBI, while the remainder of applications were checked by State or local agencies. 
   In February 2000, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) reported that the identification of non-felons ineligible to purchase firearms is likely to remain problematic under NICS. The Bureau of Justice Statistics stated that new enabling statutes may be required to identify and access such information. 
   The legislation I am introducing today is such a statute. Specifically, this bill will encourage states to make the information available to the NICS system by tying the receipt of grants made under the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund to the provision of relevant data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This bill will ensure that the NICS system is as complete as possible, so that the Instant Background Check will be as reliable as possible. The Federal gun law--the Brady Act--makes it clear that certain persons are ineligible to purchase firearms. It is time that we take the steps necessary for enforcement of the law. This bill is a giant step toward reaching that goal.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I rise with a deep sense of sadness. As you all are aware, on Monday night Missouri's Governor, Mel Carnahan, was killed in a tragic plane crash. Also killed in the crash were the Governor's son, Randy Carnahan, and the Governor's long-time aide, Chris Sifford. My wife Janet and I join with all Missourians in mourning these deaths. We express our deepest sympathies to the Carnahan and Sifford families. We will continue to pray that God will grant these families comfort, healing, and strength in this time of great sorrow. This is a time when the Carnahan and Sifford families must bear the burden of a tragedy so unexpected and so profound that each of us–

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the Agriculture Appropriations Conference Report, which we will vote on today. This bill contains over $78 billion in  funding (and more than $3.5 billion in emergency assistance for farmers). And it contains important initiatives I have been pushing--doubling the payment limit for LDPs (from $75,000 to $150,000) and lifting embargoes on food and medicine. 
   I extend my sincere gratitude to the Chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Committee, my friend from Mississippi, who has crafted a bill that gives America's farmers the assistance they need in the short term--and keeps a promise we made to open more markets in which to sell their products overseas. 
   This bill culminates an almost 2-year effort on my part to open overseas markets to American farmers by ending U.S. food and medicine embargoes. We talk a lot about foreign trade barriers, and rightly so. We must continue to be vigilant to remove those barriers, such as the EU ban on U.S. beef. However, it is hypocritical of the U.S. government to target foreign barriers without removing our own barriers. That's exactly what food embargoes are--U.S. barriers against U.S. farmers. A policy shift in this area is long overdue, and I am pleased that this Conference Report reflects that shift. While the final product before us is not perfect, it does change substantially U.S. policy on embargoes of agriculture and medicine. 
   We know that sanctions hurt farmers. The currently-embargoed market for our food products is estimated by some at about $6 billion. Cuba alone could purchase about $1.6 billion worth of food and medicine each year. Jim Guest, the President of the Missouri Pork Producers said: ``With 11 million people who enjoy pork, Cuba will become an important U.S. pork export market. In 1998, the last year for which statistics are available, Cuba imported about 10,000 metric tons of pork from Canada, Mexico and the European Union.'' 
   This sanctions reform proposal covers more countries than just Cuba. There are four other countries affected by this legislation that could present substantial opportunities for U.S. producers of wheat, soybeans, beef, corn, etc. 
   Furthermore, this provision reforms sanctions policy for the future. The President will not be able to impose new sanctions without Congressional involvement. 
   Food embargo reform can be summed up as a big ``win'': a win to the U.S. economy, a win for U.S. jobs, a win in foreign policy, and a win for those hungry and hurting in foreign countries. 
   My goal that I set out to reach years ago--giving the U.S. the opportunity to export more 
   food and medicine--has been achieved in the bill we are voting on today. The Food and Medicine for the World Act, which I introduced in 1999, and which is the basis for the agreement in this Ag. Approps. Conference Report, separates out food and medicine from all other products when it comes to sanctions policy. 
   Current embargos against agriculture and medicine will be lifted, and there will be no embargoes in the future unless the President first receives Congressional approval. This proposal of mine has remained in place throughout the Senate and House negotiations. It is the underlying basis for real sanctions reform because it does not focus on any one country. Instead, it is a new framework for U.S. policy in general. The differences between my original proposal and this final agreement are merely details on HOW the exports of food and medicine will be facilitated. We made progress in some areas, and in others, we must monitor the effectiveness toward reaching our goal. 
   Let me explain briefly those differences. On the issue of how the exports will be allowed, there are two things I would like to cover--licensing and financing. 
   On licensing--we have gone much further than the Administration plan put in place last year, which has two substantial limitations. First, the Administration plan requires case-by-case licensing, whereas, the language before us in the Conference Report ensures that a least restrictive licensing system is set up--to cover a 2 year span instead of being case-by-case. Second, current U.S. policy requires tight restrictions on the end recipient of the food (those to whom we could sell our farm products). However, the bill we are voting on today allows exporters to sell to countries broadly, whoever wants to buy their products. 
   On financing--all sales to these countries can be freely financed by U.S. banks, but the House added a restriction that will prohibit U.S. banks from being the primary financial institution in any sales to Cuba. U.S. banks will be able to facilitate transactions, but they won't be allowed to assume the risk of the Cuban buyers. While this policy is not my preference, I will point out that it is not a step backward. It simply keeps in place the current restrictions that exist in U.S. law. 
   One final note on financing, particularly U.S. government financing--under the bill before us, U.S. government credits will be available to help finance exports of agricultural products if the President determines that it is in the humanitarian or national security interest to extend the credits. 
   All along, I have been committed to real sanctions reform in a final bill--and that is what we have accomplished. As with any major reform of U.S. policy, our proposal may not be perfect, but we can address any roadblocks that arise when they are brought to our attention by the farming community and humanitarian organizations. 
   I welcome the recognition by a sizable majority of Congress that the time has come to reform this nation's obsolete and hurtful policy that allows using food and medicine in embargoes. And I look forward to sending this embargo reform bill to the President's desk so America's farmers are given increased freedom to market. 
   Mr. President, I would like to insert in the RECORD a letter addressed to me from Charlie Kruse, the President of the Missouri Farm Bureau. Also, I would like to insert a statement from the Missouri Pork Producers. Finally, I would like to insert a letter signed by 15 agriculture organizations supporting this sanctions reform proposal and the Conference Report. Let me just say that this effort--reforming our nation's policy on food embargoes--has been a cooperative effort. The farm organizations that have signed these letters have shown tremendous leadership in getting us where we are today. I extend my sincere appreciation for their support throughout this entire process.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I would like to honor John T. Pierpont for his outstanding service as Sheriff of Greene County, Missouri. I want to extend my personal appreciation and heartfelt thanks to John for his dedication and hard work. 
   There are few careers more noble than those spent in public service. Sheriff Pierpont's twenty years of service with the Greene County Sheriff's Office have meant a great deal to the people he has served. Prior to being elected Sheriff of Greene County, Mr. Pierpont served as U.S. Marshal for the Western District of Missouri for eight years. His service has extended well beyond the Sheriff's office and law enforcement to community and charitable organizations across Greene County and throughout our state. 
   Sheriff Pierpont has represented the state of Missouri and the Sheriff's Department with dignity, integrity, and professionalism. His commitment to the enforcement of Missouri law and the protection of our residents is to be commended. I am delighted to honor my friend and fellow Greene County resident, John Pierpont. 
   May God richly bless John and his family as they begin this next chapter in their lives.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today's final passage of the Defense Authorization Conference Report is a significant achievement. It fulfills past commitments, provides the necessary funds for our present obligations, and makes significant investments toward a secure future. I want to commend Senator WARNER and Senator LEVIN for the tremendous job they have done providing for our national defense. This bill authorizes $310 billion for the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy's defense related activities. This is $4.5 billion more than requested by President Clinton, and represents the first real increase in defense spending in 14 years. 
   One provision in the Defense Authorization bill of particular importance to the people of Missouri is that of military retiree health care. For generations, our military's career men and women have dedicated their lives to the protection of freedom and prosperity in America. One of the promises this country made to these men and women was a pledge that career members of the Armed Forces, their spouses, and dependents would have health care benefits on active duty and in retirement. While these benefits were not authorized by Congress, they were promised by the United States government, specifically, by the Department of Defense and its recruiters. Promises made need to be kept. Career members of the Armed Forces acted in good faith and relied on the statements of their government's representatives. 
   Mr. President, until recently, military retirees were provided with health care in military facilities here and abroad. However, due to major changes in the military health care program, multiple base closings, and a risky downsizing of the military by the current Administration, too many military retirees have been shut out of military facilities. Many have sought Medicare coverage or private insurance, or have been forced to do without access to care. In Missouri, where we have 76,439 military retirees, retiree family members, and survivors, this is a significant problem. Although we are fortunate to have Fort Leonard Wood and Whiteman Air Force Base close at hand in Missouri, and Scott Air Force Base in Illinois and Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, both nearby, many military retirees in Missouri have told me that it is virtually impossible to get an appointment at these bases for a routine physical, let alone for critical care. It is clear that Washington is not keeping its promise to these patriotic men and women. 
   Through the strong and dedicated leadership of Senator WARNER, America's military retirees will again have access to quality health care, as promised. This Defense authorization bill includes a provision to expand the popular TRICARE Senior Prime demonstration project. It eliminates the current restrictions that require military retirees to lose their military health care benefits under the CHAMPUS and TRICARE programs after they reach age 65 and become eligible for Medicare. Military retirees will not be able to receive TRICARE Senior Prime, or ``TRICARE-for-life''--an HMO-type coverage plan for retirees that includes partial payment of the costs from Medicare. This program will finally ensure that all military retirees have access to quality health care throughout their life. This bill will also establish a military health care trust fund to ensure that retiree health care remains solvent for years to come. This valuable retiree health care provision is endorsed by most of the major veteran and military retiree organizations, and I support its inclusion in this legislation. 
   In addition to ``TRICARE-for-life,'' the Defense Authorization bill also extends to military retirees access to prescription drugs, by restoring the full DoD Prescription drug benefit, including mail order and retail pharmacy, to all Medicare-eligible uniformed services beneficiaries. 
   These break-through provisions for military retirees are not the only important provisions of the Defense Authorization bill. This bill includes several critical active-duty provisions including measures to bring our military families off the food-stamp roles, provide a well-deserved 3.7% pay increase, and eliminates the statutory requirement that service-members incur out-of-pocket housing costs, thus permitting the Deputy of Defense to increase housing allowances immediately. This will eliminate out-of-pocket cost for housing by October 1, 2004. 
   This bill also makes significant progress towards ensuring a strong defense for our country in the years to come. The legislation includes authorizations for additional F-15s and a new Extended-Range Cruise Missiles, as well as provides $63 billion dollars for other new weapons procurements. Furthermore, the bill provides an additional $1 billion in funding for key readiness accounts. These amounts are necessary to ensure our military is not only ready to fight today, but will remain ready for any challenges our country may face in the future. 
   Again, I want to thank Senator WARNER for his leadership in the area of national defense. I urge the Senate to support this bill, and to support our men and women in uniform, especially those who gave their lives in service today on the U.S.S. Cole, in far away Yemen. We extend our thoughts and prayers to their families and friends.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, over the past two weeks, the Middle East has been in a state of grave turmoil and violence. With almost 100 people reported dead, Israel is dangerously close to internal war between the Jews and Palestinians. Even this morning, two Israeli soldiers were brutally murdered in Ramallah in connection with this ongoing violence. Although there are some reports of a decrease in violence, this conflict demonstrates how complex and difficult it will be to have real peace for the people of the Middle East. 
   Throughout the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and even Arab towns inside Israel proper, Palestinians have taken to the streets. They are demanding Israeli capitulation and withdrawal of Israel troops from Arab regions. Although the Palestinian Authority has claimed that the flashpoint for the violence was a visit to the Temple Mount by Israeli political leader Ariel Sharon, the violence's widespread and intense nature of the violence, along with Palestinian reaction, indicates that the violence may not be a simple and uncoordinated reaction. 
   Since the initial incident, the violence has rapidly spread with incredible fervor. According to published reports, ``The internal riots stunned Israeli police officials by their size and intensity.'' A simple incident was radically and almost instantaneously transformed into a dire situation that threatens the entire Middle East peace process. Although this outrageous reaction may appear isolated, Mr. Arafat has threatened over the years to cross out the peace accords and unleash a new uprising against Israel. He has often described the peace accords as simply a temporary truce. 
   Mr. Arafat's response to the recent situation raises many concerns. It appears he has done little to nothing to quell the violence. The Palestinian Authority's official media arm, the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation, has consistently broadcast incitement against Israel, including a children's program where martyrdom as ``suicide warriors'' is glorified. Palestinian television is also running a story about an alleged brutal killing of a Palestinian by Jewish settlers. The audience is told that the 40-year-old man's skull was crushed, his bones broken and his body burned by the settlers. Pictures of a charred and mutilated body are being used continually to incite already combative protesters and mourners. Although Israeli officials have stated that the man, Isam Hamad, 36, died in a car crash north of Ramallah and that the Palestinians chose to exploit the terrible condition of his body, Palestinian officials have refused to investigate the real cause of death and instead some have stated that the killing justifies an ``open season on settlers.'' 
   Hassan Asfour, a Palestinian cabinet minister, told the Reuters News Service that, ``The settlers must now be a target by every Palestinian in order to stop their terrorism and they must be uprooted from our Palestinian occupied lands.'' These are not the words of a leadership that wants peace. 
   Mr. President, we must continually remember that Israel is in one of the most dangerous and unstable regions of the world. Since the beginning of the Oslo process in 1993, Israel has lost more than 280 of its citizens to terrorist violence (a portion of the Israeli population comparable to 15,000 Americans) in over 1,000 terrorist attacks. That death toll is worse than in the 15 years prior to Oslo. Rather than eradicate terrorist infrastructure in Palestinian territory, the Palestinian Authority apparently has maintained its revolving door policy in detaining terrorists. Over 20 prominent terrorists have been released since President Clinton's visit to Gaza in December 1998. Israeli reaction to violence must be seen in this context. 
   During this current situation, President Clinton has failed to stand firm with our long-time friend and ally, Israel. Although I appreciate the President's interest in bringing about peace in the Middle East, his desire to play the role of the ``honest broker'' is sadly misguided. Until Mr. Arafat begins to demonstrate otherwise, it appears clear that the Palestinian Authority is simply not an ``honest player''. 
   Mr. President, it is time to stand with Israel in the effort to find real and lasting peace. We must continue to work with our friends and allies around the world, including moderate Arab countries, to bring the Palestinian Authority into line with appropriate international behavior that will contribute to the process of peace, not to war. I call on Prime Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat to honestly work towards an end to this latest violence and come back to the negotiating table with the goal of reaching a workable and lasting peace.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I would like to engage in a brief colloquy with Senator MCCAIN the Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. Yesterday, the Senate took an important step forward in improving our nation's motor vehicle safety laws. One of the most important aspects of that bill was a provision to require Department of Transportation to upgrade the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard for tires for the first time in nearly 30 years. 
   Because it has been so long since the standards have been revised, they do not apply to tires used on sport utility vehicles (SUVs). In fact, SUVs weren't even around when these standards were last developed. Given the relationship of tires to the rollover propensity of SUVs, I would expect that the Department should first upgrade the standards for those tires used on SUVs. In addition, since the tire standard was put in place technology for the construction and design of tires has improved dramatically. For example, nylon ply caps can significantly improve the performance of tires. The types vehicles on the road has also changed as more and more people choose to drive sport utility vehicles. Chairman MCCAIN would you agree that the Department should consider new technologies that would improve tire safety as they establish the new tire standard and that they should also consider the different mix of vehicles on the road as they set their priorities for implementing the new standard.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I would like to offer my strong support for the conference report on H.R. 3244, a bill that will strengthen our laws in order to protect women, children and all victims of domestic violence. The conference report that we will vote on today includes several sections, each of which provides additional protections for vulnerable members of society. 
   First, the bill contains the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, legislation that has been the passion of the Senator from Kansas, Mr. BROWNBACK, and the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. WELLSTONE. This legislation will combat sexual trafficking of women and children--the deepest violation of human dignity and an unspeakable tragedy. Second, the conference report contains a bill that we have heard a lot about in the last several weeks--the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act--to provide funding for programs to combat domestic violence and assist victims of domestic violence--both male and female. The original Violence Against Women Act authorization expired on October 1, 2000, and I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the reauthorization bill sponsored by Senators HATCH and BIDEN (S. 2787). The third main section of the bill contains anti-crime measures including provisions to encourage States to incarcerate, for long prison terms, individuals convicted of murder, rape, and dangerous sexual offenses. Together, these provisions form a comprehensive approach to fighting abuse against the most vulnerable members of society. 
   It is tragic that as we stand on the brink of the 21st Century the world is still haunted by the practice of international trafficking of women and children for sex, forced labor and for other purposes that violate basic human rights. The frequency of these practices is frightening. For example, an estimated 10,000 women from the former Soviet Union have been forced into prostitution in Israel; two million children are forced into prostitution every year, half of them in Asia; and more than 50,000 women are trafficked into the United States every year. Unfortunately, existing laws in the United States and other countries are inadequate to deter trafficking, primarily because they do not reflect the gravity of the offenses involved. Where countries do have laws against sexual trafficking, there is too often no enforcement. For example, in 1995, the Netherlands prosecuted 155 cases of forced prostitution, and only four resulted in the conviction of the traffickers. In some countries, enforcement against traffickers is hindered by indifference, corruption, and even official participation. 
   The conference report before us seeks to improve the lives of women and children around the world by providing severe punishment for persons convicted of operating trafficking enterprises within the United States and the possibility of severe economic penalties against traffickers located in other countries. In addition, it provides assistance and protection for victims, including authorization of grants to shelters and rehabilitation programs, and a limited provision for relief from deportation for victims who would face retribution or other hardships if deported. The bill also creates an Interagency Task Force to monitor and combat trafficking, in 
   order to facilitate and evaluate progress in trafficking prevention, victim assistance, and the prosecution of traffickers. I would like to thank the Senator from Kansas for his tireless work on this issue, and am pleased to support this legislation. 
   The second main section of this conference report, the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 2000, reauthorizes the Violence Against Women Act through Fiscal Year 2005. VAWA contains a number of grant programs, including the STOP grants, Pro-Arrest grants, Rural Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Enforcement grants, the National Domestic Violence Hotline, and three programs for victims of child abuse, including the court-appointed special advocate program (CASA). In addition, there are targeted improvements to the original language that have been made, such as providing funding for transitional housing assistance, expanding several of the key grant programs to cover violence that arises in dating relationships, and authorizing grants for legal assistance for victims of domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault. 
   There is another issue that has been raised recently and that is the eligibility of men to receive benefits and services under the original Violence Against Women Act and under this bill. It was the original intent of this legislation to direct federal funds toward the most pressing problem--that of domestic violence against women, and violence against women in particular, since the statistics show that the majority of domestic violence is perpetrated against women. But although women are more often victims of such violence than men, it does not mean that men are never victims, or that the problems of domestic violence when men are victims should be ignored. It was not, and is not, the intent of Congress to exclude men who have suffered  domestic abuse or sexual assaults from receiving benefits and services under the Violence Against Women Act. Maybe the bill should be renamed the ``Stop Domestic Violence Act'' in order to more accurately reflect the purposes of this bill. The Act defines such key terms as ``domestic violence'' and ``sexual assault,'' which are used to determine eligibility under several of the grant programs, in gender-neutral language. Men who have suffered these types of violent attacks are eligible under current law to apply for services and benefits that are funded under the original Act--and they will remain eligible under the Violence Against Women Act of 2000--whether it be for shelter space under the Family Violence Protection and Services Act, or counseling by the National Domestic Violence Hotline, or legal assistance in obtaining a protection order under the Legal Assistance for Victims program. I am pleased that this clarification was added to this bill. 
   I am committed to confronting domestic violence because I believe that all forms of violence and crime destroy lives, hopes, and opportunities. All citizens should be safe from violence at home, in their neighborhoods and at schools. Protecting public safety is a fundamental duty of government, and we must make it clear to criminals that if they commit crime and violence, they will be punished swiftly and severely. 
   Domestic violence has been a problem in the State of Missouri. In 1999, according to data from the Highway Patrol Criminal Records Division, there were 754 incidents for every 100,000 Missourians. This number is too high, despite the fact that it has been falling from a high of 815/100,000 in 1997. The early nineties saw a disturbing rise in domestic violence 
   reports, from 657 per 100,000 Missourians in 1993 to the high in 1997. 
   I have worked aggressively in the past, while in service to the state of Missouri, to confront domestic violence. As Governor, I established a special Task Force on Domestic Violence. This task force conducted a comprehensive review of domestic violence in Missouri and researched the efficiency of various programs and services for victims of abuse. Additionally, I supported the Adult Abuse Act of 1989, which provided new protection against domestic violence as well as new services for victims. 
   October is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I would like to enter into the RECORD an article by Doctor Hank Clever, a well-known pediatrician in St. Charles, Missouri. This article appeared in The St. Charles County Post, on October 2, 2000. Dr. Clever outlines the severity of the problem of domestic violence and provides a checklist of behaviors that may help one distinguish if you or someone you know is being abused. 
   The conference report we are voting on today provides real tools to combat violence against women and children, here in the United States and around the world, as well as new resources to curb domestic violence of all types. I support this conference report and thank Senator BROWNBACK for his leadership in the fight against sex-trafficking, Senators HATCH and BIDEN for their work in the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, and the other members of the Conference Committee for their success in fashioning such strong legislation.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to commend the Senate's passage of S. 662, the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this important legislation, which provides low-income, uninsured women with access to the treatment they need to battle these two potentially devastating diseases. 
   In 1990, Congress created a program, administered by the Centers for Disease Control, CDC, to provide breast and cervical cancer screening for low-income, uninsured women. While this program's goal was to reduce mortality rates from these two diseases, the fact many women diagnosed under the program had no funds for treatment left our goal largely unfulfilled. 
   The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act moves this Federal commitment forward to the next logical step, by providing Medicaid funds to treat these women who are diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer through the CDC screening program. Under this important legislation, American women will be able to receive the treatment they need to win the fight against breast cancer or cervical cancer. 
   As we are in the waning days of this legislative session, I am glad to join my Senate colleagues in passing the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act, which will provide new resources and hope to low-income women with breast or cervical cancer. As the House has already passed a similar bill, it is my hope that Congress will present final legislation to the President for enactment this year.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a very important piece of legislation. This bill continues my effort to help working parents balance the demands between work and family. 
   Over the past five years, we have been talking about the difficulty that parents have balancing work and family obligations. I do not think there are two values that are more highly or intensely admired in America than these. The first one is the value we place on our families. We understand that more than anything else the family is an institution where important things are learned, not just knowledge imparted but wisdom is obtained and understood in a family which teaches us not just how to do something but teaches us how to live. 
   The second value which is a strong value in America and reflects our heritage is the value of work. Americans admire and respect work. The difficult issue that face us as a nation, is how are we going to resolve these tensions? I think that is one of the jobs, that we  have to try and make sure we build a framework where people can resolve those tensions. Since 1965, the amount of time parents spend with their children has dropped 40 percent and a 1993 study that found that 66 percent of adults surveyed nationwide wanted to spend more time with their children. 
   This tension between the workplace and the home place, juxtaposed or set in a framework of laws created in the 1930's that does not allow us flexibility, is a problem. For example, you might be asked to do overtime over and over and over again, and you do overtime, and then you are paid time and a half. But at some point, you would rather have the time than the money. If the employer agreed to it voluntarily--both parties--we ought to let that happen. Right now, it is against the law. According to a number of surveys, this is what Americans want. For example, a poll by Money magazine found that 64 percent of the American people--and 68 percent of women--would rather have their overtime in the form of time off, than in cash wages. Eighty-two percent said they supported the Republican's plan to give working men and women more control over their hard-earned time. Money magazine, May 1997. 
   In an attempt to address these work and family tensions, in each of the last three Congresses, I have introduced legislation. Each of these bills provide flexible working arrangements--or ``flex-time,'' and compensatory time off--or ``comp time.'' 
   The comp time provisions in the Family Friendly Workplace Act (S. 1241) would permit employees to choose, if the employer agreed, to be compensated with time-and-a-half compensatory time off for overtime hours worked in lieu of time-and-a-half pay--whenever time is more valuable than financial compensation to the employee. This gives hourly employees the ability to meet their family obligations while still taking home a full paycheck. 
   The flex time provisions would allow private sector hourly employees to work biweekly work schedules the same as federal employees have been able to since 1978. Rather than being limited to 40 hours in a seven-day period, private sector workers could schedule 80 hours over a two-week period in any combination if their employers agree. Overtime would have to be paid 
   for any hours ordered by the employer in excess of those in the designated biweekly work schedule. For example, if an employer asked an employee to work 45 hours in a week when the employee was scheduled to work only 35 hours under the biweekly work schedule, the employer would be required to pay the employee 10 hours of overtime compensation. This is true even though absent the agreement, the employer would only be required to pay the employee five hours of overtime. 
   When these provisions were developed, I took seriously the concerns raised by my constituents that adequate protections had to be contained in the bill to make sure this was a real choice made by employees--not employers. Both of the provisions were designed to do just that. In the Family Friendly Workplace Act employers cannot require accepting compensatory time off in lieu of over time pay as a condition of employment. Nor can they require employees to work flex time as a condition of employment. In addition, such agreements to work these alternative work schedules have to be in writing, signed by the employee. Coercion into these programs--or even attempted coercion--is strictly prohibited and contain severe penalties. 
   Due to the nature of comp time, there also are protections specific to that program. Employers would be prohibited from coercing, or attempting to coerce, employees into using or not using their comp time. The bill requires employers to cash-out their employees' comp time bank at the end of each year or in the alternative, within thirty days of their employees' request. These cash-out provisions serve two important purposes. First, it ensures that employers who offer the option of comp time do not do so with the belief that it will give them ability to avoid paying overtime. Second, it also structures comp time programs with a built-in incentive for employers to allow employees to use their comp time when it is needed by the employee. 
   Today, I am introducing legislation to provide these superior protections to state and local government workers. First, it will prohibit the practice of requiring employees to accept comp time as a condition of employment. It also will require state and local governments to cash-out comp time banks at the end of each year or within thirty days of request by the employees. Finally, it will specifically prohibit state and local governments from forcing employees to use their accumulated comp time against their wishes. It is those workers who are giving up time with their families--they should be able to use it to spend time with their families. These protections will impact 290,405 workers in Missouri, or approximately twelve percent of the workforce. 
   No doubt, state and local governments will be concerned about the cost of cashing out these comp time banks or changing their scheduling patterns in order to allow workers to use their accumulated comp time. As a former Governor, I understand these concerns. However, I have to take seriously the practice that can no longer be called isolated incidents. Forcing employees to work over time takes away time from their families. Our police officers, fire fighters, corrections' officers, and other state and local government workers should have the choice whether that time should be compensated with time or money. They know what best fits their needs and should not be forced--with the blessings of the federal government--into giving up that choice.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I rise today in support of the conference report on the energy and water appropriations bill. This is a very important bill, for it contains a provision that will protect the citizens of Missouri from a risky Administration scheme to flood the Missouri River Basin. Section 103 of this bill is a provision that is necessary for the millions of Americans who live and work along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. This is the section of the bill that was subject to an amendment to strike when the Senate considered this legislation on September 7, 2000. The Senate defeated the attempt to strike at that time, and I want to thank the subcommittee chairman, Senator DOMENICI, for maintaining Section 103 in the conference report now before us. 
   Madam President, as you know, the use of the Missouri River is governed by what is known as the Missouri River Master Manual. Right now, there is an effort underway to update that manual. The specific issue that is at the crux of the debate over Section 103 is what is called a spring rise. A spring rise, in this case, is a release of huge  amounts of water from above Gavins Point Dam on the Nebraska-South Dakota border during the flood-prone spring months. 
   In an effort to protect the habitat of the pallid sturgeon, the least tern, and the piping plover, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued an ultimatum to the Army Corps of Engineers insisting that the Corps immediately agree to its demand for a spring rise. The Corps was given one week to respond to the request of Fish and Wildlife for immediate implementation of a spring rise. The Corps' response was a rejection of the spring rise proposal, and they called for further study of the effect of the spring rise. 
   The language in section 103 will allow for the studies the Corps recommends. Section 103, inserted in the bill during the subcommittee markup, is a commonsense provision that states in its entirety:  
   None of the funds made available in this act may be used to revise the Missouri River Master Water Control Manual if such provisions provide for an increase in the springtime water release program during the spring heavy rainfall and snow melt period in States that have rivers draining into the Missouri River below the Gavins Point Dam.  
   This policy--this exact language--has been included in the last four energy and water appropriations bills, all of which the President signed without opposition. Let's look at the support that the Energy and Water appropriations bills, with the exact same language, have enjoyed in the past. 
   In October, 1995, the Senate agreed to the energy and water appropriations conference report by a bipartisan vote of 89-6. 
   In September, 1996, the Senate agreed to the energy and water appropriations conference report by a bipartisan vote of 92-8. 
   In September, 1998, the Senate agreed to the energy and water appropriations conference report by unanimous consent. 
   In September, 1999, the Senate agreed to the energy and water appropriations conference report by a bipartisan vote of 96-3. 
   In addition, this year, the Senate voted 93-1 in favor of final passage of the energy and water appropriations bill on September 7, 2000, following the defeat of the amendment to strike Section 103. 
   This lengthy record of support is part of the reason I am shocked and astounded to report that last week, the President's Chief of Staff, John Podesta, sent a letter to the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee chairman stating that the President would veto this bill if section 103 is included. In other words, the Clinton-Gore administration is threatening to veto the entire energy and water appropriations bill if it contains language to protect the lives and property of all citizens living and working along the lower Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. 
   If the President follows through with a veto of the bill, after having signed this provision four times previously, he will be sending a very clear message to the citizens of the Midwest. It is very easy to understand. Unfortunately, it would be very hard to digest and accommodate. But the message would be this: The Clinton-Gore administration is willing to flood downstream communities as part of an unscientific, risky scheme that will hurt, not help, the endangered species it seeks to protect. If that is the message, I wouldn't want to be the messenger. 
   The President's Chief of Staff, Mr. Podesta, made a number of interesting, yet untrue, claims in his veto threat letter. We have corrected and clarified these points before, but allow me to do so again, in the hope that the administration will reconsider its position when confronted with the real facts on this issue. 
   First, the administration claims in its veto letter that section 103 would, ``prevent the Corps from carrying out a necessary element of any reasonable and prudent alternative to avoid jeopardizing the continued existence of the endangered least tern, pallid sturgeon, and the piping plover.'' This statement is false. 
   Under section 103, alternatives can be studied and all alternatives can be implemented--with the exception of a spring rise. 
   What is ironic is that spring flooding could hurt the wildlife more than it will protect them. And it will do so in a way that will increase the risks of downstream flooding and interferes with the shipment of cargo on our nation's highways. 
   Dr. Joe Engeln, assistant director of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, stated in a June 24 letter that there are several major problems with the Fish and Wildlife Service's proposed plan that may have the perverse effect of harming the targeted species rather than helping them. 
   In his letter, he writes that, ``the higher reservoir levels [that would result from a spring 
   rise] would also reduce the habitat for the terns and plovers that nest along the shorelines of the reservoirs.'' 
   Dr. Engeln also points out that because the plan calls for a significant drop in flow during the summer, predators will be able to reach the islands upon which the terns and plovers nest, giving them access to the young still in the nests. 
   Second, the administration claims that the Missouri Master Manual is outdated and, ``does not provide and appropriate balance among the competing interests, both commercial and recreational, of the many people who seek to use this great American river.'' This, also, is untrue. 
   This administration's plan for ``controlled flood'' or spring rise places every citizen who lives or works downstream from the point of release in jeopardy by disturbing the balance at a time when downstream citizens are most vulnerable to flooding. 
   Section 103 protects citizens of Missouri and other states from dangerous flooding while allowing for cost efficient transportation of grain and cargo. 
   Section 103 is supported by bipartisan group representing farmers, manufacturers, labor unions, shippers, citizens and port authorities from 15 Midwest states. 
   Also supporting Section 103 are major national organizations including the American Farm Bureau, American Waterways associations, National Grange, and the National Soybean Association. 
   The strong support for Section 103 and against the spring rise undermines the administration's claim that the Master Manual must be immediately changed. 
   In addition to the illusory argument that the spring rise is necessary to protect endangered species, some advocates of the spring rise claim that this plan is a return to more ``natural flow conditions'' and that the river should be returned to its condition at the time of the Lewis and Clark expedition. 
   Not only is this unrealistic because the Midwest was barely habitable because of the erratic flooding conditions at that time, according to Dr. Engeln of the Missouri DNR, the proposal would benefit artificial reservoirs at the expense of the river and create flow conditions that have never existed along the river in Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri. 
   Over 90 organizations representing farmers, shippers, cities, labor unions, and port authorities recently sent a letter to Congress saying: ``The spring rise demanded by the Fish and Wildlife Service is based on the premise that we should `replicate the natural hydrograph' that was responsible for devastating and deadly floods as well as summertime droughts and even dustbowls.'' 
   I think it is pretty clear that there is not sound science to support some protection of these species. There is a clear disagreement among scientists, and a strong argument that the implementation of this plan would, in fact, damage the capacity of some of these species to continue. 
   I urge the Senate to support this conference report. I ask the President to rethink his threatened veto and side with the bipartisan consensus to protect the citizens living and working in the lower Missouri River Basin from the Fish and Wildlife Service's plan to flood the region.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. Individuals from strong families contribute greatly to society. I believe it is both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment of ``till death us do part'' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country strong. 
   For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Dorothy and Eddie Karnes, who on October 7, 2000, will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. The Karnes' commitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, for the past fourteen years, the men and women serving selflessly in the Reserve components of our Armed Forces, which includes the National Guard and federal Reserve, have been denied a sensible, fair, and morally right tax deduction. Today, I am introducing a bill that will correct this tax injustice. 
   The Reservist Tax Relief Act of 2000 will allow Reservist and National Guardsmen and women, who are our nation's purest citizen-soldiers, to deduct travel expenses as a business expense, when they travel in connection with military service. It is my hope that my colleagues will join me in quickly passing this legislation before the end of the 106th Congress. 
   With the dramatic downsizing of the U.S. military over the past decade, the Reserve component has become an increasingly valuable aspect of our national defense. Traditionally geared to provide trained units and individuals to augment the Active components in time of war or national emergency, the Reserve component's role and responsibility has rapidly increased throughout the 1990s. During the Cold War, the Reserve component was rarely mobilized due to the robust nature of the Active Duty forces, however, with the 1/3 cut in Active Duty forces since 1990 there have been five presidential mobilizations of the Guard and Reserve beginning with the 1990-1991 Gulf War. The Guard and Reserve are heavily relied upon to provide support for smaller regional contingencies, peace-keeping and peace-making operations, and disaster relief. Although this level of mobilization is unprecedented during a time of peace, the men and women of the Guard and Reserve have performed a tremendous job in bridging the gap in our national security. For instance, more than 1,000 Missouri Army National Guard soldiers went to Honduras to help the country recover from the devastation of Hurricane Mitch. Additionally, Missouri Air Force Reservists have defended the skies over Bosnia-Herzegovina. America's Reserve component is now essential to our every-day military operations. 
   I strongly believe that our Active Duty forces should be provided additional resources to improve the readiness and overall capability of our national defense so America will not have to over-use its ``weekend warriors.'' But I also know that Congress should provide the necessary resources and support for the Reserve component to complement their new position in our security. Beyond providing the Reserve component with the resources, training, and equipment to be fully integrated into the military's ``Total Force'' concept, the Reserve component personnel should be provided targeted support to address their unique concerns. 
   When a member of the Reserve component chooses to serve, these brave men and women give up at least several weeks a year for training. In return, they are provided only minimal pay. With this training, along with additional out of area deployments each lasting up to 179 days, the 866,000 Reserve troops have put in 12 to 13 million man--days in each of the last three years. This type of commitment often puts a tremendous strain on these men and women, their families, and their employers. They all deserve our deepest thanks and sense of gratitude, and also our full support. 
   Mr. President, the Reservist Tax Relief Act of 2000 is one way we can actively support the contribution made by the Reserves to our national defense. This bill, endorsed by the Reserve Officers' Association of the United States, will provide a tax deduction to National Guard and Reserve members for travel expenses related to their military services, so that their travel costs in connection with Guard duty can be treated as a business expense. This provision was part of the federal tax code until it was removed by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Estimates show that approximately 10 percent of Reserve members, or about 86,000 personnel, must travel over 150 miles each way from home in order to fulfil their military commitments. The expenses involved in traveling this distance at least ``one weekend a month and two weeks a year'' can become a tremendous burden for dedicated citizen-soldiers. It is time, with taxes at record levels in this country, to reinstate this tax deduction for military reservists, who give up more than just their time in service to this country.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will reaffirm the vital role parents play in the lives of their children. My legislation, the Putting Parents First Act, will guarantee that parents have the opportunity to be involved in one of their children's most important and life-affecting decisions--whether or not to have an abortion. 
   The American people have long understood the unique and essential role the family plays in our culture. It is the institution through which we best inculcate and pass down our most cherished values. As is frequently the case, President Reagan said it best. Within the American family, Reagan said, ``the seeds of personal character are planted, the roots of public virtue first nourished. Through love and instruction, discipline, guidance and example, we learn from our mothers and fathers the values that will shape our private lives and public citizenship.'' 
   The Putting Parents First Act establishes something that ought to be self-evident, but tragically is not: that mothers and fathers should be allowed to be involved in a child's decision whether or not to have a major, life-changing, and sometimes life-threatening, surgical procedure--an abortion. This seems so simple. In many states, school officials cannot give a child an aspirin for a headache without parental consent. But doctors can perform abortions on children without parental consent or even notification. This defies logic. 
   The legislation I am introducing today would prohibit any individual from performing an abortion upon a minor under the age of 18 unless that individual has secured the informed written consent of the minor and a parent or guardian. In accordance with Supreme Court decisions concerning state-passed parental consent laws, the Putting Parents First Act allows a minor to forego the parental involvement requirement in cases where a court has issued a waiver certifying that the process of obtaining the consent of a parent or guardian is not in the best interests of the minor or that the minor is emancipated. 
   For too long, the issue of abortion has polarized the American people. To some extent, this is the inevitable result of vastly different views of when life begins and ends, what `choices' are involved, and who has the ability to determine these answers for others. Many including myself, view abortion as the destruction of innocent human life that should be an option in only the most extreme situations, such as rape, incest, or when the very life of the mother is at stake. Others, including a majority of current Supreme Court Justices, view abortion as a constitutionally-protected alternative for pregnant women that should almost always be available. I think that all sides would agree that abortion involves a serious decision and a medical procedure that is not risk-free. 
   Thankfully, there are areas of common ground in the abortion debate on which both sides, and the Supreme Court, can agree. One such area of agreement is that, whenever possible, parents should be informed and involved when their young daughters are faced with a decision as serious as abortion. A recent CBS/New York Times survey found that 78 percent of Americans support requiring parental consent before an abortion is performed on a girl under age 18. Even those who do not view an abortion as a taking of human life recognize it as a momentous, indeed a life-changing, decision that a minor should not be left to make alone. The fact that nearly 80 percent of the states have passed laws requiring doctors to notify or seek the consent of a minor's parents before performing an abortion also demonstrates the consensus in favor of parental involvement. 
   The instruction and guidance about which President Reagan spoke are needed most when our children are dealing with important life decisions. It is hard to imagine a decision more important than whether or not a child should have a child of her own. We recognize, as fundamental to our understanding of freedom, that parents have unique rights and responsibilities to control the education and upbringing of their children--rights that absent a compelling interest, neither government nor other individuals should supercede. When a young woman finds herself in a crisis situation, ideally she should be able to turn to her parents for assistance and guidance. This may not always happen, and may not be reality for some young women, but at the very least, we should make sure that our policies support good parenting, not undercut parents. Sadly, another reason to encourage young women to include a parent in the decision to undergo an abortion is because of adverse health consequences that can arise after an abortion. Abortion is a surgical procedure that can and sometimes does result in complications. Young women have died of internal bleeding and infections because their parents were unaware of the medical procedures that they had undergone, and did not recognize post-abortion complications. 
   Unfortunately, parental involvement laws are only enforced in about half of the 39 states that have them. Some states have enacted laws that have been struck down in state or federal courts; in other states, the executive branch has chosen not to enforce the legislature's will. As a result, just over 20 states have parental consent laws in effect today. In the remaining 30 states, parents are often excluded from taking part in their minor children's most fundamental decisions. 
   Moreover, in those states where laws requiring parental consent are on the books and being enforced, those laws are frequently circumvented by pregnant minors who cross state lines to avoid the laws' requirements. Often, a pregnant minor is taken to a bordering state by an adult male attempting to ``hide his crime'' of statutory rape and evade a state law requiring parental notification or consent. Sadly, nowhere is this problem more apparent than in my home state of Missouri. I was proud to have successfully defended Missouri's parental consent law before the Supreme Court in Planned Parenthood versus Ashcroft. Unfortunately, a study a few years ago in the American Journal of Public Health found that the odds of a minor traveling out of state for an abortion increased by over 50 percent after Missouri's parental consent law went into effect. There are ads in the St. Louis, Missouri, Yellow Pages luring young women to Illinois clinics with the words ``No Parental Consent Required'' in large type. 
   The limited degree of enforcement and the ease with which state laws can be evaded demand a national solution. The importance of protecting the fundamental rights of parents demands a national solution. And the protection of life--both the life of the unborn child, and the life and health of the pregnant young woman--demands we take action. Requiring a parent's consent before a minor can receive an abortion is one way states have chosen to protect not only the role of parents and the health and safety of young women, but also, the lives of the unborn. Thus, enactment of a federal parental consent law will allow Congress to protect the guiding role of parents as it protects human life. 
   The Putting Parents First Act is based on state statutes that have already been determined to be constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. The legislation establishes a minimum level of involvement by parents that must be honored throughout this nation. It does not preempt state parental involvement laws that provide additional protections to the parents of pregnant minors. 
   Mr. President, sound and sensible public policy requires that parents be involved in critical, life-shaping decisions involving their children. A young person whose life is in crisis may be highly anxious, and may want to take a fateful step without their parents' knowledge. But it is at these times of crisis that children need their parents most. They need the wisdom, love and guidance of a mother or a father, not policy statements of government bureaucrats, or uninvolved strangers. This legislation will strengthen the family and protect human life by keeping parents involved when children are making decisions that could shape the rest of their lives.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the Children's  Health Act of 2000 that will pass the Senate today. This legislation is the result of months of dedicated work by a number of Senators and House members. I believe the final language represents a comprehensive approach to promote physical and mental health for children, and protect them from dangerous, illegal drugs. I am a co-sponsor of the Senate version of this bill, a previous Senate version of the Children's Health Act (S. 2868), as well as the author of two key provisions contained in the package we are considering today. 
   I rise today to speak in favor of this legislation and to thank the bill's sponsor, Senator FRIST, for working with me to include two provisions that I believe are essential tools for advancing health and safety of America's children. The bill that will pass today, H.R. 4365, contains three main sections: (1) the text of S. 486, the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act, a bill I introduced last year that previously passed the Senate and has been approved by the House Judiciary Committee for consideration by the House of Representatives; (2) the Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act, which reauthorizes programs within the jurisdiction of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to improve mental health and substance abuse services for children and adolescents and allows the Charitable Choice concept, which I first authored in the 104th Congress, to be applied to the programs covered by this Act and (3) the Children's Health Act, which amends the Public Health Services Act to revise, extend, and establish programs with respect to children's health research, health promotion and disease prevention activities conducted through Federal public health agencies. 
   Mr. President, let me touch briefly on each of these three main sections. 
   First, this bill includes the text of S. 486, the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act, a bill I introduced in February 25, 1999 in response to the growing problem of methamphetamine production and use in my home state of Missouri, throughout the Midwest and in many other states as well. Unfortunately, the problem of methamphetamine has only gotten worse in the past year and a half. This anti-meth measure I authored will help fight meth in Missouri and the U.S. with $55 million in new resources for enforcement, cleanup, school- and community-based prevention efforts, and rehabilitation services. 
   The Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act will bolster the fight against meth through stiffer penalties for drug criminals; more money for law enforcement, education, and prevention; and a wider ban on meth paraphernalia. The bill directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to raise its guidelines for sentencing meth offenders. It requires mandatory reimbursement for the costs incurred by federal, state and local governments for the cleanup associated with meth labs. It authorizes $5.5 million in funding for DEA programs to train State and local law enforcement in techniques used in meth investigations and staff mobile training teams which provide State and local law enforcement with advanced training in conducting lab investigations. It also provides $15 million in funding to combat the trafficking of meth in counties designated High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas. 
   This legislation also provides for further research into the use of meth; authorizes $15 million in funds for community- and school-based anti-meth education programs; and includes an additional $10 million in resources for treatment of meth addiction. It directs HHS to include its annual National Household Survey on Drug Abuse prevalence data on the consumption of methamphetamine and other illicit drugs in rural, metropolitan, and consolidated metropolitan areas and requires the Secretary of HHS, in consultation with the Institute of Medicine, to conduct a study on the development of medications for the treatment of addiction to methamphetamine. 
   The nation's lead anti-drug agency, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), has thrown its support behind the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act. In endorsing this bill, DEA Administrator Donnie Marshall said this bill is ``landmark methamphetamine legislation.'' Marshall stated: ``I believe this bill (the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act) will prove instrumental in the Drug Enforcement Administration's efforts to bring to a halt the continued spread of methamphetamine across our country.'' 
   Mr. President, I am sad that Missouri is notorious as a national center of meth production and distribution. Methamphetamine, for those who are lucky enough not to have a meth problem in their areas, is a highly addictive synthetic drug that is typically made in illegal clandestine ``labs.'' Missouri and California lead the nation in seizures of such labs. In Missouri, the federal Drug Enforcement Administration and state and local law enforcement officers seized only two such labs in 1992, 14 in 1994, and a record 679 in 1998. This number jumped to 920 in 1999, setting a new record. 
   The second section of this bill is the Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act, which reauthorizes the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). This section addresses the issue of drug abuse in our nation's youth which has dramatically increased this decade. It creates new programs to provide additional funding for youth-targeted treatment and early intervention services. Under this bill, states will receive more flexibility in the use of block grant funds and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will have more flexibility to respond to the needs of young people who need mental health and substance abuse services. 
   I am especially pleased that included in the Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act is an expansion of the Charitable Choice provision, which will allow federally-funded substance abuse services to be open to faith-based providers. Under Charitable Choice, which was first enacted into law in 1996 as part of the welfare reform law, churches and other faith-based providers are able to compete on an equal footing with other non-governmental organizations in providing services to disadvantaged Americans. 
   Since its enactment, Charitable Choice has been expanded from job training and related services for welfare clients to include the Community Services Block Grant program, which is used for a variety of anti-poverty activities, such as improving job and educational opportunities and providing financial management and emergency assistance. This latest expansion will apply Charitable Choice to federal drug treatment programs that will total $1.6 billion for Fiscal Year 2000. My home state of Missouri is slated to receive $24.46 million in substance abuse block grant funding for the coming fiscal year. 
   Charitable Choice calls our nation to its highest and best in our effort to help those in need. It meets the tests of compassion and common sense that count for so much in Missouri. When people of faith extend compassionate help to those in need, the results can be stunningly successful. Where too many traditional substance abuse treatment programs have failed to help those in need, faith-based programs have succeeded. For example, Teen Challenge has show that 86% of its graduates remain drug-free. San Antonio's Victory Fellowship boasts of a success rate of over 80%. This is the test of common sense: America needs to create a vibrant partnership that succeeds where other approaches have failed. 
   Mr. President, the bipartisan support for Charitable Choice is overwhelming in Congress. In additional, both Presidential candidates--Governor Bush and Vice President GORE--strongly support the program. It is my hope that this broad national consensus will continue to grow and that soon will be able to enact a comprehensive expansion of Charitable Choice to all federally-funded social services programs. 
   Third, the Children's Public Health Act has four overriding themes represented in its four titles: Injury Prevention, Maternal and Infant Health, Pediatric Health Promotion, and Pediatric Research. This legislation focuses federal research efforts in these areas and provides a comprehensive approach to children's health. For example, the bill includes authorization for research to prevent traumatic brain injuries, provides federal grants for comprehensive asthma services to children, and establishes a National Center for Birth  Defects and Development Disabilities within the CDC. The bill also includes childhood obesity prevention programs, childhood lead prevention programs, and a groundbreaking pediatric research initiative within NIH to ensure the realization of expanding opportunities for advancement in scientific investigations and care for children. This legislation also includes support for pediatric graduate medical education in children's hospitals, an issue that has been a high priority of mine for years. 
   I am hopeful, that with passage of this landmark legislation, we can improve the lives of America's children. By funding research for many childhood diseases and disabilities, expanding programs to assist youth with addiction and mental health problems through faith-based providers, and drastically increasing the war against meth, this bill is an important step in the right direction. I thank all those who worked on this legislation, and urge the President to sign this bill to help secure a safer and healthier future for the next generation.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, tomorrow will be a special day for the State of Missouri. Tomorrow, President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will hold a ceremony to officially rename the U.S. State Department Headquarters as The Harry S Truman Federal Building. 
   I am pleased to have played a role in the renaming of the State Department in honor of one of Missouri's most famous sons--President Truman. Last spring, I introduced a bill, S. 2416, to designate the headquarters for the Department of State, as the ``Harry S. Truman Federal Building''. The House's companion legislation, H.R. 3639, sponsored by Missouri Congressmen IKE SKELTON and ROY BLUNT, passed the Senate on June 8th and was signed by the President on June 20, 2000. Secretary of State Albright was supportive of this effort from the beginning, and I thank her. In addition, I would like to thank the Senators who cosponsored this bill, Senators BOND, BOXER, BYRD, DEWINE, HAGEL, MOYNIHAN, ROBERTS, and WARNER. 
   Born in Lamar, Missouri, Harry S Truman was a farmer, a national guardsman, a World War I veteran, a local postmaster, a road overseer, and a small business owner before turning to politics. Through these traditional experiences, he gained the courage, honesty, and dedication to freedom required of a great leader. Joining the Senate in 1935, Truman fought against government waste and saved the U.S. Government $15 billion as Chairman of the Senate War Investigating committee. Ten years later, Harry S Truman became Franklin D. Roosevelt's Vice President. Four short months later, Truman assumed the presidency after Roosevelt's untimely death, and remarked to reporters: ``I felt like the moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on me.'' Although Truman might have felt unprepared, he rose to the challenge with typical Missourian resolve and changed the face of history. President Truman went on to become one of the most influential presidents of the modern era. His leadership and character, especially in the area of foreign policy, have earned him well-deserved praise and respect throughout the world. The life, character, and freedom-loving values of this great Missourian are honored by countless millions. 
   Mr. President, naming the State Department Headquarters building after President Truman is a befitting tribute to his life and his legacy. This is truly a proud moment for the Truman family, the people of Missouri, and all Americans.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a significant vote I will cast--a vote in favor of permanent normal trade relations for China. It is significant, but difficult. Difficult because the Chinese have shown--in everything from predatory trade practices, to threatening our national security, to total disregard for religious freedom and human rights--a disturbing lack of trustworthiness. And furthermore, the current administration seems trapped in a cycle of failed policy. I deeply regret that our President, on behalf of the United States, has squandered multiple opportunities to protect U.S. interests and to promote American values in trade matters. 
   The vote is significant because about one-fourth of the people in the world live in China. When we talk of China, we need to remember that we are talking about people, many of whom seek to embrace the same values that made America great, such as religious freedom, freedom of expression, and capitalism. They want to live free, while many of their leaders want only to amass power and rule with a heavy hand. 
   I do not argue, as some do, that dropping the annual review of China's trading status will usher in all of these freedoms. Nor will it further protect U.S. security interests. That argument is tenuous, at best. 
   The only thing that will usher in the freedom to express religious or political beliefs, to organize, to obtain a fair trial, and to be free from governmental intrusion, will be a transformation among China's highest government officials. This will not happen in the absence of a well-formulated policy underpinned by moral leadership on the part of the U.S. Presidency. The leader of the free world must lead the world toward freedom. For the sake of the Chinese people, it is my hope that the next President of the United States will take the initiative in a calculated and consistent manner to be a leader in this area, without the need to be prodded by Congress at every turn. 
   Furthermore, the key to U.S. security interests lies in the hands of the Commander in Chief. If China joins the World Trade Organization, the United States does not alter its ability, or its responsibility, to protect our interests at home and to promote security abroad. While the WTO agreement has an explicit exception that states that WTO trade obligations do not supercede national security decisions, the fact is that the United States does not need the exception. The most fundamental role of the U.S. government is to protect the security interests of its people, period. We can count on other countries to attempt to steal our national secrets and to violate our security interests. It is the way of history, the conflict of powers. The breakdown in U.S. security with the Chinese has occurred because this Administration has not been vigilant to protect our interests. It did not and does not have to be that way in the future. 
   Granting permanent normal trade relations to China does not alter the President's responsibility to promote American values or to protect U.S. security interests. However, granting PNTR to China does have a substantial impact on our ability to enforce our trade agreements. I would like to discuss this issue fully today because I believe it is central to the ability of American farmers and companies to crack open the Chinese market--on which Chinese officials, at times, appear to have a death grip. 
   As we all know, China has been trying to accede to the WTO for over a decade. In order for this process to be complete, China has to negotiate the terms of the trade agreement that are satisfactory to the United States and other WTO members and must receive a favorable vote from the WTO members. Also, for the United States to benefit from those new terms, Congress has to grant to China what is known as ``permanent normal trade relations'' status. The Administration has concluded a trade agreement with China, and the President, Vice President, and entire Administration are now asking Congress to support PNTR. 
   A fair trade relationship with China has the potential to give Missouri workers and farmers the ability to sell goods in a new market of more than one billion people. However, a relationship is not built on commitments alone. It must include accountability. In China's case, we have a new and improved trade agreement, but we must also be able to enforce those commitments. 
   On the first issue--a solid agreement--there has been substantial progress made. China should open its market on equal terms to the United States. The U.S. market has been fully open to China for years. Although I would like to see complete reciprocity, I have reviewed the proposed agreement for China's WTO accession, and I believe it is a forward step toward opening China's market for U.S. products and services. This is a good deal for American jobs and Missouri's long-term economic growth. 
   On everything from automobiles to agriculture, Missourians are prepared to embrace the opportunities the agreement could provide: overall average tariffs will go from 24 percent to 9 percent by 2005; agricultural tariffs will be cut nearly in half (31 percent to 17 percent); businesses will be able to bypass state-trading ``middle-men''; import standards for U.S. food goods will be based on sound science; competition will increase in all of the service sectors, like telecom, insurance, banking; the Internet will be open to U.S. investment; and the list goes on. 
   The Missouri economy at large is poised to benefit substantially from further opening of the Chinese market. From the early to late 1990s, Missouri's exports increased by about 120 percent, going from about $65 million in 1993, to about $145 million in 1998. Most recently, China ranked in the top 10 countries for Missouri exports, up from the 16th position in 1993. 
   Agriculture is the largest employer in my home state, and in fact, Missouri ranks 2nd in the nation in its number of farms. As I've traveled around the state, stopping in every county over the last few months, Missouri farmers and ranchers have expressed to me the importance of approving the agreement that has been reached on agriculture.  Those I met at the Missouri State Fair and at Delta Days told me that trade is becoming the number one issue for farmers. 
   Soybean farmers, for instance, must export about half of what they produce because there are simply not enough buyers in the United States. As the nation's sixth largest soybean producer, Missouri's soybean and soybean product exports were estimated at $586 million worldwide in 1998. China is the world's largest growth market for soybeans and soy products, and it has taken additional steps under the WTO agreement to further open its market. Tariffs will be 3 percent on soybeans and 5 percent on soybean meal, with no quota limits. For soybean oil, tariffs will drop to 9 percent, and the quota will be eliminated by 2006. 
   Examples of how Missouri agriculture stands to benefit are limitless. Beef, for instance, could see huge gains. Currently, Missourians are not in any real sense able to export beef to China because of trade barriers. Under the WTO accession agreement, by 2004 China will lower its tariff from 45 percent to 12 percent on frozen beef, from 20 to 12 percent on variety meats, and from 45 to 25 percent on chilled beef. Also, China has agreed to accept all beef that is accompanied by a USDA certificate of wholesomeness. These are opportunities Missouri cattlemen want to embrace. Under the agreement, U.S. cattlemen gain parity with those in other countries to compete for a beef market that covers about a quarter of the world's consumers and is virtually wide-open for growth. I know that if Missouri farmers and ranchers are given the opportunity to compete on these fair terms, they will succeed. 
   The WTO agreement could also help Missouri's manufacturing industry. Missouri's manufactured exports to China are broadly diversified, with almost every major product category registering exports to the Chinese market including processed foods, textiles, apparel, wood and paper products, chemicals, rubber and plastics, metal products, industrial machinery, computers, electronics, and transportation equipment. 
   Missouri's exports to China are from all across the state and include a variety of small and mid-sized companies. Sales to China from St. Louis totaled $93 million in 1998, a 92 percent increase since 1993. Kansas City posted exports to China of $66 million in 1998, an increase of 169 percent since 1993. The exports from the Springfield area grew by 42 percent between these years. Clearly, however, these numbers could increase much more if China's market becomes truly open--if China keeps its promises outlined in the WTO agreement. 
   I certainly do not claim to know exactly how changes in trade policy, such as China's WTO membership, will translate into real changes for people on a day-to-day basis, so I have set up a Missouri Trade Council to advise me on issues such as this. I would like to share a few of their thoughts. 
   Gastineau Log Homes, in New Bloomfield, wants to see if it can tap into China's demand for American-style homes, by providing U.S. engineering expertise and the materials with which to make them. 
   In Ava, MO, the Copeland plant (a subsidiary of Emerson Electric) explained how opening markets to one-fourth of the world's population can create jobs and substantially impact local communities. The Ava facility supplies the key components (scroll sets) for air-conditioning compressors. This plant would receive the benefits of the November agreement for these scroll sets by a reduction in industrial tariffs from 25 percent to 10 percent. Also, trading and distribution rights would be phased in over three years, so that Emerson Electric could distribute its scroll sets and compressors broadly, not just to its Suzhou plant, but to all distributors in China. And, Emerson Electric will be given the opportunity to service their products and establish service networks. The Copeland management has high expectations about sending their products to China. Right now, 40 percent of the plant's manufactured equipment goes to Asia, and the manager is expecting that percentage to nearly double. By 2003, exports to Asia well could be about 85 percent, and half of those exports are expected to go to Suzhou. Currently, the Ava plant employs about 350 Missourians, and the workforce is expected to double by 2003. 
   After reviewing China's WTO accession agreement and examining its probable impact on Missouri businesses and farmers, I believe that while the agreement does not give the United States complete reciprocity, it does make substantial progress on China's commitment to open its markets. However, the U.S.-China trade relationship must also have accountability. On the second issue--the enforceability of the agreement--I have more serious misgivings about the impact of granting PNTR to China. 
   The United States government has a responsibility to see that trade agreements we enter into are enforceable and enforced. My goal is to ensure that workers, farmers, and ranchers in Missouri receive the benefits promised to them through our international trade agreements. 
   Unfortunately, there is a combination of factors that I find discouraging, and that I believe underscores the need to make changes to broader U.S. trade policy. These included China's record of noncompliance with its trade commitments, the United States' loss of leverage in the WTO to get cases enforced, and China's propensity to be a protectionist market like the EU which has repeatedly blocked imports of American agriculture. 
   China's record of living up to its trade agreements has been dismal. China has frequently opened a door to U.S. companies only to frustrate their attempts to walk through it. For example, in the early 1990s, China reduced the import tariff on U.S. apples from 40 to 15 percent. However, by 1996, China had erected new backdoor barriers on apples and other agricultural products that U.S. exporters say were even more punitive than the original import tariffs. 
   Another example is the 1992 Market Access Agreement in which China agreed to eliminate trade barriers to U.S. agriculture, manufactured products, and automobiles. Not only did China fail to comply with this agreement, the Chinese actually made negative changes that put U.S. businesses in a worse position than they were in prior to the agreement. For instance, the U.S. Trade Representative reported that on 176 items, import restrictions were abolished. However, the Chinese replaced those 176 old restrictions with 400 new restrictions that essentially make it harder for U.S. companies to export to China. The 1999 U.S. Trade Representative report said: ``By 1999, China had removed over 1,000 quotas and licenses. . . . But there are indications that China is erecting new barriers to restrict imports.'' Also, China adopted a new auto policy only two years after signing the Market Access Agreement that put auto manufacturers at a severe disadvantage compared to Chinese auto workers. 
   I agree that China's record of noncompliance, considered alone, should not be dispositive of determining how to vote on PNTR. In fact, the Administration says that we have nothing to lose by allowing China into the WTO because by doing so, China agrees to ``deeper and broader'' commitments, and the United States gets the benefits of the WTO dispute settlement system to enforce those commitments. However, I believe the proponents of PNTR have left out an important aspect of this ``deal''--when the United States approves PNTR, we give up our ability to unilaterally retaliate against China if China doesn't live up to its commitments, and must instead rely on the WTO dispute resolution system. Unfortunately, the WTO dispute resolution 
   procedures have been inadequate to enforce our rights in past cases where the United States has successfully challenged unfair trade practices of other countries. 
   One of my constituents wrote the following:  
   Granting PNTR will . . . reduce our ability to use unilateral tools to respond to continued Chinese failure to live up to its commitments. Our ability to take unilateral action is our only leverage against the Chinese government. Proponents of PNTR admit that only by using unilateral actions we were able to make even modest progress on intellectual property rights. The Chinese government has not lived up to the promises they made in every single trade agreement signed with the U.S. in the past ten years.  
   This Missourian is absolutely correct. While the process for getting a WTO Panel Decision issued has become  more favorable to the United States, the ability to enforce Panel Decisions has been diminished. 
   In 1994, when the United States negotiated the WTO, the United States gave up the right to threaten higher levels of retaliation. The new standard is much more limited. The pre-1994 standard allowed a successful party (country) to impose a level of retaliation that was ``appropriate in the circumstances'' in relation to the violation proved. However, now we are bound retaliation levels that the WTO decides is ``equivalent to the nullification or impairment.'' This new standard has impaired our ability to enforce successful decisions, such as the one involving the export of U.S. beef to Europe. 
   The detrimental effect of this loss of leverage on our ability to demand implementation of favorable WTO decisions is illustrated by the U.S.-EU beef case. The WTO authorized retaliation of only $120 million by the United States to address the EU's closed beef market. Compare this figure with the $4.6 billion the United States threatened against China when we were not bound by the WTO retaliation levels. I am not suggesting that the United States should use retaliation levels that are disproportionately harsh. I favor multilateral mechanisms to determine noncompliance with trade agreements. But I believe that once the United States has been successful in challenging another country's trade barriers, retaliation should be authorized to ensure enforcement. Denying the U.S. adequate tools to enforce a decision is similar to denying a plaintiff a judgment in a case he won. ``Winning'' just for the sake of being called the winner is not the objective when pursuing a WTO enforcement decision. U.S. ranchers want to sell beef to the EU not just be told by the WTO that the EU is violating its agreements. And, if China fails to comply with its commitments in the future, we will need to have the tools to enforce our rights. 
   We need a policy that ensures results, not just paper promises. Missourians want some guarantee that inviting China into the WTO will result in enhanced export opportunities, not just never-ending litigation. To address the enforcement issue, I have taken a number of steps including the following. 
   I worked directly with former Commerce Secretary Daley to set up a ``China Compliance and Enforcement Initiative'' within the Department of Commerce. At a Commerce Committee hearing, I told Secretary Daley that this would be my top priority. In response the Enforcement Initiative was set up, which does the following: 
   Establishes a Deputy Assistant Secretary for China devoted to monitoring and enforcement of China's trade agreements; 
   Sets up a rapid response team of 12 compliance trade specialists based in Washington, D.C. and in China; 
   Provides U.S. businesses and others with detailed information about China's accession commitments, contact names, and up-to-date information on China's laws and regulations; 
   Implements an accelerated investigation procedure to encourage China's compliance without having to initiate a WTO case (within 14 days of receiving a complaint about China's noncompliance, the rapid response team will engage Chinese officials and try to come to a resolution of the issue within 90 days); 
   Gives U.S. companies a head start in the Chinese market by launching a trade promotion campaign, including missions, seminars, and trade shows; 
   Closely monitors imports from China to ensure that our trade laws are enforced. 
   Second, I am involved in an effort to get the Continued Dumping Act (S. 61) passed so that China will be unable to continually flood U.S. markets with unfair imports. This legislation provides for the penalties to be given to the injured industry in the United States if China continues to unfairly dump its products into the U.S. market after a decision has been made and penalties have been imposed. This bill would provide a powerful disincentive to foreign producers who dump their products in our market because it would give a financial benefit to U.S. manufacturers. 
   Third, I introduced the ``SHOW-ME'' Act (S. 2548), which says that the United States should retain a more liberal standard of retaliation in the WTO for China. This is a principle I support for the WTO in general. If the United States has completed all of the required steps by initiating, arguing, and winning a case in the WTO, we should first give the other country some time to implement this WTO decision. However, if the country continues to disregard a decision that has been made by a neutral panel in the WTO, the United States should have greater flexibility when setting levels of retaliation. I support a policy that will give the United States more tools for enforcement, as opposed to reducing the amount available, which is unfortunately where recent trade negotiations have taken us. 
   Along these same lines, I introduced the WTO Enforcement Act (S. 1073), which would ensure that U.S. businesses and farm interests are widely represented and heard during every stage of the WTO dispute settlement process, especially when it is necessary to threaten retaliation in order to enforce a WTO panel decision in their favor. 
   Fifth, I have worked with newly-appointed Commerce Secretary Mineta to make trade enforcement a top priority during the remainder of this Administration. Specifically, I have communicated with Secretary Mineta my goal of attaining added flexibility for the United States in order to enforce our rights. Secretary Mineta ensured me in meetings and at a Commerce Committee hearing that this would be a priority. I am pleased to quote from his most recent statement about the issue:  
   As we have recently discussed, I share your concerns about enforcement of dispute resolution cases under the WTO and the available means of retaliation. . . . I will make one of my top priorities enforcement of our trade laws and compliance with our trade agreements, particularly the WTO. Our goal must be to ensure that panel decisions are faithfully implemented. Let me assure you that I will work closely with you and members of the Administration to find effective means of retaliation when decisions are not property implemented.  
   These are some of the initiatives I have recently undertaken to address Missourians'--and my own--concerns with China's past noncompliance record and our ability to enforce agreements in the future. I believe the job of opening markets begins, not ends, with the signing of agreements and the approval of PNTR for China. I know we have a continuing and great responsibility to ensure that America's farmers, ranchers, workers, and businesses receive the full benefit of the agreements that have been negotiated on their behalf. I embrace this responsibility on behalf of the millions of Missourians who are impacted by this vote and this issue. I am committed to monitor China's compliance with our trade agreements and demand action if they fail to keep their promises. In addition, I will continue to encourage this Administration, and the next, to be vigilant about enforcing our rights. Missourians deserve the opportunity to export their products according to the terms promised in agreements. 
   In closing, Mr. President, I would like to reiterate the fact that there is, quite frankly, a declining satisfaction in America's heartland with our ability--or inability--to open foreign markets. The only way we will rebuild confidence in trade agreements is by real enforcement of existing agreements, not by entering into newer, more unreliable ones. 
   It is time for U.S. trade policy to be fortified with a strong foundation--that of real enforcement. It is time that our policies lead to job creation in practice, not just in theory. It is simply unacceptable for the Chinese to repeatedly repackage the same deal with a new label and not live up to the commitments it makes. 
   I will continue to work with all parties to fashion fair trade policies with China and all our trading partners to increase Missourians' access to world markets, which will create more jobs and a stronger economy. As a Senator from the Show Me State, I believe China, and other WTO members, need to show us that they are serious about living up to trade agreements. I will continue to work toward this goal.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President. I rise today to give honor to and remember the life of William F. Askew. Bill devoted his life to his nation, his family and to delivering the comfort of the Lord's word to the hearts of all those he touched. 
   Bill enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1942 and served in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II. He also served in the Florida National Guard during the Korean Conflict. Bill married Doris Dillman in June, 1946, and together they had 9 children. Bill was the founding pastor of Arlington Heights Baptist Church in Jacksonville, Florida, for 15 years, before moving to Springfield's Noble Hill Baptist Church where he pastored for the next 26 years. In 1995, Bill retired from the pastorate, but continued to touch the lives of young people with the love of God by serving as the foundations class teacher at New Life Baptist Church. 
   Bill understood that preaching God's word meant more than speaking from the pulpit on Sunday; it meant action as well. Bill participated in Springfield and area community activities. He served as a longtime member of the Springfield Northside Betterment Association and the Breakfast Club of the Ozarks. He served as General Manager of a 100,000 watt Christian Radio Station, KWFC, in Springfield since it first opened in 1968. And with all these activities, he still found time to be a member of the teaching faculty at Baptist Bible College. 
   Bill's devotion to the Savior was his most prominent feature and shapes the legacy that he leaves with his 9 children, 34 grandchildren and 14 great grandchildren.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Senior Care Safety Act of 2000. This bill prohibits nursing homes and other long-term care facilities operating under the Social Security and Medicaid systems from employing individuals with a demonstrated history of violent, criminal behavior or drug dealing. To that end, it requires these nursing facilities to conduct criminal background checks on all of their prospective employees as part of the hiring process. Nursing facilities that fail to conduct a background check prior to hiring an employee are subject to a civil fine of up to $5,000. The reason for these requirements is simple: we must ensure that our most defenseless senior Americans--those in need of long-term nursing care--are attended not by people with a demonstrated history of violent, criminal behavior, but by the most qualified and trustworthy individuals available. 
   The Senior Care Safety Act provides nursing facilities with the tools necessary to accomplish this objective. It requires the Department of Justice to open federal databases of criminal background information to nursing homes so that they can promptly determine if prospective employees have a criminal record. The act provides that the Department of Justice provide this information without charge to the facility or the applicant. Furthermore, it ensures that those who comply with the background check requirement are insulated from liability for refusing to hire someone prohibited from working in a nursing facility by this provision. Finally, it guarantees the privacy of those individuals who are denied such employment due to a criminal record by prohibiting the use by a nursing facility of an individual's background information for any purpose other than complying with this act. 
   It is tragic that a bill like this is necessary. But, while the overwhelming majority of those who care for the more than 40,000 senior citizens receiving 24-hour care in my home state of Missouri, and the more than 1.5 million of such seniors nationwide are dedicated and caring individuals, there are unfortunately too many examples of those who take advantage of this position of trust. There are far too many stories of convicted violent felons who have slipped through the cracks in the hiring process and have physically or mentally abused our frailest citizens in the very institutions that their families have entrusted them for care. This bill will play an important role in ensuring that when a family entrusts  their loved ones to a nursing facility, they can rest assured that those who are looking after them are not violent felons. I look forward to working with my fellow Senators to pass this important legislation in the time remaining this year.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the International Consumer Safety Information Act. As we are all aware, there has been a tragic loss of life associated with defects in Firestone tires. 
   The loss of 88 lives in the United States alone from defects in Firestone tires is extremely tragic. The death toll in other countries from this U.S. product is reportedly more than 50. Each of these people had dreams that will not be realized. There is nothing we can do that will ever compensate for the loss of one life. 
   However, we have a responsibility to the American people and to consumers worldwide to do everything we can to create accountability and to ensure that innocent people are not put at such a high risk in the future. By quickly alerting consumers about motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment recalls around the globe, we will equip people with potentially life-saving information. 
   American consumers should be provided with immediate, life-saving information on motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment recalls, regardless of whether the recall originated in the United States or another country. As the chairman of the Consumer Affairs and Foreign Commerce Subcommittee, I intend to do what I can on this issue. My consumer protection plan would provide consumers--via the Internet--with more immediate information about recalls of motor vehicles or motor vehicle equipment. 
   U.S. drivers are just not finding out about the Firestone tire defects, but there were tire failures in Venezuela as far back as 1998, and in Saudi Arabia, 1999. It is simply unacceptable that American officials abroad did not inform the American public. My proposal would ensure that this does not happen again. 
   Under the legislation I am introducing today, the President would negotiate an international agreement requiring foreign countries and the United States to maintain an Internet site to inform consumers worldwide of recalls of motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment. My bill includes the following key provisions: 
   The international agreement would have countries include on an Internet site the names of companies that have issued recalls, the companies' contact information, the specific products that are being recalled, the countries in which the recalls are effective, and the date of the recall. 
   In addition, the international agreement would set up guidelines for a company that initiate a recall of motor vehicle or motor vehicle equipment to ensure that they disclose all relevant information to consumers and federal authorities in all countries it sells its products. 
   Finally, the bill would make the Administration accountable for disclosing information on foreign recalls by ensuring that Congress is notified and by posting the information on an Internet site for the public. 
   It is my hope that the Senate Commerce Committee will act quickly on this measure. At a Commerce Committee hearing this last Tuesday, I pointed out another harm that can come from a lack of adequate information about recalls. 
   Almost half of all Ford Explorers, which was a model that used defective Firestone tires, that are assembled in the U.S. are made at a plant in Hazelwood, Missouri. I want to visit the workers employed at this plant. The plant has been closed the past two weeks and will not reopen to assemble the popular Ford Explorer until next Monday. Most of the 2,000 workers are not reporting to work and are unsure about their future. Their overtime is nonexistence, and due to the 15,000 Explorers that will not be produced, their profit-sharing is threatened. However, they did not complain about Ford's decision to close the plant in order to get tires out to consumers as quickly as possible. In fact, they were proud that the company was willing to take such a drastic measure to serve their customers. Most importantly, they want us all to realize that what we do and what we say up here makes a difference. It makes a difference in their lives, and it affects consumer confidence in the produce these workers sweat and toil to produce. 
   My efforts today are intended to shine light on recalls worldwide. Consumers should know if there are recalls in other countries, and the Federal government should facilitate this transparency. The bill I am introducing today will hopefully ensure that consumers in the U.S.--and consumers worldwide--obtain updated information about recalls around the globe.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, as this body discusses the China Non-proliferation amendment, I would like to comment briefly on Chinese actions that have not only damaged the national security of the United States, but are antithetical to the peace and stability of the entire world--weapons of mass destruction and missile proliferation. I am dismayed that the government of the People's Republic of China has consistently brutalized its own population, intimidated its neighbors, and provided the world's most dangerous technology to ``States of Concern''--in direct violation of international agreements, domestic law, and fundamental international standards of behavior. It is time for the Senate to speak in a clear, definitive voice against China's actions. 
   The facts are that China has provided nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons technology, along with ballistic and cruise missiles to ``States of Concern''--previously referred to as ``Rogue Nations''--including Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, North Korea, and Algeria. Congress should not stand idly by as China continues these practices. Passage of the China Non-Proliferation amendment is a prudent step in the right direction to address this problem. The amendment is both a reasonable and measured response to the serious situation that this Administration has allowed to continue. 
   While I prefer to see this bill, the China Non-proliferation Act, passed as a separate measure and not as an amendment to the China-Permanent Normal Trade Relations, PNTR, bill, it is now clear that the critical and timely nature of this issue, combined with the counterproductive actions of those trying to prevent its consideration, have left us in the position of having to vote on this today. I reject the notion that a vote on this amendment is a vote against granting PNTR to China. This is simply not the case. The Thompson amendment will not kill PNTR or even place conditions on granting PNTR for China. This amendment will simply stem the flow of unauthorized information on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons technology by creating real consequences for proliferating countries. I believe that these consequences, coupled with strong leadership by the Executive Branch, can dramatically slow proliferation. 
   Senator THOMPSON's amendment addresses proliferation concerns by requiring the President to submit a report to Congress identifying every person, company, or governmental entity of the major proliferating nations--China, Russia, and North Korea are currently on this list--against which credible evidence exists that the entity contributed to the design, development, production, or acquisition of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or ballistic or cruise missiles by a foreign person. Based on this report, the President would then be required to impose specific measures against foreign companies in these countries who have been identified as proliferators. For example, under this amendment if a Chinese company provided nuclear technology to Iran, the United States would deny all pending licenses and suspend all existing licenses for the sale of military items and military-civilian dual-use items and technology as controlled under the Commerce Control List to that company. Additionally, the President would be required to impose an across-the-board prohibition on any U.S. government purchases of goods or services from, and U.S. government assistance, including grants, loans, credits, or guarantees, to this company. 
   In addition to the mandatory sanctions imposed on proliferating foreign  companies, the amendment would also authorize the President to impose discretionary measures against the key supplier countries. Foreign companies do not act alone in the proliferation of weapons; it is quite clear that China, Russia, and North Korea all actively support proliferation activities, and therefore must be held accountable for their actions. This amendment recognizes this truth and would empower the President to apply discretionary measures against them as well, such as: 
   Suspension of all military-to-military contacts and exchanges between the covered country and the United States; 
   Suspension of all United States assistance to the covered country by the United States Government; 
   Prohibition on the transfer or sale or after-sale servicing, including the provision of replacement parts, to the covered country or any national of the covered country of any item on the United States Munitions List, which includes all military items, and suspension of any agreement with the covered country or any national of the covered country for the co-development or co-production of any item on the United States Munitions List. 
   Suspension of all scientific, academic, and technical exchanges between the 
   covered country and the United States; 
   Prohibition on the transfer or sale to the covered country or any national of the covered country of any item on the Commerce Control List, which includes military-civilian dual-use items, that is controlled for national security purposes and prohibition of after-sale servicing, including the provision of replacement parts for such items; 
   Denial of access to capital markets of the United States by any company owned or controlled by nationals of the covered country; 
   Prohibition on the transfer or sale to the covered country or any national of the covered country of any item on the Commerce Control List and prohibition of after-sale servicing, including the provision of replacement parts for such items. 
   Due to the highly sensitive national security issues involved in cases of proliferation, any of the sanctions can be waived by the President if he determines: (1) that the person did not engage in the proliferation activities; (2) that the supplier country was taking appropriate actions to penalize entities for acts of proliferation and to deter future proliferation; or (3) that such a waiver was important to the national security of the United States. 
   I believe that these measures, affecting both the proliferating company and country, if applied consistently and fairly by the President, can and will stem the serious problem of weapons proliferation. China, along with Russia and North Korea, must understand that there are real consequences for continuing this reckless behavior, and the United States must take a stand and lead the charge to stop such proliferation. Passage of the Thompson amendment will accomplish that goal. 
   A firm stand against proliferation is desperately needed. Chinese proliferation, along with that of Russia and North Korea, is continuing unabated to the detriment of America's national security. It is well documented that China has provided sensitive technology to at least seven States of Concern, including Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, North Korea, and Algeria. Most of these states have explicitly threatened the security of the United States and actively sponsored terrorism. The remaining countries are in regions where war is commonplace and the consequences for the use of WMD would be especially devastating. Of these proliferation cases, the two most horrendous cases are Pakistan and Iran. 
   Pakistan is a nation of tremendous unrest and instability, and China has provided it with extensive nuclear and missile technology. Born in conflict, Pakistan was created with India out of one people and one territory, and conflict has defined this nation throughout its history. Pakistan fought three wars and numerous border skirmishes against India, its principal adversary. These battles have been mostly fought over the hotly contested Kashmir region bordering northeast Pakistan. The Kashmir conflict is widely accepted by International Affairs and Defense experts as one of the most likely conflicts to erupt into a nuclear war. China, to a great extent, has not only fostered the conflict through political posturing and land-grabbing, but it has also provided the nuclear weapons that would be used in such a war. China continues to provide critical nuclear and missile related technology to Pakistan, thereby further escalating the arms race and underlying conflict. 
   In May 1998, India and Pakistan tested a total of eleven nuclear devices. This ushered Pakistan into--and reestablished India as part of--the world's most exclusive club of nuclear weapon states. Although India's nuclear program was created from mostly indigenous sources, Pakistan's nuclear program was purchased from the People's Republic of China. A recently declassified Central Intelligence Agency report states that during the early 1980's, China provided Pakistan blueprints of a full Chinese nuclear design that was tested in 1966. It appears it took Pakistan almost 20 years to test a weapon because they had difficulty translating the blueprints from Chinese. 
   Since the 1980's, China has consistently provided Pakistan additional nuclear components and missiles. China has operated the Pakistani Cowhide Uranium-enrichment plant (needed for nuclear weapons production), provided designs for additional bombs and reactors, sold weapons grade uranium, sold 5,000 ring magnets for a nonsafeguarded nuclear enrichment program, and continues to provide assistance to nuclear facilities that are not safeguarded by the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA. The IAEA ensures that nuclear facilities are not producing nuclear weapons grade material. 
   China has also provided Pakistan with complete nuclear-capable missile and missile components. The most widely reported missile transfers are the M-11 missile, also 
   called the CSS-7 or Ababeel. This nuclear capable missile, designed and produced in China, has a 300-kilometer range--placing many highly populated Indian cities at risk. Although it is unclear how many M-11s Pakistan currently possesses, it appears that China has been providing these missiles for almost a decade. 
   Pakistan's nuclear-capable Medium Range Ballistic Missiles, (MRBM), named Ghauri and Shaheen, were developed as a result of extensive Chinese technology and assistance. The Ghauri has a quoted range of 1500 km, but during the actual flight test, the Ghauri flew only 600 km. Even at this shorted range, some of India's largest cities, including New Delhi and Bombay, would be at risk. The Shaheen, although not flight tested, is reported to have a range of 700 km, making its strike distance comparable to the Ghauri. 
   What is especially disturbing is that this is just the beginning of the Chinese proliferation record regarding Pakistan. These transfers have allowed Pakistan to amass an incredibly capable and frightening nuclear and missile force. These transfers are in direct violation of international and domestic law. It is apparent that China and Chinese businesses have violated the Missile Technology Control Regime, the Arms Export Control Act, the Export Administration Act, the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Export-Import Bank Act, and the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act. 
   With all these violations of international and domestic law, one must ask the question, ``What has the Clinton Administration done to stem the flow of nuclear and missile technology?'' The answer is sadly, ``very little.'' The Clinton Administration imposed only mild sanctions on China for providing the M-11 technology. However, these sanctions were quickly lifted when China ``agreed'' not to continue providing missile technology to Pakistan. Despite this ``agreement,'' China has not stopped the provision of missile and nuclear technology. 
   I am troubled that the President seems to have accepted Chinese promises and reassurances without thoroughly examining the facts. For example, a July 1997, CIA report concluded that ``China was the single most important supplier of equipment and technology for weapons of mass destruction'' worldwide, and that China continues to be Pakistan's ``primary source of nuclear-related equipment and technology. . .'' The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai, responded characteristically to these charges by stating that ``China's position on nuclear proliferation is very  clear . . . It does not advocate, encourage, or engage in nuclear proliferation, nor does it assist other countries in developing nuclear weapons. It always undertakes its international legal obligations of preventing nuclear proliferation . . . China has always been cautious and responsible in handling its nuclear exports and exports of materials and facilities that might lead to nuclear proliferation.'' The Clinton Administration was apparently reading from the Chinese script when Peter Tarnoff, Under Secretary of State, said during a Congressional hearing that, `` ......we (the United States) have absolutely binding assurances from the Chinese, which we consider a commitment on their part not to export ring magnets or any other technologies to unsafeguarded facilities . . . The negotiating record is made up primarily of conversations, which were detailed and recorded, between US and Chinese officials.'' With the overwhelming evidence, it is mystifying that the Chinese spokesman could make such statements with a straight face, and it is extremely disappointing that the Administration apparently took China at its word. 
   More than one and half billion people live in South Asia. I believe that Pakistan would not be in the position to start a nuclear war without Chinese assistance. Although we cannot reverse proliferation in Pakistan, we can, and should, take a stand to stop further transfers to Pakistan and other countries through passage of the China Non-Proliferation Act. Without taking a stand here, what will stop China from providing nuclear and missile technology to Palestine, or Sudan, or the renowned terrorist Osama Bin Ladan? The United States must take the lead, as the world's only Superpower, and stand against nuclear proliferation, which damages the security of the entire nation. 
   Not only has China provided nuclear and missile technology to the dangerous and unstable region of South Asia, China has provided sensitive technology to Iran. Iran has been identified by U.S. government agencies, organizations, and entities, along with independent national security experts, as one of the major threats to US security. Iran's threat stems from several significant factors including its large population and armed forces; its geo-strategic and political location in the Middle East--along the straits of Hormuz and the Caspian Sea; an Islamic fundamentalist government; a drive to obtain weapons of mass destruction along with their associated delivery vehicles; 
   stated opposition to the United States and United States' national interests; opposition to the Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process; the de-stabilization of Lebanon--Israel's northern neighbor; and the use and sponsorship of terrorism in its own country and around the world. Due to these facts, the idea of providing nuclear, biological, chemical, and missile technology to Iran seems unbelievable, but it is a sad reality. 
   According to a 1999 CIA report, ``Iran remains one of the most active countries seeking to acquire Weapons of Mass Destruction, WMD, and Advanced Conventional Weapons, ACW, technology from abroad. In doing so, Tehran is attempting to develop an indigenous capability to produce various types of weapons--nuclear, chemical, and biological--and their delivery systems.'' Iran is obtaining much of this technology from China and Russia. 
   The CIA report continues, ``for the second half of 1999, entities in Russia, North Korea, and China continued to supply the largest amount of ballistic missile-related goods, technology, and expertise to Iran. Tehran is using this assistance to support current production programs and to achieve its goal of becoming self-sufficient in the production of ballistic missiles. Iran already is producing Scud short-range ballistic missiles, SRBMs, and has built and publicly displayed prototypes for the Shahab-3 medium-range ballistic missile, MRBM, which had its initial flight test in July 1998. In addition, Iran's Defense Minister last year publicly acknowledged the development of the Shahab-4, originally calling it a more capable ballistic missile than the Shahab-3, but later categorizing it as solely a space launch vehicle with no military applications. Iran's Defense Minister also has publicly mentioned plans for a ``Shahab 5.'' Such statements, made against the backdrop of sustained cooperation with Russian, North Korean, and Chinese entities, strongly suggest that Tehran intends to develop a longer-range ballistic missile capability in the near future.'' These longer ranged missiles would be capable of striking targets in Europe and perhaps in the United States. 
   China is ``a key supplier'' of nuclear technology to Iran, with over $60 million annually in sales and at least fourteen Chinese nuclear experts working at Iranian nuclear facilities. In 1991, China supplied Iran with a research reactor capable of producing plutonium and a calutron, a technology that can be used to enrich uranium to weapons-grade. (Calutrons enriched the uranium in the ``Little Boy'' bomb that destroyed Hiroshima, and were at the center of Saddam Hussein's effort to develop an Iraqi nuclear bomb.) In 1994, China supplied a complete nuclear fusion research reactor facility to Iran, and provided technical assistance in making it operational. China also continues to work with two Iranian nuclear projects, a so-called ``research reactor'' and a zirconium production facility. It is well documented that China has provided Iran ``considerable'' chemical and biological weapon-related production equipment and technology. China has also provided sensitive ballistic missile technology for Iran's growing missile capability. Among other transfers, in 1994, China provided hundreds of missile guidance systems and computerized machine tools. This is just the beginning of Chinese proliferation to Iran. 
   The sad fact is that Iran would not have these capabilities without Chinese assistance and American inaction. Although these transfers violate almost every non-proliferation law on the books, the Clinton Administration has only taken small and random acts against selected Chinese companies. These meaningless acts have done nothing to stem the proliferation, and without stronger laws, Chinese proliferation will continue. 
   It is time for the United States to respond with authority to the continued threat of weapons proliferation. Although we need a President who is willing to lead, we also need more effective laws mandating the President to impose sanctions on foreign companies when they engage in proliferation, and authorizing him to take actions against nations violating international law. This is what the China Non-Proliferation Act will do, and I support passage of this amendment.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, E-commerce is growing at an unprecedented rate--$8 billion last year. With this increase in online purchases, we have made more products and services available to Americans--regardless of where they live. We are working to bridge the digital divide so all Americans, even low income and rural Americans can benefit from the opportunities the Internet provides. However, one thing we don't want to make ubiquitous is Internet fraud. Along with convenience, easy price comparisons, and limitless selection--this new medium also has provided a new opportunity to those who make their living defrauding the public. Fraud over the Internet, just as fraud over telephone lines and mail, is an increasing problem. 
   In 1998, Congress passed the Telemarketing Fraud Prevention Act. I, like the rest of my colleagues recognized this problem and supported that effort. That law builds upon other federal laws that deal directly with telemarketing fraud. The 1998 law stiffened penalties for telemarketing fraud by toughening the sentencing guidelines--especially for crimes against the elderly. It requires criminal forfeiture to ensure the fruits of telemarketing crime are not used to commit further fraud, mandates victim restitution to ensure victims are the first ones compensated, adds conspiracy language to the list of telemarketing fraud penalties, and helps law enforcement zero in on quick-strike fraud operations by giving them the authority to move more quickly against suspected fraud. 
   While I supported that law, I believe we need to do more. According to the National Consumers League, consumers lost over $3.2 million to Internet fraud last year. This is a 38 percent increase from 1998. The actual figure probably is much higher, since this number reflects only those who reported incidents to the National Consumer League's Fraud Watch. While it is true consumer protection laws under the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission have been interpreted to cover Internet fraud--those laws are inadequate. Therefore, today, I am introducing a bill, An Act to Prevent Internet Fraud and Fraud Against the Elderly, to ensure that Internet fraud also is covered by federal criminal laws. It is important to me that the stiffer penalties contained in the Telemarketing Fraud Prevention Act for those targeting the elderly also cover fraud perpetrated over the Internet. 
   Through work I have done over the last year, I have seen first hand the tragic results of schemes targeting our elderly. I held a hearing in the Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on  Consumer Affairs and heard heart breaking testimony about scam artists--targeting the elderly--who are maybe the worst criminals on the planet. They target people, who in the twilight of their lives may lose their life savings, their independence and their dignity. I held events in Missouri, with the regional director of the Federal Trade Commission, educating those most venerable to these schemes on how to avoid becoming a victim. According the National Consumers League, seniors are the target for more than 20 percent of Internet fraud. Although this is lower than the 56 percent of seniors targeted by unscrupulous telemarketers, the number will only increase as more and more of our seniors begin to use the Internet. 
   I strongly believe that education is crucial. That is why this bill also containing provisions giving the FTC the charge of educating our elderly. They currently have the largest network of information on fraud schemes. Through their Sentinel website, they have connected law enforcement agencies all over the world--giving them the ability to act quickly. In addition, they currently have the network in place designed to educate consumers on all areas of consumer protection law. 
   The bill I am introducing today will expand current law to include the same crimes committed over the Internet. As now, fraud cases would be divided between the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Missouri for taking point on this very important measure that will protect a livelihood and a set of very essential opportunities that exist in downstream States. To send a surge of water downstream in the spring, when we are already at risk of flooding, could hurt the capacity of our farmers to produce. And then to compound the injury and add the insult of making the shipping of what they produce difficult, or impossible, or not competitive, would be very damaging. 
   Over half of the people in my State of Missouri drink water from the Missouri River. We have come to rely on it as a resource. This doesn't detract from the overall ability to measure and evaluate what happens on the river. It simply says that prior to the plan we are not going to authorize a spring surge which would add flooding and jeopardize the livelihood of many individuals in Missouri and other States that border the Missouri River.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill to grant the consent of Congress to the Kansas and Missouri Metropolitan Cultural District Compact. 
   This bill would allow the people in 2002, or after, to consider additional projects which contribute or enhance the aesthetic, artistic, historical, intellectual of social development or appreciation of members of the general public. This definition has been expanded to include sports facilities. This compact has made the restoration of Kansas City's Union Station possible. 
   The original enabling legislation, which passed in 1994 established a bi-state cultural district for the Kansas City metropolitan area of five counties in Western Missouri and Eastern Kansas. This provides a secure source of local funding for metropolitan cooperation across state lines to restore historic structures and cultural facilities. The Federal authority for this bi-state compact expires at the end of 2001. We must see to it that a new compact is approved to continue this successful venture. 
   Mr. President, this legislation does not cost the Federal government any money. It is funded through a 1/8 sales tax, passed by the voters of Jackson, Johnson, Clay and Platte counties, and merely needs Federal approval. This measure is a perfect example of the appropriate relationship between the Federal government and the states. This approval would allow these local communities to make decisions on how--and whether--their tax dollars are to be spent on cultural activities. 
   This bill has bipartisan support in the House of Representatives. The companion legislation, HR 4700, passed the House Judiciary Committee by voice vote and the full House also by voice vote. It is supported by the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce, the Mid-American Regional Council, the Overland Park Chamber of Commerce, Kansas City Area Development Council, Johnson County President's Council, Labor-Management Council of Greater Kansas City, Jackson County Executive, Kansas Governor Bill Graves, and Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan. 
   Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. JEFFORDS, Mr. GRAMM, Mr. MURKOWSKI, Mr. CAMPBELL, Mr. NICKLES, Mr. LOTT, Mr. STEVENS, Mr. FRIST, Mr. DOMENICI, Mr. CRAIG, and Mr. GRAMS):

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Good Samaritan Volunteer Firefighter Assistance Act of 2000. This bill will assist our nation's volunteer firefighters, who daily risk their lives to protect our families, friends and neighbors. The legislation I am introducing will allow volunteer fire departments to accept much needed fire-fighting supplies from manufacturers and others by limiting the liability of companies and fire departments that donate certified surplus equipment. 
   In the United States today, the local fire department is expected to be protector of life, property and environmental safety concerns. Many communities must rely on the capable and courageous men and women in the local volunteer fire department to protect lives and safety. In fact, 75 percent of firefighters in this country are volunteers. Most volunteer departments serve small, rural communities and are quite often the only fire fighting services available for these areas. Unfortunately, one of the largest problems faced by volunteer fire services is lack of sufficient resources. Too often, these departments are struggling to provide their members with adequate protective clothing, safety devices and training programs. 
   In my home state of Missouri, there are approximately 450 fire departments throughout the state that have a budget of less than $15,000 per year. Many have budgets under $7,000/year and there are even some under $2,000/year. After paying insurance premiums, most departments do not even have $5,000 in their operating budgets. This is simply not enough money to purchase new and much needed fire-fighting equipment. In addition, the cost of fire and emergency medical apparatus and equipment has steadily increased over the past 20-30 years. Because of this, volunteer firefighters spend a large amount of time raising money for new equipment; time that could be better spent providing training to respond to emergencies. 
   Fire protection equipment is constantly improving and advancing with new state-of-the-art innovation. Because industry is constantly updating its fire protection, it is not unusual for plants and factories to accumulate surplus fire equipment that is slightly dated, but still effective, and most is almost new, or never used. Despite the excellent condition of most of these surplus items, company attorneys usually refuse to allow donations to fire departments, which desperately need this equipment. Companies routinely destroy surplus equipment to guarantee it will never be used by other firefighters. Pressure bottles for breathing apparatus are cut in half and the regulators buried. Protective fire coats are cut apart. Fire trucks are broken up and sold for scrap. All of this is done to prevent any liability from falling on corporate donors. Approximately $20 million per year in surplus equipment is scrapped, while a lot of rural departments go without the most basic supplies, such as protective clothing. Tragically, each year millions of dollars worth of fire equipment is destroyed instead of donated to these volunteer fire departments. 
   Mr. President, it does not make sense that quality fire-fighting tools are destroyed because of fear of liability by those who wish to donate their unused equipment. According to some estimates, over 800,000 volunteer firefighters nationwide save state and local governments $36.8 billion annually. We need to support the volunteer fire departments, and Congress should start by removing liability barriers that keep volunteer firefighters from receiving perfectly safe, donated equipment. Under this bill a person who donates qualified fire control or fire rescue equipment to a volunteer fire company will not be liable in civil damages in any State or Federal Court for personal injuries, property damage, or death proximately caused by a defect in the equipment. In order to protect firefighters from faulty donated equipment, this bill requires the equipment to be recertified as safe by an authorized technician. The bill does not protect those persons who act with malice, gross negligence, or recklessness in making the donation; nor does it protect the manufacturer of the donated equipment. 
   Mr. President, this bill is supported by a number of firefighting organizations. In States that have removed liability barriers through legislation similar to this, volunteer fire companies have received millions of dollars in quality fire fighting equipment. For example, in 1997, the Texas state legislature passed a bill that limited the liability of companies who donated surplus equipment to fire departments. Prior to passage of this bill, companies in Texas had refrained from donating their used equipment for fear of potential lawsuits. Now, companies donate their surplus equipment to the Texas Forest Service, which then certifies the equipment and passes it on to volunteer fire departments. The donated equipment must meet all original specifications before it can be sent to volunteer departments. The program has already received in excess of six million dollars worth of equipment for volunteer fire departments. 
   Companion legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman CASTLE. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in ending the wasteful destruction of useful fire equipment, saving taxpayer funds, and better equipping our volunteer firefighters to save lives. I am proud to introduce this bill and look forward to working to ensure that the federal government increases its commitment to the men and women who make up our local volunteer fire departments.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, in recent years, our nation has achieved tremendous advances in its War on Cancer--including developing breakthrough therapies and expanding the cancer care delivery system of convenient and low-cost community settings. This progress has enabled us to achieve an unprecedented reduction in American cancer deaths, which began in 1998. 
   Today, 90% of all chemotherapy treatments are delivered in community settings like doctors' offices and outpatient hospital settings. Two important components of Medicare reimbursement for outpatient cancer treatments support these community care sites: payment for drugs themselves; and payment for the services of the physicians, nurses, and other caregivers who treat patients with cancer. 
   Unfortunately, the Health Care Financing Administration has targeted outpatient cancer therapy services for deep budget cuts. HCFA has proposed to reduce drastically Medicare reimbursement rates for cancer drugs by unilaterally changing the definition of ``average wholesale price,'' which is at the heart of the current reimbursement formula. While there are indications that drug reimbursements have often exceeded doctors' and hospitals' costs, these margins have been used to help cover costs for professional services, which are inadequately reimbursed according to the cancer community, the General Accounting Office, and HCFA itself. Yet HCFA has not made any adjustments in these professional services payments. 
   The planned cuts in Medicare reimbursement rates threaten to force doctors to send seniors with cancer out of the community settings where they now receive care and into more expensive in-patient settings. As a result, seniors may lose the option of receiving cancer treatments from the caregivers of their choice in settings that are close to the support structure of family, friends, and community. In addition, since the cost of cancer treatments are generally higher in hospital in-patient settings than they are in outpatient settings, this ill-conceived proposal to force seniors into hospitals will actually cause Medicare spending to rise. 
   Mr. President, I have heard from many Missourians--doctors, patients, and hospital officials--about how the Administration's planned cuts in Medicare outpatient cancer care reimbursement rates will negatively impact patient care. I would like to share with my colleagues what some of them have told me. 
   Dr. Burton Needles of St. Louis wrote to me to say that his patients prefer receiving chemotherapy in his office rather than in the hospital, but that the planned cuts would make it impossible for him to continue treating Medicare cancer patients in his office. On the other side of the state in Kansas City, Dr. Christopher Sirridge said that the result would be less accessible care for seniors with cancer, and even higher costs for the Medicare program. 
   In Columbia, officials at the Ellis Fischel Cancer Center have told me that HCFA's change in reimbursement rates would make it extremely difficult for them to continue to be a source of chemotherapy and supportive care for cancer patients. 
   And, finally, Mr. President, let me share the words of a cancer patient, Darlene Bahr, from St. Louis. Ms. Bahr wrote to me: ``I have been fighting cancer for 18 years. This is the fourth time I have cancer. I have been on a total of four years of chemo, which had been successful. I am now on chemo and hope it will be successful again.'' Ms. Bahr continues: ``If the physician's office and the hospital cannot afford to give me these drugs, where will I get them? Does Medicare want to eliminate cancer care?'' 
   Mr. President, Medicare beneficiaries like Ms. Bahr--who are facing battles against cancer--must not be saddled with the added burden of worrying about whether they will receive the care they need, in the setting they choose. Many doctors have communicated to HCFA and Congress that the Administration's plan to cut payments for cancer-fighting drug treatments will likely prevent doctors from delivering outpatient cancer care--leaving thousands of seniors without this preferred, and lower cost, option. 
   Congress must act to ensure that our progress in cancer treatment is not undermined by bureaucratic, inappropriate changes to Medicare reimbursement rates for cancer care. 
   Therefore, Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Cancer Care Preservation Act, which will guarantee that HCFA cannot implement any reductions to Medicare reimbursement for outpatient cancer treatment unless those changes: are developed in concert  with the General Accounting Office, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, and representatives of the cancer care community, including patients, survivors, nurses, physicians, and researchers; provide for appropriate payment rates for outpatient cancer therapy services, based upon the determinations made by the General Accounting Office; and are authorized by an act of Congress. 
   My legislation also will require GAO to complete a formal nationwide analysis to determine the physician and non-physician clinical resources necessary to provide safe outpatient cancer therapy services. In addition, GAO must determine the appropriate payment rates for such services under the Medicare program. 
   Medicare beneficiaries with cancer must be confident that they will continue to receive the care they need, in the setting they choose, without risk of arbitrary and unexpected reductions in reimbursement that may force their doctors to cease offering treatment or refer them to a different facility for treatment. 
   So today, I urge my colleagues to join with me in ensuring that our seniors receive full access to the life-saving therapies they need in the settings they choose, by cosponsoring the Cancer Care Preservation Act.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an urgent issue of great concern to me. Over the past eighteen months, terrible violence has occurred and is still taking place in Indonesia's Moluccan (Maluku) Islands, focused in the provincial capital of Ambon, and no end is in sight. In this Indonesian province, religious conflict between Christians and Muslims has led to the loss of up to 10,000 lives and the displacement of up to 500,000 people. To my great dismay, the Indonesian government has had little success in protecting Christians. In the Moluccas in the last two years almost 10,000 buildings and churches have been burnt and mass killings go largely unpunished. 
   Since, the situation has intensified with the arrival of members of the Laskar (Jihad) Force. The Laskar Jihad is a group of over 2,000 Muslim militants who sailed to the Moluccas from the main island of Java. Efforts by the United States to keep this group out was in vain. Indonesia adhered to her open inter-island immigration policy and the group was allowed to go to the Moluccas. Due to internal political unrest and continuing economic depression, the police forces and military are unable or unwilling to restore order. The necessity to bring the populace under the rule of law and order has intensified due to some reports that the Muslim Jihad Force has given the Christians in the city of Ambon until July 31st to vacate the city. If they do not leave in compliance with this ultimatum, they probably will be murdered. 
   Mr. President, the Molucca islands, known previously as the Spice Islands, have had a long history of contact and trade with Europe. The Spice Islands  were greatly valued for their nutmeg and clove production. Due to this prolonged and extensive contact, the Moluccas have a much higher percentage of Christians than other parts of Indonesia. Indonesian President Abdurrahaman Wahid supports a policy of tolerance between the two religions, but such cooperation is not forthcoming. A history of heavy-handed authoritarianism, practiced by the Indonesian military under ex-President Suharto, resulted in the suppression of a range of disputes between the two groups. When Suharto's rule collapsed, these arguments were vented, and sectarian violence soon erupted. The spark came in January of 1999, the end of the Muslim month of Ramadan, when a minor incident on Ambon led to 160 deaths and villages burned to the ground. The violence escalated leading to a greater frequency of killings and the destruction of churches and mosques. To further complicate this horrendous situation, the military has not acted consistently neutral in this conflict, aiding Muslims militants against the Christians in several disturbing instances. The situation is desperate. 
   Mr. President, I would like to thank our Secretary of State, Ms. Madeline Albright, for her continuing work with the Indonesian government to alleviate this horrible religious strife in Indonesia. It is important for the United States to vigilantly and immediately pressure the Indonesian government to continue to take steps to restore civil order, foster dialogue between the Christians and the Muslims, and help the communities find a way to peacefully coexist. The U.S. also needs to press Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri to find both short-term and long-term solutions to this problem--for she has expressly been given this task. In addition, the State Department must continue its push to let humanitarian workers and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) into the Moluccas to alleviate some of the human suffering that is occurring as a result of the warfare. The Indonesian government has taken several positive steps towards ending the violence, including the appointment of a Hindu to head the police forces in the area. This nomination, as a gesture of non-partisanship, was a great stride in the right direction. However, we must work to ensure that all actions taken by the police and the military are fair, even-handed, and contribute to stopping the violence. Indonesia has also, to my pleasure, recently mounted a campaign to eject the Jihad Force from the Moluccas. This development should alleviate some of the violence, but the basic problems remain unsolved. The government of Indonesia must do more. In addition, the United States must continue to immediately press for a solution to this bloody situation in the hopes of establishing a peace and stability that would end the persecution of Christians in the Moluccans. Thank you.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for his kindness to me. I certainly am not the one to object to that unanimous consent. I appreciate that very much. 
   I express my unequivocal support, and I rise to do so for the many efforts that we are making in this Congress to reform U.S. policy on embargoes of food and medicine. Now is the time to reevaluate the policies we have engaged in in the past that are perpetuating losses to America. 
   Food embargoes can be summed up as a big loss: a loss to the U.S. economy, a loss of jobs, a loss of markets. For example, embargoed countries buy 14 percent of the world's total rice, 10 percent of the world's total wheat purchases, and the list goes on. 
   When we lose those markets for America, we should have a very good reason. There should be some benefit if we are going to give up access to 14 percent of the world's rice import market, 10 percent of the world's wheat market, for soybean farmers, cattlemen, hog farmers, poultry producers, cotton, and corn farmers. 
   The nation of Cuba, for example, imports about 22 million pounds of pork a year. Someone says that is important to the livestock farmers. Feed that pig corn before exporting it, so it is important to the grain farmers, as well. 
   The embargo causes a loss in America's foreign policy. Often we think we will inflict some sort of pressure or injury on another country and, instead of hurting them, we help them. I don't think there was any more dramatic case of that than the Soviet grain embargo with 17 million tons of grain and those contracts were canceled. Instead of hurting the Soviet Union, they replaced the contracts in the world marketplace at a $250 
   million benefit to the Soviet Union. Instead of hurting the former Soviet Union, we helped the former Soviet Union. That particular weapon was dangerous. Using food and medicine as an embargo is dangerous because that weapon backfires. Instead of hurting our opponent, we helped our opponent. 
   Who did we hurt? We hurt the American farm agricultural community. We hurt the food processing community. We need to make a commitment to ourselves that we need to reform this area of embargoing food and medicine resources. 
   The provision the Senator from Kansas and I and others will likely offer today simply reaffirms what we have been trying to do for some time; that is, to get real reform of humanitarian sanctions. I will cosponsor Senator ROBERTS' and Senator BAUCUS' amendment. I support it fully. However, the amendment should not be necessary. Twice we have passed sanctions reform for food and medicine in the Senate. Why is it necessary to do this a third time? My clear preference is to pass sanctions reform for all countries, not only for Cuba. We should reform the sanctions regime for all countries, not only Cuba, and we should ensure that future sanctions will not be imposed arbitrarily. 
   Last year, the Senate accepted overwhelmingly, by a vote of 70-28, accepted an amendment that I and many of my colleagues offered. That amendment lifts food and medicine sanctions across the board, not only applying the lifting of the sanctions to Cuba. 
   When we went to the House-Senate conference, the democratic process was derailed. We were not voted down. The conference was shut down because the votes were there to affect what the Senate had clearly voted in favor of. That is, the reformulation of our policy in regard to food and medicine embargoes. The conference was shut down by a select few individuals in the Congress who were outside of the conference committee. 
   This reform proposal was then adopted by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I am pleased the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has embraced the concept, which the Senate voted 70-28 in favor of, in spite of the fact this was shot down when the committee was shut down in the conference last year. 
   Once again, this provision passed the Senate this year. Senators DORGAN and GORTON offered it as an amendment in the agricultural appropriations markup, and it was accepted overwhelmingly. 
   Once again, we are faced with a House-Senate conference. It would be very troublesome to me if the democratic process is not allowed to work,  especially after we have seen the will of Congress and the American people. That will is clearly expressed as a will to reform and embrace the reform of sanctions imposed by the President. It has passed the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, and it has passed the Senate twice. Some version of this effort has now passed the House of Representatives and is broadly supported all across America. 
   I hold in my hand a list of about 50 organizations, dozens and dozens and dozens of organizations, including the American Farm Bureau, the National Farmers Union, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Gulf Ports of the Americas Association, the AFL-CIO. That is a pretty broad set of groups that want to reform this practice of embargoes.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. We are today offering yet another amendment because there is concern that the democratic process in the agricultural appropriations House-Senate conference will not be respected. 
   Let me be clear. We would not have to be here today offering this amendment that says ``don't enforce the law,'' if we in the Congress were allowed to change the law, which is the purpose of Congress. 
   If you don't want to change the law, you don't need a Congress. You can have the same laws all the time. We found a law that is not working; we should change the law. This amendment will be a ``don't enforce the law'' amendment, but the truth is, our prior expressions on this are clear. We ought to change the law so we won't have to talk about withdrawing funding for enforcement. 
   My preference is to get this issue resolved in the agricultural appropriations conference and pass embargo reform for all countries and for future sanctions. We need to send real embargo reform to the President's desk this year. That should be our objective. I will support this amendment today which I am cosponsor of, but real reform, and reforming the regime, the framework in which these sanctions are proposed, is what we ought to do. It is what we have done. I believe, ultimately, it is what we will do for the benefit of not only those who work in agriculture and who respect foreign policy but for future generations and the relations of the United States with other countries. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from Arizona, for his remarks in regard to this challenge, especially as it relates to the South Pacific. 
   Today, we have received very troublesome information about parts of Indonesia where there is this kind of tension which is threatening the peace, well-being, and the capacity of individuals to exercise their own religious beliefs in ways they see fit. This troublesome disorder is to be noted and understood, and we should speak out on it. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his remarks.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about something closer to home for me. Perhaps one of the most important things that has ever been known or understood in the economy of Missouri is the Missouri River. It is part of the lifeblood of our State. It transports commerce from one part of the State to another and from our State down through the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico and around the world. 
   There are some troublesome issues regarding the flows in the Missouri River. They relate to the energy and water appropriations bill which includes specific measures relating to language in this year's bill that is identical to language found in previous bills. 
   Under normal Senate procedure once a committee acts and reports out a bill, the bill comes to the floor, and if a Senator does not like a certain provision in the bill, then that Senator has the right to move to strike that position. That is a guaranteed right. 
   However, it appears that one of the provisions, which is totally consistent with language that has been in previous bills regarding flows in the Missouri River system, is not to the liking of some individual Senators. In particular, the minority leader has indicated his opposition to Section 103. Senator DASCHLE has done what he could to prevent debate on this section, and has worked to make sure the bill does not come to the floor at all. 
   That is a harsh and inappropriate way for us to act. If any Senator does not like a provision, then that Senator can move to strike the provision, and the Senate can vote on such a motion. Unfortunately, this election to stall; to interrupt the progress and business of the Senate; to say we do not want to allow a bill to come to the floor as it was reported by the committee and as it has come year after year is a way to interrupt the business of the Senate, is inappropriate. 
   I was pleased that earlier this afternoon the majority leader filed a cloture motion on the energy and water appropriations measure, but it is unfortunate that he had to do so. I regret the majority leader had to take such action, but because the Democrats insisted on stalling the normal legislative process, such action was necessary. 
   The Missouri River and the Mississippi River are the two most valued treasures of Missouri citizens. They are essential for not only transportation in our State but about 40 percent of all the people in our State get their drinking water out of those rivers. They are important for irrigation and for cost-efficient transportation. 
   I have had the privilege through the decades of fighting to protect that resource, not only for human consumption but for transportation as well. As attorney general, I was involved in litigation that went all the way to the Supreme Court. I was pleased to be part of that, to be a moving factor in that litigation which protected our waterflows at that time in the river. 
   I watched as the Missouri River, when it had inadequate flows, paralyzed a community. I remember years ago when I was Governor, an ice bridge developed. This was a natural impairment of the flow north of Missouri in the river and north of the city of St. Joseph. Instead of the water flowing down, the ice jam backed up the water. 
   The river levels fell and a great city such as St. Joseph, MO, was without water. When I went to look at the water intake facility for St. Joseph, I noticed the water was a foot or two below the intake. We worked night and day to get a new pump and a new system of drawing water out of the river. Proper river flows are essential to the well-being of our State. 
   In the committee report of the energy and water appropriations bill, Section 103 prohibits the expenditure of resources to diminish the flow or to otherwise tamper with the flow of the river because the river flows are so essential to the well-being of our State. The Corps' plan for rewriting the way the river will be managed is known as the Missouri River Master Manual. It would send additional surges of water down in the spring, which would cause flooding, and withhold additional water in the fall, which would cause low levels in the river. 
   If you make the level of the river low in the fall, the crop which has been grown can't be shipped as efficiently when there is inadequate river flow for transportation. Of course, you may not have a crop to ship if in the spring you release so much water that you cause widespread flooding. This flooding potential concerns many of our communities. I have worked closely with the rest of the Missouri delegation in the Congress, the Missouri Farm Bureau, and the Mid-America Regional Council 2000. We uniformly oppose management of the river in a way that would cause flooding in the Spring, and then a restriction of the flow of the river in the fall which would make impossible the kind of transportation upon which our farm, agricultural, and other industries must rely.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today, the Senate passed the Conference Report reflecting the agreement between the House and Senate to provide needed relief to American families from the onerous marriage tax penalty. I am pleased to support this agreement. 
   For too long, the current tax code has been at war with our values, penalizing the basic social institution: marriage. The American people know that this is unfair--they know it is not right that the code penalizes marriage. 
   25 million American couples pay an average of approximately $1,400 in marriage penalty annually as a result of the marriage penalty. Ending this penalty will give couples the freedom to make their own choices with their money. 
   The conference agreement between the House and the Senate will make the standard deduction for married couples double that of singles. This is especially important to families that do not itemize their tax returns. It will also make the 15 percent tax bracket double the size of that for single people and fix the marriage penalties associated with the Alternative Minimum Tax and the Earned Income Credit. Doubling the 15 percent tax bracket for married couples will benefit all married couples. It is just and fair that all couples benefit from this bill, whether one spouse works outside the home, or both do so. Most importantly, it will begin to provide this much-needed relief this year, so that the American people will see that their government recognizes and values the institution of marriage. 
   The President has indicated that he will veto this bill. That is unfortunate. If the President is truly for ending the marriage penalty, as he has said, he will sign this bipartisan bill, which passed with the support of 60 percent of the House of Representatives. The Senate has also voted on this bill in a bipartisan manner, approving the Conference Report by a vote of 60-34. I hope the President will change his mind and join us in bringing this historic tax relief to American families. 
   This bill will help 830,000 couples in Missouri, couples like Bruce and Kay Morton, from Camdenton, MO, who have written to me and asked for me to help bring an end to this unfair penalty. With this conference agreement, the House and Senate stand united in trying to help couples like the Mortons. I respectfully ask the President to join us. 
   This conference agreement demonstrates our support for an important principle: that families should not be taxed extra because they are married. Couples choosing marriage are making the right choice for society. It is in our interest to encourage them to make this choice. 
   Unfortunately, the marriage penalty discourages this choice. I believe that the government, in its policies, should uphold the basic values that give strength and vitality to our culture. Marriage is one of those values, and it  is time for the government to stop punishing this value. 
   The marriage penalty has endured for too long and harmed too many couples. It is time to abolish the prejudice that charges higher taxes for being married. It is time to take the tax out of saying ``I do.''

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the current tax code is at war with our values--the tax code penalizes the basic social institution: marriage. The American people know that this is unfair--they know it is not right that the code penalizes marriage. I commend the Senate on the vote we are going to take today to end this long-standing problem. 
   Twenty-five million American couples pay an average of approximately $1,400 in marriage penalty annually as a result of the marriage penalty. Ending this penalty gives couples the freedom to make their own choices with their money. Couples could use the $1,400 for: retirement, education, home, children's needs. 
   This bill will also provide needed tax relief to American families--39 million American married couples, 830,000 in Missouri. Couples like Bruce and Kay Morton, from Camdenton, MO, who suffer from this unfair penalty. Mr. Morton wrote me a note so simple that even a Senator could understand it: ``Please vote yes for the Marriage Tax relief of 2000.'' 
   Another Missourian, Travis Harms, of Independence, Missouri, wrote to tell me that the marriage penalty hits him and his wife, Laura. Mr. Harms graciously offered me his services in ending the marriage penalty. ``I would like to thank you for your support and effort towards the elimination of the unfair `marriage tax.' If there is any way I can support or encourage others to help this dream become a reality, I would be honored to help.'' 
   I am grateful to Travis Harms and Bruce Morton for their support. And I want to repay them by making sure we end this unfair penalty on marriage. 
   The marriage penalty places an undue burden on American families. According to the Tax Foundation, an American family spends more of their family budget on taxes than on health care, food, clothing, and shelter combined. The tax bill should not be the biggest bill families like the Morton's and Harms' face. 
   And families certainly should not be taxed extra because they are married. Couples choosing marriage are making the right choice for society. It is in our interest to encourage them to make this choice. 
   Unfortunately, the marriage penalty discourages this choice. The marriage penalty may actually contribute to one of society's most serious and enduring problems. There are now twice as many single parent households in America than there were when this penalty was first enacted. 
   In its policies, the government should uphold the basic values that give strength and vitality to our culture. Marriage and family are a cornerstone of civilization, but are heavily penalized by the federal tax system. 
   The marriage penalty is so patently unfair no one will defend it. Those on the other side of the aisle are making a stab at addressing the marriage penalty, even though they are not willing to provide relief to all couples who face this unfair penalty. Their bill implements a choose or lose system for some couples who are subject to the marriage penalty. Their bill phases out marriage penalty relief, and does not cover all of the couples who face this unfair penalty. 
   This issue, however, is not about income, it's about fairness. It is unfair to tax married couples more than single people, no matter what their income. The Finance Committee bill provides tax relief to all married couples. 
   In addition, the Finance Committee bill makes sure that couples do not face the risk of differential treatment. Under the minority bill, one family with a husband earning $50,000 and a mother staying home with her children will pay more in taxes than a family with a combined income of $50,000, with the wife and husband each earning $25,000. This system creates a disincentive for parents to stay at home with their children. The Republican plan will treat all couples equally. 
   While the minority bill is flawed, I am encouraged that they are finally acknowledging that the marriage penalty is a problem. I am also encouraged that President Clinton has also acknowledged the unfair nature of the marriage penalty. But unfortunately, Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has announced that he would advise the President to veto marriage penalty relief. 
   I say to the President and to my colleagues on the other side: being against the marriage penalty means that you have to be willing to eliminate it. You cannot just say you oppose the penalty, and then fight to keep the penalty in law, or to keep part of the penalty in law for some people. Join us to vote for the elimination of the penalty, and let us bring this important tax relief bill to the American people together. 
   The marriage penalty has endured for too long and harmed too many couples. It is time to abolish the prejudice that charges higher taxes for being married. It is time to take the tax out of saying ``I do.''

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. Individuals from strong families contribute to the society. It is both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment of ``till death us do part'' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country strong. 
   For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Merrill and Barbara Sindt of Jefferson City, Missouri, who will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary in August. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. The Sindts' commitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.

The longevity of his life has meant much more, however, to the many relatives and friends whose lives he has touched over the last 90 years. 
   Mr. Hinckley's celebration of 90 years of life is a testament to America. His achievements are significant and deserve to be recognized. I would like to join his many friends, relatives, and colleagues in wishing him health and happiness, including rich and fulfilling friendships, in the future. I salute him.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I want to address the amendment which I sent to the desk because for decades, in a business-as-usual context, Washington has constantly invaded various trust funds to spend for a variety of purposes and programs. One of those trust funds was the Social Security trust fund. We spent a lot of time and energy finding a way to protect the Social Security trust fund. 
   Having developed at least a budget rule to protect the Social Security trust fund, I think it is important for us to look to the protection of other trust funds that are important to the well-being of the people of this country and to protect them as well. 
   One of the other trust funds which remarkably has been invaded over and over and over again as a source for spending money for a variety of Government programs has been the Medicare trust fund. For over 30 years, working people have been contributing to the country's welfare by paying the taxes they owe, paying their debts, saving for the future. Those values were rejected inside the beltway when we went into the trust funds in order to meet our spending desires. 
   Washington tried to impose its own rules and values on the rest of the country. These misdirected rules--spending beyond our means, making promises we did not keep, misleading the American people about how their money is being spent--for too long these rules were allowed to continue. We have taken some very strong steps in the right direction. 
   Last year, this Congress took the first step toward stopping this raid on the Social Security trust fund by enacting the Social Security lockbox rule on the budget resolution. That creates a point of order against any budget for spending money out of what would be called the Social Security surplus. The Social Security surplus is pretty easy to understand. It is defined in our accounting as the amount of money that comes into Social Security because of Social Security taxes that aren't required in that year to meet the obligations in that year of Social Security. 
   Obviously, because we have a lot of young people working now, we have far more money coming in than we have going out with the relatively small group of older Americans consuming. In the years ahead, though, when this bulge of young people now contributing to the fund become consumers of the fund, we will need a lot of the money they are sending in. That money they are sending in is called the Social Security surplus. For years we spent that. I worked very hard to stop that spending. I worked to get included in the budget resolution a measure that would make it out of order for the Congress to spend money on other things that was sent in by taxpayers for Social Security purposes. That is the protection of the Social Security surplus. 
   In addition, last year Senator DOMENICI, Senator ABRAHAM, and I tried several times to enact a law, not just a budget rule which we did get put in place, but a law which would protect Social Security proceeds as a statutory measure. Obviously, the President would have to sign it for it to become a law. The President said he wanted a Social Security lockbox, but, unfortunately, despite all the words of support for saving the Social Security surplus and locking away the surplus, the Senate was unable to end the filibuster by Members of the Senate who opposed us and their President on the issue.  
   Despite that opposition, Congress was able to change how business in Washington was done on the Social Security surplus. We are far better off as a result. 
   Last year, for the first time since 1957, not one penny of the Social Security surplus was spent. Again this year, we 
   passed a budget resolution that will not touch the off-budget or Social Security surplus, the Social Security trust fund. It will also provide tax relief for married couples and dedicate over $40 billion over the next 5 years to provide prescription drug coverage for needy, older Americans who receive Medicare. 
   When I saw what we accomplished last year, I knew we could, as well, protect Part A of the Medicare surplus. Part A of Medicare is the only Medicare provision of which there is a trust fund. It is not funded out of the general revenue. It is something people pay specifically their taxes for, with an anticipation that those resources will be available. 
   On November 18 of last year, I introduced S. 1962, the Social Security and Medicare Safe Deposit Box Act. I did this because Social Security is not the only trust fund that has been raised over the recent years, over decades. Over the next 5 years, taxpayers will pay in an estimated $179 billion more into the Medicare Part A trust fund than will be required to sustain the purpose of that trust fund, which is patient hospital care in Medicare. 
   The amendment I offer today will add the Social Security and Medicare Safe Deposit Box Act to this pending bill. The Social Security and Medicare Safe Deposit Box Act takes the Medicare Part A trust fund off budget and creates a permanent 60-vote point of order in the Senate and a majority point of order in the House against any budget resolution or subsequent bill that uses Medicare Part A or Social Security surpluses to finance on-budget deficits. This amendment protects the Medicare Part A surplus in the same way we protect the Social Security surplus. It says that Congress and the President cannot consider the Medicare surplus as part of the on-budget surplus. They can't look to this fund for ordinary spending. Therefore, Congress and the President should be unable to spend the Medicare surplus for additional spending or for additional tax cuts. 
   This lockbox protects the Medicare trust fund from the raids of the past. This is a historic time. I hope this will be a historic day. In this, an election year, we have an unusual bipartisan opportunity to support this measure. It is not surprising that this is the right policy. It is the right thing to do. The House of Representatives has already taken this step to protect the Medicare trust fund from invasion of spending for other Government programs. Last week, the House passed their version, a little different version, of the Medicare lockbox legislation, by a vote of 420-2. The House bill was offered by Representative Wally Herger and opposed by only two House Members. 
   Now, there are a lot of Members of this body who will want to protect, I believe, the Medicare trust fund sustaining the capacity of our Government to provide the hospitalization we have promised to individuals who are eligible for Medicare. I am pleased there are Members of this body who join me in cosponsoring this amendment, one of whom is Senator ABRAHAM from Michigan. He has been active in the lockbox movement to protect Social Security, to make sure that Social Security is not invaded for other spending, and much of the success we have had in protecting every dime of Social Security in the trust fund this year should flow to Senator ABRAHAM of Michigan. I am pleased he has endorsed this and is a cosponsor of this measure with me in the Senate. 
   It is just not several Senators who endorse this. Both the Vice President and the President of the United States have endorsed enactment of a Medicare lockbox such as the one I introduced last November. Earlier this month Vice President GORE announced his support for this kind of proposal. On June 13, GORE announced he would ``place Medicare in a lockbox so its surpluses could only be used to pay down the national debt and to strengthen Medicare, not for pork barrel spending or tax cuts.'' 
   I am pleased that the Vice President has endorsed this Medicare lockbox. I welcome that support. Obviously, when he says ``so its surpluses,'' he is referring to the kind of thing we are talking about--dedicated tax resources designed to support the program that are in excess of the needs of the program in any current year. 
   As we have already recounted this morning, there are 175 billion of anticipated such surplus that would be directed toward the Medicare trust fund for Medicare Part A, which is the only Medicare trust fund we have. I am pleased he would endorse this concept. I think it is a concept that is bipartisan that deserves our support. 
   Two days ago, the President of the United States called for protecting Medicare Part A surpluses through a lockbox. Allow me to quote from the President's announcement. This is from a text provided by the administration:  
   President Clinton is proposing to take Medicare off budget. This would mean that, like the Social Security surplus, the projected $403 billion Medicare surplus would not count toward on-budget surplus and therefore could no longer be diverted for other purposes. Taking the Medicare surplus off-budget would ensure that Medicare is protected for paying down the debt to help strengthen the life of the Medicare Program.  
   So the President has recognized there are funds specifically paid in, and that they are in surplus of what is needed immediately to be paid out. He has indicated that for those surpluses, we should be safeguarding them with a Medicare lockbox. 
   Let me quote further from the White House release, because I believe the President has described the Medicare lockbox proposal in my amendment, which I proposed last November, in a very simple, understandable manner: 
   What taking Medicare off budget means, the administration, speaking of itself says, is:  
   The Administration projects that if current policies are continued, Medicare Part A, which covers hospital expenses, will run a surplus of $403 billion from [the year] 2001 through [the year] 2010. This surplus is the excess of Medicare income, principally from the 2.9 percent payroll tax, combined employer and employee, over benefit payments and administrative costs. The Medicare surplus has grown from $4 billion in 1993 to $24 billion in the year 2000.  
   I am still quoting the President and the statement of the White House here:  
   Under previous budget accounting conventions, this Medicare surplus was treated as part of the total on-budget surplus and was thus available for new spending on other programs or tax cuts. 
   By taking Medicare Part A off budget, the President proposes to make it unavailable for other spending or tax cuts.  
   That is exactly what I proposed last November. I quote again from the White House:  
   Instead, the projected baseline Medicare surplus would be used to pay down the debt.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Mr. President, I previously spent some substantial time in talking about the need for a Medicare lockbox. I spent time indicating that as Social Security is off budget, I think it would be good to protect Medicare with a lockbox. In addition to talking about the common sense of not taking trust funds and spending them for things other than that for which they were paid into the trust fund, I indicated there were a broad group of people who supported this concept, including the Vice President, who has endorsed the concept of a Medicare lockbox, and the President of the United States, who very recently has endorsed the concept of a Medicare lockbox. 
   I was in the midst of reading an extensive set of points that had been made available by the White House supporting the concept. I believe the concept is worthy of our support. 
   I think it is important that we do it with integrity, that we don't leave any gaping holes or opportunities for the lockbox to be invaded or otherwise dispersed. It is important we not have a lockbox that appears to be a lockbox that doesn't satisfy the idea of a lockbox. 
   I hope Senators will join with me and with an almost unanimous House of Representatives and join the President and the Vice President of the United States, who have all voiced support for this concept of a Medicare lockbox. 
   When I came to Washington 5 years ago, people said it would be impossible to balance the budget, but we did it. They said we could not and would not balance the budget without using the Social Security trust fund. We have done it. And there are those who say we cannot and will not balance the budget and protect Medicare Part A surpluses. But we can and we will. We are more than halfway to this point. The House has voted. The President has expressed himself in support of a lockbox, as has the Vice President. Now it is the Senate's turn. 
   I believe the Senate will sign a Medicare lockbox measure. That would send a powerful message. A lockbox amendment also requires the President to protect Medicare and Social Security by submitting a budget that does not spend either surplus. We make these changes. They are beneficial changes for the people. I call upon the Members of this body to enact a Medicare lockbox that is durable and strong and real--not one with loopholes but one that will protect Part A Medicare surpluses for expenditure for their intended purpose. 
   It is with that in mind I ask my colleagues to vote in favor of the amendment I proposed. 
   I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Michigan, Mr. ABRAHAM, and the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. FEINGOLD, be included as a cosponsors.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for his kind remarks and for his commitment to maintaining the integrity of our Social Security and Medicare trust fund. Frankly, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for coming to the floor to engage in the debate about a very important issue, as well as the other Senators who have come forward to indicate their support for discontinuing--or stopping--what has become a rather traditional exercise of this Congress: spending money out of the Medicare trust fund for other purposes. 
   It is time for us to cease that kind of expenditure. It is time for us to say the trust fund, which is made up of taxes specifically paid by working people--you have to work to pay the Medicare tax; it is a specific tax paid by working people--should be off limits to other expenditures. 
   I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I thank the Senator from Michigan. I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I am grateful for the others--the Senator from New Jersey and others--who have talked about this issue. It is a major step forward. 
   There are a lot of folks who have come to the floor talking about how they wanted this for a long time. Frankly, we have not had this kind of  debate on protecting the Medicare trust fund in my memory. When I filed this legislation last November, I was not aware of any, and I still do not know that there is, any other legislation similar to this that had been filed at that time. I am delighted we are making this progress. I commend people on both sides of the aisle for this progress. 
   My amendment protects the Social Security surplus as well. Social Security is off budget already. My amendment prohibits on-budget deficits. 
   The Senator from North Dakota is talking about how durably he protects the Medicare trust fund with a point of order that takes 60 votes in the Senate. I am pleased for him to embrace that and to talk about it and say how good it is, in part because that is the budget rule which I proposed.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I tried to accommodate the Senators on the other side. When the leader from the other side asked for 5 additional minutes, I interrupted my own remarks, and I thought it would be fair for me to have an opportunity to spend my time without being interrupted. I will start over. 
   I commend the Senator from North Dakota for his concern and for coming to the floor to debate this issue. I am delighted we have now come to a place where we are debating ``hows'' instead of if we are going to do it--how we are going to do it. Both of these measures provide a 60-vote point of order, which is a pretty high hurdle to climb over, as a way of protecting Medicare. As a matter of fact, that is the mechanism that is used in the protection for Social Security. 
   The Senator from North Dakota has commended that as durable, strong, vigorous, robust protection. It happens to be the protection which I placed in the law as a result of an amendment I offered in the budget process in previous budget years so that we would find ourselves incapable of infringing the Social Security surplus. When we adopted that amendment and embraced it, we had tremendously good results. 
   This year, it looks as if there may be as many as $175 billion we will save, not spend; that we will respect instead of invade in terms of the Social Security surplus. That is a big positive. Really, what both sides of the aisle are talking about is getting the kind of robust, strong protection for Medicare that we have for Social Security. 
   I have to say how much I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee, who talked about the fact we need protection in the statute, not just in the budget rules. It is lamentable that each time we have sought to upgrade that protection from the budget rules to a statute, there has been a filibuster on the other side. 
   They now say the reason they were filibustering--one time they said it is because of Medicare; another time they waved an opinion that came from the Secretary of the Treasury. One of the reasons the Secretary of the Treasury indicated he would not want to support what we were offering was they might need to do additional spending in certain times in our economy. I understand there are those who believe wanting to spend more is a reason not to do this, but the real reason for wanting to do this is to spend less, especially to spend less of the money that is in the lockbox. 
   The Senator from North Dakota has raised issues regarding 
   the security of the lockbox which I have proposed. A good debate on these issues is important and appropriate. As a matter of fact, we want to have the strongest lockbox we can. I would not come to this Chamber and offer lockbox legislation that is not durable and not strong. I do not think the Senator from North Dakota would either. There are problems with the proposal of the Senator from North Dakota. This particular phrase on the fifth page of his amendment beginning with the words:  
   This paragraph shall not apply to amounts to be expended from the hospital insurance trust fund--  
   That is, Medicare trust fund----  
   for purposes relating to programs within part A of the Medicare as provided in law on date of enactment of this paragraph.  
   Frankly, they may have a durable lock on that box; they may have reinforced corners on the box; they may have a stout handle on the box; but if there is a hole in the side of the box, we have problems. 
   I appreciate the Senator from New Mexico raising this issue about potential leakage from the box. What we should be about, though, is not trying to find ways in which our proposals are inadequate or whether there is a hole in his box or whether my supermajority point of order is as durable as his supermajority point of order. We should be about the business of protecting the Social Security surplus and the Medicare surplus and doing it in a durable way and a way which means this Congress will not relapse into habits that Congress engaged in for decade after decade. It is time for us to respect the need for a lockbox. 
   I filed the measure last November. Last month, Vice President GORE endorsed the concept of a lockbox. This week, 2 days ago, the President of the United States said we ought to have a lockbox to secure the Medicare box 
   so that it would not be available for spending. I do not know what the Treasury said last year, but I know what the President said last week. And I agree with that. 
   So it is possible to quibble here or there about one aspect of this or the other. It is instructive for me to know that these amendments were not proposed until I came to the floor to propose this.  
   I am delighted that for the first time in my memory we are debating a Medicare lockbox, in conjunction with a Social Security lockbox, that is durable. 
   May I inquire as to the time remaining?

   Mr. ASHCROFT. So with that in mind, I commend to the Members of the Senate, generally, the concept of a lockbox: a durable, secure, mechanism that keeps this Congress from reengaging in activities it has engaged in over time. 
   As this measure moves forward, let's do what we can to improve it in every way possible. Let's talk about a lockbox for Social Security that is statutory. 
   I was delighted to be able to put it in the budget rules of the Senate so that it is out of order for someone to propose spending Social Security income trust funds for non-Social Security purposes. But I would like to see it enshrined into law. 
   We have talked about waiving budget points of order. Obviously, I would like to have this be beyond a point of order. I would be very pleased to have a law enshrined for the way in which we would enforce these rules. 
   It is with that in mind that I express my appreciation to the Members of the Senate and say that our objective here is relatively uniform. From what I can tell from arguments made on the other side, to arguments made on this side, we both want a lockbox. We both want a lockbox that is durable. We want one that does not leak. We want one that is enforceable. 
   The lockbox--I think we are agreeing today--should be one that protects not only Social Security but Medicare. When we get this close to this kind of agreement on an issue that is this important, I think it is time for us to work together. 
   I do not want to fight with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I want to work with them. If we are close to having a durable Social Security lockbox and if we are close to having one that protects Medicare, I want to do it. 
   I have been working on this for over 2 years. Early in 1999, S. 502, the Social Security Safe Deposit Act, was incorporated in the fiscal year 2000 budget resolution, and again in the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution, with those kinds of rules. That is why we have the durability of at least the rules. 
   Finally, the Conrad amendment does not offer stronger protection for Social Security than the Ashcroft budget rule. It is the same thing. It is codified. I think we can even do better than that. I would like to do better than that with a statute. 
   While both offer the same point of order protection for Medicare, my amendment does not have the hole in the side of the box and, as a result, I think it is stronger. But, very frankly, I want to work with folks on the other side of the aisle who agree with me on this issue. I am not opposed to the 
   idea of our working together to get it done. 
   So I announce to my colleagues in the Senate, I do not think it is a difficult thing to vote for my amendment. I think it is a very good amendment. I do not think it is a difficult thing to vote for the amendment on the other side of the aisle. 
   I hope if we vote for these amendments, and they are enacted, that we will be able to work together toward a solution that really helps the American people, that protects senior citizens from having the Medicare trust fund violated, and from having the trust fund for Social Security violated as well. 
   I would like to see that done in statute as well as in the rules of the Senate. It is with that in mind that I thank the Members of the opposition and those who have spoken on behalf of this amendment. I think we can work together for a really important purpose. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the Senate today will pass the foreign operations appropriations bill and I rise to speak in support of the additional funding for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) that is contained in this legislation. The bill makes additional FY2000 funds available for the DEA to step up efforts against the burgeoning epidemic of methamphetamine--commonly called ``meth''. This funding is needed for the DEA to combat the explosive meth problem which is emerging as one of the fastest growing threats in our country, especially in Missouri. 
   With its roots on the west coast, the meth epidemic has now exploded in middle America. Meth is today what cocaine was to the 1980s and heroin was to the 1970s--the hot, ``in'' drug with a catastrophic potential to destroy all those it comes in contact with--financially, spiritually, and physically. It is currently the largest drug threat we face in Missouri. Unfortunately, it is most likely coming soon to a city or town near you.  
   If one wanted to design a drug to have the worst possible effect on the community, one would make methamphetamine. It is highly addictive, highly destructive, cheap, and easy to manufacture. 
   To give my colleagues an idea on the scope of the problem in Missouri alone, let me share with you these frightening statistics: during the whole year of 1992, law enforcement seized two clandestine Meth labs in Missouri and in 1994, the number of Meth labs seized increased to 14. By 1998, the number of seized labs mushroomed to 679. Based on reports of the figures collected in 1999, that number jumped again last year to over 900 labs in Missouri alone. According to the latest national statistics from the DEA, reported meth lab seizures in 1999 for the entire United States totaled 6,438, up from 5,786 in 1998 and 3,327 in 1997. This is nearly a 100% increase in only two years. 
   The rapid increase and spread of meth across the country has brought with it the problems that we too often see with illegal drug use. As the ``popularity'' of meth has increased, we have seen the proportional increases in domestic abuse, child abuse, burglaries and drug related murders. In addition, from 1992 to 1998 meth-related emergency room incidents increased by 63 percent. 
   What is most unacceptable to me is that meth is ensnaring our children. In 1998, the percentage of 12th graders who used meth had doubled from the 1992 level. In recent conversations I have had with local law enforcement officers in Missouri, they estimated that as many as 10% of high school students know the recipe for meth. In fact, one need only log-on the Internet to find numerous web sites giving detailed instructions for setting up a meth lab. This is troublesome. 
   We in Congress have taken these indicators seriously. Despite yearly appropriations to combat meth abuse and trafficking, the meth problem continues to grow. I believe it is time to dedicate more resources to stopping this scourge once and for all. To that end, earlier this year I joined a number of my colleagues in the Senate in sending letters to President Clinton and Attorney General Reno requesting that at least $10,000,000 in additional funds be made available for the DEA to assist state and local law enforcement in the proper removal and disposal of hazardous materials recovered from clandestine methamphetamine laboratories. This funding would provide the necessary resources for the DEA and state and local law enforcement officials to combat this growing meth problem. 
   Meth presents us with a formidable challenge. We have faced other challenges in the past and we can face this one as well. In fact, the history of America is one of meeting challenges and surpassing people's highest expectations. Meth is no exception. All it takes is that we marshal our will and channel the great indomitable American spirit. 
   In order to successfully combat this growing meth problem, we must provide law enforcement officials with adequate resources to stifle this growing epidemic. To this end, I support the increased level of funding in this foreign operation bill, and I encourage the conferees to maintain adequate funding in the Supplemental appropriations measure for fighting the scourge of methamphetamine. Through legislative efforts like this to assist law enforcement efforts to combat meth, we will meet this new meth challenge and defeat it.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am concerned about the need for prescription drug assistance to needy seniors. I have traveled all across my State and, frankly, I think there are many seniors in need of some stop-loss protection. Those without coverage want to be able to buy drugs at discounted prices like those with coverage can because they are part of a group. This measure brought before us today literally takes longer to read than we have allowed for debate in the Senate on it. My staff hasn't been able to get a copy of it, which doesn't provide us with an intelligent and responsible way of making decisions here. 
   I think there are some good concepts here. I like the concept of stop-loss protection. In talking to people in my State, they want that. They want some sort of copay for people, but they want this to be available for people at all income levels. We spend a lot of time here in the Senate trying to make it possible for people to make good decisions by mandating that there be plain language, or that there be time for people to read things, or time for people to consider things in making contracts or otherwise entering into agreements. Yet we are being asked today, without any strong, valid, and reliable estimation as to cost, without an opportunity to actually see what is being proposed, to make a commitment, or instruct the Congress to commit to the expenditure of funds that might invade the Social Security surplus, which might well impair the capacity of this Government to meet its other obligations. It is not responsible. It is not the way we ought to do business. 
   So while I very much appreciate the effort, and I believe that we ought to find ways to help needy seniors to get access to prescription drugs, which can frequently keep them out of the hospital and help them remain independent and can save what would be hospital costs under Medicare, I think it is reasonable that we would have an opportunity to read the legislation, an opportunity to know something about an accurate estimate of its cost. 
   So I have to say that I don't think we should pass that which we haven't read, or that which is not available for our inspection. For that reason, regrettably, I announce that I will have to vote against this legislation. I think its intention is good, and I think many of its proposals appear to be in line with what the people would want and expect but without having an opportunity to read it and inspect it, to understand it and understand its cost, I think it is unwise for us to vote in its favor.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak for a few moments to call attention and applaud the actions of the House of Representatives this week in taking a fundamentally important step toward protecting both the Medicare and Social Security programs. 
   I want all Americans to know that the full House passed Medicare Lockbox legislation--H.R. 3859, sponsored by Representative WALLY HERGER--by an overwhelming 420-2 margin. What months ago some inside the Beltway said was impossible has happened--one chamber of Congress has spoken in an almost unanimous voice to protect the Medicare and Social Security surpluses. 
   For decades, Congress and the President have used Social Security and Medicare surpluses to finance additional government deficits. Last year, for the first time since 1957, Congress balanced the budget without spending a penny of the Social Security surplus. 
   When Congress accomplished this important goal, I immediately set my sights on a higher goal--that is, to protect the Medicare Part A surplus in the same manner. So on November 18, 1999, I introduced S. 1962, the Social Security and Medicare Safe Deposit Box Act. The bill the House passed yesterday is very similar to my legislation, and I am encouraged about the prospects of passing the Medicare Lockbox in the Senate and seeing it signed into law. 
   We need to ensure that the payroll taxes Americans contribute to pay for Social Security and Medicare are used solely to pay Social Security and Medicare benefits. Any surpluses in these accounts should be used to reduce publicly-held debt. It is wrong for Washington to spend this money on additional government programs or to finance additional government deficits. 
   The Medicare lockbox will wall off the surpluses in the Social Security and Medicare Part A Trust Funds, barring Congress from even considering a budget that used Social Security or Medicare surpluses to finance deficits in the rest of the government; only a three-fifth vote in the Senate and a majority in the House could override the new rule. 
   It will impose discipline and clarity on the spending practices in Washington. If Congress or the President wants to spend Medicare Part A or Social Security surpluses, Congress will need to have a separate vote to suspend the Lockbox protections in order to do so. 
   Not only have nearly all Republicans and Democrats in the House endorsed the Lockbox concept; Vice President AL GORE announced several weeks ago that he, too, supports erecting a wall of protection around the Medicare surplus. His support is welcome, and his assistance in helping to pass this measure is eagerly anticipated. 
   I urge the leadership on both sides of the aisle to agree to call up and pass the Medicare Lockbox. By doing this, we will send the powerful message that protecting both Medicare and Social Security is our highest priority. 
   It is essential that we make this change. Social Security is scheduled to go bankrupt by 2037. Medicare is projected to become insolvent even sooner, in 2023. It is vitally important that we ensure that the government not spend monies dedicated for the trust funds that sustain these essential programs. 
   While protecting the Medicare surplus seemed to be an 
   unattainable goal just a few short years ago, this goal is now within our reach. In addition to funding the government for fiscal year 2000 without spending a penny out of the Social Security trust fund, CBO's new projections will demonstrate that we will have enough revenue available to protect the $22 billion Part A Medicare surplus as well. 
   It is imperative that we limit spending this year so that we do not dip into the Medicare surplus in FY 2001 and in years to come. 
   Both Medicare and Social Security are funded out of payroll taxes specifically delineated for their respective purposes, and are supposed to be reserved for those purposes. If there are surpluses in these accounts, if these accounts take in more money than is necessary for their stated purposes in a specific year, then that money should not suddenly be available for general government spending. 
   Any and all surpluses in those two accounts should be reserved for their stated purpose, or be used to help shore up those accounts. The Medicare Lockbox promotes honest accounting, and requires the government to use funds for their advertised purposes. 
   Lockboxing Social Security and Medicare surpluses is an essential first step in securing the long term financial solvency of Medicare and Social Security. 
   The Medicare Lockbox will change the way business is done in Washington. I commend the House and Congressman HERGER for taking the first step in protecting the Medicare Part A trust fund. 
   The House bill is not perfect, but it will protect all of the Medicare Part A and Social Security trust funds. It also has the support of 420 members of the House of Representatives. The overwhelming support for the Medicare lockbox in the House should send a powerful signal to the Senate to take up and pass this bill. 
   Passing this law will be the next step on our journey to secure the long term solvency of Social Security and Medicare.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I want to announce my unqualified support for the recent signing of the Multi-Year Procurement contract on Boeing's F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet. This is a good day for U.S. national defense, the Navy, the American taxpayers, and the city of St. Louis. 
   This announcement secures the production of the Super Hornet, which is in St. Louis, for the next 5 years. Valued at $8.9 billion for a total of 222 aircraft over 5 years, this contract will ensure that the Navy will have these planes and, in addition, U.S. taxpayers will save over $700 million. It is definitely a ``win-win'' situation.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for yielding time to me to speak on a very important issue. 
   In the 1970s, Congress sought to regulate fuel economy for various vehicles in the United States, and recently, as a result of the continuation of that program, there has been an effort to continue to escalate the amount of fuel economy that is demanded from companies that produce automobiles. Since CAFE was enacted, we have had a weight reduction in cars of about 1,000 pounds per car. That is the way you get better fuel economy--carry less, and reduce the weight of the car in order to get better fuel economy. 
   I point out that there are some very serious consequences of reducing the weight of a car by a thousand pounds. I indicate that one of those serious consequences has been highlighted in USA Today in a major feature article from July 2 of last year, ``Death by the Gallon.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. ASHCROFT. The 1989 Harvard University/Brookings Institution study determined that the current CAFE standard of 27.5 miles per gallon is responsible for between a 14 and 27 percent increase in the annual traffic deaths, since the new car fleet must be downsized in order to meet stricter standards. 
   Further, the 1992 National Academy of Sciences study concluded that the downsizing of automobiles due to fuel economy requirements has a direct impact on passenger safety. The study found ``safety and fuel economy are linked because one of the most direct methods manufacturers can use to improve fuel economy is to reduce vehicle size and weight.'' 
   Stunning advances are being made to improve safety in other respects. To give away those advances by imposing lighter and lighter vehicles raises very, very, very serious and troubling questions. 
   The most troubling conclusion from the study that was conducted by the National Academy of Sciences: ``it may be inevitable that significant increases in fuel economy can occur only with some negative safety consequences.'' The National Academy of Sciences study also said, ``the CAFE approach to achieving automotive fuel economy has defects that are sufficiently grievous to warrant careful reconsideration of the approach.'' 
   The National Academy of Sciences says careful reconsideration of this entire approach ought to be undertaken. If the National Academy of Sciences is suggesting we need to carefully reconsider this approach, I am not sure we ought to be in the business of extending the approach or enlarging that approach. These standards are killing people, yet there are those who want to make the standards even tougher, even more deadly. 
   Based on experience and the research, increasing CAFE standards to 40 miles per gallon, which is less than the proposal supported by the President and the Vice President, would cause up to about 57,00 deaths a year. At some point, I hope we will get the attention of policymakers and ask ourselves if we really want to sacrifice, on this altar of fuel economy, that many lives a year. 
   Of course, that is included in this special USA Today report. Mr. President, 46,000 people is equivalent to an entire town, such as Joplin, MO, in my home State. The deaths of 46,000 people would wipe out the entire town of Blue Springs, MO, or all of JOHNSON and Christian Counties in Missouri. 
   The average gas mileage for passenger vehicles in 1975 was 14 miles per gallon; today it is 20 miles per gallon. That averages 7,700 lost lives for every gallon of increased fuel efficiency. I am not sure 46,000 lives are worth it for improved fuel efficiency. 
   There are a number of alternatives to lightening vehicles for fuel efficiency. Some of the alternatives are in the process of being developed in the capitals of the automotive industry, whether in Detroit or other sections around the country. They relate to fuel cells. They relate to combination strategies. They relate to large flywheels that capture the momentum of a car as it stops, and as that momentum is captured in the flywheel it is regained as the car is started again. There are many things that are being done. 
   Some in the automotive industry say if we mandate additional fuel economy standards immediately, the research resources which are supporting the development of these new technologies will have to be shifted back over into weight reduction techniques immediately to meet demands. So instead of moving toward long-term changes in efficiency, we get to the short run,  which loses more lives and impairs our ability to develop the kind of fuel cell technology, the kind of combined energy technologies that result in safer and more efficient cars. 
   I asked the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety for an opinion on raising CAFE standards and the impact on highway safety. The Institute said: Even in single vehicle crashes, which account 
   for about half of all passenger vehicle occupant deaths, people in lighter vehicles are at greater risk. The letter stated: The more safer vehicles the manufacturer sells, the more difficult it becomes to meet CAFE standards. 
   The idea of elevated CAFE requirements is at war with the idea of safe occupancy in the automobile. The simple idea or notion that says fatalities have been going down while weight has been going down in cars, therefore it must be safer to be in lighter cars, is a simple notion, but it is an incorrect notion. It ignores the other factors. It ignores factors such as seatbelt use, airbag deployment, divided highways, the kinds of things highway design has done to elevate safety standards. 
   I make one thing very clear: I am in favor of promoting cleaner air. I believe we must be responsible environmentally. However, there is a level at which we ought to consider the risk to human lives. The reason we want clean air is that dirty air impairs the health and well-being of human beings. So the reasons we are pursuing are the same. We want to save people who might be included in these gruesome statistics of 46,000 people dying. While I want to have cleaner air, I don't think it is necessarily done by putting people on the altar of lighter vehicles and having them lose their lives when we can find other ways of achieving that. 
   Consumers are not choosing smaller cars. They look at convenience. They look at safety. They look at where their children are going to be riding, and how they will get there. They are buying larger cars. Safety is one of the three main reasons people purchase SUVs. Small cars are only 18 percent of all vehicles on the road, but they account for 37 percent of vehicle deaths. 
   You have to think about that for a moment. That is a startling statistic. Small cars are only 18 percent of the vehicles on the road. Yet they account for 37 percent of the vehicle deaths--or that was the figure in 1997. I doubt if the data has significantly changed. 
   Some people argue that the reason the small cars are troublesome is because they get into wrecks with bigger cars; they are getting into accidents with SUVs. Frankly, the facts do not support that claim. Based on figures from the National Highway Traffic Safety Board, only 1 percent of all small car deaths involved collisions with mid-size or large SUVs--1 percent. One percent of their accidents, yet their fatality rate is 37 percent; in spite of the fact they are only 18 percent of the cars on the road, 37 percent of all the traffic deaths. 
   Car-buying experts have said that only 7 percent of new vehicle shoppers say they will consider buying a small car. According to this source, 82 percent who have purchased small cars say they will not buy another. 
   Safety-conscious consumers--certainly my constituents in Missouri--understand the need for safety and are buying larger vehicles. But now Washington wants to tell residents in my State what kind of car they can buy. Washington wants to increase the level of risk, basically, that will attend driving those cars. The lighter the car, according to the National Academy of Sciences and the National Highway Traffic Safety Board, the higher the risk. 
   We fight drunk driving. We mandate seatbelt use. We require manufacturers to install airbags. Yet today we are being asked to tell the House we will not accept their policy of providing for Americans the opportunity of choosing cars that are heavy enough to be safer. We want to mandate, somehow, that we take additional pounds out of cars. 
   I was stunned by the data developed by our own agencies that said if you add 100 pounds, you save 300 lives. I suppose it is not scientifically correct to say if you took 100 pounds out, you would lose 300 lives--maybe you would. You might lose more. I would hate to be the person who had to make up the list of the 300 names, or of the thousand names, or however many names there are, of the lives that would be lost because we refused to adopt an approach which says: We have gone far enough with the Federal mandates on weight reduction and fuel economy. We should allow what is already happening in the automotive industry, a tremendous surge of research and technology, much of it spurred by our own incentives and initiatives, to develop alternative technologies which can provide for the transportation needs that we have with greater efficiency, without putting so many people at risk. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject this motion, the motion which would instruct the conferees not to accept section 318 of the bill as passed by the House of Representatives.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the concerns of Missouri farmers and ranchers about concentration in the agriculture sector and about individual farmers' ability to compete and to get fair prices for their commodities. 
   Missouri is a ``farm state'', so ensuring fair competition in markets is an important issue to me. The state of Missouri is ranked second in the list of states with the most number of farms--only Texas has more. Missouri's varying topography and climate makes for a very agriculturally diverse state. Farmers and ranchers produce over 40 commodities, 22 of which are ranked in the top ten among the states. Missouri is a leader in such crops as beef, soybeans, hay, and rice, as well as watermelon and concord grapes. Having diversity and the ability to change has allowed Missouri farmers to maintain their livelihood for generations. More than 88 percent of the farms in Missouri are family or individually owned, and 8 percent are partnerships. It is easy to see that Missouri is a state that values small and family farms--which are the bedrock of Missouri's rural communities. 
   As I have traveled around Missouri--visiting every county in the state--Missouri farmers and ranchers have repeatedly told me that increasing concentration of the processing and packing industry has resulted--and will continue to result--in a less competitive market environment and lower prices for producers. 
   I have been responding to these concerns, and I am taking further action today. Last year, I asked the Department of Justice to create a high-level post within the Antitrust Division to specialize in agriculture-related mergers and transactions. The Administration responded by appointing a representative for agriculture in the Department of Justice. This appointment is a step in the right direction, but producers still have multiple concerns that need to be addressed. 
   Today, I am introducing three bills to address Missouri and American farmers' concerns about agriculture concentration and market competition. In addition to listening to Missouri farmers on this issue, I have reviewed a resolution that was considered in the Missouri State Legislature about competition in the agricultural economy. 
   The Ninetieth General Assembly of Missouri called upon the 106th Congress to take an initiative on federal  law governing agriculture concentration. Missouri State Concurrent Resolution 27 (S. Con. Res. 27) is a bipartisan resolution outlining what the Missouri legislature recommends the federal government should do to address the issue of concentration. The resolution passed the Missouri State Senate and was reported out of the House Agriculture Committee to the full House. In drafting the package of bills I am introducing today, I studied the recommendations and objectives in State Senator MAXWELL's Missouri resolution as well as including important provisions of my own. 
   Mr. President, the bill I'm introducing today--the Fair Play of Family Farms Act--does the following things: 
   First, this legislation adds ``sunshine'' to the merger process. It will give the Department of Agriculture more authority when it comes to mergers and acquisitions. This will 
   heighten USDA's role in review of all proposed agriculture mergers so that the impact on farmers will be given more consideration, and will make these reviews public. The public will be given an opportunity to comment on the proposed merger, and the USDA will be required to do an impact analysis on producers on a regional basis. I want to ensure that if two agri-businesses merge, the impact on farmers are completely evaluated. 
   Second, my bill creates a permanent position for an Assistant Attorney General for Agricultural Competition. This position will not simply be appointed by the President or by the Attorney General, but the position will require Senate review and confirmation. Also, my bill provides additional staffing for this new position. 
   In addition, this bill provides additional funds and requires the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyard Administration (GIPSA) to hire more litigation attorneys, economists, and investigators to enforce the Packers and Stockyard Act. An important element of this provision is that it requires GIPSA to put more investigators out ``in the field'' for oversight and investigations. I want to make sure that there are not just more attorneys and economists in Washington, D.C., but that there are more people out doing investigations and oversight. 
   Because there has been some concerns that the Packers and Stockyards Act does not cover the entire poultry industry, this legislation also requires an analysis of why the poultry industry is not covered, and requires GAO to offer suggestions for how the disparity between poultry and livestock can be remedied. 
   This bill addresses another problem I was informed about when I was out visiting Missouri farmers--and that is the issue of confidentiality clauses in contracts signed by farmers. Several farmers were concerned about confidentiality clauses in the contracts with agri-business that they were told make it illegal for farmers to share the contract with others, even their lawyers and bankers. I want to ensure that farmers are able to get the legal and financial advice they need, so this bill ensures that such confidentiality clauses do not apply to farmers' contacts with their lawyers or bankers. 
   The bill also creates a statutory trust for the protection of ranchers who sell on a cash basis to livestock dealers. Right now, if ranchers deliver their cattle to a dealer and then the dealer goes bankrupt, the rancher is not protected. My bill would set up a trust for the rancher, so that if the dealer goes bankrupt, the rancher would be at the front of the line to get paid. There are similar trusts already set up for when a rancher sells livestock to a packer, and this legislation extends the same protections to ranchers when they sell their livestock to dealers. 
   One of the recommendations from the Missouri legislature that I included in the bill allows GIPSA to seek reparations for producers when a packer is found to be engaged in predatory or unfair practices. This section specifies that when money is collected from those that are damaging producers, the money should go to the farmers, not to the federal government. 
   This bill will lead to a more fair playing field for Missouri farmers and ranchers. It address concerns of Missourians that I have visited with and incorporates the outline of the Missouri State Resolution. 
   Finally, I am pleased to be the Senate sponsor of two bills that have already been introduced in the other Chamber by the distinguished Representative from Missouri, Congressman JIM TALENT. I would like to commend Congressman TALENT for the work he has done to help the Missouri agriculture community. Representative TALENT's bills on value added agriculture are a positive step for Missouri and U.S. producers. Therefore, I would like to introduce these two bills in the Senate to ``help put farmers back in the driver's seat.'' 
   The Value-Added Development Act for American Agriculture provides technical assistance for producers to start value-added ventures. This bill helps family farmers compete by giving farmers the opportunity to take a greater share of the profit from the processing industry. The legislation will provide technical assistance to producers for value-added ventures, including engineering, legal services, applied research, scale production, business planning, marketing, and market development. 
   The funds would be provided to farmers through grants requests, which will be evaluated on the State level. It has long been my opinion that farmers know how best to farm their land, meet market demands, and make a profit. If the ideas of farmers are cultivated on a local and state level, farmers will likely have more flexibility to make wise decisions for markets in their home states and regions. 
   States would have the opportunity to apply for $10 million grants to start up an Agriculture Innovation Center. The state boards will consist of the State Department of Agriculture, the largest two general farm organizations, and the four highest grossing commodity groups. The Agriculture Innovation Center will then use the funds to help farmers finance the start-up of value added ventures. 
   Once it is determined that the farmers' ideas for a value added venture could be beneficial, the State Agriculture Innovation Center can give the farmers assistance with plans, engineering, and design. When the farmer is actually ready to begin implementation of the value added project, the third bill I am introducing will help out. 
   The Farmers' Value-Added Agricultural Investment Tax Credit Act would create a tax credit for farmers who invest in producer owned value-added endeavors--even ventures that are not farmer-owned co-ops. This would provide a 50% tax credit for the producers of up to $30,000 per year, for six years. 
   The three bills I am introducing today are important to the continuation of the American farmer over the next century. I know that these bills will benefit the producers of Missouri, and in turn benefit all of America.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. Res. 319, which the Senate approved on Friday, during National Homeownership Week. I thank my colleagues for supporting this important resolution which affects the security and welfare of Missourians and all Americans. This resolution addresses the importance of placing quality housing within reach of a greater number of Americans as well as improving housing opportunities for Americans at all income levels. I, along with my colleagues, support the efforts of Habitat for Humanity and ``The House the Senate Built'' project. 
   As you know, the largest debt most families take on in their lifetimes is a home. Over 65 percent of Americans own a home, as do approximately 80 percent of Americans over the age of 50. This represents real progress. In 1940, fully 56 percent of Americans were renters. Clearly, America has come a long way. People buy homes for different reasons. A home can be a place of safety to raise a family, the potential of financial security, a sense of community. All around Missouri, and across this great nation, couples of all ages agree that buying a home is among the essential steps a family takes to ensure stability and prosperity in their lives. 
   While homes are a worthwhile investment, they also are expensive. Real estate experts recommend that families buy homes valued at over three times their annual income--a sum far greater than what families could pay back in a year, or two, or even five. So, most Americans take out a mortgage. Once this burden of debt is behind them, they are free to dream new dreams --pay for their children's or grandchildren's education, travel, or make other investments. 
   Homeownership is an important factor in promoting economic security and stability for American families. The level of homeownership among foreign-born naturalized citizens who have been in the United States for at least six years is the same as the level of homeownership of the Nation as a whole. When families such as these, who are new to our shores, prosper, we as a nation prosper. 
   This resolution expresses the Senate's concern for improving homeownership in America. The resolution commends the nonprofit housing organization, Habitat for Humanity, and supports their commitment to partner with the United States Senate to strengthen neighborhoods and communities by building simple and affordable homes with low-income buyers. I thank Senator BROWNBACK for offering this resolution and endorse its passage.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his continuing support for this amendment and his continuing support for our national defense. I also thank my cosponsors, Senators BOND, CONRAD, LANDRIEU, and BREAUX. 
   This amendment will provide an additional $23 million, bringing the total to $43 million, for the development of an extended-range cruise missile, which is the successor to what is known as the CALCM, the Conventional Air-Launched Cruise Missile. 
   The Defense authorization bill contains $86.1 million for this project. This amendment increases the appropriation to half of the authorized amount. According to the Air Force and their officials, this new total, $43 million, is needed to start this program. 
   This cruise missile will be launched from the B-52 bomber to accurately strike strategic targets deep inside enemy territory without significant risk to our pilots or our planes. It will provide the Air Force its only air-launched, long-range, all-weather, precision weapon with a range of over 600 miles. I believe this amendment has been approved by both sides, and I thank the chairman and ranking member for their support. 
   It is important we have this kind of capacity. We have found that our ability to have precision capacity for striking the enemy is very important to the maintenance of our own independence and the protection of our own fighting individuals in our Armed Forces. I am grateful for the cooperation in this respect, and I yield the floor.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of George Abraham Thampy, of Maryland Heights, Missouri. George correctly spelled ``demarche'' to win the National Spelling Bee held last week in Washington, D.C. The week prior, George placed second in the National Geography Bee, also held in Washington, D.C. 
   I would like to offer my congratulations to this young scholar who has worked diligently to not only reach, but also win, the National Spelling Bee. George's performance has been exemplary and I'm confident it will serve to promote a heightened interest in academic achievement. George also tied for fourth place in 1998 and finished in a third place tie last year. 
   I look forward to the continued success of Missouri home school families such as George's, and hope to continue promoting the kind of freedom that encourages parents to take an active role in guiding the course of their children's education. I wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of this year's National Defense Authorization Act. Senator WARNER and Senator LEVIN, along with the entire committee, have my deepest thanks for their tremendous work with respect to this country's national defense. Their hard work and dedication on behalf of our servicemen and women is evident throughout the entire Act. Senator WARNER, in particular, has been instrumental in bringing to the floor a bill that provides our country with the national defense it desperately needs and deserves. 
   To the Committee's credit, this Act continues the trend, begun with last year's Authorization Bill, of providing a real increase in the authorized level of defense spending. The Committee has once again recognized that people are the most important aspect of our military and our troops must be treated accordingly. This Act authorizes, among other things, a well-deserved 3.7 percent pay raise for military personnel, important quality of life provisions, and addresses several important health care concerns to ensure our active-duty and retired personnel have the medical care they justly deserve. 
   Mr. President, although people make our military the best in the world, our troops must have the superior equipment to ensure continued success in every conflict. We must not send our sons and daughters into war without the right tools for victory. To this end, I would like to thank Senator WARNER specifically for his support of a very important project--the extended-range conventional air-launched cruise missile project (CALCM-ER). In addition to Senator WARNER, I would also like to thank Senator BOND, Senator CONRAD, Senator LANDRIEU, and Senator BREAUX for their work in support of this important project, in the Defense Authorization Act. 
   The Conventional Air-Launched Cruise Missile, or CALCM, is a converted nuclear cruise missile that is launched from a B-52. This invaluable weapon is the Air Force's only conventional air-launched, long-range, all-weather precision weapon. Fired more than 600 nautical miles from its target, this missile can strike strategic targets deep inside enemy territory without significant risk to our pilots or planes. 
   General Mike Ryan, the Air Force Chief of Staff, praised the CALCM's invaluable capabilities when he said in a written statement dated February 10, 2000 that ``CALCM continues to be the Commander in Chief's first strike weapon of choice during contingency operations, as demonstrated by its superb performance during Operations Desert Fox and Allied Force.'' 
   Due to the weapon's great performance and subsequent heavy demand, the number of CALCMs in the Air Force inventory dwindled to below 70 last year. Through continued conversion of the nuclear cruise missiles, the current number is around 200, but the Air Force has concluded that this is simply not enough to meet our military's need. And due to the limited number of convertible nuclear cruise missiles, the Air Force needed to search out additional avenues of creating an extended range cruise missile with similar capabilities of the CALCM. 
   Mr. President, the Air Force has identified a suitable solution. In a study commissioned in last year's Defense Authorization bill to deal with this problem, a commission concluded that, and I quote, ``Of specific interest to the Air Force is the need for an extended range cruise missile in the midterm that would be a modification to an existing cruise missile in the inventory. This option meets the Air Force's two-fold requirement of increasing the inventory of cruise missiles as quickly as possible and providing an extended range missile capability to protect our aging bomber force from current and mid-term threats while long range cruise missile requirements are studied.'' 
   In order to see these conclusions become a reality, I, together with Senators BOND, CONRAD, LANDRIEU, and BREAUX, have worked to see the addition of $86.1 million in the Air Force's Research and Development account for the extended range conventional air-launched cruise missile program. The Armed Services Committee has graciously agreed with us and authorized this amount in the Defense Authorization Act--and I thank the Committee, and particularly Senator WARNER, for their assistance. 
   In the upcoming Defense Appropriations bill, Senator STEVENS has been particularly understanding of the Air Force's need of the Extended Range Cruise Missile and has worked with me to provide appropriations for this program. I want to offer him a personal thanks for his support of this vital program. I truly appreciate his efforts. 
   However, I have been informed that in order to start the process and see these important weapons are in the hands of our troops, additional funds will be needed. In order to rectify this problem, I plan on offering an amendment to increase the available funds for the Extended Range Cruise Missile program by $23 million so that work can begin on the new cruise missile. This will bring the total amount to $43 million, which is half of the authorized amount and enough to start development on this important missile. 
   Mr. President, again I want to thank Senator WARNER and Senator STEVENS for their continued and tireless service to our nation's defense.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, Medicare paperwork requirements burden America's seniors, health care providers, and federal government staff that manage Medicare. 
   In 1998, the average processing time for appeals of claims denied under Medicare Part A was 310 days. For Medicare Part B, the average appeal time was 524 days. Waiting periods of a year or longer are too long for America's seniors to wait. These lengthy waiting periods tell me that there must be room for us to improve the way we administer Medicare. 
   HCFA regulations governing Medicare consist of 110,000 pages--six times as long as the Tax Code, which is 17,000 pages. In addition, HCFA uses 23 different forms to administer the Medicare program. 
   According to Dr. Nancy Dickey, Immediate Past President of the American Medical Association, for most doctors, ``the biggest challenge is getting through mountains of Medicare paperwork.'' 
   Let me give you some examples of how paperwork burdens and related regulations are affecting the Medicare program. Recently Dr. Joseph Marshall, a Washington, DC., gynecologist, became so frustrated with HCFA regulations that he chose to give his Medicare patients free visits, so that he would avoid sending a bill to Medicare. HCFA would not allow it. HCFA told him that if he did not bill HCFA, he could be fined and imprisoned. 
   A nonprofit Minnesota organization, Allina, which serves 35,000 seniors, expects to spend $2 million annually in paperwork related burdens. And Medicare paperwork burdens have forced increasing numbers of seniors to resort to ``insurance claim service'' firms to help them complete Medicare paperwork. These firms charge $20 to $75 an hour. 
   This is not the tax code I am referring to. This is Medicare, the program that is supposed to bring health care to elderly Americans, not bury them and their doctors under mountains of paperwork. 
   During the Clinton Administration, more than a quarter of the 110,000 pages of Medicare regulations and paperwork have been added. In April of last year, HCFA proposed 93 new regulations based on the Balanced Budget Act alone. 
   Mr. President, drowning doctors and patients alike in a morass of paperwork must end. The seniors who have been promised Medicare coverage throughout their working lives deserve the best possible coverage. The doctors who treat them deserve our gratitude, not bureaucratic burdens and indifference. 
   Therefore, today I am introducing the ``Patients Before Paperwork Medicare Red Tape Reduction Act of 2000.'' This legislation would establish a Commission to examine inefficient and superfluous Medicare paperwork requirements and related regulations. The Commission will include physicians, hospital administrators, senior citizens, nursing home and long term care administrators, and health care plan representatives, the very people best able to determine which forms are necessary to ensure quality coverage, and which forms create unfair burdens and time-wasting mandates from Washington. 
   The Commission will be responsible for reviewing existing paperwork burdens, with the goal of reducing those burdens. It will streamline and simplify the coding method for Medicare services, facilitate electronic filing and the elimination of paperwork, and demonstrate that existing and proposed paperwork requirements and related regulations have proven benefits, including a positive health benefit for consumers. 
   The Commission will also explore the important issue of how patient-doctor relationships have been impacted by onerous paperwork requirements that force doctors to spend more time examining forms than examining patients. 
   This legislation would alleviate the burden that Medicare paperwork imposes on millions of Medicare beneficiaries, health care providers, and our own federal government. By establishing this Commission, we would create the opportunity to decrease Medicare paperwork burdens on seniors and promote efficiency within the health care industry and within the federal government.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is my great privilege to speak on the passage of H.R. 3639 as I am the sponsor of the Senate's companion bill, S. 2416. This bill will name the State Department's headquarters at 2201 C Street in Washington, DC, the ``Harry S Truman Federal Building.'' First, I would like to provide my deepest thanks to my esteemed co-sponsor who have joined this effort. From the onset, this proposal has had strong bi-partisan support in both Houses. Senators BOND, WARNER, DEWINE, and MOYNIHAN and Representatives ROY BLUNT and IKE SKELTON have been incredibly helpful in seeing this proposal become a reality. Furthermore, I would like to thank the Honorable Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, for her unqualified support and cooperation for honoring President Harry Truman befittingly honored in this manner. 
   Today I enjoy the privilege, granted to me by the citizens of Missouri, of occupying the Senate seat formerly held by Harry S Truman. Truman left this seat in January 1945 to become Vice President, and by April of that year assumed the office of President of the United States in the wake of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's death. The day after becoming President, Truman told a group of reporters that ``boys, if you ever pray, pray for me now ..... I feel like the moon, the stars, and all the planets have fallen on me.'' 
   As the new President, Harry Truman inherited a world on fire. The most destructive war in human history still raged on in Europe and Asia; and Truman, the only chief executive in this century who did not enjoy a university education, faced a most crucial role bringing the war to a close and constructing a viable international system in the postwar. Truman, whose strong personal integrity and vast common sense was forged in the small towns of western Missouri, brilliantly succeeded. 
   This bill will name the building that houses our Nation's Department of State--the agency responsible for international relations--in honor of Missouri's favorite son and one of our country's greatest statesmen. This is benefitting, for it was the decisions made by President Truman in the realm of foreign policy that made his Presidency one of the most monumental and influential in our country's history.  
   President Harry Truman led during one of the most trying times in our nation's tumultuous history. During Truman's years in the White House, crisis compounded crisis overseas and hard decisions continually confronted a President who stoically dealt with the awesome responsibilities he had to face. 
   After Truman assumed office he successfully led the United States to victory against the Axis powers. However, the end of the Second World War brought little respite for the new President from Missouri. The cooperation Truman, and most Americans, hoped to find with the Soviet Union collapsed as an Iron Curtain descended across the heart of Europe. Behind it, the creation of totalitarian Communist regimes confronted the United States with a new dark challenge--the cold war. 
   In response to this newest danger, President Truman led the free world forward. He emphasized the need to support free people and assist those who resisted attempted subjugation by armed minorities and outside pressures. To this end, Truman began the United States' single most successful foreign aid initiative, the Marshall plan. Under Truman's leadership, this ambitious program saved the economies of Western Europe and set vital United States allies on the path of full recovery within a democratic political framework. 
   President Harry S Truman realized that economic recovery of war torn areas would not, in itself, secure the free world from Communist aggression. Therefore, President Truman spearheaded the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, one of the most successful military alliances of all time and the cornerstone of Western Europe's defense for the past five decades. 
   Europe was not the only place where President Truman took a stand for freedom and democracy in the face of aggression and hostility. When Communist North Korea blatantly invaded South Korea in 1950, only Truman's quick action, and continued resolve, made possible South Korea's escape from the control of North Korea's totalitarian regime. Throughout the world, in Northern Iran, Berlin, China, and the Eastern Mediterranean, Truman's strong and wise leadership, grounded in a small town Missouri sense of right and wrong, heroically guided our country through some of its most dangerous years. In addition to his commitment to fight Communist aggression, the institutions created during the Truman years--such as the United States Air Force, the Department of Defense, the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency--eventually ensured victory in the cold war, and enhanced the United States strength in the years after. Surely Winston Churchill exhibited his always impressive observational abilities when he told Truman in 1950 that ``..... you, more than any other man, have saved Western Civilization.'' 
   I am proud to be a part of this effort today to see President Harry S Truman so honored. More than any other post-war President he shaped the world we live in today. To name the headquarters of the United States State Department after this fellow Missourian is a fitting and just choice.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to honor one of the great cities in Missouri: Kansas City. On June 3, 1850, the Town of Kansas was incorporated. Three years later, the town was reincorporated as the City of Kansas and renamed Kansas City in 1889. Today, Kansas Citians are celebrating the sesquicentennial of Kansas City, Missouri. 
   Kansas City is situated at the point of entry at the confluence of the Missouri and Kansas Rivers. In the beginning, Kansas City was known as the last point of civilization before venturing into the untamed West. The settlement quickly prospered as an outfitting post for gold prospectors and homesteaders who were moving west. 
   Because of its geographical location in the middle of the United States, Kansas City was destined to develop into one of our nation's most important trading markets and distribution hubs for goods and services. 
   As Kansas City began to grow and prosper it became a major region for raising and sending cattle to market. Kansas City quickly emerged as the largest cattle market in the world. Since that time, each Fall, the American Royal Festival is held to pay tribute to this rich cultural heritage. 
   Two words come to mind when people talk about Kansas City. Those two words are Jazz and Barbecue. Kansas City is world renowned for both. One also must not forget the grandeur of the Christmas lights that adorn Country Club Plaza, viewed annually by thousands. 
   Kansas City is home to the Liberty Memorial which honors America's sons and daughters who defended liberty and our country through their service in World War I. This Memorial serves as a tribute to ensure that the sacrifices made by those brave men and women are not forgotten. 
   Union Station was the gateway for many World War II service men and women passing through Kansas City on their way to service. Now newly refurbished it still stands tall and stately as a major tourist attraction. 
   In the 1960s, Kansas City emerged as a powerhouse in professional sports. Lamar Hunt brought the Chiefs NFL football team to Kansas City, and Ewing Kauffman was awarded a major league baseball franchise. The Kansas City Chiefs and the Kansas City Royals have both captured world pennants. 
   From its vibrant past to its glowing future, Kansas City is a community that remains on the cutting edge of technology, industry, medical research, manufacturing, and sports. At the dawn of a new century, Kansas City will continue to grow and prosper and rise to her highest and best. 
   Mr. President, it is a distinct privilege to represent this great city in the United States Senate. I request that my colleagues join me in recognizing Kansas City for its 150 years of contributions to our great land and paying tribute to the KC150 celebration, Kansas City's sesquicentennial.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the winner of the American Sportfishing Association's Lifetime Achievement Award, Mr. Johnny Morris, who is also a friend of mine. This award is being given to Johnny today in recognition of his outstanding lifetime contribution to sportfishing. 
   Johnny Morris is the founder of Bass Pro Shops, which offers anglers and sportsmen the same equipment that the tournament professionals use. His business has expanded from its original store to include eight additional shops, a catalog, a line of Bass Pro products and a wholesale operation that supplies more than 7,000 independent sporting goods stores in the United States and several foreign countries. 
   Since 1970, Johnny has provided a place for sportsmen, and the entire family, to outfit their outdoor and sporting activities. Because of my love for the outdoors and fishing, the Bass Pro Shops has long been one of my favorite places in Springfield to visit. I am not alone. The Bass Pro Shops is one of Missouri's top tourist sites, attracting over three and a half million visitors a year. 
   In addition to outfitting anglers, Johnny donates ten percent of Bass Pro Shops' earnings to conservation efforts, which benefit fishing areas far beyond Missouri's borders. Johnny believes ``the future of the sport and of our business depends more on conservation and how we manage our natural resources than absolutely anything else.'' To further that belief, Johnny is an outspoken supporter of not-for-profit and youth organizations that support or raise awareness of conservation issues. Organizations such as the Missouri Beautification Association, which helps clean up trash along Missouri's roadways and riverbanks, and ``Operation Game Thief,'' a program launched to curb poaching in Missouri, have benefitted from Johnny Morris' support. In March 1998, the first ever World's Fishing Fair was hosted by Bass Pro Shops, and the proceeds were given to Missouri forests and fisheries. I personally have witnessed Johnny's commitment to his community through the many educational events which Bass Pro Shops hosts. Great Outdoors Day, for example, brings together families to learn more about hiking, fishing, archery, shooting and conservation through hands-on experience. He also hosts Kids' Fishing Fun Day in Springfield, an event that brings thousands of young participants to a local pond to try their hand at sportfishing. His efforts show that individual initiative to preserve one's local environment for future generations is not only responsible citizenship but just plain good sense. 
   I commend Johnny Morris both for receiving this award and for his efforts to enrich the fishing experience for all Americans and to promote conservation through the Bass Pro Shops.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pension Opportunities for Women's Equality in Retirement (POWER) Act of 2000. This legislation is important because the current tax code often fails to give women--especially women who take time off to raise children--sufficient opportunities to earn a large enough pension to guarantee their financial security in retirement. 
   The facts demonstrate that women need help in building pensions for their future. In America today, two-thirds of women over 65 have no pension other than Social Security. This translates into 300,000 women in my home state of Missouri and 14 million women nationwide. At the same time, the median income from assets for women age 65 and over is only $860 a year. Retirement is often compared to a three-legged stool, with the three legs being pensions, savings, and Social Security. Now, everyone knows what happens to a three legged stool when one of the legs is missing: it falls over. But these statistics shows that many, too many, American women are trying to manage their retirements on only one leg of the stool. 
   As a result of the lack of pensions and relatively low savings among American women, older women are twice as likely as older men to be living near or below the federal poverty threshold. Further, the poverty rates for widows, divorced women, and never-married women are significantly higher than the rate for all elderly women. The 20 million elderly American women--including 440,000 in Missouri--carry an extremely high risk of poverty. 
   The causes for this risk can be found in the tax code and pension rules. One of the key elements of pension building is called vesting. Employees cannot build pension assets until they vest, or serve at a particular job for a redetermined amount of time, often 5 years. Employers have a perfectly good reason for vesting requirements--they want to encourage job stability--and there is no inherent bias in these requirements. But the effect of these requirements is to make it harder for women to build up pension assets. The reason for this is that the median job tenure for women is 3.8 years, well below the median job tenure for men, as well as the 5 years most pension plans require for vesting. 
   Another problem women face is that 59 percent of women have not figured out how much they need to save for retirement. When workers, men and women alike, are younger, they are frequently not thinking of how much they need to save for retirement. Younger workers are concerned with mortgages, school loans, children's needs. When these workers get older, and start thinking about retirement, they often increase the amount of money they will put away for retirement. Unfortunately women, who have often spent less time in the workplace, have less time in which to make the required `catch-up' contributions that will help create a stable and secure retirement. This process is made even harder by existing rules that limit the amounts of the catch-up contributions. 
   Given the difficulties women, especially unmarried women, face in their retirement years, I believe that it is time for the Congress to step up and to ensure that retirement security law provides for higher contribution limits for working women, easier catch-up to make up for years women missed in the labor force, and increased portability of pensions. 
   The POWER Act of 2000 will do three major things: First, the bill will increase contribution limits, allowing workers to contribute more money to retirement accounts during their working years, thereby ensuring that their retirements will be more secure. 
   For workers who are over fifty, the bill allows additional pension contributions of up to 50 percent more than allowed under current law. This provision is particularly helpful to women who leave the labor force to raise their children, and then want to ``catch-up'' when they are older by increasing their contributions in the years leading up to retirement. This bill also requires employers to vest employees earlier, so that women, who have shorter average job tenures, can accrue pension benefits earlier. 
   The bill's third section eases portability of pensions among workers who switch jobs. The bill eases rollovers and requires that rollovers apply to all retirement plans. In addition, the bill extends pension rollovers to include post-tax as well as pre-tax distributions, and calls for the post-tax distributions to be accounted for separately. 
   These provisions are not controversial. They have all passed both the Senate and the House of Representatives as part of the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act. President Clinton vetoed that earlier bill. I disagree with the President, but he is entitled to his opinion. On these provisions, however, it is impossible to claim that these female-friendly provisions will cost too much money. The provisions in this bill will help all workers save more for retirement, and develop larger pensions for their golden years. 
   This bill will particularly help women, who face a much greater risk of poverty. While the POWER Act will help both women and men save for retirement, it will correct specific pension inequalities in the current law that particularly hurt women. Missouri's nearly 900,000 working women certainly will benefit through enhanced opportunities to create financial security for retirement. In Missouri, 65 percent of working age women are in the paid labor force. According to the Missouri Women's Council, only 26 percent of older women receive a pension, compared with 47 percent of men. In addition, the pensions that women do receive are significantly less than those of men--$4,200 for women, on average, compared with $7,800 for men. 
   I hope that the Senate will take quick action on this matter, to help American women provide for safe and secure retirements.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Bridging the Digital Divide Act of 2000, a bill to make it easier for working Americans to obtain computers and computer equipment so that no one is left behind in the new Internet economy. This legislation makes it possible for employees to accept computers offered by their employers without having to pay the IRS taxes on the value of the computer. 
   Mr. President, the high-tech sector is an increasingly important part of our economy, creating new synergies and opportunities for Americans of all ages. The more we can do to encourage every American to participate in the Internet revolution, the more productive we as a nation will be. 
   But the benefits of the high-tech revolution, while lucrative, must not be limited to only some of our citizens. The great promise of the Internet revolution is that the benefits and rewards are accessed at the individual level; not just reserved for big businesses or multinational corporations. Our government should facilitate, not hinder, bringing that promise to each American. 
   In the long term, I believe that being hooked up to the Internet will be as universal as television. It is important to remember that the Internet is a new technology, one that few people had heard of ten years ago. We have gone from 5.8 million U.S. households online in 1994 to almost 40 million in 1999. By 2003, it is projected that 60 million households will be hooked up to the Internet. 
   In the short term, however, it is important to facilitate the availability of the Internet to all Americans. While many citizens have been taking advantage of the opportunities the Internet has to offer, too many Americans and Missourians have been left behind. Too many people are opting out or being left behind by the Internet economy. 
   According to Forrester Research, income is the main driver of Internet adoption. Americans who earn more, participate more, and thereby develop the ability to earn even more. According to a 1998 study by the Department of Commerce, households with income of $75,000 and more are over 20 times more likely to have Internet access than those at the lowest income levels. 
   This divide among income levels also indicates a divide along racial lines as well. According to the same Department of Commerce report, black and Hispanic households are roughly two-fifths as likely to have Internet access as white households. Overall, according to Forrester Research, only 33 percent of African American households are on-line, ten percent fewer than the national average. 
   In my home state of Missouri, great progress has been made toward the goal of bringing the state on-line. Since 1989, during my tenure as Governor, Missouri has managed a statewide network that connects state government departments and transmits voice, data, and video between them. The state Department of Administration runs the network, which connects government offices statewide over 14 nodes. In addition, according to the Department of Commerce, 42 percent of Missouri households have computers. 
   Despite this progress, there is still more to do. In terms of Internet usage, Missouri ranks 32nd out of the 50 states, with only 24.3 percent of households connected to the Internet in 1998. Clearly, it is in Missouri's interest to promote increased connectedness. 
   Across the nation, those who appreciate the power and opportunities inherent in the Internet continue to increase their involvement in the high-tech world. 60 percent of computer sales are being made to households that have already purchased a computer, demonstrating that these households recognize the importance of remaining current and up to date with their computer equipment. At the same time, only 40 percent of computer sales are being made to households purchasing a computer for the first time. If we want more Americans to experience the high-tech economy, we should encourage first time computer purchases and find ways to make computer ownership easier for families who are currently without. 
   According to Dr. Mark Dean, a specialist in advanced technology development for IBM, the solution to the digital divide is to put computers in as many homes as possible. Unfortunately, when employers have tried to help bridge this gap by providing their employees with computers and Internet access, the Internet Revenue Service has widened the digital divide by treating the new equipment as a ``taxable event,'' or in other words, requiring the employee to pay income tax on the value of the computer. 
   Recently, the Ford Motor Company began a laudale effort to increase involvement of its employees in the high-tech economy. In February, Ford announced that it would give all of its 350,000 employees free computers for their homes. Ford is doing this because they recognize the value of having a workforce that is computer literate and internet savvy. Ford understands that in the digital economy, on-line workers are more productive workers--whatever their responsibilities are with the company. 
   Unfortunately, the IRS does not see things the same way. The IRS approach is to tax everything it can get its hands on, including the computers Ford is providing to employees to help bridge the digital divide. According to the IRS, the employees who receive these computers from their employer are liable for tax on the value of the computers. 
   Mr. President, this is wrong. When companies make the move to bring all of their employees into the 21st century, the government should not make it harder on the workers to accept the technology by increasing their taxes. Ford's employees should not be penalized for having an employer that understands the importance of a computer-literate workforce. The fact is that computers are a vital business tool, for all employees, and Ford has demonstrated its understanding of this fact by providing these computers for every employee, from the newest worker to the CEO. 
   Ford's employees should not have to suffer as a result of the IRS's 19th century approach to tax policy. It is for this reason that my bill, the Bridging the Digital Divide Act of 2000, instructs the IRS not to treat computers provided to all employees by an employer as taxable income to the employee. This measure is in the interest of employees and employers alike. And because computers in the home will help increase our economic productivity and hence our output, we can expect that the long term impact of this provision will prove beneficial not just to workers and their families but to the nation's economy as well. 
   Mr. President, many politicians stand up and complain about the problem of the ``digital divide.'' The Ford Motor Company has actually found a solution--a private sector solution--for its employees. The response of the government should be to thank Ford and encourage other companies to do what Ford has done--to take action that is in the best interest of its workers, not just for today, but for the future as well. But instead, the government response is to tax the recipients. I hope that other companies will follow Ford's example. By enacting this legislation, we may be making it possible for the private sector to help solve the digital divide, and will at least be ensuring  that the government will not put the taxman in the way of the bridge-builders of the new economy.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Thomas Pilkington as he retires from over thirty-six years of service to General Motors. 
   Tom began his career with General Motors in 1964 as a Suggestion Plan Investigator at the Chevrolet Motor Division Plant in Framingham, Massachusetts. Through hard work and determination, Tom achieved numerous promotions, including Interviewer and later Safety Inspector. In 1970, Tom was appointed Supervisor of Labor Relations at the Chevrolet Assembly Plant at Ypsilanti, Michigan, Supervisor of Salaried Personnel Administration in 1972, and later that year, he became Supervisor of Labor Relations. In 1973, Tom became General Supervisor of Labor Relations followed by General Supervisor of Industrial Relations in 1976. The following year, he was named Administrator of Labor Relations at the GMAD-Central office in Warren, Michigan. Within a month, he became Administrator of Salaried Personnel. 
   In October of 1977, Tom was named Personnel Director at the GMAD-Tarrytown plant in Tarrytown, New York, until his transfer in 1982 to Wentzville, Missouri, as Personnel Director. 
   Tom Pilkington's long tenure of service demonstrates his perseverance, hard work and dedication. His outstanding service to General Motors over the years is truly admirable. 
   I urge the Senate to join me in congratulating Thomas Pilkington and wishing him, his wife, Marilee, and their family the very best as they move on to face new challenges, opportunities, and rewards.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in tribute to all the men and women in law enforcement in this country. This week, May 14-20, is National Police Week, set aside to honor the men and women behind the badge. In 1962, Congress passed and President Kennedy signed a joint resolution proclaiming May 15 of each year as Peace Officers Memorial Day and the calendar week of each year during which such May 15 occurs as Police Week, ``in recognition of the service given by the men and women who, night and day, stand guard in our midst to protect us through enforcement of our laws,'' from Public Law 87-726. 
   Sadly, between 140 and 160 law enforcement officers die in the line of duty each year. On average, 21,433 officers are injured in the line of duty each year. 
   In honor of the thousands of officers who have given their lives to protect the people of this Nation, I am pleased to announce an important step that the Senate took yesterday in furtherance of a much needed change in the current federal law. Last September I introduced S. 1638, a bill to expand the educational opportunities under the Deegan program, named after slain Federal officer Bill Deegan, for the families of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. This bill honors those who made the ultimate sacrifice in defending our communities by making available Federal funds to those officers' spouses and dependent children in order to pursue secondary education. 
   Yesterday, on National Peace Officers Memorial Day, the Senate unanimously passed S. 1638. I want to thank  the Senate for taking this action, and urge the House to do the same. 
   I want to thank the co-sponsors of this bill--Senators COLLINS, GRAMS, ROBB, TIM HUTCHINSON, DODD, ABRAHAM, SPECTER, BRYAN, GREGG, HELMS, and BIDEN. I am very pleased by the bipartisan support for the bill, and for the endorsements of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association and other law enforcement organizations. 
   This bill extends retroactively the benefits created under the 1992 law to the surviving spouses and dependent children of law enforcement officials who were killed between 1978 and the current start dates of the program. 
   It is important to extend these benefits back to the year 1978 because under the existing program, a large number of dependent children currently between the ages 8 and 21, those born between 1978 and 1992, are excluded from participating in the program merely because their parent was killed before 1992. Pushing back the date allows these dependent children, currently facing the prospect of paying for secondary education in the often financially strained environment of a single-parent family, also to benefit from this program. 
   This goal is consistent with the intent of the original law: an effort to show our gratitude to the maximum number of dependent children of slain law enforcement officers. 
   This provision affects the families of an estimated 4,100 officers, including more than 60 in Missouri. The bill makes these spouses and dependent children eligible for up to $5820 a year for 4 years if they enroll in full-time study at an approved secondary school. In short, it helps the loved ones of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in defending the rest of us by allowing them to pursue their dreams to move forward with their lives and continue their education. 
   On this occasion, I also want to thank a very important organization headquartered in Camdenton, MO--the Concerns of Police Survivors, Inc. [COPS]. COPS was organized in 1984 with 110 members. Today COPS' membership is over 10,000 families. Concerns of Police Survivors, provides resources to assist in the rebuilding of the lives of surviving families of slain law enforcement officers. 
   Furthermore, COPS provides training to law enforcement agencies on survivor victimization issues and educates the public of the need to support the law enforcement profession and its survivors. 
   To help those families begin rebuilding their shattered lives, COPS is again hosting the National Police Survivors' Seminars as part of National Police Week--the second day of this seminar is occurring today in Alexandria, VA. For 15 years, COPS' National Police Survivors' Seminars have provided survivors of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty the opportunity to interact with other survivors and have access to some of the best mental health professionals available. I wish to thank COPS for the many programs that they operate in addition to the Police Survivors' Seminars, including scholarships, peer-support at the national, State, and local levels, ``C.O.P.S. Kids'' counseling programs, the ``C.O.P.S. Kids'' Summer Camp, Parents' Retreats, trial and parole support, and other assistance programs. 
   We owe a debt of gratitude to the hundreds of thousands of police officers who protect the lives and property of their fellow Americans. By the enforcement of our laws, these same officers have given our country internal freedom from fear and are responsible for helping our nation lower its crime rates again this year. These men and women, by their patriotic service and their dedicated efforts, have earned the gratitude of us all. 
   Officers who give their lives to protect our freedom leave behind families that must cope with the terrible loss. When this tragedy occurs, we have an obligation to help the spouses and children of fallen heroes. One way to help is to offer the opportunity to pursue their education. I thank the Senate for supporting this bill, and urge the House of Representatives to pass this legislation quickly.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I want to discuss an issue that, judging from my discussions with Missourians, establishing the right trade policy with China is of increasing concern to Americans, and Missourians in particular. 
   Missourians want more opportunities to use their economic freedom to shape the future for their families. They want increasing opportunities to sell their products. They want reciprocity and fairness. This is why I want to ensure that Missouri businesses, farmers, and workers will get what they are promised. Access to a market that is almost one-fourth of the world's population can create higher paying jobs. But if China doesn't live up to its agreements like in the past--no new jobs will be created in Missouri. 
   The WTO agreement that the United States concluded with China last November could give Missourians substantial benefits. Tariffs on industrial goods could fall from 25 to 9 percent--this means that all of the parts manufacturer5s for aerospace, automobiles, appliances would all face substantial ``tax decrease.'' Also, tariffs on agricultural goods would be reduced from 31 to 17 percent. Missouri, as a leader in agricultural production, would benefit substantially from these reductions. Cattlemen and pork producers would experience significant gains when tariffs are dropped to 12 percent. I also want Missouri farmers to have direct access to Chinese consumers instead of having to go through a bunch of middle-men. In addition, China has made commitments to eliminate eventually many of its current restrictions on services, such as distribution, banking, insurance, telecommunications, accounting, consulting, and other financial services. 
   But these are the promises that are on paper. Missourians in the ``Show-Me'' state are leery of relying only on promises when they don't know whether there is adequate enforcement. I've visited many factories where the workers want to make sure that they get a fair shake. They want real opportunities. They don't want hollow promises. I've been all over the state visiting farm families, and this is what they want as well. 
   Several of my constituents have a fairly accurate perspective on China's record of not voluntarily living up to its agreements. Let me read from a constituent letter, from the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, District 9, Bridgeton, Mo., dated March 17, 2000:  
   China has a history of failing to live up to every other trade agreement it has signed with the United States (the 1992 Memorandum on Prison Labor, the 1996 Bilateral Agreement on Unilateral Property Rights, the 1994 Bilateral Agreement on Textiles, and the 1992 memorandum of Understanding on Market Access).  
   I think this constituent has a pretty accurate assessment of China's dismal trade record. Quite honestly, China's trade record has been poor. In a 1992 agreement, the so-called ``Market Access'' Agreement, Missouri farmers, ranchers, and workers weren't actually given much market access. In 1995 China eliminated 176 licensing requirements, but then imposed 400 new de facto licensing requirements. By 1999, China had removed over 1,0000 quotas and licenses, but the U.S. Trade Representative reports that China is erecting new barriers to restrict imports. 
   Also, despite the commitment not to require import substitution, China announced a new ``Industrial Policy for the 1990s'' which could undermine the U.S. automobile, telecommunications, transportation, machinery, electronics, and construction industries. 
   Another one of my constituents has additional concerns that once we approve PNTR, the U.S. will lose substantial leverage. From the International Association of Fire Fighters of Kansas City, Mo, Local Union No. 42, dated March 28, 2000:  
   Granting PNTR will ..... reduce our ability to use unilateral tools to respond to continued Chinese failure to live up to its commitments. Our ability to take unilateral action is our only leverage against the Chinese government. Proponents of PNTR admit that only by using unilateral actions we were able to make even modest progress on intellectual property rights. The Chinese government has not lived up to the promises they made in every single trade agreement signed with the U.S. in the past ten years.  
   This Missourian is absolutely correct. In 1994 when we negotiated the WTO, the United States gave up the right to threaten a level of retaliation that was ``appropriate in the circumstances'' to get compliance. However, now we are bound to retaliate at a level that the WTO decides. We have seen where this has taken us with exporting our beef to Europe--absolutely nowhere. 
   We need to avoid creating an endless lawsuit with China that gets us nowhere. Missourians want some guarantees that they will in fact get export opportunities and not just a lot of litigation with no real results as with the Europeans in the beef and banana cases, where the retaliation level was reduced by the WTO body. 
   My goal is consistent with the ``show me'' state. It is straight-forward. Open China's market to Missouri goods and services. In order to do that, however, we must have enforcement that works. That is why I am proposing the ``SHOW ME'' Act. 
   My bill is simple. It would require the Administration to work out an arrangement with China whereby if the U.S. wins a WTO case but can't get compliance, China would agree not to challenge the U.S. level of retaliation. The Administration could negotiate this concession from China as a side letter to the November agreement or could negotiate as a part of the protocol of the accession phase. 
   There is precedent for this requirement. The Administration negotiated a 12 to 15 year phase out of special rules for safeguards and anti-dumping and countervailing duties (which are tools to protect our market), yet they did not work out a 15 year phase out of use of Section 301 (which is a foreign market opening tool). Both are needed--surge protection and market access tools. Market access is crucial to the farming community in Missouri, which gets about one-fourth of its farm income from overseas sales. 
   In closing, Mr. President, quite frankly, there is declining satisfaction in America's heartland with our inability to pry open foreign markets. The only way we will rebuild is with real enforcement. A lot of my constituents from the ``Show Me'' state want to see more assurances from us and the Administration that what happened on the EU beef and banana cases won't reverberate through the Chinese market. They want our trade policy to create jobs in practice, not just in theory.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to congratulate the class from Westminister Christian Academy in St. Louis that represented the state of Missouri in the We the People--The Citizen and the Constitution national finals in Washington, D.C., during May 6-8, 2000. These young scholars worked diligently to reach the national finals, where they received honorable mention. Through this experience they have gained a deep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles and values of our constitutional democracy. 
   I would like to recognize Rebekah Baxter, Anna-Grace Claassen, Samantha Denny, Jonathan Friz, Joseph Goldkamp, Nick Gustafson, Tim Ivancic, Aaron Johnson, Melissa Millar, Sarah Munson, John Murphy, Steve Ottolini, Nick Pavlenko, Dawn Piehl, Rodney Schnellbacher, Michelle Stanford, Lindsey Vehlewald and Kristen Walle and their teacher Ken Boesch. 
   The We the People ..... The Citizen and the Constitution program is an extensive educational program developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The three-day national competition is modeled after hearings in the U.S. Congress. These hearings consist of oral presentations by high school students before a panel of adult judges. The students testify as constitutional experts before a panel of judges representing various regions of the country and a variety of appropriate fields. The students' testimony is followed by a period of questioning by the simulated congressional committee. The judges probe students for their depth of understanding and ability to apply their constitutional knowledge. 
   I would like to congratulate the class from Westminister Christian Academy on their exemplary performance at the We the People ..... national finals. I wish these young ``constitutional experts'' from Missouri the best of luck in their future endeavors.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I note with interest Vice President GORE's recent attacks on Governor Bush's comments regarding Governor Bush's thoughts on Social Security reform. In dismissing the Governor's suggestions regarding Social Security reform, Vice President GORE denied that the Clinton-Gore Administration ever proposed the dangerous idea of having the government invest Social Security surpluses in the stock market. According to the May 2, 2000 Washington Post, the Vice President claimed that the administration never made any such proposal, saying ``We didn't really propose it.'' 
   I find it surprising that the Vice President made this denial, especially since the Clinton-Gore administration has indeed made this proposal, and done so a number of times. First, on January 19, 1999, with the Vice President right behind him, President Clinton said in his State of the Union Address, and I quote, ``Specifically, I propose that we commit 60 percent of the budget surplus for the next 15 years to Social Security, investing a small portion in the private sector, just as any private or state government pension would do.'' 
   Just a few weeks later, the Clinton-Gore FY 2000 budget said quite clearly, on page 41, that ``The Administration proposes tapping the power of private financial markets to increase the resources to pay for future Social Security benefits. Roughly one-fifth of the unified budget surplus set aside for Social Security would be invested in corporate equities or other private financial instruments.'' 
   When I read this proposal, I was extremely concerned and proposed an amendment to the FY 2000 Budget Resolution that would express the Sense of the Senate that the government should not invest Social Security funds in the stock market. My amendment passed the Senate unanimously. After this resounding statement by the Senate, I hoped that we had laid the risky scheme to have the government invest Social Security funds in the stock market to rest. 
   Despite the fact that we had sent the clearest possible signal on this issue, the Clinton-Gore administration apparently did not get the message. On page 37 of the Clinton-Gore administration's FY 2001 budget, they resurrected this risky scheme to have the government invest the Social Security dollars in the stock market, saying, ``The President proposes to invest half the transferred amounts in corporate equities.'' The only concession that the Clinton-Gore administration appeared to make was writing this unpopular proposal in smaller type than last year. 
   In response to this repeated proposal, I once again submitted an amendment to the Budget Resolution expressing the Sense of the Senate that the federal government should not invest the Social Security trust fund in the stock market. Once again this amendment passed with no votes in opposition. 
   The Senate has twice unanimously passed an amendment rejecting the idea of having the government invest the trust fund in the stock market. I am pleased that the Vice President now agrees with us, but I find it curious that he has failed to notice that it is his administration that has repeatedly suggested this risky scheme. 
   The Clinton-Gore administration's repeated attempts to implement this plan violates U.S. law. For more than 60 years Social Security law has forbidden the trust funds from being invested in the stock market. This new scheme is directly contrary to six decades of U.S. policy on Social Security.  
   In addition to the Senate and long-standing U.S. government policy opposing government investment of the trust funds in the stock market, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan opposes the idea as well. Chairman Greenspan says that investing Social Security funds in the market is bad for Social Security and bad for our economy. 
   When Alan Greenspan talks, the Clinton-Gore administration ought to listen. Chairman Greenspan has said this plan ``will create a lower rate of return for Social Security recipients,'' and he ``does not believe that it is 
   politically feasible to insulate such huge funds from a governmental direction.'' 
   In addition to these other concerns, I am also listening to the concerns of Missourians. Last year I received a letter from Todd Lawrence of Greenwood, Missouri, who wrote: ``It has been suggested that the government would invest in the stock market with my Social Security money. No offense, but there is not much that the Government touches that works well. Why would making MY investment decisions for me be any different. Looking at it from a business perspective, would the owner of a corporation feel comfortable if the government were the primary shareholder?'' 
   Todd Lawrence understands what the Clinton-Gore administration does not. No corporation would want the government as a shareholder, and no investor should want the government handling their investment. 
   Even if the government were able to invest without adding new levels of inefficiency to the process, the government's putting Social Security taxes in the stock market adds an unacceptable level of risk to retirement. This risk is a gamble I am unwilling to make for the one million Missourians who get Social Security. 
   It is hard to overestimate how dangerous this scheme really is. While individuals properly manage their financial portfolios to control risk, the government has no business taking these gambles with the people's money. 
   Just recently, the Microsoft case gave us a chilling illustration of the potential conflicts of interest caused by the President's proposal. If the government had invested Social Security funds in the stock market, the anti-trust suit against Microsoft would have put those funds at risk. Whatever one may think of the wisdom of the case, we do not want the federal government making law enforcement decisions based on government's stock portfolio. 
   While Americans should invest as much as they can afford in private equities to plan for their own retirements, the government should stay out of the stock market. I am glad that the Vice President has finally recognized that having the government invest the trust fund in the stock market, but I wish that he would remember that his administration has been the most vocal proponent of this bad idea. If the federal government tried to pick market winners and losers, all of us would end up as losers.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak because I believe the right participation by the U.S. Government in the educational process of our children is fundamental to our success as a nation in the next century. It is important for us to understand that we have a limited role in this area. 
   Mr. President, 93 percent of all the funding for education--93 percent; that is basically $13 out of $14 spent in education--comes from State and local governments. Frankly, I think that is a positive, not a negative. I think when people invest their own resources, when they invest the resources they have control over, they are likely to do so very effectively. 
   But it is appropriate, and as a matter of fact beneficial, when the Federal Government decides to be of assistance in the area of education. When we are involved, I think there ought to be some principles that we should follow in order to make sure we maximize the positive impact we can have in terms of the achievement standing of children. I use a term such as ``achievement standing'' or the ``capacity to achieve'' because I think that is what we are interested in, in education. 
   The question is, What do we want out of education? I think we want children whose capacity to do things, whose capacity to learn, and the things that they have learned, have been enhanced substantially. 
   It is nice to have school buildings. It is nice to have teachers. It is nice to have education programs. But ultimately, the purpose for which we develop resources and to which we devote the resources, is to elevate the capacity of children to learn. 
   How do we improve what happens to children? 
   I have had some opportunity to be aggressive and active in this area at the State and local level in government. Having spent 8 years as the Governor of my State, and visiting many of Missouri's 550 or so school districts, I know it is the focal point of the community in almost every setting. It is the objective of that community to elevate the standing of students, asking how do we help students do more? 
   Different communities have found different ways of inspiring students, preparing students, building students, and elevating what happens in the classroom. I think that is what we should be involved in. 
   During my time as Governor of the State of Missouri, the State board of education was so convinced about getting parents and teachers involved in the education of children, because it motivates children to be achievers, that we had a slogan that said: ``Success in school is homemade.'' 
   Talking about localizing what we do in education, if you take it all the way to the home, you have localized it about as much as possible. 
   As a matter of fact, during my time as the president, or chairman--I forget the designation I carried--for the Education Commission of the States, it was an emphasis we agreed upon nationally that energizing parents and energizing the local community was the way in which we get the most return for our school dollars, as study after study has shown. And the anecdotal evidence is incredibly strong that cultures that involve parents and local officials in making decisions for what can and will work are the cultures where education succeeds. 
   So the ingredients of public school success include the very important point of getting students motivated as a result of the active participation of their families. 
   The House Committee on Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations answered this question about what are the ingredients of educational success in a report released in July of 1998. The report was called ``Education at a Crossroads: What Works and What's Wasted in Education Today.'' The subcommittee found that successful schools and school systems were not the product of Federal funding and directives but instead were characterized by--here are the ingredients--parental involvement in the education of their children; two, local control; three, emphasis on basic academics; four, dollars spent in the classroom, not on distant bureaucracy and ineffective programs.  
   I believe these are the ingredients that are necessary for all of us to understand if we are going to talk about elevating the performance of students, which is why we speak about this issue today, because there are noble objectives and there are programs that may sound novel and noble, but if they don't elevate the status of students, we will have failed miserably. 
   I am concerned that too often the Federal program which finds its first consumption of resources in the administration of the program and the bureaucracy at the Federal level very frequently then goes to the State bureaucracy at the State level, but it doesn't get all the way to the student. 
   But there is more to my concern that the proposal just doesn't get all the way to the student. Frequently, when it gets all the way to the student, it directs an activity or a devotion of the resource which is not called for in the circumstance of the student. 
   So there are two principles that are operative here: First, that we get the resource all the way to the student so that the resource is spent in the classroom and not in the bureaucracy. The second principle is, let the resource be spent, once it is at the level of the student, on things that make a difference in terms of performance and student achievement in the classroom. 
   It would be appropriate, I think, to have some sense of satisfaction of getting a resource all the way to the classroom and not having the shrinkage of the bureaucracy that takes the resource away. But if the resource gets to the classroom and the expenditure can only be for things that aren't needed or directly pertinent to student achievement, we will have lost the battle anyhow. 
   Yesterday, I had the opportunity of addressing this body, and I had the unhappy task of detailing the fact that for tens of thousands of individuals at the State level in our educational effort their entire existence is consumed with filling out Federal forms; that we are serving the bureaucracy with paperwork perhaps more effectively than we are serving the 
   students with education. 
   If the active participation by parents, community leaders, teachers, and boards of education at the local level is what really energizes schools to elevate the level of student achievement, maybe we should not have so much direction from the Federal level about how much and where the money should be spent. 
   I think that is pretty clear as a part of this bill which has been offered by our side; that we want to get the resources to individuals in the classroom, and not only deliver the resources to the classroom but to make sure that the best use for those resources can be determined by those who know the names of the students and the needs of the school rather than some hypothetical best use being developed a thousand miles away by bureaucrats who know, in theory, that generally the country needs X or Y but do not have very much awareness of specific needs in specific classrooms, in specific districts, in particular towns, counties, or communities all across America. 
   So this principle is, one, to get resources to the classroom and, two, to let the people who know the names of the students and the needs of the schools make the decisions. That is of fundamental importance. 
   When you gather at the Federal level the character of the programs and say we will make all the decisions about what is done, and we may want to get the resources to you but we will tell you what you have to do, that is the equivalent of hanging a sign on the schoolhouse door: ``Parents need not apply.'' It is the equivalent of saying to them, as much as we think you are an important part of education, you won't get to help make a decision about the way the resources are devoted, about the kind of program that is conducted, because, as a matter of fact, we will make those decisions for you in some remote bureaucracy. 
   I think the key to what we want to do is to empower those individuals at the local level by, first, sharing the resources with them as efficiently as possible, not shrinking it by running it through bureaucracy after bureaucracy and, second, empowering them by saying, once you have the resources, you have the right and opportunity to spend it in ways you know will benefit the students in a specific setting. 
   We have watched as we have lived with the sort of status quo in education, with the Federal Government trying to impose its ideas on the country, and we aren't showing the desired results. When you are not getting the right results, if you keep doing the same things, you are asking for difficulty. The industrialist puts it this way: Your system is perfectly designed to give you what you are getting. 
   If we like what we are getting in education, we should just keep doing what we are doing. But if we think we can do better --as a matter of fact, if we think we must do better for the next generation of Americans, if we recognize that the world is exploding in a technological, developmental sense, and that for people to be at the top of the list, they are going to have to be able to deal with technology and they will have to have high levels of achievement and capacity in terms of education, I think we are going to have to confess that we must do better. And in order to do better, we have to change what we are doing. 
   It is virtually impossible to do better if we just do the same thing over and over. I think State and local governments need the kind of flexibility that we provide, and I think when we try to restrict that flexibility, when we try to restrain the capacity of the people who know best what their own children need, who witness what will motivate, on occasion, success in those students, we tell them they can't use that judgment, awareness, and knowledge, they can't use their proximity to the problem as a basis for developing a solution, as a matter of fact, we are hindering the process. 
   I stand to speak in favor of this measure which will not only move resources to the local and State level but will provide the authority and flexibility so those resources can be devoted to students in classrooms in ways that are known by the individuals who know--teachers and students--and to the needs of the institution to improve performance. I believe that is the key. 
   For us to persist in doing what we have done with the status quo, to persist with a system that finds more and more people disenchanted because they find their hands tied, and they want to do one thing they believe will help their students but the government says, no, they have to do something else, which isn't that helpful, or, even in order to do something else, they have to file a stack of papers that will take people out of the classroom, moves people away from education. 
   For the Federal Government, according to a study in Florida, to administer Federal dollars, it is about six times as expensive as it is to administer a State dollar. That is six times the paperwork volume that is basically involved. 
   We ought to begin to wonder whether those individuals who actually have the stake in the circumstances, their child in the school, why we should distrust them and impose this sort of not only rigid set of requirements but this rigid audit trail which requires six times as much administration as a State or local dollar does to deliver educational capacity to children. That is something we ought to be leery of. We ought to say, wait a second. Why would we want to spend all of that money in administration and second-guessing those who know best about their own children, their own future, and who have a stake in this issue, which is the important stake, and that is the 
   achievement of the students? 
   I think we ought to ask ourselves what happens in education when there is more nonteachers in the education system than there is teachers in the education system? When the administration of education and the tens of thousands of full-time equivalents across the country mandated by the Federal Government consume the resources instead of the resources getting to the classroom, we ought to ask ourselves: Is this the way for us to really be achievers? 
   We know when people have the right opportunity to succeed and the right resources, they can get the job done--my colleagues and I have talked about it over and over again--when they have the right opportunity in terms of resources and the right authority in terms of flexibility. 
   I think those are the two keys we have offered to the American people by this measure on our side as a way of allowing them to use the money they  have paid in taxes to elevate the capacity of the students who will chart the course of America in the next century. 
   We want for our children high levels of achievement. The children are the focus. The classroom is the focus. It is the place where it happens to those on whom we focus--the children. The ingredients of success are not great bureaucracies. They are great teachers, great classrooms, and great students. And it involves parents. When we tell parents the bureaucracy will make the decisions, we shunt them aside. We tell them they need not apply. That is a dangerous strategy and damaging to our students. 
   Our Federal programs haven't worked, and just doing more of it won't improve our performance. 
   My grandfather's admonition was, ``I sawed this board off more times, and it is still too short.'' If you keep sawing it will still be too short. You have to change your conduct. 
   We should change the focus at the local level; States and local governments need the ability as it relates to teachers. As Senator ABRAHAM said, we are not going to mandate that the States and local communities deal with teachers in any specific way. We want to authorize them to be able--with the resources they earned and paid in taxes--to devote those resources in such a way that they believe it will result in elevated performance for the students. 
   That is the long and the short of what we ought to be doing. The status quo is unacceptable. America will not survive on a continuing basis in the long term with our students being last on the list of those among industrialized nations. It doesn't matter if we are first on the list of expenditures. It doesn't matter if we have more resources devoted to the process that is eventually sucked into the bureaucracy or devoted to things that do not pay off. What matters is that students achieve. We cannot long endure as the leader of the free world if our students are the last on the list. Being the leader and being last doesn't fit. 
   It is time for us to focus our energies, resources, and authority to make good decisions for the elevation of student capacity. That will make a difference at the local level. That is why this measure is such an important measure. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to address the important issues we are facing today regarding education. I admire the passion with which my colleague from Connecticut has spoken. I simply come to a different conclusion. I think that if we really admire those individuals who work at the local level, we won't distrust them to allocate the resources for their children in their communities, to make good decisions about how the moneys are spent. That is a real contrast to what we have had for quite some time. 
   I wish to give a few examples about how Federal education program requirements eat up resources and they consume a disproportionate amount of the time that States and schools spend on administration. You see, when my constituents come to talk to me, they don't ask me about the process. They are asking me about the product. They are asking me can the students read? Can they spell? Can they compute? Can they reason? They want to be focused on student achievement. They don't want to be focused on whether the money is going to the State or whether the money is going to the Federal bureaucracy. They want something to happen at the end of the process that changes the lives of individuals. 
   As we get into a culture that is more and more technically oriented, the need for education is elevated more and more. In fact, we need to make sure that the money not only gets to the local level, but when it gets there, it can do something of value. And we have a couple of big problems with our current situation. They are primarily these: 
   No. 1, we may get the money to the local level, but only what is left of it after the Federal government and the State bureaucracies consume it with their bureaucratic redtape. So there is a small stream, a very anemic flow, that goes to the local community. 
   No. 2, when we finally get it there, we are frequently telling people at the local community that they have to spend it for something the local community knows isn't really very important. 
   Very few of us would want to get our help, for instance, medically, from someone who was 1,000 miles away and who didn't know anything about our condition. We would want someone who could examine us to find where our problems are and direct a therapy to address those problems. Federal programs from 1,000 miles away designed to make things uniform frequently don't work, and it is because the conditions are different in each community. 
   My colleague from Connecticut boasted of Connecticut's ability to provide uniform salaries for teachers. Then he talked about how unsuccessful it was to have the same salary in one place that you have in another place because the conditions are different. Maybe we should conclude something based on that--that uniformity may not be the answer. Maybe we should conclude that we should give individuals an opportunity to tailor, to adjust, to refine, and to define the resource and its application so that we could have a cause and effect, which is what we are looking for. 
   What is it we are looking for? We are looking for an elevated classroom capacity. We are looking for an elevated human capacity. We are looking for students who can read, write, spell, decipher, add, subtract, multiply, and divide. That is what we want from our schools. That isn't really different from the culture at large. 
   We have passed the century of mass products. Henry Ford was the master of mass production in the 1930s. He said, ``You can have your Ford any color you want it so long as it is black.'' He had the best idea, and a centrally driven idea that everybody would drive the same color car. The problem was that 10 years later, after he had 75 percent of the automotive market, he had 50 percent of the automotive market, and he began to understand that it wasn't appropriate to try to tell everybody what they wanted or what their needs were. He changed his slogan. Instead of, ``You can have your Ford any color you want it so long as it is black,'' he just shortened it to say, ``You can have your Ford any color you want it''--because he knew he had better meet the need. 
   It is time for us to stop saying you can have your education any color you want it so long as it is bureaucratic. It is time for us to say we want to help you elevate the capacity of students. We are not interested in bureaucracy. We are not interested even in bureaucracy at the State level. We are interested in students. We are interested in classrooms. We are not interested in interest groups. We want to elevate the capacity of students. 
   Listen to what has happened in the Federal Government. The Federal Department of Education requires over 48.6 million hours worth of paperwork every year in order for people to receive Federal dollars. That is the equivalent of 25,000 employees working full time. That is a real cost--25,000 full-time equivalents just processing Federal paperwork. There are more than 20,000 pages of applications States must fill out to receive Federal education funds each year. 
   The Department of Education brags that its staff is one of the smallest Federal Government agencies with only 4,637 people. State agencies, however, have to employ nearly 13,400 FTEs, full-time equivalents with Federal dollars to administer the myriad of Federal programs. That doesn't always reflect the total that is necessary at the local level. Hence, there are nearly three times as many federally funded employees at State education agencies administering Federal programs as there are U.S. Department of 
   Education employees. 
   I think we need to be thinking carefully about getting the resources to the students. We are facing a situation today in the United States of America where more than half of all the employees in public education are outside the classroom. No wonder people are wondering whether or not we are getting a return on our investment. 
   Where do we want to focus our investment? Do we want to feed the bureaucracy and build the bureaucracy, or do we want to fund the classroom and elevate student performance? We have to look carefully at that. 
   In the State of Florida, it takes 374 employees to administer $8 billion in State funds. It takes almost 400 to do $8 billion in State funds. For the $1 billion in Federal funds, it takes almost 300 employees. Basically, there are six times as many hours required to administer one dollar of Federal funds as there are hours required to administer one dollar of State funds. That puts us in a situation where there is a lot of money being spent on administration trying to make sure we have complied with all of the Federal requirements and working to satisfy the Federal mandate instead of working to educate the children. 
   I submit that we ought to look at these statistics. We find that it is not surprising that the Federal bureaucratic maze consumes up to 35 percent of Federal education dollars. These Federal programs and their requirements take away not only precious dollars, but they take up valuable teacher time. 
   I don't think there is much question about what we want. I don't think this is a partisan issue. All of us in the end want students to be able to achieve. The educational system is not for the bureaucracy. It is not for Washington. It is not for the State capitals. It is not for making people fill out forms to comply with Federal rules. Clearly, we can't afford for this trend to continue. We need to change our Federal policies to ensure a more efficient use of our Federal resources.  
   I would be pleased to yield to the manager on my side for a comment or unanimous consent request.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, a recent example of an inflexible mandate is the $1.2 billion earmarked exclusively for classroom size reduction for early elementary grades. That is a noble aspiration--lower classroom size. You can pursue a noble aspiration into a dead end or make a noble aspiration a financial misallocation. 
   Last year, Governor Davis of California described how the inflexibility of this initiative is hindering his State's ability to direct Federal funds to areas where the need is the greatest. While the Federal initiative requires funds to be used to reduce class size to 18 in the first three grades, in California they have already reduced class size to near that target in grades K through 4. 
   Governor Davis put it this way. He said of those Federal funds which are earmarked for an area where he has pretty much achieved the desired goal, that the goal to best serve the State's needs is to reduce class size in math and English in the 10th grade. 
   Of course, it is kind of hard to see that from Washington DC. But the Governor has a pretty good shot at understanding that if he has the class size problem under control in grades K through 4, and he really has a desperate need to reduce class size in the different area, he should be able to allocate those funds in that direction. 
   He put it this way: We need to have the flexibility to apply those resources where we think they could best be used. 
   A lot has been made about the potential for politics at the State level. 
   The eloquent speaker, the Senator from Connecticut, talked about how that might contaminate decisionmaking. Frankly, I think that the ability to hit the target from close up is usually far better than the ability to hit the target from long range. 
   When we talk about helping our children learn and helping them achieve elevated capacities in terms of the fundamentals necessary, States and local schools need the flexibility to spend money in the way they see fit to improve education. 
   Knowing the kinds of misallocations that have come, up to 35 percent of the resource being lost in the bureaucratic nightmare of regulations, the tens of thousands of full-time equivalents designed to supervise to make sure you spend the money in the way the Federal Government says it should be spent, in spite of the fact that might totally miss the needs of the student, we need to change things. We can't keep going in the same direction. 
   They used to joke when I was a kid when someone asked for directions. Someone else would say: Any road will get you there so long as you don't care where you are going. My grandfather used to say: I have sawed this board off four times, and it is still too short. If you are not succeeding, think about changing. The industrialist put it this way: Your system is perfectly designed to give you what you are getting. If you don't like what you are getting, think about changing it. 
   What are we getting? We are getting a poor return on our investment. It is wrong for America to have an output from its educational effort that is at the bottom of the industrialized nations. We can't keep sawing this board off. It is too short. We can't just take any road to get us there because we know we have a destination that is important. We can't afford to be taking the wrong road. 
   It is important to put people who are there on the spot, to see what the needs are. I say it this way: I want someone who knows the names of the students and the needs of the schools making the decisions. That is what is important. I want people who will live or die by the decisions, not someone from 1,000 miles away. 
   I believe there is a lot of common ground here. People talk about getting money to the local level. It doesn't do any good to get it there and then tie the hands of the people at the local level, or send the money to the school district so they can only spend it for things that are not priorities. That doesn't make much sense. Send the money to the school district and allow the school district to devote the resource to those things which are important to the achievement of students.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. First you said, could I respond by saying what priorities people are being required to spend resources on, or what things are not a priority. 
   Governor Davis of California said: You are requiring me to spend money on reduced class size in grades K through 4 when the priority is for reducing class size in grade 10 and English. 
   I quoted the Governor a few moments ago to that effect. 
   I believe it is very important that we be able to devote resources in ways to improve the ultimate performance. 
   We know class size is a priority in some settings. And other kinds of priorities exist for other settings. But I think we should allow individuals who know what the students need for our ultimate priority, which is student achievement. I think they should be able to look at that ultimate priority and see how we are going to elevate the performance of students.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I believe the correct interpretation of Ed-Flex is that there is substantial flexibility accorded to Governors for certain programs--not for all programs--and I believe it would be a misstatement to characterize it in the way it was characterized in the question. But there is additional flexibility, and I voted for Ed-Flex because it was a step in the right direction. 
   I don't purport to say the Governors should be the last word on this. From my perspective, we would be well served to push more of the decisionmaking authority down to the local level where the people who know the names of the students and the needs of the schools can make the determination. 
   I have visited three or four dozen school districts in my State in the last 3 or 4 months. I have been very intensive in my examination. It is very important we understand that tailoring the resource to meet the needs of students to elevate student performance is very important. 
   Sending money to feed the bureaucracy isn't important. The ultimate thing we need to determine is, are we doing those things that will elevate student performance? It may not even be the same thing in every case. There may be things needed in one area in one setting, in one cultural venue, that are different from in another. The presumption that Washington can know a  single solution is as foolish as the idea that there is a single product that would suit everyone. 
   Look at the march of industry in our country. We don't try to sell everybody the same computer. Look at the future. The future tells us if you call a fellow named Dell down in Texas, he doesn't tell you what computers he has to offer, he asks you what your needs are. They tailor that computer to meet your specific needs. 
   It is called mass customization, not mass production. Mass production is a thing of the past. Mass customization is a thing of the future. Let's allow our school districts to tailor the resources we provide to meet their needs and to elevate their students' capacity. Let's not try to impose on those students some sort of template from Washington that pushes them into a program or something that is not in their best interests and not according to their needs. The idea of Washington imposing and distorting education is an idea whose time has past. 
   In my State, there is a designation that is a result of a Federal program called IDEA. One in seven students in my State--and one in eight nationally--are designated as disabled. As a result of this designation, those students are not subject to discipline in the same way other students are. For example, if a disabled student brings a gun to school, the maximum time you can keep him out of the regular classroom is generally 45 days. Some of these disabilities, a good number of them, are behavioral disabilities, so they are students whose problem is in controlling themselves. Instead of having the 1-year suspension from class because they brought a weapon to school, they only have a 45-day suspension from class because they brought a weapon to school. 
   It is very difficult for local school administrators to have a situation where they can't discipline students effectively to maintain order and control. I believe we ought to adjust that. We ought to get decisions about resource allocation down to the local level, to moms and dads, community leaders, school board members, to decide how to spend the resources to best elevate student performance. I think that is what they want to do with the money. That is what they want school resources for. 
   I think we ought to also say to those people at the local and State level, you can make the kinds of decisions regarding discipline that are necessary in your culture and in your community and in your setting to secure the classroom and secure teachers. It is very important that be done, and be done in ways that will help students. 
   The Missouri School Boards Association has talked to me recently about these kinds of circumstances. They have given me some examples of what has happened in their school districts in the area of IDEA, discipline, and safety. Here is one, ``Teacher Assault.''  
   High school student with disabilities was placed in an alternative school after repeatedly assaulting her high school teachers. Recently aggravated, she approached the office. The secretary was talking with a person outside the office and did not see the student approach. The student hit the secretary in the side of the head, knocking her glasses off her face and causing personal injuries. This year the student has broken her teacher's glasses four times by hitting him in the face or pulling them from his face and breaking them. This behavior continues in spite of multiple years of interventions by mental health professionals, behavioral specialists and disability experts at school. The parents continue to meet on a regular basis with the school personnel. However, assaults are frequent and cause injury at home, at school and in the community. No agencies within the community or State will provide comprehensive treatment or services as she is considered too aggressive. She remains in public school.  
   Not subject to the kind of discipline there ought to be. 
   I can go through case after case of teacher assault. I can talk about students who have been shot by other students, students who were injured, whether it is with a knife or with a gun, and the absence of the capacity of our school administrators to deal with students who pose threats to the learning environment of our classrooms. It is a tragic absence of capacity. We ought to return that capacity to the local level. I believe it is possible for us to do so when we think carefully about our school; whether it be assaults on teachers, whether it be the possession of weapons, whether it be the importation of drugs into the schools. 
   So it is with this in mind that I think trusting local school officials is the way for us to respond. We need to adopt the kind of philosophy that moves decisionmaking as well as resources to the local level. Just moving resources to the local level with an administrative burden and a direction to spend the resources in ways that are not needed at the local level is nonsense. Move the resources to the local level and move the decisionmaking capacity to people who know the names of the students and the needs of those students and the needs of the institution. Let them make decisions. 
   Second, allow individuals who are running our schools at the State and local level to have the kind of rules and disciplinary procedures which provide a safe learning environment. If we do those things, we get to our ultimate accountability. The accountability is in student performance. Accountability is not in answering to Washington. Accountability is not answering to a bureaucracy. It is not filing tens of thousands of papers. Accountability is whether our students can read and write, add, subtract, multiply, and divide. It is whether our students are prepared for a technically demanding world, a workplace where, if they succeed with the right education, it will provide them with a chance to be world leaders; where, if we do not succeed and our educational skills languish, our days are numbered as a leader of the world. 
   It is with that in mind I want to say how important it is for us to not only have the right ability to send resources but decisionmaking as well to the local level, and then to provide a basis for maintaining a safe school environment by simply saying that school districts have the ability to discipline all children who bring weapons to school or use illegal drugs at school or possess them at school or children who assault school district personnel. 
   I will close by just remarking that this is not something that is against the best interests of schools or of teachers or of groups of individuals. The Education Roundtable of Missouri, which is comprised of all the major education associations in Missouri, including the PTA, including the MNEA, including the AFT, including the Missouri State Teachers Association and the Missouri School Boards Association--all of those endorse this idea that we need to have the capacity to discipline appropriately all students who bring weapons to schools, who assault teachers, who threaten and assault teachers and provide drugs in the school. They should be subject to appropriate discipline measures.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize May as the National Neurofibromatosis month. Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to grow along nerves throughout the body. These tumors can lead to a number of physical challenges including blindness, hearing impairment, or skeletal problems such as scoliosis or bone deformities. In addition to these physical challenges, over 60 percent of those diagnosed with neurofibromatosis are also faced with learning disabilities ranging from mild dyslexia and ADD to severe retardation. 
   Anyone's child or grandchild can have NF. This disease affects one in 4,000 children, making it more prevalent than cystic fibrosis and hereditary muscular dystrophy combined. NF equally affects both sexes and all racial and ethnic backgrounds. Although 50 percent of the cases are inherited, half are spontaneous with no family history. 
   It is an honor to stand before this body and recognize May as National Neurofibromatosis month. I would also like to take this opportunity to recognize the Missouri Chapter of The National Neurofibromatosis Foundation, Inc. and their efforts to provide support to those who suffer from NF as they strive towards a cure.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the marriage tax relief bill. You could characterize it as tax relief or you could characterize it, I suppose, as a tax cut. But the true characterization is one that Senator HUTCHISON has over and over emphasized: This is tax correction. The bill is intended to correct the Tax Code. The code needs correction because it is an assault on the very values of our culture. 
   There is a fundamental unfairness when the Tax Code is at war with our values and penalizes a basic social institution such as the institution of marriage. The American people know this. They understand it is not right to have a Tax Code that penalizes marriage. The vast majority of the Members of this body understand this. This last week, during consideration of the budget resolution, the Senate voted 99-1 on the Hutchison amendment to support marriage tax relief. In other words, let's abandon the policy of punishing married people who pay higher taxes in the Tax Code. 
   Despite this overwhelming vote less than 10 days ago, some of my colleagues are now trying to stop or to delay the marriage tax relief measure by demanding nonrelevant amendments. Yesterday, several Senators from the other side of the aisle spoke on the floor and agreed there is unfairness in the Tax Code and that it is fundamentally unfair to tax people only because they marry. However, these same Senators then said the Finance Committee bill gives tax cuts to people who do not need them. That seems an arrogant statement to me, to suppose Government knows best how to spend the people's money. In addition, one Senator opposed the finance bill, asking, how many of these tax cuts can we afford to give away? 
   I submit, the real question is, how much of the hard-earned money can families afford to have taken away by an unfair system which penalizes men and women, a schoolteacher, a fireman, for getting married and beginning a family? How much longer will we continue to allow married couples to be penalized just for getting married? 
   We are here to correct that fundamental unfairness. It is something that has grown up in the code. It is like a weed which is taking over the garden. Good things are prevented by its presence. We ought to pull it out and make sure we have a Tax Code that does not make it harder for young people to be married and have a family. 
   Are we for correcting this unfairness? Are we against it? Or are we just saying that we are? One cannot say they oppose this penalty and then fight to take the relief away that is provided in the bill. Our colleagues in the House  have already demonstrated dramatically that they back a correction for this injustice. 
   In February, the House passed the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act of 2000. Thanks to the good work of the Senate Finance Committee, under the direction of Senator ROTH, we have a measure which will help substantially lessen the burden of this penalty that has been laid upon the families of America. 
   This bill makes great strides in providing relief and correcting this injustice. Twenty-five million American couples pay an average of $1,400 a year extra simply because they are married. Ending the penalty will give couples the freedom to make the choices they ought to make: The choice to be married and have a durable, lasting relationship of marriage as the foundation for the family unit. 
   The marriage tax penalty forces some Americans to make compromises instead of real choices. Mothers and fathers should be able to choose whether both parents will be employed outside the home based on what is in the family's best interest, or whether there should be a nonworking spouse who stays in the home. The Senate bill respects the value of the contribution of the spouse who stays home, and that is very important. Our Tax Code should respect the value that is added to the equation by a stay-at-home spouse who makes the family a stronger unit and builds for this country the kind of integrity that strong families provide. 
   In conclusion, no one has ever devised or developed or even dreamed of a better department of education, social services, a better department of health, education, and welfare than the family, and it is time for our Tax Code.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the Budget Resolution before us is a responsible budget framework. Senator DOMENICI has done a superb job in helping to craft this budget on the Senate side, and he deserves our praise. This budget resolution balances the important goals of debt reduction, tax relief, and prudent spending levels. 
   Most importantly, the budget will fully protect Social Security now and in the future. This represents a sea change in the way business is done in Washington. When I came to Washington, Congress routinely spent money out of the Social Security trust fund. This resolution ends the raid on Social Security, and does so in two ways. 
   First, the budget is based on the premise that Social Security funds will not be used to pay for additional deficit spending or tax relief. Second, as part of this budget's commitment to protect the entire Social Security surplus, Senator DOMENICI included a point of order against any budget that spends money out of the Social Security surplus. This rule is the same as the one I proposed last year, and that was included in the FY 2000 budget. 
   As a result of this hard-fought fiscal discipline, this budget will retire $1.1 trillion in publicly held debt over 5 years, and approximately $170 billion next year. If we continue upon the path laid out by this budget, we will completely eliminate the publicly-held debt over the next 13 years. 
   We have already made great progress in this regard. When this budget is enacted, we will have reduced the national debt by $533 billion over the past three years. 
   I was particularly pleased that the Senate unanimously accepted my amendment objecting to the President's plan to have the government invest Social Security surpluses in the stock market. This risky scheme would have put both Social Security and the stock market at risk. 
   In addition to responsibly paying off our publicly-held debt, this budget allows for approximately $150 billion in tax relief over 5 years, including $13 billion in FY 2001. These actions include significant marriage penalty relief, which already has passed the House, and is working its way through the Senate. In fact, during the debate on the Budget Resolution, the Senate passed the Hutchison-Ashcroft amendment calling for marriage penalty relief 99-1. 
   In addition to providing a judicious mix of tax relief, debt reduction, and Social Security protection, the FY 2001 Budget Resolution also includes responsible spending levels. This budget, which is a balanced budget for the third year in a row, calls for approximately $600.5 billion in discretionary spending. 
   This budget will fully fund Medicare, rejecting President Clinton's Medicare cuts of $14 billion over 5 years. In addition, Congress' spending plan calls for a $40 billion reserve fund to pay for Medicare reform and Medicare prescription drugs. 
   As I said, this budget focuses spending towards our national priorities, including a $4.5 billion increase in education spending in FY 2001, and $5.5 billion in agriculture spending in FY 2000. The FY 2001 budget also increases funding for domestic priorities such as Head Start; embassy security; the National Science Foundation; the National Institutes of Health; the Park Service; and highways and airports. 
   Of course, this budget isn't perfect. I was disappointed that the Senate did not adopt the effort to protect the Medicare surplus with my Medicare lockbox amendment. This amendment, which would have extended the protections that now apply to Social Security to the Medicare Part A Hospital Insurance trust, did not overcome a point of order in the Senate. 
   Despite this setback, I am pleased with the overall package agreed to by Congress. It meets the vital national needs of protecting Social Security, reducing debt, cutting taxes, and funding our domestic priorities. I plan to vote for the FY 2001 Budget Resolution.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is my great privilege to introduce a bill today, along with Senators BOND, WARNER, DEWINE, and MOYNIHAN, that will name the State Department's Headquarters in Washington, D.C., the ``Harry S. Truman Federal Building.'' I truly appreciate the support of these distinguished colleagues and Secretary Albright to see this idea become a reality. 
   Born in Lamar, Missouri, Harry S. Truman was a farmer, a national guardsman, a World War I veteran, a local postmaster, a road overseer, and a small business owner before turning to politics. Through these experiences, he gained the courage, honesty, and dedication to freedom required of a greater leader. Truman went on to become one of the most influential Presidents of the modern era. His leadership and character, especially in the area of foreign policy, have earned him well-deserved praise and respect throughout the world. 
   He established the Marshall Plan--creating a politically and economically stable Western Europe. President Truman was instrumental in creating the North Atlantic Treaty Organization which kept Soviet aggression at bay in Western Europe. He worked to contain the further spread of communism in Berlin, Greece, Turkey, and Korea. Clearly, President Truman was the architect of the strategy that won the Cold War and is a prime reason the United States is currently the world's sole superpower. 
   Mr. President, the State Department should be named after a true leader in foreign policy--and President Harry S. Truman is the clear choice. And through this choice, I hope the United States will continue President Truman's principled foreign policy as seen in his 1949 Presidential Inaugural Address:  
   Events have brought our American democracy to new influence and new responsibilities. They will test our courage, our devotion to duty, and our concept of liberty. But I say to all men, what we have achieved in liberty, we will surpass in greater liberty. Steadfast in our faith in the Almighty, we will advance toward a world where man's freedom is secure. To that end we will devote our strength, our resources, and our firmness of resolve. With God's help, the future of mankind will be assured in a world of justice, harmony, and peace.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment regarding Congressional term limits and the ability of States to set term limits for members of the United States Congress. Mr. President, I would like to summarize the history of this proposed constitutional amendment. 
   On November 29, 1994, the Clinton administration argued before the Supreme Court of the United States that States should not have the right to limit congressional terms. Thus, the executive branch has spoken against the right of the states and of the people to limit the number of terms individuals may serve in the U.S. Congress. 
   On May 23rd, 1995, in U.S. Term Limits v. Thorton (514 U.S. 779), the Supreme Court denied the people the right to limit congressional terms. Before the court ruling, 23 states, including my home state of Missouri, had some limit on the number of terms members of Congress could serve. 
   In a 5-4 decision, the Court invalidated measures which represented over five years of work and were supported by 25 million voters. These voters wanted nothing more than to rein in congressional power, restore competitive elections, and create a Congress that looked, and legislated, like America. 
   Both the executive branch, through the Clinton administration, and the judicial branch, have spoken against the right of States and of the people to limit the terms of individuals who represent them in Congress. 
   There has been limited debate on terms limits in this Congress. In 1995, the House of Representatives fell well short of the two-thirds majority required to forward to the people a constitutional amendment on term limits. Of the 290-vote margin required for a constitutional amendment, they mustered only 227 votes. What would normally be a significant majority vote in the House, was clearly not enough to ensure that States would have the opportunity to vote on a constitutional amendment permitting term limits. 
   One hope for the overwhelming number of people in this country who endorse term limits is for Congress to extend them the opportunity to amend the Constitution in a way that would allow individual States to limit the terms members of Congress may serve. More than 3 out of 4 people in the United States endorse the concept of term limits. They have watched individuals come to Washington and spend time here, captivated by the Beltway logic, the spending habits and the power that exists in this city. The people of America know that the talent pool in America is substantial and there are many who ought to have the opportunity to serve in Congress. Furthermore, they know that term limits  would ensure that individuals who go to Washington return someday to live under the very laws that they enact. 
   In January of 1995, Senator THOMPSON and I introduced a constitutional amendment that would have limited members of Congress to three terms in the House and two terms in the Senate. As a result of its defeat and of the administration's refusal to recognize the will of the people, in May of 1995, I introduced S.J. Res. 36, a different kind of constitutional amendment. This amendment simply would give States the explicit right to limit congressional terms. It would not mandate that any State limit the nature or extent of the terms of the individuals who represent it in the Congress. Instead, it would give the States, if they chose to do so, the right to limit the members' terms who represent that State. I am reintroducing that amendment today. 
   In the Thornton case, Justice Thomas wrote, ``Where the Constitution is silent it raises no bar to action by the States or the people.'' I believe he is correct. This is the concept embodied in the often forgotten Tenth Amendment that would not cede all power to the federal government, only to have it doled back to us where the federal government thinks it appropriate. This proposed amendment is offered to rectify that situation. 
   The people of this Republic should have the opportunity to limit the terms of those who serve them in Congress. In light of the fact that the administration has argued against term limits, the executive branch is not going to support term limits, and because the judicial branch has ruled conclusively now that the States have no constitutional authority to act in this area, it is up to those of us in Congress to give the people the opportunity to be heard on this issue. 
   We must, at least, give them the opportunity to vote on that right by sending to them this joint resolution on the right of States and individuals to limit members' terms who serve the States and the districts of those States in the U.S. Congress. 
   It is a profoundly important expression of our confidence in the people of this country to extend to them the right to be involved in making this judgment. I submit this joint resolution today in the hopes that democracy will continue to flourish as people have greater opportunities to be involved.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the thirteen Iranian Jews wrongfully imprisoned and facing trial in Iran. I join with concerned people of all faiths around the nation, and the world, in calling for the observation of fundamental human rights and the ultimate goal of freedom for these innocent people. 
   Iran has recently taken some positive steps away from political and religious repression toward the acceptance of freedom, justice, and democracy. Reforms, however, have been marred by a disheartening lack of concern for the human rights of religious minorities in Iran. Throughout my life, I have been committed to furthering fundamental human rights, especially religious freedom, for both Americans and people throughout the world. Therefore, I was deeply concerned by the February 1999 arrest of thirteen Iranian Jews informally accused of spying for Israel and the United States. Today, ten of the thirteen are still in jail awaiting trial, while the other three have been released on bail. This situation is especially troubling because these innocent community and religious leaders could face the death penalty if convicted. 
   Mr. President, this entire legal ordeal has been filled with Iranian Constitutional violations and shrouded in secrecy. For instance, the thirteen have never been formally charged or indicted. This should be the first step in any legal proceeding, but it now appears almost certain the defendants will not know the charges they face until the trial begins. As a former Attorney General of Missouri, I fully appreciate what a daunting, if not impossible, task it would be to build a credible defense without knowing the charges. 
   Additionally, although it appears the Iranian government might have recently reversed its previous position and agreed to allow the thirteen to choose their own legal counsel, the judge in the case has refused access to the defendants by their chosen attorneys. Beyond the seriously limiting results of this decision, the chosen attorneys cannot officially become the defendant's counsel until the necessary legal documents are signed, which will not occur until the attorneys and defendants meet. The courts have created one of the worst ``Catch-22s'' I have seen. 
   It also troubles me that the trial will be conducted in secrecy. After repeated requests by international observers and the press, the decision to keep the trial secret has been affirmed by the courts. For these obvious reasons, I believe it likely that the thirteen will not receive a fair and impartial trial. 
   The members of the Jewish Iranian community, who out of respect and fear of the Islamic majority rarely speak out in public, have even made an uncharacteristic plea to the Iranian government. I join with this community in asking for all defendants in Iran, regardless of religion or standing, to have access to legal counsel of their own choosing, and to be afforded the requirements of Iranian law for fair and open trials. In addition, I urge the Iranian government to grant permission for the ten jailed Iranian Jewish defendants to go home on furlough for Passover, which begins on the evening of April 19th, if the proceedings have not yet been completed. 
   Mr. President, I rise today in support of the basic principles of human rights and religious freedom. The Iranian government must do the right thing and provide these defendants their fundamental rights, and the International Community must use all available pressure and diplomatic avenues to influence them to do so. And the United States Government should demonstrate real leadership by diligently working to see the ultimate release of these thirteen Jewish Iranian defendants.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, this is an amendment which would express the sense of the Senate that the Government should not invest the Social Security trust fund in the stock market. I believe there is a consensus on both sides that this is the case. 
   Last year, we voted 99-0 to say we did not want the Government playing stockbroker for a day with the retirement security of the American people. 
   I personally believe we could do this on a voice vote as a matter of saving the time and energy of this body. I suggest we do so. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I would like to begin by praising Chairman DOMENICI for producing this responsible budget, which I intend to support. 
   Chairman DOMENICI's budget will fully protect Social Security over 5 years. This represents a sea change in the way business is done in Washington. When I came to Washington, Congress routinely spent money out of the Social Security trust fund, something that Chairman DOMENICI's budget does not even consider. 
   As a result of this hard-fought fiscal discipline, this budget will retire $1.1 trillion in publicly held debt over 5 years, and $177 billion next year. If we continue upon the path laid out by this budget, we will completely eliminate the publicly-held debt over the next 13 years. 
   In addition to responsibly paying off our debt, this budget allows for $150 billion in tax cuts over 5 years, including $13 billion in FY 2001, and responsible increases in other discretionary accounts, including a 4.8% increase in national defense. 
   I would like to commend Senator DOMENICI for crafting this budget, and emphasize what a pleasure it is to work with him. 
   Last year, I worked with Senator DOMENICI on a rule in last year's budget that created a point of order against any budget that spends money out of the Social Security surplus. 
   As a result of last year's budget rule, the CBO has stated that they FY 2000 budget will not spend a penny out of the Social Security surplus for the first time in 40 years. This year, the Senate Budget Committee estimates that the United States government will have an on-budget surplus of $8 billion. This on-budget surplus allows the government to protect the Social Security trust fund and to help reduce our publicly held debt by $300 billion by the end of this year. 
   Early last year, I introduced the first legislation designed to lockbox the Social Security trust fund. This legislation formed the basis of the Ashcroft rule protecting Social Security included in last year's budget resolution. 
   In addition, we spent much of last year working on the Abraham-Domenici-lockbox, which also would have protected all of the Social Security surpluses from new spending. 
   Unfortunately, the Democrats saw fit to block this legislation, filibustering the lockbox 6 times. 
   Despite this opposition, we have succeeded in creating in practice what we have not yet achieved in legislation. 
   This year Senator DOMENICI included last year's Social Security rule in the FY 2001 budget, and Senator ABRAHAM successfully offered a committee amendment to extend that point of order to 60 votes, which was my original intention. 
   Protecting Social Security through the Social Security lockbox has been a giant step forward in the fight for responsible budgeting. Now it is time to take that fight one step further. 
   Today I am offering an amendment that creates points of order in the Senate and the House against any budget resolution or subsequent bill that uses the Medicare or Social Security surpluses to finance on-budget deficits. We do not have that protection now. 
   This new rule I am proposing expands the Social Security budget rule by adding Medicare part A to the Social Security lockbox, ensuring that Congress must balance the budget without using any money from the annual Social Security or 
   Medicare part A surpluses. If Congress does dip into the Medicare part A surplus, my amendment calls for a sequester of discretionary spending in the amount of the violation. 
   While protecting the Medicare surplus seemed to be an unattainable goal just a few short years ago, this goal is now within our reach. In addition to funding the government for fiscal year 2000 without spending a penny out of the Social Security trust fund, CBO projections demonstrate that we now have enough revenue available to protect the $22 billion part A Medicare surplus as well. 
   It is imperative that we limit spending this year so that we do not dip into the Medicare surplus in FY 2001. 
   Both Medicare and Social Security are funded out of payroll taxes specifically delineated for their respective purposes, and are supposed to be reserved for those purposes. If there are surpluses in these accounts, if these accounts take in more money than is necessary for their stated purposes in a specific year, then that money should not suddenly be available for general government spending. 
   Any and all surpluses in those two accounts should be reserved for their stated purposes, or be used to help shore up those accounts. This legislation promotes honest accounting, and requires the government to use funds for their advertised purposes. 
   In addition to protecting these essential funds, the Medicare lockbox rule will send the powerful message that protecting Medicare and Social Security is our highest priority. 
   Social Security is scheduled to go bankrupt by 2037. Medicare is projected to become insolvent even sooner, in 2023. We have made real progress on these two fronts since the beginning of the Republican Congress. Social Security's projected insolvency has been extended from 2029 to 2037, while Medicare's bankruptcy has been pushed back by a greater amount, from 2002 to 2023. Despite this progress, we still have more work to do. 
   Lockboxing Social Security and Medicare surpluses is an essential first step in securing the long term financial solvency of Medicare and Social Security. 
   It is vitally important that we ensure that the government not spend monies dedicated for the trust funds that sustain these essential programs. 
   The Medicare lockbox rule will change the way business is done in Washington. We should pass the Medicare lockbox rule, so that protecting Social Security and Medicare will be part of the rules of the Senate. Passing this rule will be the next step on our journey to secure the long term solvency of Social Security and Medicare.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the budget resolution before us is a responsible framework for spending. I believe sincerely that Senator DOMENICI has done a superb job in creating this budget. He deserves our praise. His budget will fully protect Social Security over 5 years while balancing the important goals of debt reduction, tax relief, and prudent spending levels. 
   One of the important goals allowed by this budget resolution is the reduction of the marriage penalty. I rise in favor of the Hutchison-Ashcroft-Brownback amendment calling for marriage penalty relief. 
   I am happy to report that the relief called for in this amendment should be arriving very shortly. Just today, the Finance Committee filed a plan to increase the marriage penalty relief passed by the House. Some people have referred to this as a tax cut for married individuals. Frankly, I like the way Senator HUTCHISON labels this particular measure. She calls it a tax correction. 
   This is an effort which is designed to take some of the penalty out of being married. The Finance Committee plan, which the budget resolution anticipates, makes the income brackets for couples in the 15-percent and 28-percent tax brackets double that of single filers. It increases the standard deduction and alleviates marriage penalties in the EITC, the earned-income tax credit, and the AMT, the alternative minimum tax. This plan, passed by the committee, improves upon the initial finance bill which, in turn, improves upon the bill passed by the House. 
   As a result of these improvements, more people will receive more needed relief from the marriage tax penalty. We need this relief because our Tax Code discriminates against the fundamental societal value of marriage. 
   I would like to pause for a moment to say how important it is for us to have, as policy in this country, an approach to institutions that are crucial to our success and survival which is nondiscriminatory and not hostile. I cannot think of any institution that means more to the future of the United States of America than the institution of the family. There is very little that could possibly mean more to a family than the potential of having marriages. 
   When we find ourselves in a setting where the Tax Code of the United States penalizes persons for tying the knot, for becoming committed in the durable, lasting relationship of marriage, we find ourselves in a very sorry state. 
   We need to provide relief. We need to correct this terrible mistake in our Tax Code which discriminates against the fundamental societal value of marriage. The Tax Code simply must stop penalizing Americans just because they make the right decision and they choose to get married. 
   Incidentally, this isn't only a penalty on young people. Frequently, this penalty hits older Americans as well. In my home State of Missouri, there are 573,000 couples affected by the marriage penalty in the Tax Code. 
   This bill is a raise in pay for the 25 million hard-working families nationwide who have been paying a penalty because they have been married. It is time for us to signal to that population that no longer will we take it out on you. Because you have had the honor and the integrity and the foresight and the commitment to 
   each other, and the good will to foster a family, no longer will we penalize you taxwise. In my own State, it will put more money in the household budgets of those half million or so married couples. 
   We hope to pass this needed tax relief by tax day when millions of Americans feel the tax burden most acutely. 
   I predict that the President, when he gets this bill, will not veto it. I predict that he will, instead, recognize the need to help keep hard-working moms and dads in a position to provide for their children and not to discriminate against them merely because they are married. 
   When the time comes, I believe the President will choose to liberate American families from paying an outrageous $29 billion per year fine for being married, for having that durable lasting commitment in our culture. 
   I look forward to a future in America where men in this country will no longer have to visit an accountant before they ask the woman's father for the daughter's hand in marriage. 
   I think it is time for us to say we do not want the Government standing between individuals who might otherwise be married and charging a toll that does not just last like the few days of a marriage license but becomes a recurrent toll that, on average, in this country constitutes about $100 a month for married couples who suffer this penalty. 
   I rise to support this amendment. It is an amendment that should harmonize the Tax Code of the United States with the culture of this country and with the values of this country. 
   It is outrageous, to say the least, that when couples want to get married they have to pay the equivalent of a tax fine or a tax penalty in order to get married. 
   We need to have families with durable, lasting relationships. Families are the best department of social services, they are the best department of education, they are the best department of health and assistance that we could ever expect in a culture. They are the core of what our civilization is all about. For us to charge extra to individuals who form these families is simply wrong. 
   This is a measure which brings common sense to the Tax Code, as strange as that may be. We need more common sense in the Tax Code. We need less of the pernicious discrimination against wholesome, healthy institutions such as marriage. 
   It is with that in mind that we should work to mitigate the damage imposed on America by the marriage penalty in the tax law. As a result, we have offered this amendment and look forward to its adoption by the Senate, and eventually to its signing by the President of the United States, liberating individuals who deserve to have the resources they earned to support their families left in their hands and not confiscated as a result merely of their marriage by the Federal Government to spend in its programs. 
   That will be a happy day not only for the married people who will be released from this kind of penalty, but it will be a happy day for this culture because it will signal that, indeed, we favor an institution that means so much to us: long, durable, lasting relationships, through the commitment of marriage, which provides the basis for our best families. It is with that in mind we have sponsored this amendment. I look forward to its adoption. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader's comments and candor on this issue. 
   Last year I introduced S. 758, the Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act in response to two Supreme Court rulings urging Congress to act on national legislation that would fairly and efficiently compensate victims of asbestos. As U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Souter wrote for the court in Ortiz versus Fibreboard: ``The elephantine mass of asbestos cases ..... defies customary judicial administration and calls for national legislation ..... to date Congress has not responded.'' 
   It was my hope that this bill could serve to bring all parties together to  solve this issue. It is now clear, however, that this bill will not move in its current form. As I mentioned to the majority leader, the consensus regarding S. 758 between industry, the plaintiffs, and other concerned parties, and among industry itself, appears to have deteriorated substantially since S. 758 was introduced. 
   It is also clear that there is virtually no time in the Senate to consider this bill this year. The Senate has a target adjournment date of October 6 this year. Before adjourning, the Senate will work to repeal the Social Security earnings limit, repeal the marriage tax penalty, pass agriculture sanctions reform to open markets for American farmers and ranchers, timely pass the budget and 13 separate appropriations bills, reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, give final approval to legislation to combat the methamphetamine crisis, and adopt legislation to protect Social Security. These issues will take up my time this year. And these issues are just a partial list of the ambitious agenda for the year. 
   In light of this situation, and the fact that the House appears to be taking a different approach entirely, I appreciate the majority leader's candid assessment of the legislative prospects for this bill. Because it serves no purpose to represent that S. 758 will pass or be acted upon this year or in the future, I appreciate the remarks of the majority leader.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the proposed amendment to the United States Constitution to permit Congress to prevent the desecration of our greatest national symbol: the American flag. I want to thank Chairman HATCH for his leadership on this important issue. Last year, Senator HATCH, on behalf of myself and many others, introduced S.J. Res. 14, a constitutional amendment to authorize Congress to protect the flag through appropriate legislation. Since 1998, the Judiciary Committee has held four hearings on this issue. I am pleased that this resolution now has 58 Senate sponsors. In addition, the House of Representatives has already passed an identical resolution, H.J. Res. 33, on June 24, 1999, by a vote of 305 to 124. 
   Throughout our history, the flag has held a special place in the hearts and minds of Americans. Even as the appearance of the flag has changed with the addition of new stars to reflect our  growing nation, its meaning to the American people has remained constant. The American flag symbolizes an ideal for Americans, and or all those who honor the great American experiment. It represents freedom, sacrifice, and unity. It is a symbol of patriotism, of loved ones lost, and of the American way of life. The flag stands in this Chamber, in our court rooms, and in front of our houses; it is draped over our honored dead; and it flies at half-mast to mourn our heroes. It is the subject of our national anthem, our national march and our Pledge of Allegiance. In short, the flag embodies America itself. I believe that our nation's symbol is a unique and important part of our heritage and culture, a symbol worthy of respect and protection. 
   This is not a new perspective. The American flag has enjoyed a long history of protection from desecration. Chief Justice Harlan, upholding a 1903 Nebraska statute proscribing use of the Flag in advertisements states,  
   [To] every true American the Flag is a symbol of the nation's power--the emblem of freedom in its truest, best sense. It is not extravagant to say that to all lovers of the country it signifies government resting on the consent of the governed; liberty regulated by law; the protection of the weak against the strong; security against the exercise of arbitrary power; and absolute safety for free institutions against foreign aggression. Halter v. Nebraska, 205 U.S. 34, 41 (1907).  
   It is for these reasons that Americans overwhelmingly support preserving and protecting the American flag. During a hearing I chaired in March 1998, entitled ``The Tradition and Importance of Protecting the United States 
   Flag,'' the witnesses noted that an unprecedented 80 percent of the American people supported a constitutional amendment to protect the flag. Recent polls show that support unchanged. In addition, the people's elected representatives reflected that vast public support by enacting flag protection statutes at both the State and Federal levels. In fact, 49 State legislatures have passed resolutions asking Congress to send a constitutional amendment to the States for ratification. 
   Regrettably, the Supreme Court has chosen instead to impose the academic and elitist values of Washington, DC, on the people, instead of permitting and upholding the values that people attempted to demand of their government. In 1989, the Supreme Court ignored almost a century of history and thwarted the people's will in the case of Texas v. Johnson by holding that the American flag is just another piece of cloth for which no minimum of respect may be demanded. 
   In response, the Congress swiftly attempted to protect the flag by means of a statue, the Flag Protection Act of 1989, only to have that statute also struck down by the Supreme Court in United States v. Eichman. In 1989, 1990 and 1995 the Senate voted on proposed constitutional amendments to allow protection of the flag--and each time the proposal gained a majority of votes, but not the necessary two-thirds super-majority needed to send the amendment to the States for ratification. And so we are here today to try again. 
   Critics of this measure urge that it will somehow weaken the rights protected by the first amendment. I would draw their attention to the long standing interpretation of the first amendment prior to Texas v. Johnson. At the time of the Supreme Court's decision, the tradition of protecting the flag was too firmly established to suggest that such laws are inconsistent with our constitutional traditions. Many of the state laws were based on the Uniform Flag Act of 1917. No one at that time, or for 70 years afterwards, felt that these laws ran afoul of the first amendment. Indeed, the Supreme Court itself upheld a Nebraska statute preventing commercial use of the flag in 1907 in Halter v. Nebraska. As Chief Justice Rhenquist noted in his dissent in Texas v. Johnson, ``I cannot agree that the First Amendment invalidates the Act of Congress, and the laws of 48 of the 50 States which make criminal the public burning of the flag.'' 
   Mr. President, I also reject the notion that amending the Constitution to overrule the Supreme court's decisions in the specific context of desecration of the flag will somehow undermine the first amendment as it is applied in other contexts. This amendment does not create a slippery slope which will lead to the erosion of Americans' right to free speech. The flag is wholly unique. It has no rightful comparison. An amendment protecting the flag from desecration will provide no aid or comfort in any future campaigns to restrict speech. 
   Moreover, an amendment banning the desecration of the flag does not limit the content of any true speech. As Justice Stevens noted in his dissent in Texas v. Johnson, ``[t]he concept of `desecration' does not turn on the substance of the message the actor intends to convey, but rather on whether those who view the act will take serious offense.'' Likewise, the act of desecrating the flag does not have any content in and of itself. The act takes meaning and expresses conduct only in the context of the true speech which accompanies the act. And that speech remains unregulated. As the Chief Justice noted, ``flag burning is the equivalent of an inarticulate grunt or roar that, it seems fair to say, is most likely to be indulged in not to express any particular idea, but to antagonize others.'' 
   But what if we fail to act? What is the legacy we are leaving our children? At a time when our nation's virtues are too rarely extolled by our national leaders, and national pride is dismissed by many as arrogance, America needs, more than ever, something to celebrate. At a time when too many Americans have lost respect because of disrespectful actions of elected leaders, we need a national symbol that is beyond reproach. At a time when Hollywood, which once inspired Americans with Capra-esque tales of heroism, integrity, and national pride, now bestows its highest honors on works that glorify the dysfunctional, the miserable, the materialistic, and the amoral. America needs its flag untainted, representing more than some flawed agenda, but this extraordinary nation. The flag, and the freedom for which it stands, has a unique ability to unite us as Americans. 
   In sum, there is no principal or fear that should stand as an obstacle to our protection of the flag. The American people are seeking a renewed sense of purpose and patriotism. They want to protect the uniquely American symbol of sacrifice, honor and freedom. The genius of our democracy is not that the values of Washington would be imposed on the people, but that the values of the people would be imposed on Washington. I urge my colleagues to join me in letting the values of the American people affect the work we do here. It is my earnest hope that by amending the Constitution to prohibit its desecration, this body will protect the heritage, sacrifice, ideals, freedom, and honor that the flag uniquely represents.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, first, I commend the bipartisan efforts of the Agriculture Committee. In S..2251 the committee has produced a bill which will deliver much needed expansion and improvement of the federal crop insurance program. Additionally, I appreciate Senators ROBERTS and KERREY for accepting a proposal I put forward that will establish a commission to examine reform issues over the long term. 
   Missouri farmers are hurting. Prices for cotton, soybeans, corn, rice, and almost all commodities dropped so low last year that University of Missouri economists predicted grain farmers could face prices almost as low as those seen in 1986. The Senate responded to the crisis strongly by supporting a disaster assistance package worth about $9 billion in 1999. The Senate now has the opportunity to assist farmers by helping them protect their losses that are due to bad weather and market fluctuations. Our farmers need more affordable crop insurance, to obtain higher levels of coverage and revenue protection. 
   Missourians, like farmers in many other sates, are diversifying their agricultural production and increasingly focusing on specialty crops. S..2251 also provides a realistic basis for expanding and improving insurance for specialty crops. 
   As good as this bill is, I offered, and Senators ROBERTS and KERREY graciously accepted, a provision that would establish a commission to review the effect of the changes made in traditional crop insurance and the addition of a pilot project for alternative risk programs. The Federal Crop Insurance Improvement Commission will report to Congress in 2 years with its findings. The Commission strengthens the public-private partnership that farmers rely on to deliver crop insurance by bringing together Government officials, economists, farm interests, and insurers to review various proposals. As we review farm policies down the road, I want to have the input of those that are actually out there ``in the field.'' 
   Again I thank my Senate colleagues from Kansas and Nebraska for bringing this important issue to the Senate floor. I want farm families to be able to encourage their children to continue the traditions of family farming and agri-business. The crop insurance reform detailed in S..2251 puts us one step closer to that goal.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, 
   today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until the Senate recesses for the weekly party conference lunches from 12:30 to 2:15 p.m. When the Senate reconvenes, it will begin consideration of H.R. 5, the Social Security earnings legislation. Under a previous agreement, there will be approximately 4 hours of debate with three amendments in order to the bill. Any necessary votes on those amendments will occur this afternoon with a vote on final passage to occur on Wednesday morning. For the remainder of the week, the Senate may begin consideration of the crop insurance legislation or any other legislative or Executive Calendar items available for action. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, as has been noted, we will be dealing today with the repeal of the Social Security earnings limit. I think individuals on both sides of the aisle are eager to deal with this kind of legislation. 
   What is the earnings limit? The earnings limit is simply a way of saying that if citizens between 65 and 69 years of age earn over a modest amount of money when they earn outside income by working, the Government deducts from their Social Security $1 for every $3 they earn; that is, for $1 over $17,000, the Government reduces the benefits $1 for every $3 of earnings. 
   This makes it very difficult for a number of people who are between 65 and 70 years of age, who want to be able to sustain themselves, who want to be able to help their families, who want to be able to remain independent and not dependent on Government. Yet Government has this rather onerous discriminatory effect on their work habits. It says if you earn money, we are going to take money away from what you have previously earned as a Social Security benefit. 
   The earnings test is a misguided and outdated relic of a time when jobs were scarce, unemployment was high, when people did not live as long and healthy lives as they do today. It is clearly a disincentive for seniors to work. By telling seniors if they work hard and earn money, we will just take it away from them or we will deduct it from their Social Security, we are saying: Seniors need not apply; seniors need not aspire to a better life; seniors need not expect to remain independent--all of which are the wrong statements for us to be making to our seniors. 
   There are a great number of seniors who are working anyhow and paying a penalty for working. It seems strange that in a country that needs workers, we are asking people to pay a high penalty for working: 1.2 million working seniors are penalized now; 17,523 working seniors in Missouri suffer losses in their Social Security as a result of their industry, their willingness to work. But the actual number of seniors affected by this pernicious idea of discriminating against seniors in the workplace is much greater than this 1.2 million nationwide or 17,523 in the State of Missouri. There are millions of seniors who choose not to work or choose to work only a small amount because they don't want to work in such a way that it will erode, undercut, undermine, or diminish their Social Security income. 
   Keeping seniors out of our workforce has a serious consequence. It is against our best interest to remove the kinds of things seniors bring to the workforce. They are great workers. They are skilled workers. They are workers of value and experience. The current unemployment rate of 4 percent indicates to us that we need skilled and experienced workers. Seniors are highly valuable members of the workforce. Their continuing contributions are crucial. The only limit to what they have to offer is the earnings limit. We should not limit what good people can offer to this country. 
   I have spent quite a bit of time in my home State of Missouri talking with constituents. There are real life examples. Beverly Paxton from Belton, MO, who represents the Green Thumb organization, says hundreds of seniors would be eager to work without the earnings test. Furthermore, some don't try to work for fear that the Social Security Administration might take benefits away. Seniors don't want to have to visit a CPA to find out whether if they go to work they will lose benefits or be taxed at such a high rate that working will actually end up costing them money. 
   Many more limit their hours to avoid the Social Security earnings test and its application which would result in the deduction of Social Security benefits. A manufacturer from Belton, MO, said to me: Seniors work until they reach the income limit. 
   Then they tell the employer: I won't be here next week; I will see you next January. 
   Well, what does this do to our situation where we want people to be able to work with continuity and our manufacturers and our enterprises to be able to provide service with continuity? 
   Here we have an employer who is left in the lurch, having to absorb training costs or heavy overtime costs because we have said to seniors: You cannot work on a regular basis if that regular basis carries you over the income limit. These decisions of people working for quite a bit of time and then precipitously dropping off or being underemployed by not working very much throughout the entire year are based on the arbitrary earnings test limit of the Social Security Administration which says if you pass a certain limit, we will start deducting from your Social Security check. Even when seniors work around the test, they suffer unexpected costs. 
   C.D. Clark from Florissant, MO, had earned $25,000 before trying to limit earnings to protect himself from the test. He had planned to work only 8 months so his Social Security benefits would not be cut; he would get himself down under the limit. The Social Security Administration, however, assumed he would earn the same amount, the $25,000 he had earned previously, and withheld his Social Security checks from January through March of this year. When Mr. Clark complained to the Social Security Administration that he had not reached the income limit of $17,000, he was told: We like to get our money up front--as if Social Security was their money, as if it were not a benefit for which Mr. Clark had paid years and years of taxes. 
   Not only do we find people harmed financially, but seniors express to me over and over again that their physical and mental well-being is pinned upon their ability to keep working. In St. Joseph, MO, working is a mental health issue. Seniors who don't work often lose their sense of self-worth. This point was not only made to me in my visit to St. Joseph but across the State. In Joplin, for example, I was given the same information. 
   To the extent that the earnings test keeps as many as 200,000 Missouri seniors from working, it harms the mental well-being of those 200,000 Missouri seniors who would like to be active. Over and over again, this was a refrain I heard from seniors: We want to work; we want to be active; we need to be. 
   The earnings test can threaten lives in other ways as well. Lois Murphy of St. Louis is 65 and works part-time as a registered nurse in the operating room at St. John's Mercy Medical Center. The hospital suffers from a labor shortage and needs help from women like Mrs. Murphy who are experienced, willing, and dedicated to work. She limits her hours because of the earnings limit. This takes a skilled, experienced, and needed worker out of the hospital, out of the capacity of caring for other individuals. 
   Mrs. Murphy wrote to me:  
   The $17,000 limit a person could earn plus the small Social Security check is not enough to live comfortably and enjoy your senior years.  
   Mrs. Murphy neatly summarized this issue in one simple sentence:  
   I think if a senior citizen at age 65 is willing to work, they should be able to earn a lot more or not have a limit.  
   Well, I believe Mrs. Murphy is right. Seniors should have the freedom to earn if they choose. The problem is that they don't have that choice. We must send the earnings test into retirement. We should retire the earnings test, not force the retirement of our senior citizens. 
   One of the business owners and operators I talked to put it this way: Seniors are able to work pretty aggressively through most of the year until they get up to the brink of the Christmas season when they really are needed. Then when they are intensely needed, the test kicks in and they have to check out. 
   Many seniors who want to work don't work because of the costs imposed by the earnings test. Take, for example, a senior in the 28-percent tax bracket. The earnings test kicks in. One out of every $3 is taken away from Social Security. That turns out to be another tax of roughly 33 percent. 
   Then if you add the 7.65-percent Social Security tax on the people, and a State income tax of, say, 6 percent, you get up to a 74- to 80-percent combined tax load on a working senior citizen. If they have any expenses of going to and from work, or wardrobe expenses associated with work, it could well be that the senior citizen actually loses money. The Government is so aggressive in reducing their ability to earn. The earnings test is pernicious and discriminatory toward seniors.  
   This is something we ought to address. I am delighted that the House has done so and that the President has signaled his agreement with what the House has done. I have been working on this since I came to the Senate in 1995. I voted to substantially increase the limit in 1997. I called for the elimination of the test and cosponsored legislation that would get rid of the test. 
   This year, I have introduced legislation that would eliminate the test. My bipartisan legislation has 43 cosponsors, including the entire majority leadership. There are a number of others, organizations and all, who have endorsed this concept, including Green Thumb, 60+, the Seniors Coalition, National Association of Home Builders, National Taxpayers Union, the U.S. Air Force Sergeants Association, Americans for Tax Reform, CapitolWatch, National Tax Limitation Committee, United Seniors Association, United Seniors Health Cooperative, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
   The point is, the House of Representatives recognized the value of this concept and unanimously voted to eliminate the earnings limit. The President has indicated he would sign clean legislation, unencumbered by extraneous amendments. I believe we should follow the lead of the House and do what the President is asking us to do--to deliver this measure which would eliminate the earnings test. It is something I have been working on now for years. It is a counterproductive, unfair penalty. I believe that, because the President is prepared to sign it, the Senate now needs to move forward and eliminate this out-of-date and costly impediment, this discrimination, this very serious problem for our seniors, which prohibits our culture from having the benefit and value of the best effort of many of our very best workers. 
   With that in mind, I look forward to the debate later today. I am pleased to have had this opportunity to address this issue. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, this morning I spoke in morning business on the repeal of the Social Security Earnings Limit, an onerous tax burden on seniors who want to continue working. This afternoon, while we are discussing the bill, I would like to re-emphasize my support for repealing this unfair test. 
   Earnings test is a misguided and outdated relic of the Great Depression--when jobs were scarce, unemployment high, and people did not live as long and healthy lives as they do today. 
   By limiting the amount a person 65-69 can earn, it provides a disincentive for seniors to work. For every dollar a senior aged 65-69 earns over $17,000, the government reduces benefits by $1 for each $3 of earnings. 
   This test penalizes 1.2 million working seniors nationwide, and 17,523 working seniors in Missouri suffer. The actual number of seniors affected is far greater, though, as millions of seniors choose not to work, or limit their earnings because of the penalty. 
   The effect of this test is to keep seniors out of the workforce, and it has serious consequences. More workers create more jobs, not fewer jobs. With our current unemployment rate of 4 percent--we need skilled and experienced workers. 
   Unfortunately, the earnings limit keeps too many qualified, experienced seniors out of the workforce. Seniors have the skills, integrity, work ethic, and experience that make them highly valuable members of the workforce. Their continuing contributions are crucial. The only limit to what they have to offer is the earnings limit. 
   Recently, I spent some time with constituents in Missouri, and found many seniors in my home State of Missouri are harmed by the earnings test. Beverly Paxton from Belton, who works with ``Green Thumb'' to find jobs for seniors, told me that hundreds of seniors would be eager to work without the earnings test. Furthermore,  some don't try to work for fear that the Social Security Administration might take their benefits away. Seniors don't want to visit a CPA to find out if they will lose benefits. 
   In addition, many more seniors limit their hours to avoid the test. A manufacturer in Belton told me that some seniors work until they reach eligibility, then tell the employer: ``I won't be here next week, I'll see you next January.'' This leaves employers in the lurch, having to absorb training costs or heavy overtime costs. These decisions based on the earnings test impose productivity costs on the economy. 
   Even when seniors work around the test, they suffer unexpected costs. C.D. Clark, from Florissant, Missouri, and who has since moved to Kentucky, had earned $25,000 before trying to limit earnings to protect himself from the test. This year, he planned to only work 8 months so that his Social Security benefits would not be cut. 
   The Social Security Administration, however, assumed he would earn the same amount, and withheld his Social Security checks from January through March of this year. When Mr. Clark complained to the SSA that he had not yet earned $17,000, he was told, ``We like to get our money up front.'' 
   I recently received a letter from Lois Murphy of St. Louis, who is 65, and works part time as an RN in the operating room at St. John's Mercy Medical Center. The hospital suffers from a labor shortage, and needs help from women like Mrs. Murphy, who are experienced and willing to work. But she limits her hours because of the earnings limit, taking a skilled, experienced--and needed--worker out of the hospital. 
   In her letter, Mrs. Murphy wrote: ``The $17,000 limit a person could earn plus the small Social Security check is not enough to live comfortably and enjoy your senior years.'' Mrs. Murphy neatly summarized this issue in one simple sentence: ``I think if a senior citizen at age 65 is willing to work, they should be able to earn a lot more or not have a limit.'' I believe that Mrs. Murphy is right. Seniors should have the freedom to earn if they choose. But the problem is that they don't have that choice. We must send the earnings test into retirement. 
   I have been working on this since I came to the Senate. In 1995, I voted to substantially increase the limit. In 1997, I called for the elimination of the test and cosponsored legislation that would get rid of it. This year, I have introduced legislation that would eliminate the test. My bipartisan legislation has 43 cosponsors, including the entire majority leadership. 
   Organizations that support me on this include: Green Thumb, 60+, the Seniors Coalition, National Association of Home Builders, National Taxpayers Union, the U.S. Air Force Sergeants Association, CapitolWatch, Americans for Tax Reform, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Tax Limitation Committee, and the United Seniors Association. 
   It is time to eliminate this counterproductive and unfair penalty. The House has already acted. The President is prepared to sign this. Thanks to the hard work of Chairman ROTH, who is managing this bill, the Senate is now ready to pass the earnings test repeal as well. I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this measure, and grant seniors the opportunity to earn freely in their golden years.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to give honor to Ingvald Bernard  Jacobsen, Uncle Barney, who will be celebrating his 90th birthday on March 25th. He is the first born of Gina Brathen Fyhrie Jacobsen and Peder Jacobsen. 
   Although Mr. Jacobsen was born in Racine, Wisconsin, due to the death of his grandmother, he and his family moved to Norway. While a young boy in Norway, Ingvald learned the value system he has maintained for the past 90 years through a strong belief in the Bible by which his mother and grandfather lived. He became a Christian at his mother's knee before starting school and has been a walking example of what it is to be Christian all his life: never the preacher, always the doer of kind deeds for others, expecting nothing in return for those kind acts. 
   Mr. Jacobsen's early years were lean on material things and long on the hard work of a farm and a life on the seas helping to earn the family living. He attended school three days a week and completed his education by age 14. He was confirmed in the small Lutheran church on a Norwegian island, and still uses the New Testament he was presented with that day in 1924. 
   After returning to the United States in 1928, Mr. Jacobsen's first job was landscaping the new golf course in Forest Hills, New Jersey, where he worked with his father. When that job was completed, he moved to Chicago. Thereafter, he had many jobs that led to a position at Northwestern University lasting 25 years. 
   In 1935, Mr. Jacobsen joined a fraternal order called Sons of Norway, a group of Norwegian immigrants that got together for fellowship. This fellowship grew by leaps and bounds all around the world and has become a vehicle for keeping the old traditions of Norway alive, as well as the language. He has held every office possible in his local lodge and district and served as an international director for eight years, a great honor for him. Because of his faithfulness and hard work throughout the Norwegian community in the Midwest, King Olav V awarded him the King Olav medal in 1973. 
   Throughout his years in the Chicago area, Mr. Jacobsen gave of himself above and beyond the call of duty. At Trinity Lutheran Church, he sang in the choir, greeted people at the door with a warm welcome, and was in charge of the coffee hour and Easter breakfast for years. He picked up countless children for Sunday School and led the Boy Scout troop in the church. Every year near Christmas time, he saw to it that the residents of the Norwegian home for the elderly in Chicago had a traditional cod-fish dinner. He chose the fish, picked it up, peeled the potatoes, and than poached the fish and saw that it was served to every person. His reward came in the form of tins of fresh, Norwegian homemade cookies baked by the ladies auxiliaries of these homes. 
   Mr. Jacobsen was asked to serve on the Tall Ship committee when in 1976 the Norwegian Tall Ship Christian Radich came to Chicago to celebrate the 200-year anniversary of our country's birth. He was also a member of the select few who greeted King Olav V in Chicago in 1975, when the 150th anniversary of a sailing vessel finally made it to Chicago from Norway. He was honored by traveling the city with King Olav V, spending many days and hours in his company including a large dinner attended by dignitaries from around the world. 
   After the death of his wife, Bernie Lars, Mr. Jacobsen sold his home and built a beautiful addition to his daughter's home. Since 1997, following a successful battle with cancer, he has resided with his granddaughter, Solveig, in Illinois part of the year and with his oldest daughter, Carolyn, and her husband in the mountains of North Carolina during the remainder of the year. 
   Mr. Jacobsen will be celebrating his 90th birthday with countless friends and relatives, including five who will come from Norway. Grateful people filled with joy and happy memories of this gentle giant--he still stands tall at 6 feet 3 inches--will gather to honor and thank him. I join those many friends and relatives in wishing him a joyous and rich celebration.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and honor Silex Assembly of God in Silex, Missouri. On March 26th, they will be dedicating their new church building. This dedication and celebration is a tribute to God's faithfulness to the congregation, which began gathering together in 1942. It is also a tribute to their labor of love and personal generosity, led by Pastor and Mrs. John Pool. 
   Pastor Pool, who retired in 1985, agreed to step up to the pulpit again when the Silex church called upon him to lead them. Now, at age 81, he and the congregation have built their new church themselves, with volunteer labor and sacrificial contributions of time and money. Mrs. Pool has helped feed the volunteer groups day after day. Their devotion to Christ brings honor to the name of the Lord. 
   I join those gathered for this wonderful occasion, including the Pool's five children and most of their grandchildren, in bringing best wishes for a memorable celebration as Silex Assembly of God renews its commitment to the redemptive mission of Christ. May God bless this ministry with many more years of celebration.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, families are the cornerstone of America. Individuals from strong families contribute to society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important to honor those who have taken seriously the commitment of ``till death us do part'', demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country strong. 
   For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Ramah and Herbert Robinson of Lee's Summit, Missouri, who on April 9, 2000, will celebrate their 70th wedding anniversary. Many things have changed in the 70 years this couple has been married, but the values, principles, and commitment this marriage demonstrates are timeless. As the Robinsons celebrate their 70th year together with family and friends, it will be apparent that the lasting legacy of this marriage will be the time, energy, and resources invested in their children, church, and community. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. 
   The Robinsons' commitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and recognized.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I support the objective of the Senator from California that the Senate should do all it can to implement policies ``that will reduce the threat of gun violence in schools.'' 
   I would like, however, to note that the amendment contains an erroneous factual finding. This amendment states that ``Every day in America, on average, between 12 and 13 children under the age of 18 die of gunshots from homicides, accidental shootings and suicides.'' That is incorrect. 
   According to the 1997 statistics collected by the National Center for Health Statistics there were 4,205 firearms-related deaths of persons aged 0 to 19, 85 percent of whom were between the ages of 15 and 19. Thus, the daily average stated in this amendment is young adults and children under the age of 20, not under 18 as this amendment says. 
   Of course, this number is far too high regardless of whether it is young adults and children under 18 or under 20. It is a national tragedy either way, and the Senate should do all it can to reduce that number. I just want to make the record clear, consistent with my belief that the Senate has an obligation when it makes findings of fact to be accurate.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I strongly support and urge Congress to pass and President Clinton to sign the Affordable Education Act now pending before the Senate. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation. 
   Children presently are 25 percent of our population and 100 percent of the future. It is my fundamental belief that Congress should invest in the future by improving educational opportunities for students. This bill is part of a comprehensive strategy to give parents and local schools the resources needed to make the 21st century, the era in which educational excellence for all students is achieved. 
   For the past three years, Congress has passed legislation that provides tax incentives to help parents pay for the education of their children. But President Clinton has twice vetoed legislation that provided these incentives. Parents across America hope and trust that this time these tax incentives will be enacted into law. 
   A major feature of this bill is that it creates Educational Savings Accounts for K through 12 expenses. These ESAs allow parents to contribute up to $2,000 annually to an Educational Savings Account. The build-up of earnings within the account is tax-free if used for educational expenses, such as tuition, fees, tutoring, special needs services, books, computers, etc. The premise behind ESAs is that parents should have greater control over the education of their children. After all, who is in a better position to know what each child needs--a bureaucratic Washington government or the parents and teachers who see that child every day? 
   This bill does more than just create Educational Savings Accounts. Included in this bill are other provisions that I have either supported or co-sponsored that: 
   Provide tax incentives to help pay for college tuition; 
   Provide tax exclusions for education assistance programs provided by employers; 
   Revise the tax treatment of qualified state tuition programs to exclude from gross income any distributions used for higher education expenses; 
   Allow a tax deduction of up to $2,500 per year of interest on education loans; 
   Allow a limited tax credit for the donation of computers to schools, and extends from two to three years the age of computers that may be donated to schools; and 
   Reduce the complexity of the arbitrage rules that currently govern the issuance of school bonds. 
   This bill provides more than $4.3 billion of education tax incentives for the next five years, and it gives more educational control to parents. Parents will be able to save more for the future education of their children. 
   This bill is just one part of an overall strategy to increase educational resources. Over the past five years Congress has increased overall educational spending by 40 percent, and Congress last year approved a budget that projects yet another 36 percent increase over the next four years. In the next few weeks Congress will take up legislation to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I will be offering amendments to that bill that will: 
   Channel federal aid in failing school districts to teaching the academic basics in order to raise student achievement levels; 
   Provide funds for failing school districts to use in attracting and retaining highly qualified teachers; and 
   Double the amount of federal aid for college costs for high achieving students in failing school districts. 
   For now, however, Congress should take the first step in expressing its commitment to improving education by passing the pending Affordable Education Act. I urge Senators to support this legislation.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to address a serious and specific crisis that has occurred in my home state of Missouri. 
   In October of 1999, the Missouri State Board of Education canceled accreditation for Kansas City's schools, effective May 1, 2000, and gave St. Louis a court-required probationary period in lieu of accreditation withdrawal. Today, 80,000 young people are trapped in these failing urban school districts. It is hard for students to be successful in these types of settings. Both of these school districts receive substantial financial resources from the federal government, yet we are not seeing positive results on our investment. It is time for taxpayers to have accountability so that they know their tax dollars are spent in classrooms to boost academic achievement. 
   This is especially true since Congress is continuing to increase its financial commitment to education. Federal education funding has increased by 40% since 1994. And most recently, last year Congress approved a budget that proposes to increase federal resources for education by an additional 40% over the next five years. The final budget bill passed by Congress for FY2000--and that I supported--pays the first installment by increasing these resources by 6%, or $2 billion, $35 billion for Fiscal Year 2000. 
   In light of this increase in federal education resources, I want to encourage better, smarter use of federal funds where the need is greatest--in failing schools--so that the children languishing in these schools will have a real opportunity to achieve academic excellence and create a brighter future for themselves. 
   Therefore, today I am introducing the Excellent Schools for All Our Children Act, a three-part program to help students trapped in failing urban schools in St. Louis, Kansas City, and other U.S. cities. This bill was developed in response to my state's challenge to the accreditation of Missouri's two largest school districts. 
   This new legislation would channel federal aid in failing schools to teaching the academic basics, in order to raise student achievement levels; would provide funds for failing schools to use in recruiting, retaining, and rewarding highly qualified teachers; and would double the amount of federal aid for college costs for high-achieving students in failing schools. 
   While focusing on an overall plan to streamline and simplify federal education programs for all schools, my plan incorporates a two-tiered ``flexibility when merited and accountability when warranted'' approach to the use of federal education resources. 
   First, this legislation proposes a major reduction in paperwork and ``red tape'' for all schools, by consolidating a number of federal education programs so that funds may be sent directly to local schools. Schools will be free to use the funds in ways they believe will be most effective in elevating student achievement. The programs included in this consolidation are: Goals 2000, School-to-Work, Class Size Reduction (the ``100,000 Teachers'' funding); Title III, Technology for Education; Comprehensive School Reform under Title I; Title VI block grant; Immigrant Education under Title VII C; the Fund for Improvement of Education under Title X, Part A; and the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. This provision is modeled after the Bond-Ashcroft ``Direct Check for Education'' legislation introduced in 1999. 
   For school districts that fail to meet their state's performance-based accreditation standards and, are thus failing their students, these ``direct check'' funds may be spent only for purposes relating directly to improving academic performance. This will include focusing on ``the basics;'' funding mentoring programs to help students who can't read, write or do arithmetic; and using proven methods of instruction, such as phonics. These federal funds can also be used to recruit, retain, and reward high quality teachers. Districts in trouble need help in finding and keeping the very best teachers, and my legislation provides resources for this purpose. 
   These school districts will be asked to report on how they have spent their federal resources and on their students' academic performance using state and local measurements. Parents and others in the community need to see how their federal tax dollars have been spent on educating their children. 
   When these school districts attain state accreditation for two consecutive years, they will gain the authority to use federal resources under new standards for expanded local control created by this legislation for non-failing schools. These school districts regaining accreditation will also have access to $10 million annually in new federal funding to reward teachers and principals for improved student performance, and for professional development opportunities. 
   Finally, the Excellent Schools for All Our Children Act encourages students in failing school districts to be high achievers. As an incentive to their studies, I am proposing special college aid awards that would at a minimum  double the amount of federal aid now available for students' college costs. Students who rank in the top ten percent of their high school class and have an ACT or SAT score that is at or above the national average would be eligible for these ``Good Student Scholarships,'' which would be equal to the maximum appropriated Pell Grant award, presently $3,300 per year. Thus, a high-achieving student eligible for a Pell Grant of $1,500 would also receive a Good Student Scholarship of $3,300, for a total federal aid package of $4,800. 
   Mr. President, as a parent and public servant, I want to help thousands of young Missourians who are trapped in failing urban schools. It is clear to me that federal resources should be doing more to benefit these children. My plan to target resources to fund programs that will encourage and elevate student achievement will provide our students in failing school districts with the opportunity to succeed. We cannot risk losing an entire generation to the snares of education mediocrity. The federal government can--and should--be a critical partner in providing education funding in a manner that will help all our school children attain academic excellence. 
   I ask for unanimous consent that the bill be printed in its entirety at the conclusion of my remarks.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I recognize and congratulate Mr. and Mrs. David Herbst, on receiving the National Young Farmer Award from the American Farm Bureau Federation. From their farm near Chaffee, Missouri, David and Leslie Herbst have set an example to our nation's agricultural industry about productive farming, land management, and environmental conservation. 
   The National Young Farmer Award is the highest award given for outstanding achievements, and it is given only to one farmer each year. David and Leslie Herbst were selected from a field of nominees submitted by state Farm Bureaus across the nation. It is an honor for Missouri to have such prominent examples of excellence in farming. 
   This prestigious award, presented to David and Leslie, is accompanied by some impressive prizes, including a 2000 Dodge Ram 4x4 truck and an Arctic Cat all terrain vehicle. They also won registration to conferences that will give them an opportunity to share their successes and perspectives on farming with other young farmers and ranchers. 
   David and Leslie are continuing the tradition of family farming in southeast Missouri. They are the fourth generation of Herbsts to farm in the region, and they have been particularly successful with a unique approach to environmental protection that will preserve their land and keep it fertile for future generations. 
   When I look to Missouri, I do not see a state defined only by its geography--spanning from the Missouri River to the Mississippi River. Nor do I simply define Missouri by its economic diversity--a state leading in farming and industry. I see the definition of Missouri as a place where Missourians, like the Herbsts, can work together to give the next generation more opportunity than we have today. It is a state of ascending opportunity. 
   Because of David and Leslie's careful stewardship of their land, prudent planning, and perseverance through the market crises of recent years, they will be able to advise the next generation of Missourians to continue the traditions of family farming and agri-business. The Herbsts can truly say ``the best is yet to come.'' 
   It is my honor to wish David and Leslie continued success in agriculture. They have set an inspiring example for farmers across the nation, and indeed in Missouri.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today in favor of repealing the Social Security earnings test, the onerous tax burden the United States government places on seniors who wish to continue working. In order to ease this unfair burden, I am hereby introducing the Social Security Earnings Test Elimination Act of 2000. 
   The earnings test limits the amount a person older than 65 and younger than 70 can earn without having his or her Social Security benefits reduced. Currently, benefits are reduced by $1 for each $3 of earnings over $17,000. This test provides a disincentive for seniors to work by reducing seniors' Social Security benefits according to the amount of income they earn. 
   It is time to repeal that limit. Right now, Social Security is scheduled to go bankrupt in 2034. One of the reasons for the looming bankruptcy of Social Security is the declining ratio of workers  to beneficiaries, which worsens as our elderly population continues to grow much faster than the number of workers entering the workforce. In 1960 the ratio was 5:1, today it is a little more than 3:1, and in thirty years it is expected to be only 2:1. This decreasing number of workers paying for retirees benefits is making it increasingly difficult to make the Social Security books balance. 
   Instead of helping to fix this problem, the earnings test exacerbates this situation. By providing a disincentive to work, the earnings test keeps seniors at home instead of at work and paying the payroll taxes that keep the Social Security system solvent. 
   The earnings test is based on a misconception of the U.S. economy. The Social Security Earnings Test is a relic of the Great Depression, designed to move older people out of the workforce and create employment for younger individuals. The idea behind the earnings test is that if seniors were penalized for working, they would stay home and open up employment opportunities for younger workers. Not only was this view wrong in earlier times, but it is counterproductive in today's economy. Today, we do not have a labor surplus, but a labor shortage. Unemployment is at a long-time low of 4.0%, one-and-a-half points lower than the so-called ``full employment'' mark of 5.5%. 
   Low unemployment is a great development, but it contributes to a labor shortage that will worsen when the ``baby boom'' generation ages. Employers will have to develop new sources of labor to fill this shortage, and seniors represent the most experienced, most skilled workers. Many senior citizens can make a significant contribution, and often their knowledge and experience complements or exceeds that of younger employees. 35 million Americans are over the age of 65, and together they have over a billion years of cumulative work experience. It is both counterproductive and harmful to our growing economy to keep willing, diligent workers out of the American economy. 
   In addition to the negative consequences for the economy as a whole, the Social Security Earnings Test is also bad for seniors. The earnings test punishes Americans between the ages of 65 and 70 for their attempts to remain productive after retirement. This is particularly problematic for low income seniors, many who exist on fixed incomes, and are burdened with a 33.3 percent tax on their earned income. When combined with federal, state and other Social Security taxes, taxes on the elderly can total nearly 55 or 65 percent. An individual who is struggling to make ends meet should not be faced with an effective marginal tax rate which exceeds 55 percent. 
   While the earnings test harms lower-income people, it only affects seniors who must work and depend on their earned income for survival. Wealthy seniors are not affected by the earnings limit. Their supplemental, ``unearned'' sources of income are safe and not subject to the earnings threshold. At the same time, many of the older Americans penalized by the Earnings Test need to work in order to cover their basic expenses: health care, housing and food. Many seniors do not have significant savings or a private pension. For this reason, low-income workers are particularly hard-hit by the Earnings Test. 
   In addition to all of the policy reasons for elimination of the Earnings Test, the most important reason to eliminate the Test is that it is fundamentally unfair. The earnings test discriminates against seniors. Nobody, regardless of creed, color, gender, or age should be penalized for working or discouraged from engaging in work. 
   Furthermore, the Earnings Test takes money from seniors that is rightfully theirs. The Social Security benefits which working seniors are losing due to the Earnings Test penalty are benefits they have rightfully earned by contributing to the system throughout their working years before retiring. These are benefits which they should not be losing because they are trying to survive by supplementing their Social Security income. 
   Mr. President, it is time to eliminate this counterproductive and unfair penalty. With the Social Security and Medicare Trusts Funds facing long-term insolvency, it is now more important than ever to encourage work. More people working means more people paying into the Social Security Trust Fund and Medicare. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this unfair burden placed on elderly Americans.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I come to the floor today. Just a few days ago, on February 1, I came here to talk about a professional football achievement, congratulating the St. Louis Rams on their Super Bowl victory. It was a tremendous victory.  
   Today, I come to the floor on what may seem to some to be another ``football story,'' albeit one that is much more tragic. I want to make remarks about my friend, Kansas City Chiefs' linebacker Derrick Thomas. I want to talk about more than just professional sports. I believe what is important in life is not what game you play but how you play the game to which you are called. I want to share my thoughts on a young man who was a true professional. 
   Yesterday, the Kansas City Chiefs' great linebacker, Derrick Thomas, died of cardiorespiratory arrest, a complication from a tragic automobile accident of January 23. The accident occurred on a snow and ice-covered stretch of Interstate 435 in Clay County, MO, as Derrick and two of his friends were headed to the airport to fly to St. Louis for the NFC championship game between St. Louis Rams and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. To Derrick's many loyal fans, the news of his death is stunning and saddening--profoundly saddening. 
   The life of Derrick Thomas, who lived but 33 years, should be celebrated. His accomplishments on the field and off the field were substantial. An All-American at the University of Alabama, he became an instant star with the Kansas City Chiefs after his selection in the first round of the 1989 draft. He was named as an All-Pro in each of his first nine seasons in the league. Derrick ranked ninth on the all-time list in career quarterback sacks. 
   Chiefs fans will never forget the day in 1990 when No. 58 set the amazing single-game record of seven sacks in a game against the Seattle Seahawks on Veterans Day. What some people don't know is that Derrick dedicated his efforts on Veterans Day to his father, an Air Force pilot killed in Vietnam in Operation Linebacker II when Derrick was just five. 
   The fighters from nearby Whiteman Air Force Base periodically do a fly-by during pre-game ceremonies. The planes, according to Derrick Thomas, reminded him of his father and provided inspiration for some of his greatest and most spectacular performances. I have been at Arrowhead Stadium before games for those pre-game ceremonies, when in the parking lot there was tailgating, with the smoke from the barbecue and the roar from the jets as they crossed the field in a fly-by. It is a moving experience, but it moved none of us as much as it moved Derrick Thomas, who set records based on the inspiration that reminded him of his dad. 
   Derrick will, no doubt, enter the pantheon of Kansas City's great athletes--George Brett, Tom Watson, and Len Dawson, just to name a few. But Derrick's accomplishments off the field are worthy of note as well. He was that kind of special star who took all that he gained from his talents and gave back with generosity, energy, and joy to his community. Very early in his career as a Kansas City Chief, he began an inner-city reading program called the ``Third and Long Foundation.'' As part of it, he read to children at local libraries on Saturdays when he was home in Kansas City during the season. 
   He was No. 832 among President George Bush's celebrated ``Thousand Points of Light.'' He was named the NFL's Man of the Year in 1993. Two years later, he received the Byron ``Whizzer" White Humanitarian Award from the NFL Players Association for his service to the community. In addition, he received the Genuine Heroes Award from Trinity College in Chicago. 
   But more important than accolades from several foundations was the love and respect directed toward Derrick by the people of Kansas City. They understood that Derrick helped bring an invigorated sense of civic pride and community and togetherness to Kansas City, and the Chiefs fans were inspired by his sunny smile, his giving heart, and his winning ways. The arrival of Carl Peterson and Derrick Thomas to Kansas City marked the resurrection of Lamar Hunt's historic franchise. The people of Kansas City loved Derrick Thomas--as a Chief and as a person. Carl Peterson, at yesterday's news conference, clearly communicated his deep respect and profound joy in his association with Derrick. 
   Others expressed themselves eloquently as Kansas City Chiefs fans who, visiting the Web site on the Sports Illustrated chat room, left remarks about this great football player. The first remark I would like to call to your attention is from a fan who calls himself ``Frank L.'' In a frank evaluation, perhaps, he put it this way:  
   Thanks for everything, D.T. [Derrick Thomas]. You helped bring our city to life and gave us a common cause. While doing that you helped a lot of those less fortunate. Now you are with your father that you always talked about and never knew. Back here in the land of the free and the home of the Chiefs we will never forget you. God bless your soul.  
   That line back there, ``in the land of the free and the home of the Chiefs,'' is the way they sing the anthem at the stadium. They didn't want to say the ``brave,'' so they said the ``Chiefs.'' Derrick knew that and enjoyed it. 
   Listen to what a fan, called Big58, says. And, of course, we all know Derrick was No. 58. He wore that number on his jersey. A fan who identified himself as Big58 said:  
   I can't believe that Derrick is gone. He was one of my heroes for more than a decade now. Derrick did so much for the Kansas City community and the people here. It wasn't loved in KC because he was such a great athlete. He was loved in KC because of the person he was. The time and money he gave to help the kids of the Kansas City community was enormous. And who can forget his Veterans Day performances dedicated to his father who was killed in Vietnam? They were always D.T. at his best. At least D.T. will have some great company along with our Lord in Heaven. I'll bet he's chasing around Walter Payton right now. And ya know what, Derrick will finally get to spend time with his Dad. We love you and will miss you Derrick. Rest in Peace.  
   And finally, not only are Chiefs fans saddened, but others who recognized his talents as well. Listen to what Lance Reynolds had to say:  
   I have been a Raider fan for over 20 years. Derrick Thomas single handedly ruined at least a dozen Sunday afternoons for me; destroying O-tackles, tight-ends and quarterbacks of the Silver & Black. The Raiders-Chiefs rivalry runs deep. Even though, I have found myself pacing the Chiefs sidelines the past couple of weeks avidly cheering for Derrick Thomas' quick recovery. Today I find myself amongst the millions mourning his death. Derrick Thomas, you wickedly ruthless foe, God Bless You! You are already missed!  
   From time to time, we are compelled to pause and consider the real and lasting value of the things we hold dear. For Missouri football fans like me, today is a reminder that, as much as we love the game, it is just a game. 
   To those to whom we look for examples, we extend our thanks, and we give our thanks to Derrick, for he was one who excelled not just on the field but inspired us by an example and called us to our highest and best. 
   Friends such as Derrick Thomas are a rare and special gift to each of us. We will miss him. Our prayers are with his family his friends and each other as we, his fans, across the Nation and certainly across Missouri and Kansas City are saddened by this very substantial loss. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am delighted to have the opportunity to commend the House for beginning to move through its process, specifically the House Ways and Means Committee, the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act of the year 2000. 
   I am delighted that my colleagues in the Senate, including Senator BROWNBACK of Kansas and Senator HUTCHISON of Texas, have been so aggressive in talking about what this tax means to America. 
   Almost all of us realize that if you tax something, you get less of it, and if you give something a subsidy, you get more of it. It occurs to me that we do not need less marriage, less family, and fewer intact households in America. We need strong, durable, lasting families  that reflect the kind of commitments for which marriage really stands. 
   It is possible for people to be committed to each other without the formal institution of marriage, but the data indicates that possibility does not find its way into reality very often. Marriage is not something that is against the interests of America. Marriage is something that is advancing the interests of America because it is in our homes and in our durable, lasting, persistent relationships, loving relationships, that we teach the fundamental values so important to this culture--values of responsibility, values of work and, yes, values of caring. We learn that we have responsibility and duty to each other. If someone in our family is in trouble, our first turn is not outside the family to get help; we first turn toward each other to help. One of the greatest values any culture can have is learning how to care one for another, and it happens in our families. 
   I plan to talk for a few minutes today about a real problem we have in this country, and that is that our Tax Code is at war with some of the fundamental values and attributes and characteristics in our culture. I think it is wrong for our Government to be attacking the very institution in society which provides the best support for what we otherwise achieve governmentally. Someone far more wise than I said it first when they said the family is the best department of social services, the family is the best department of education, the family is the best department of health and welfare. One would think if the family were doing this job and doing it well and relieving Government of its backstopping responsibility in these places, we would want to encourage the family; we would want to support it; we would want to sustain it; we would want to provide incentives for it rather than a penalty. 
   That is the thing that confounds us--that we are providing a penalty. Some great industrialist once said: Your system is perfectly designed to give you what you are getting, basically saying if you are not getting what you want, you should change your system. 
   Senator BROWNBACK eloquently cited the data. We are not getting what we want. We are getting fewer marriages instead of more marriages. We are getting less durability in these relationships instead of more. Look at the reason for the family breakups we have, and almost every sociological study says at the heart of it is the financial stress in the family. 
   What is Government doing in regard to marriage and stress that financially threatens and sometimes disrupts those marriages? It is adding to the stress instead of relieving the stress. Forty-two percent of all married couples suffer a marriage penalty, meaning the Government taxes them more for being married than they would be paying if they were not married. 
   We have already heard the data, and I do not think it is 
   important to have the data, but it is there: About $1,400 per couple per year on average for the 21 million couples who suffer this $29 billion a year disadvantage imposed by Government against the very institution that should carry us into this next century. 
   When the House Ways and Means Committee marked up the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act, they were simply saying it is time for us to start peace negotiations; stop the war between Government and families; let's start having incentives for helping families. At least let us have a neutral environment so we do not have a situation where families are discriminated against by the Tax Code of the United States. 
   In my home State of Missouri, there are 1 million potential marriage tax victims because of family standing. According to the Treasury Department, 42 percent--over 4 out of every 10 married couples--pay a penalty for being married. I find that to be a tragedy. 
   According to the Tax Foundation, an American family spends more of its family budget on taxes than on health care, food, clothing, and shelter combined. When you say this is the kind of tax bite the American family is paying--it pays more for Government than health care, food, clothing, and shelter combined --Government is taking a big bite. It is taking a big bite from every citizen. Then add to that a Government penalty, a financial stigma imposed, saying we are going to tax you more because you are married than you would pay otherwise. This is wrong. It is simply that we have found a way, unfortunately, to get additional resources for Government at the expense of resources to the family. 
   In some measure, this really calls upon us to ask ourselves where our faith is for the future of America. What do we believe will sustain America in the future? Is it going to be big Government or will it be strong families? Will it be a culture that teaches responsibility, duty, compassion, and caring, one for another, or will it be a massive Government? If we really believe families are irrelevant, we should take more and more of their money and pour it into the bureaucracy. But I do not believe bureaucracies are the hope of America or of the world tomorrow. 
   Responsible citizenship, the kinds of values that are engendered in families, these are the elements of America's future. These are the bright lights that allow us to believe the best is yet to come, and we should stop eroding the funding for families by giving it all to Government. 
   If our faith is in families, we should help families. How do we help families? The first thing we do is let them keep some of the money they earn. Penalizing families is the wrong way to go about that. Unfortunately, Treasury Secretary Larry Summers announced on Tuesday that he will advise the President to oppose the House bill, less than 1 week after the President announced his support for marriage penalty tax relief. 
   The marriage penalty may actually contribute to one of society's most serious and enduring problems. There are now twice as many single-parent households in America as there were when this penalty was first enacted. I cannot say it is a cause, but it is hard to believe it is not a contributor. In our Government policies, we should not be intensifying the problems; we should be eliminating the problems and mitigate the damages they cause. 
   Our Government should uphold the basic values that give 
   strength and vitality to our communities and to our culture. Sound families do that, and the science which supports that proposition is sound and complete and uncontradicted. Marriage and family are a cornerstone of who we are and what we stand for as a civilization, but the heavy hand of Government which imposes a penalty against marriage distorts the system and lacks the fairness we want in the tax system, and, frankly, it undermines our potential for the kind of future that good families, allowed to reserve some of their resources for their own use and development, could provide. 
   It is with that in mind that I commend the House for its action, and I look forward to the day when we in the Senate can do what we almost got done last year. We did it in the Senate. We had a major tax relief for the American family through the abolition or mitigation of the marriage penalty tax, sponsored by Senator HUTCHISON of Texas, Senator BROWNBACK of Kansas, and I was privileged to be a cosponsor. It went to the President and was vetoed in the overall tax package. 
   This concept the President has endorsed, which I think America understands, to bring parity to families so they are not discriminated against, because they are a part of the enduring, lasting, persistent, valuable relationship of marriage, is a concept whose time has come. 
   I am grateful for the action taken by the House and look forward to the opportunity of implementing, otherwise enhancing, that relief for American families in the Senate. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, across America, buildings are named for great Americans and fallen heroes so that the living might memorialize the legacy of those who have died. Petty Officer 3rd Class Matthew E. Schlimme was just such an American. He was an extraordinary hero in service to his nation and fellow man. 
   Raised on a farm in Southeast Missouri, Matthew knew the value of hard work, the necessity for respect and consideration of others, and the need to overcome obstacles. One such obstacle he had from an early age was a fear of the water. Not only did Matthew join the U.S. Coast Guard to overcome his fear, but in doing so he served his country and saved a life. 
   On February 12, 1997, Officer Schlimme and two other Coast Guardsmen were thrown overboard in 24-foot seas while attempting to rescue a sailboat. Before going overboard, Schlimme was able to buckle in Seaman Apprentice Benjamin Wingo. Mr. Wingo was the sole survivor. Officer Schlimme lost his life, but gained the thanks of a nation. 
   Mr. Schlimme's parents, Larry and Haroletta Schlimme, of Burfordville,  Missouri, were present at the January 27, 2000, dedication of the Matthew E. Schlimme Industrial Facility in St. Louis. The building will provide a production site for navigation equipment and will house the St. Louis Electronic Support Detachment. 
   Mr. and Mrs. Schlimme can be proud of their son's bravery and courage. His act of heroism has been remembered in the hearts of many Missourians. All of Missouri is deeply grateful to Officer Schlimme for his bravery and ultimate sacrifice.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes, at the conclusion of which time I will propound a unanimous consent request regarding Senate Resolution 250 related to the Super Bowl champions, the St. Louis Rams.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to make a comment on an event which is very important to the State of Missouri, very important to the city of St. Louis, very important to this Senator. 
   It happens that over the weekend, the St. Louis Rams encountered a very energetic and talented team, the Tennessee Titans, in Atlanta to settle the issue of who would be the Super Bowl NFL champions this year. In a very hard fought game that represented the highest of effort by both teams, the Rams prevailed. There are those who from time to time ask me if I was nervous at any time. I think they were hoping I would say I was never nervous. Well, I got pretty nervous toward the end of the game. But I was very pleased with the result because there is no team more worthy of having won this game than the St. Louis Rams. 
   I will just say a few things about the St. Louis Rams, about that marvelous effort of a crew we call the ``go to work,'' ``gotta go to work'' crew in St. Louis. Different football teams are understood and known for different things. The St. Louis Rams have a slogan: Gotta go to work. I don't think there is a better slogan anywhere for a sports team than a sports team that elevates the idea of work. It is work that brings us to any goal, to the achievements we enjoy. It is work that gives us successful families. It is work that allows America to compete successfully around the world. It is that work ethic, expressed by the St. Louis Rams, that made them world champions. 
   For me to have the opportunity to stand today and say a few words about the St. Louis Rams, the fact that they had the work ethic necessary to prevail in the Super Bowl over an excellent team from Tennessee, is something for which we are all grateful. 
   I will talk a little bit about the kind of statistical year the Rams had. We had Kurt Warner, who is one of the great Horatio Alger stories of America. People talk about rags to riches. I don't know if he has gotten to riches yet. He was at the minimum wage in the National Football League before they decided to give him a bonus this year, and I don't know that he was in rags, but 5 years ago he was bagging groceries in Iowa because he hadn't quite gotten the opportunity to demonstrate his skills in football. Maybe this would be called from bags to riches. 
   The truth is, it is a heroic story of an individual who has not only great football skills but whose inspirational life is the kind of leadership we need more of in this country. When asked about his own inspiration, he said he gets inspiration from his family and the handicapped member of the family who every day, when falling down, gets back up. For the most valuable player in the Super Bowl, the most valuable player in the National Football League, to understand that we can all learn from each other and we can learn from even those in their heroic efforts who have not the talents that we do but have the courage to get back up, that is a tremendous thing. 
   It is with that in mind that I will talk a bit about the St. Louis Rams today, the Ram team, including Kurt Warner, and then Marshall Faulk, who set the all-time record for combined yardage this year. I thrill to the fact that there are youngsters in my State and across America who are saying: I want to be like Marshall Faulk; I want to be like Kurt Warner and this team of individuals who are such outstanding individuals; Isaac Bruce, who has been so productive as a football player and such an exemplary leader in our community. 
   There are statistics about this team. They won the West divisional title with a 13 and 3 record. They posted an undefeated record at home. That is something special to me because that was in the TWA Dome. When I was Governor of the State of Missouri, it was my responsibility to be involved in the construction of that dome and to see to it that it came in under budget and on time and 
   was a great facility. But no facility ever achieves greatness unless there are great things done there--to have the team come and be undefeated there this year and, of course, have other great things there. The Pope visited St. Louis and was at the TWA Dome, and Billy Graham came to St. Louis this year and was at the TWA Dome. There are some people who think it is important to invite the Pope and Billy Graham back next year so we can go undefeated another time. We would be pleased to have them come back because they bring the kind of presence to St. Louis that all of us cherish and want. 
   To watch our quarterback, Kurt Warner, who enjoyed one of the best seasons ever by an NFL quarterback, becoming only the second player in history to throw more than 40 touchdown passes and to realize that he wasn't discovered as a starting quarterback until this year's circumstances thrust him into the position, it was an amazing thing: completing 66 percent of his passes; 10 300-yard games in the season; setting a new Super Bowl record for 414 yards in passing. The offense of the Rams team: 526 points, the third highest single-season record ever. 
   Of course, Kurt Warner was named the NFL player of the year. He took his $30,000 award and gave it to Camp Barnabus, which is a camp for young people in southern Missouri. This  wasn't a $30,000 donation by someone who is making the big salaries; this was a $30,000 donation by someone who is earning the minimum wage in the NFL. 
   I could go on. The resolution that I will propound not only talks about Kurt Warner but extols the greatness of Marshall Faulk. These individuals are as great, or greater, off the field than they are on the field. That is what is so inspiring--their commitment to community. 
   Isaac Bruce caught 77 passes for 1,165 yards and 12 touchdowns in the regular season and led the Rams to a Super Bowl victory with 6 receptions for 162 yards, including a game-winning 73-yard touchdown reception that, frankly, required him to make a very big effort to come back and get the ball and go get the score. What a tremendous inspiration it was. 
   On defense, Todd Lyght led the Rams with a regular season career high of six interceptions, including a touchdown. He started in 97 straight games. Now, there is durability. Talk about having to go to work. That is the longest current streak with the team. 
   Rams' linebacker Mike Jones ended the very spectacular and heroic effort of the Tennessee Titans on the 2-yard line with the game-winning tackle as the time ran out in the Super Bowl. 
   I could also talk about wide receiver Terry Holt and about Coach Dick Vermeil, named NFL coach of the year, the oldest coach ever to win a Super Bowl. He, of course, retired from coaching, but he came back because he still had a burning capacity within him to motivate and help young people, and the football team reached the maximum of its potential. 
   It is with that in mind I wanted to propound a resolution to congratulate not only the team, the St. Louis Rams, but, frankly, the fans of St. Louis. No group of fans that I know of is more intelligent, understanding of the game, and more supportive of a team than the fans in St. Louis. The fans came together with the team over and over again. They stuck with the team in previous years when we were the worst in the league and helped carry the team when we were first in the league. That is very important. 
   I was at a tremendous celebration in St. Louis, and the individual who announces the team onto the field in each game, who is also a disc jockey at KSD FM, Smash, Asher Benrubi, was leading this rally. It became very apparent to me that the biggest contribution of the St. Louis Rams is the contribution of community, because the community has come together around this team in a special way that unites us all. Unity is the most important characteristic of any organization. When you can be unified and work together, that is something to behold. 
   It struck me at the time that the last five letters of the word ``community'' are the word ``unity.'' Those things, those challenges in our lives, and those opportunities in our lives, those victories and, yes, even defeats bring us together and are valuable to us. It is with that in mind I thank Smash for his great leadership as the MC of that rally. I thank the fans of St. Louis.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Senate for passing, S. 486, the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 1999. I'm proud to say this comprehensive anti-methamphetamine bill was built upon the DEFEAT Meth legislation that I  introduced earlier this year. This reflects a tremendous amount of bi-partisan work by the members of the judiciary committee. 
   And the reason for the level of bipartisan effort in crafting this bill was the recognition by all involved that it is needed desperately to combat one of the fastest growing threats to American society: the explosive problem of methamphetamine. 
   With its roots on the West coast, this epidemic has now exploded in middle America. Meth in the 1990s is what cocaine was in the 1980s and heroin was in the 1970s. It is currently the largest drug threat we face in my home state of Missouri. Unfortunately, it may be coming soon to a city or town near you. 
   If you wanted to design a drug to have the worst possible effect on your community, you'd make methamphetamine. It is highly addictive, highly destructive, cheap, and easy to manufacture. 
   To give you an idea of the scope of the problem, in 1992, law enforcement seized 2 clandestine Meth labs in my state of Missouri. By 1994, there were 14 seizures. In 1998, they seized 679 labs. Based on the figures collected so far this year, that number will jump again this year to over 800 labs. 
   And with this growth have come all of the problems. As meth abuse has increased, domestic abuse, child abuse, burglaries and meth related murders have also increased proportionately. From 1992 to 1998 meth-related emergency room incidents increased 63 percent. 
   What is more unacceptable is that meth is ensnaring our children. In 1998, the percentage of 12th graders who used meth was double the 1992 level. In recent conversations I have had with local law enforcement officers in Missouri, they estimated that as many as 10% of high school students know the receipe for meth. In fact, one need only log on to the Internet to find scores of web sites giving detailed instructions to set up you own meth lab. This is unacceptable. 
   Despite the appropriation of over $35 million dollars in the past two appropriation cycles for the Drug Enforcement Administration to train local law enforcement in the interdiction and clean-up of methamphetamine labs, the meth problem continues to grow. 
   And that is why I am so pleased S. 486, the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 1999 passed the Senate. This bill provides the necessary weapons to fight the growing meth problem in this country, including the authorization of $9.5 million for DEA programs to train State and local law enforcement in techniques used in meth investigations, $5.5 million for the hiring of new agents to assist State and local law enforcement in small and mid-sized communities, $15 million for school and community-based meth abuse and addiction prevention programs, $10 million for treatment of meth addicts, and $15 million to the Office of National Drug Control Policy to combat trafficking of meth in designated HIDTA's (High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas) which have had great success in Missouri and the Midwest. 
   This bill also amends the Sentencing Guidelines by increasing the mandatory minimum sentences for manufacturing meth and significantly increases mandatory minimum sentences if the offense created a risk of harm to the life of a minor or incompetent. Furthermore, the bill includes meth paraphernalia in the federal list of illegal paraphernalia. 
   But focusing on reducing supply through interdiction and punishment is not enough. The bill also authorizes substantial resources for education and prevention targeted specifically at the problem of meth. Local law enforcement in Missouri tells me that 10% of high school students know the recipe for meth. I want to ensure that 100% of them know that meth is a recipe for disaster. 
   Meth presents us with a formidable challenge. We have faced many other challenges in the past and we can face this one as well. In fact, the history of America is one of meeting challenges and surpassing people's highest expectations. Meth is no exception. All its takes is that we marshal our will and channel the great indomitable American spirit. Through legislative efforts like this bill we will meet this new meth challenge and defeat it.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today the United States Senate completes its business for calendar year 1999 by passing two important bills: H.R. 3194--the final spending bill, and H.R. 1180--the Work Incentives Act, which provides new opportunities for disabled individuals to enter the work force and includes $18 billion dollars in tax cuts. I am pleased to announce my support for both these bills. 
   The Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee has eloquently explained how this budget agreement keeps faith with the Republican pledge that no Social Security trust fund monies be used to pay for other government programs. 
   Last year, for the first since 1960--during the Eisenhower Administration--we balanced the budget without counting the Social Security surplus. Mr. President, for the first time in 39 years the government did not divert money from the Social Security Trust Fund to pay for other programs. 
   As a result of the spending plan pursued by this Republican Congress, which called for protection of Social Security, increased spending on education and defense, and reduction of the national debt, we have begun to put our fiscal House in order. 
   When I was elected to this body in 1994, the incoming 104th Congress inherited a projected four-year budget deficit of $906 billion. Now, through the hard work and discipline of this Congress, the tables have turned. That actual four-year period produced a net budget surplus of $63 billion--a turnaround of $969 billion, just a shade under a trillion dollars. With the passage of the final FY 2000 appropriations bill, we will continue on that path, reducing our national debt by $140 billion dollars in the current fiscal year. 
   Unlike last year's omnibus appropriations package that increased spending by almost $14 billion, this Congress successfully obtained offsets for all of the President's new spending, including an across-the-board cut that will help eliminate government waste and excess. In addition, despite President Clinton's best efforts, the offsets do not include a tax increase. 
   At the beginning of this year, I said that the Congress' primary responsibility was to protect the Social Security surplus. With the passage of this budget, we have accomplished that goal. In addition, not only have we avoided a tax hike, but we have also given the American people an $18 billion tax cut through the provisions contained in H.R. 1180--the Work Incentives Act. 
   I am pleased that the final bill includes over $2 billion in additional education spending over last year and gives local school districts more flexibility in how they spend that federal  assistance. The appropriations bill also contains an increase of $1.7 billion for veterans spending above 
   President Clinton's request, as well as an increase in funding for national defense that includes a boost in pay and benefits for our soldiers, sailors, and airmen. 
   But this bill does not just fund these important priorities, it also provides real cuts in government waste and abuse. The legislation includes a 0.38% across the board reduction that is essential to maintaining our fiscal discipline and protecting Social Security. 
   Included in this package are provisions to address some unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to protect Medicare recipients and providers. This bill includes $16 billion over 5 years to ensure that senior citizens can continue to receive quality health care. 
   These Medicare changes will help Medicare patients in hospitals--particularly rural, teaching, and cancer hospitals--skilled nursing facility residents, home health care recipients, and seniors who wish to receive their health care through the innovative Medicare+Choice program rather than through the conventional fee-for-service mechanism. I have traveled around Missouri and heard from countless doctors, patients, nurses, and other health care providers about the necessity of these changes. These provisions are good for the seniors in Missouri and across the Nation. 
   The package also provides for State Department Reauthorization, including language I authored that requires the State Department to publish a report documenting American victims of terrorist attacks in Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank. 
   In addition, the almost 400,000 Missouri households that are satellite television viewers will be pleased that this bill includes language that will allow them to continue receiving local programming. The Satellite Home Viewer Act will give real price competition and choice in video programming to all Missourians. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I am pleased that unlike last year, when we lumped all the bills together, allowing $14 billion in extra spending into one package, this year we finished our work on each of the bills, and negotiated each bill on its individual merits. While this bill is an omnibus package for procedural reasons, it was not negotiated as an omnibus package. Every provision was negotiated according to regular order, and as a result, we were able to succeed in our goal of protecting Social Security.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I would like to associate myself with the remarks of my colleague from Missouri. We in 
   Missouri are just as protective of our water as any other State in the Missouri River Basin, or for that matter, the rest of the United States. Before either of us can agree to any legislation that has the potential to affect our State, we must have the opportunity for our state experts to go over this legislation with a fine-tooth comb. I welcome the chance that the Senator from Alaska has offered and I know our state water experts will be happy to participate. As I have repeatedly stated, I am willing to work with my colleagues to try to resolve any concerns in a manner that will fully protect the interests of Missouri.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President I rise today to talk about an important and highly successful program operated for more than 25 years by the Salvation Army in conjunction with the Bureau of Prisons. This program is called the Prison Card Program. Under the program, greeting cards are donated to the Salvation Army that are then given to inmates at correctional facilities across the country. This program allows inmates to keep in touch with family and friends--not only during the holiday season--but throughout the year. The benefits of this program to the inmates and their loved ones are clear. However, there are also benefits to the community as well. Inmates who maintain strong ties with their families and friends are less likely to return to prison once their sentence is completed. 
   I want to commend the Salvation Army, the Department of Justice, and the Bureau of Prisons for supporting this program. In particular, I want the Department to know that this program has the support of Congress. I have spoken to Chairman GREGG, who has indicated that he is prepared to work with me and other supporters of the program in the coming months to ensure that this important charitable program is sustained well into the future.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair. 
   I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak in support of an amendment offered by Senator HATCH and by Senator ABRAHAM and by me. This amendment contains the text of S. 486, the Methamphetamine Antiproliferation Act of 1999. It is a comprehensive antimethamphetamine bill that I am grateful to have the opportunity of saying is built upon what we called DEFEAT Meth legislation that I introduced earlier this year. It reflects a tremendous amount of truly bipartisan work by the members of the Judiciary Committee cooperating to address a threat which was once thought to have been very localized but is a threat now that is literally reaching from sea to sea. 
   The reason for the level of bipartisan effort, of course, in crafting this bill is the recognition by all involved that it is needed to combat one of the fastest growing threats to America, the explosive problem of methamphetamine. When I say explosive, I do not just refer to the fact that those cooking or producing methamphetamines are using dangerous chemicals that often result in explosions and house fires. It has exploded in terms of growth across our culture, and we need to curtail it.  
   Today we are blessed and privileged to live in a period of great national prosperity, but with prosperity sometimes comes apathy or complacency. Unfortunately, this is the perfect breeding ground for drug abuse. Worse still, apathy and complacency not only foster drug abuse, they hamper our society's ability to combat drug abuse and other social ills. We have not been combating drug abuse effectively enough as a culture, and for that reason we have been working on this measure to increase and elevate our effectiveness against this most dangerous of drugs. 
   As I have noted many times before, under this administration we have been backsliding in the war against drugs. Marijuana use by 8th graders has increased 176 percent since 1992, and cocaine and heroin use among 10th graders has more than doubled in the last 7 years. And now we need to add to these failings the burgeoning epidemic of methamphetamines. 
   Methamphetamines have had their roots on the west coast and for a long time in other parts of the country, but the epidemic has now exploded in middle America. Meth in the 1990s is what cocaine was in the 1980s and heroin was in the 1970s. It is currently the largest drug threat we face in my home State of Missouri. Unfortunately, it may be coming soon to a city or town near you. If you wanted to design a drug to have the worst possible effect on your community, you would probably design methamphetamine. It is highly addictive, highly destructive, cheap, and it is easy to manufacture. 
   To give you an idea of the scope of the problem, in 1992 law enforcement seized 2 clandestine meth labs in my home State of Missouri; by 1994, there were 14 seizures; by 1998, there were 679 clandestine meth lab seizures in the State of Missouri alone. 
   When we talk about a clandestine meth lab, we are talking about a place where people are making or manufacturing methamphetamines. Based on the figures collected so far this year, however, the number will jump again this year to over 800 meth labs to be seized in the State of Missouri. 
   Let us put that in perspective: 2 in 1992, 800 in 1999. By any definition, this is a problem that commands our attention. And with this growth have come all kinds of difficult challenges and problems. As meth use has increased, domestic abuse, child abuse, burglaries, and meth-related murders have also increased. From 1992 to 1998, meth-related emergency room incidents increased 63 percent. 
   What is most unacceptable is that meth is ensnaring our children. In 1997, the percentage of 12th graders who used meth was double the 1992 level. In recent conversations I have had with 
   local law enforcement officers in Missouri, they estimate that as many as 10 percent of high school students know the recipe for methamphetamines. In fact, one need only log onto the Internet to find scores of web sites giving detailed instructions about how to set up your own meth lab or production facility. This is unacceptable. 
   We in the Congress have taken these indicators seriously. In the past two appropriations cycles, we have appropriated $11 million and then $24.5 million for the drug enforcement administration to train local law enforcement officials in the interdiction, finding, discovering, and then cleaning up of methamphetamine labs. 
   Despite these appropriations, the meth problem continues to grow. I believe it is time we dedicate more resources to stopping this scourge once and for all. So that is why I am so committed to passing S. 486, the Methamphetamine Antiproliferation Act of 1999, as part of this bill. 
   This amendment provides the necessary weapons to fight the growing meth problem in this country, including the authorization of $5.5 million for DEA programs to train State and local law enforcement in techniques used in meth investigation. There is $9.5 million for hiring new Drug Enforcement Administration agents to assist State and local law enforcement in small and midsized communities. There is $15 million for school and community-based meth abuse and addiction prevention programs; $10 million for the treatment of meth addicts; and $15 million to the Office of the National Drug Control Policy to combat trafficking of meth in designated high-intensity drug trafficking areas which have had great success in Missouri and the Midwest in bringing attention to, focus upon, and eradication of the methamphetamine problem. 
   This bill also amends the sentencing guidelines by increasing the mandatory minimum sentences for manufacturing meth and significantly increasing mandatory minimum sentences if the offense created a risk of harm to the life of a minor or an incompetent. 
   As I have traveled across my own State of Missouri, I have learned about cases where methamphetamines were being produced in the presence of children--children contaminated chemically by the processes and the byproducts of meth production. It is time we make a clear statement that we will not sacrifice our children on the altar of methamphetamine production. We must have serious increased, mandatory minimum sentences for putting at risk the life of a child in the creation and development of methamphetamines. 
   Furthermore, the amendment includes meth paraphernalia in the Federal list of illegal paraphernalia. 
   For a long time, drug paraphernalia relating to other serious drug scourges has been outlawed. The maintenance or development of, and the utilization of paraphernalia in those settings has been inappropriate and wrong. Now we are going to add meth paraphernalia to that Federal list of illegal paraphernalia. 
   By focusing on reducing the supply through interdiction and punishment, we will make some progress, but that progress is not enough. The amendment authorizes substantial resources for education and prevention targeted specifically at the problem of meth. As I said earlier, law enforcement in Missouri tells me 10 percent of the high school students know the recipe for meth. I want 100 percent of the high school students to know that meth is the recipe for disaster. 
   Meth presents us with a formidable challenge. We have faced other challenges in the past, and we can face this challenge as well. In fact, the history of America is one of meeting challenges and surpassing people's highest expectations. Meth is no exception. All it will take is that we marshal our will and we channel the great, indomitable American spirit. If we focus our energy on this problem, we can add substantially to the safety and to the health and to the future and opportunities for our young people. Through legislative efforts like this amendment, we will meet this new meth challenge and defeat it, and I urge Members of this body to work hard to make sure this effort to defeat meth becomes a part of the law. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am here on the floor today to talk about one of Missouri's most important natural resources, and that is the Missouri River. There is a bill that another Member is trying to pass by unanimous consent that would threaten the Missouri River. I am making it clear that I have an objection to this bill, and I am firm on this issue. 
   On Friday around 4 p.m., 52 bills were hot-lined to be passed by unanimous consent in the Senate. Most of the time, Members pass bills by unanimous consent that are noncontroversial. However, buried in this list of 52 bills was one that I am opposed to, S. 623, the Dakota Water Resources Act. I am opposed to it because it would divert a substantial amount of water out of the Missouri River. The bill that I am objecting to authorizes $200 million to divert additional water from the Missouri River system to the Cheyenne River and the Red River systems. This is an inter-basin transfer of water which could have substantial impacts all along the Missouri River basin. I do not blame the North Dakota Senators for fighting for this, but it hurts my State and it hurts other States, and I cannot consent to its approval by unanimous consent. Apparently, this bill has broad opposition by many different parties along the Missouri River. It is a very controversial provision and should not be passed in the dead of night on a consent calendar with a lot of noncontroversial bills. 
   This is opposed strongly by the Governor and the Department of Natural Resources in Missouri. It is opposed by Taxpayers for Common Sense. It is opposed by a host of environmental groups--including the National Wildlife Federation, the National Audubon Society, Friends of the Earth, and American Rivers. The Canadian Government opposes this bill and has opposed the program it authorizes for decades, claiming that it violates a 1909 United States-Canada Boundary Waters Treaty. The Governor of Minnesota opposes this measure. The Minnesota State Department of Natural Resources opposes it, and the list goes on. 
   It is too early in the process for me to clear this bill. There are too many questions that remain to be answered. There are too many related issues that the States are negotiating at this time. We are awaiting the recommendations of the Corps of Engineers on how much additional water they intend to reserve for Dakota purposes. The senior Senator from Missouri and I will continue to object. As a result of our objections, the sponsor of the bill is holding up 51 other unrelated bills. 
   Let me be clear. These 51 holds are not related to the longstanding dispute between North Dakota and Missouri and many other parties over the water allocation in the Missouri River. Therefore, Senator BOND and I will not be pressured into lifting our hold on a bill that will harm the livelihood of the people of Missouri. These types of interstate river disputes that have been going on for years simply should not be resolved without all interested parties involved and without adequate consideration given to the ecological and commercial effects. 
   From the farm to the factory, the Missouri River creates jobs in the Midwest. The Missouri River is a stable water supply and a source of hydro power for major cities. We must be very cautious about changing water levels along the Missouri River in order to maintain the recreational opportunities for local communities, as well as hatcheries for fish and flyways for migratory birds.  
   I regret that important unrelated and noncontroversial measures are being held up by the sponsors of S. 623, but I cannot consent to passage of this bill at this time. The water flow of the Missouri River is too important to the livelihood of numerous metropolitan areas and small cities, and transportation and industry not only in Missouri but all along the waterway. We must deal with this measure reasonably and in the context of real negotiations, not as a matter of consent to be undertaken without full discussion by the parties. 
   I thank the Senate for my opportunity to reference my position on this issue. I yield the remainder of the time.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to commend the members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee for their efforts in crafting S. 976, the ``Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act,'' which reauthorizes programs under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. In particular, I want to recognize the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Public Health, the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. FRIST, for his tremendous leadership in drafting this legislation. 
   I am especially pleased that this legislation contains the Charitable Choice provision--modeled after my Charitable Choice provision in the 1996 welfare reform law--which will expand the opportunities for religious organizations to provide substance abuse treatment services with SAMHSA block grant funds. This provision is also very similar to language contained in Senator ABRAHAM's legislation, the ``Faith-Based Drug Treatment Enhancement Act.'' 
   While government substance abuse programs have not succeeded very well in helping people break free from addictions, faith-based drug treatment programs have been transforming shattered lives for years by addressing the deeper needs of people--by instilling hope and values which change destructive behavior and attitudes. 
   What results have they achieved? We have heard countless stories of the efficiency and effectiveness of these faith-based programs. Teen Challenge has shown that 86% of its graduates remain drug-free. These are individuals who finally broke free of addictions after being routed through a number of government drug treatment programs. The Bowery Mission in New York City has had the most effective free-standing substance abuse shelter in the city-wide system. Bowery also serves its clients at approximately 42% of the cost of some other city-sponsored men's substance abuse shelters. Mel Trotter Ministries in Grand Rapids, Michigan, named for its former alcoholic founder, has an astounding 70 percent long-term success rate in its faith-based rehabilitation program. According to director Thomas Laymon, government programs leave addicts without ``spiritual support.'' Worse, addicts ``are not held accountable for addictions, and they have no incentive to change their behavior.'' Meanwhile, Trotter Ministries provides guidance, a supportive community, and integration into a life beyond drugs. San Antonio's Victory Fellowship, run by Pastor Freddie Garcia, has saved thousands of addicts in some of the city's toughest neighborhoods. The program offers addicts a safe haven, a chance to recover, job training, and a chance to provide for themselves and their families. It has served more than 13,000 people and has a success rate of over 80%.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I join my Senate colleagues, the people of Rhode Island, and the citizens of this great nation in bidding a sad farewell to our friend and countryman John Chafee. 
   From the shores of Guadalcanal to his hometown of Providence, RI, to the floor of the United States Senate, John Chafee was a true patriot. In everything he did, he put the best interests of the United States first. 
   And even when I disagreed with him, I knew that our disagreements were legitimate disagreements about what each of us felt was the best interests of this great country. 
   Descendant of two Governors and a Senator, John liked to joke that the one member of his family who ran for office as a Democrat--Harvard professor Zechariah Chafee--lost handily. John, knowing the family history, signed up as a Republican and never looked back. 
   John was a remarkable man coming from a remarkable family. His legacy gave him a lot to live up to, and he not only met but exceeded all expectations. 
   John's record of successes began at an early age. In high school, he was the runner up in the 135 pound class in the state wrestling championships. And let me tell you, nobody wrestles like those 135 pounders! Not only was it an impressive achievement, but it was good training for a future career as a Senator.  
   Later, at Yale, he was captain of the undefeated Yale freshman wrestling team. We will never know if he would have repeated that achievement the following year, because he left Yale in his sophomore year to enlist in the Marines--he didn't have to do that, but because he was an American Patriot, he did. 
   In the Marines, he served at the Battle of Guadalcanal. John was in the first wave of Americans to join in the bloody and important battle there. This country will always owe a great debt to him and the other Marines who served so bravely there. 
   After the Marines, John sought to move on with his life. He went to Harvard Law School, got married, and began the practice of law in the state he loved so dear. But duty called once again, and he returned to the Marines, to lead a rifle company in our struggle in Korea, and the nation's debt to him became even greater. 
   After his service in Korea, John returned to Rhode Island and embarked upon a political career. While John had ups and downs in his time, he certainly 
   had more ups than downs. And more importantly, he knew how to handle those downs. 
   One of the downs came in 1968, when he lost the governorship in a surprising upset. Richard Nixon, recognizing the talent in John, tapped him to be Secretary of the Navy. There he was faced with a difficult decision concerning the chief officers of the Pueblo, a Navy ship that had been taken by the North Koreans. John decided not to court martial the captain and chief intelligence officer of the ship, deeming that they had suffered enough during their internment in a Korean prisoner of war camp. It was a difficult decision, but John Chafee has a great wisdom in difficult matters and the nation once again benefited from John's leadership. 
   In 1976, he was elected to the United States Senate, the institution to which he would devote the rest of his days. Both John Chafee and I won elections to the Senate in 1994, he for his fourth term and I for my first. Despite the disparity in seniority, we became friends, exchanging greetings on his birthday, which was just last Friday. He always appreciated my greetings, and sent the kindest thank you notes in response. 
   In my time here, I had the pleasure to work with him on a great number of issues, but two in particular stand out. 
   The first is ISTEA, the all-important transportation legislation we passed here few years ago. I worked closely with John to secure desperately-needed transportation projects in my home State of Missouri. John was always willing to work with me and my staff, and the citizens of Missouri must be added to the list of those who owe him a debt of gratitude. 
   The other issue that stands out in my mind when I think of John is his effort to reform the Superfund program. John was always concerned about the environment; back in 1969, the New York Post reported that John would stop his campaign motorcade and get out of his car to pick up a piece of litter. John always understood that we were all responsible for improving the environment, and his efforts to improve Superfund were based on that belief in individual action. As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, he was in a position to act on his love for the environment, and his work in reforming Superfund is one of his most important achievements. 
   John leaves behind a loving wife, Ginny, 5 children, and 12 grandchildren. My prayers are for them at this time. They will miss him, as will we all.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, Monday was a tragic day for golf fans across the country, and especially for folks in my home town of Springfield, MO--the town where pro golfer Payne Stewart was born and raised. Today, we mourn the loss of Payne, who lost his life Monday in a plane crash. I rise to express my sympathy to Payne's family and loved ones, and to the families of the other individuals who lost their lives Monday: Robert Fraley, Van Ardan, Michael King, and Stephanie Bellegarrigue. 
   I would also like to take a moment to remember Payne Stewart, a man whose personality, talents, and faith are an inspiration to us. 
   From his early years, Payne distinguished himself as not only a golfer, but as an all-around athlete. One of my staff members from Springfield remembers tagging along as a six year-old little sister with her father, her brother, Payne, and his father on a road trip to Kansas City, where the boys competed in the state's annual Pass, Punt, and Kick contest. She also recalls the countless hours her brother was gone during the summers, playing golf--often times with Payne. 
   In high school, Payne excelled as an athlete in football, basketball, and of course, golf, at Greenwood High School, where he graduated in 1975. Payne then attended Southern Methodist University, where he won the Southwestern Conference Golf Championship and was named an All-American. 
   Payne turned professional in 1981 and embarked upon what would be a highly successful career. 
   Payne's flare for style and individualism soon made him one of the most recognizable golfers on the PGA tour, with his now-trademark knickers, long colorful socks, and coordinating hat. 
   But Payne's attire on the golf course was not the only thing that distinguished him among his colleagues. Overall, Payne won 11 PGA Tour titles, including three major championships: the PGA in 1989, the U.S. Open in 1991, and the U.S. Open again in June of this year. He was on five Ryder Cup teams and won three consecutive Skins Games. He was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame earlier this year. 
   In what is now known as his final U.S. Open appearance, Stewart finished his last U.S. Open round by sinking the longest winning putt ever to win the most heralded American tournament. While Stewart always will be remembered for this clutch putt to win the 1999 U.S. Open, what he did one month later during the Ryder Cup competition speaks to his character. After a miraculous final day comeback by the American team, Stewart's opponent, Colin Montgomerie, faced a ten foot putt to win the individual match on the final hole. Although the American team already had assured itself a victory, a tie with Europe's top player would have been a tremendous individual feat for Stewart. Instead of making Montgomerie attempt the putt, Stewart told his opponent to ``pick it up,'' conceding the putt and ensuring his own defeat. Stewart's justification for his action was that Montgomerie had been heckled all day by the American fans and he did not want to put his opponent through that if he missed. 
   Payne Stewart, who became a world-famous golfer, continued to be a home-town boy from the Ozarks after his success. Although Orlando had become his official home, Payne still liked to come back home to Springfield to spend time with family and friends. Those close to him say that when he came home, Payne didn't act like a celebrity, but rather more like ``everyday people.'' 
   There are many words that have been used to describe Payne Stewart. Fun-loving and generous. Highly competitive. Yet Payne was also very much of a family man. 
   Payne was always close to his father, Bill. The father and son tandem shared the unique distinction of winning dual amateur championships, the Missouri Amateur and the Missouri Senior Amateur in 1979. After his father had died of cancer in1985, Payne donated his entire $108,000 in winnings from the 1987 Bay Hill Classic to a Florida hospital. Mr. President, I, too, had a father who had a major impact on my life, and I was touched by the reflections I heard Payne share about his father. 
   Payne was also recently described by the Springfield News-Leader as the ``consummate family man who was as thrilled with picking up daughter Chelsea [13] and son Aaron [10] from school, or shuttling them back and forth to ball games, activities, etc., as he was picking up a first-place check.'' Friends say that Payne believed that family time with his children and his wife Tracey was the most important thing in his life, even if it meant canceling a tournament appearance. 
   In the last year or so, Payne Stewart characterized himself as an increasingly religious man. He said that watching his children grow up further strengthened his faith. Payne also attributed his success to his faith. In fact, he publicly credited this faith with giving him the strength to sink the winning 15-foot putt at this year's U.S. Open this June. A close friend, reflecting Monday on Payne's death, said, ``Later on, coming to know the Lord, he was attributing his success, his talents and his blessing--he attributed it all and gave glory to Jesus Christ.'' 
   Mr. President, while it is painful to see someone in the prime of his career have his life cut short by tragedy, it is also encouraging to remember someone whose life has inspired us--through both his talents as a golf champion and through his commitment to faith and family. Today we remember Payne Stewart--a local hero from the Ozarks--a champion and a competitor, and we convey our thoughts and prayers to his family and loved ones during this time of grief. I also want to express condolences to the families and friends of those who perished with Payne, Robert Fraley, Van Ardan, Michael King, and Stephanie Bellegarrigue.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, a lack of leadership from the administration is responsible for the present difficulty in reaching an agreement on the foreign operations appropriations bill. The President says he vetoed the bill over low levels of foreign assistance in general and a lack of funding for the Wye Accord specifically. The Administration did not exert the leadership needed to secure the Wye funding, however, and did not work with Congress to find a way to provide this critical assistance to Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinians without raiding the Social Security surplus. I am a strong supporter of funding the Wye Accord if the money can be found without using Social Security surplus funds. The President should make Wye funding the priority it should be and find the money somewhere in the budget. 
   The lack of leadership from the administration in providing for our allies and interests in the Middle East already has had real costs, however. The President's veto of the foreign operation appropriations bill on October 18, 1999 sends a disturbing signal that our foreign policy is being held hostage to the domestic budget politics of the administration. While the President's veto was the wrong step for U.S. foreign policy around the world, the administration's rejection of the bill is particularly troubling for U.S. policy in the Middle East and strategic allies such as Israel. 
   The foreign operations bill passed by Congress contains $960 million in economic assistance and $1.9 billion in military assistance for Israel. The foreign operations bill also contains over $2 billion in assistance to Egypt and $225 million in aid to Jordan, both important countries in the peace process. The provision of such assistance to Israel is critically important at this juncture of the peace process, and it troubles me that the administration did not lay the groundwork for an acceptable foreign assistance package. The government of Prime Minister Ehud Barak has stated its intention to complete final status negotiations within one year. Many difficult issues must be resolved for a final settlement to be reached. Jerusalem, refugees, and water rights are just several of the monumental issues that will be topic of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. 
   It is my hope that the administration will support Israel more forcefully during these negotiations, including a clear statement of U.S. policy that Jerusalem is and should remain Israel's undivided capital. As final status negotiations proceed, the United States should defend Israel against diplomatic ambushes in international fora such as the United Nations. An unequivocal U.S. position in support of Israel in the coming months will be essential to achieve a sustainable peace settlement. 
   Also at stake is a potential peace settlement with Syria. I trust that Prime Minister Barak will not make territorial concessions in the Golan Heights that will jeopardize Israel's security. As a former military chief of staff, Prime Minister Barak is well aware of the security implications associated with relinquishing territory in the Golan. Any Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights should be met with the most reliable assurances from Syria that its hostility toward Israel and support for terrorism will cease. For the peace to be sustainable, however, and Israel-Syrian settlement will have to be based on more than words. Israel will have to be able to defend itself, and continued provision of annual U.S. military assistance is an integral part of that process. 
   With all that is at stake right now in the peace process, it is difficult for me to understand why the administration has not worked closely with Congress to ensure that vital assistance is provided to Irasel in a timely fashion. Mr. President, it is my hope that the administration will demonstrate better leadership in supporting Israel as the peace process enters this critical year.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Delaware for his leadership, and I thank him for making the attempt to increase our capacity to serve America by allowing me to offer an amendment. 
   The measure that I am offering today is a measure that Democratic minority leader Senator DASCHLE, 31 cosponsors, and I had introduced as free-standing legislation earlier this year. All of the cosponsors of the measure have been strong advocates on behalf of American agriculture. We are addressing the ability of American agriculture to be represented effectively in trade negotiations. 
   Currently, there is a temporary American Ambassador for agriculture in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative so that America's farmers and ranchers always have a representative at the table when the United States enters large trade negotiations. If we are worried about the United States' balance of payments, we ought to elevate and try to increase our number of exports. 
   Our farm community outproduces and outworks any farm producers around the world. When trade agreements are negotiated, we need our farmers to be represented there by a consistent, strong voice for agriculture. 
   The Senate Democratic minority leader, Senator DASCHLE, and I and 31 cosponsors introduced this free-standing bill, S. 185, because we thought it is essential to U.S. farm and trade policy. It is a bill, which as an amendment to this measure, ensures that our Nation's farmers and ranchers have a permanent trade ambassador in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Let me express that once more to be very clear: We want to have a permanent agricultural trade ambassador in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative so whenever our Trade Representatives are making considerations about the kinds of agreements that will govern the relationships between the United States and other nations as they relate to trade with agricultural products, an expert, clearly focused on, committed to, trained in, and abreast of the circumstances in the agricultural community, will be right there at the table advancing our interests. 
   This is very important, especially as we understand that our agricultural productivity far exceeds our ability to consume. In my home State, between a quarter and a third of all the agricultural products produced must go into the international marketplace. I heard the Senator from Illinois the other day talk about how that in his State over half of all the products are grown for shipment overseas. For some commodities, such as soybeans, over half of those commodities must be exported. 
   This is a simple concept. The placement in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative of a permanent trade ambassador for agriculture has broad bipartisan support in the Congress. It is supported by more than 80 national farm organizations. And the administration supports it. 
   I talked recently with U.S. Trade Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky in a meeting with the congressional ``WTO Caucus for Farmers and Ranchers.'' Let me explain. Senators LARRY CRAIG and BYRON DORGAN have assembled people in the Congress who are concerned about agriculture's capacity to trade effectively and to get our products overseas. We have organized with their leadership this caucus, consisting of both Senate and House Members, to address agricultural issues in the upcoming World Trade Organization Seattle Round. 
   This fall in Seattle we are going to launch a new round of trade negotiations. We have been seeking as a caucus of Members of the Congress to work with our trade ambassador, Ambassador Barshefsky, to say we want to make sure we in the Congress cooperate so that when any trade agreements are finally reached, the Senate is in a better position not only to understand  them but 
   also to approve them if at all possible. 
   I was delighted that when we discussed this need for a permanent agricultural trade ambassador within the Office of the Trade Representative, Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky endorsed the program fully. She said this initiative is very important. 
   I described the fact we have the WTO round of trade talks starting in late November in Seattle. I want to communicate the urgency to get this provision we are offering today enacted into law before the Seattle Round kicks off. I think Senator DASCHLE understands, the other 31 cosponsors understand, the members of the WTO trade caucus understand, and the White House understands the urgency of having agricultural issues fully represented at the table. That is why the administration supports this. That is why I am pleased to have been an original cosponsor with the minority leader, TOM DASCHLE, on this proposal in February because we all understand the importance of this proposal. 
   Ambassador Barshefsky went on to say:  
   Ensuring that the United States has a permanent trade ambassador will put U.S. farmers in a stronger position in the Seattle round of the WTO negotiations that will begin late this fall.  
   Ambassador Barshefsky pointed out that when she assumed the position of the U.S. Trade Representative, she appointed Peter Scher as a special trade negotiator for agriculture. He has been the voice for America's farmers and ranchers at the negotiating table, and he has been doing a wonderful job advocating positions that will advance the strength of their interests internationally. However, his position was an administration decision and an appointment as opposed to being a permanent position in the law. 
   The bill we introduced and the amendment I am offering today makes his position permanent, subject to Senate approval, of course. Our farmers need a representative in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative who will focus solely on opening foreign markets, ensuring a level playing field for U.S. agricultural products and services, and representing the interests of American farmers, the most productive of all of our sectors of our economy. The opportunity to do that is not only ripe and ready, it is necessary now because we are looking the WTO round in the face. We need to achieve this objective. 
   In September 1998, American farmers and ranchers faced the first ever monthly trade deficit for U.S. farm and food products since the United States began tracking trade data in 1941. This sounds an alarm for States such as my home State of Missouri. We receive over one-fourth of our farm income from agricultural exports. Already this year the U.S. Department of Agriculture has reported the value of agricultural exports has dropped by over $5 billion since this time last year. We need to be promoting and developing ways of exporting more of the food and fiber we grow in this country. At best, the total agricultural exports will be $49 billion in 1999. This is a reduction from total agricultural exports of $60 billion 3 years ago. We cannot afford to be in a situation where we are vastly increasing productivity and production and curtailing our farmers' amount of exports opportunities. We desperately need to enhance the level of exports for our farmers. We need to make permanent the position of agricultural trade ambassador within the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. 
   Also, our agricultural trade surplus totaled $26.8 billion just 3 years ago. By last year, that amount had dropped by almost 50 percent. This year, our annual agricultural trade surplus will have dwindled to about $12 billion. 
   The bottom line is we need more attention focused on farmers' competitiveness overseas. We need to make this a policy priority. Our priorities need to be reflected in the level of the resources we deploy to do this job of opening markets for farmers and ranchers. 
   When I am thinking about the Nation's trade policy, especially about agriculture, I ask myself what is good for the State of Missouri. In some significant measure, Missouri happens to be a leader in farming. We are the State with the second highest number of farms--second only to Texas. We have just about every crop imaginable. Missouri is among the Nation's top producers in almost all crops. We are second in terms of beef cows. We are second in hay production. Missouri is one of the top five pork-producing States. Missouri is also among the top 10 States for the production of cotton, rice, corn, winter wheat, milk, and watermelon. 
   With 26 percent of the income in our State coming from exports, our Missouri farmers, like farmers from sea to shining sea, need to know that their ability to export will expand over time rather than become subject to foreign protectionist policies that choke them out of their market share. 
   During the 1996 farm bill debate, in exchange for decreased Government payments, our farmers were promised more export opportunities. It is time for us to deliver on that promise. 
   America's farmers and ranchers need a permanent agriculture ambassador who will represent their interests worldwide, especially as we face more negotiations in the World Trade Organization, and also as we have regional negotiations with both Central and South America progressing. There are a lot of opportunities that could be opened up to our farmers and ranchers in the coming years. We need to have someone at the door, always pressing for those opportunities. 
   Under the legislation which the minority leader and I and 31 others introduced this year, the agricultural ambassador would be responsible for conducting trade negotiations and enforcing trade agreements relating to U.S. agricultural products and services. Also under the legislation, the ambassador must be a vigorous advocate on behalf of U.S. agricultural interests. 
   It is imperative, in my judgment, that U.S. interests always have a strong, clear voice at the table in international negotiations. Foreign countries will always have agriculture trade barriers. We need to send the message to foreign governments we are serious about breaking down barriers to their markets, so that our farmers and ranchers will be put on more of a level playing field. 
   Canada and Mexico have already concluded free trade agreements with Chile, for example. Farmers in Canada can send their agricultural products to Chile, and in most instances Canadian farmers face a zero tariff level. Our farmers, on the other hand, are confronted with an 11-percent tariff. That makes it very difficult for us to be competitive. The E.U. is negotiating a trade deal with Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Thus, these countries will give European farmers more access to their markets at the expense of U.S. farmers and ranchers. We can not afford to wait. America must lead, not follow, especially in our own backyard in the Western Hemisphere, but certainly even around the world. 
   The agricultural ambassador amendment we are offering today is supported by more than 80 agricultural trade associations. Additionally, State branches of these national associations such as the Missouri Farm Bureau Federation and the Missouri Pork Producers Council are weighing in with their strong support. 
   We need to utilize every opportunity we have to help our farmers and ranchers in America. Making permanent the position of U.S. Trade Representative for agriculture, we are guaranteed the interests of American farmers and ranchers will always have a prominent status and will ensure that our agreements are more aggressively enforced. 
   It is with this in mind, and because of what I believe is the overwhelming consensus on this measure, the bipartisan nature of it, and the pressing need for it for this year's WTO round, which will begin in Seattle later this fall, that I wanted to bring this amendment to the floor and offer it. I believe this Senate will overwhelmingly endorse this commonsense proposal which has such strong bipartisan support, which is supported by the Administration, and which would render such great service to the farmers and ranchers of the United States of America who lead America in productivity and who can lead America in terms of our balance of trade and exports.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, on Sunday, October 3, 1999, the Most Reverend Raymond J. Boland, Bishop of the Kansas City-St. Joseph area of Missouri, delivered the homily at the Red Mass held at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, DC. The Red Mass traditionally marks the opening of the Supreme Court's new term. In his address, Bishop Boland discusses the idea of having cooperative dialog between the Church and State in their mutual search for justice and respect.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. SANTORUM, for his continuing work on this important issue. 
   I express my strong support for legislation that would ban this unconscionable form of infanticide known as partial-birth abortion. Abortion is a moral and governmental issue of unsurpassed importance. It strikes at the very core of who we are as a people and a nation. It hits our deepest notions of liberty and questions our most fundamental assumptions about life. 
   For decades, my home State of Missouri has been at the forefront of the abortion debate, and for the last several years, the discourse there has been focused on the procedure being discussed here today--partial-birth abortion, infanticide. While the specific language of S. 1692 is different from the Missouri legislation, the question posed is the same: Are we willing to end a procedure that is so barbaric and extreme as to defy rational, reasoned support? Both Democrat and Republican legislators in Missouri answered, ``Yes, we are willing to ban that procedure.'' 
   I had the privilege of serving as Missouri Governor. Regrettably, the legislature did not deliver a ban on this barbaric procedure to my desk when I was Governor. Had they done so, I would have signed it enthusiastically. Had that happened, the legislature could now be focused on other pressing problems, such as failing schools in Kansas City or St. Louis or the methamphetamine drug plague in Missouri. 
   Most Missourians see, as I do, the effort to ban partial-birth abortion as part of a larger commonsense approach, restricting late-term abortions, ending taxpayer funding, and requiring parental consent. These sensible ideas are not about the right of choice. They are about the right of Missouri and America to act in a manner befitting humanity. We are talking about a barbaric procedure that is inhumane. It is not befitting humanity. 
   Tragically, the Missouri partial-birth infanticide bill was vetoed, despite its overwhelming passage by the bipartisan Missouri General Assembly. Fortunately, both the Democrats and Republicans who fought for the original bill led a successful veto override effort in Missouri. It is an incredible accomplishment that represents only the seventh veto override in Missouri history, the third override this century, the first veto override since 1980. 
   Banning partial-birth abortion, which is the destruction of a partially born child, requires a historic bipartisan effort here, as it did in Missouri. America must rise above this morally indefensible, cruel procedure. It is cruel to society's most vulnerable members. Missouri's Democrat and Republican legislators got past the obfuscation, the confusion, and the deceptions. It is time for the Senate to do the same. 
   The defenders of the indefensible are already fast at work. They tell us that the procedure is necessary to save the life of the mother. The simple truth is, this procedure is never necessary to save and preserve the health of an unborn child's mother. Four specialists in OB/GYN and fetal medicine representing the Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth have written:  
   Contrary to what abortion activists would have us believe, partial-birth abortion is never medically indicated to protect a woman's health or her fertility. In fact, the opposite is true: The procedure can pose a significant and immediate threat to both the pregnant woman's health and fertility.  
   That quote was from the Wall Street Journal, September 19, 1996. 
   Nor should we accept the myth that this procedure is rarely utilized. According to interviews conducted by The Record of Bergen County, NJ, physicians in New Jersey alone claim to perform at least 1,500 partial-birth abortions every year--three times the number the National Abortion Federation claimed occurred in the entire country. 
   Once we have established that the procedure is neither rare nor medically necessary, we will hear from the other side that our law would be unconstitutional. This is just another falsehood. A legislative ban on partial-birth abortions is constitutional. Indeed, allowing this life-taking procedure to continue would be inconsistent with our obligation under the Constitution to protect life. 
   Although opponents will point to decisions in which activist Federal judges invalidated State-passed bans, language nearly identical to that which is in this bill has also been upheld in the Federal courts. These bans' requirements that the abortionist deliberately and intentionally deliver a living fetus that is then killed implicates the partial-birth procedure. This is not a generalized ban. Judges who have deemed the ban unconstitutionally vague ignored this text and instead have substituted their views in place of the views 
   clearly expressed by the various State legislatures. 
   I also want to share a word of caution with those claiming that a ban on partial-birth abortions is unconstitutional. If they truly believe that outlawing this procedure is impermissibly vague, the inevitable conclusion people will draw is that infanticide and abortion are indistinguishable. This argument provides little solace to the defenders of this gruesome procedure. 
   On January 20 of last year, I chaired a committee meeting of the Constitution Subcommittee on the 25th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. In that hearing, we learned much that is relevant to the debate over partial-birth abortion. We looked at how the Supreme Court's decision failed to provide a framework for sound constitutional interpretation or to reflect the reality of modern medical practice. This latter failure is not surprising, since the Court had neither the capacity to evaluate the accuracy of the medical data nor a way to foresee the remarkable advances in medical science that would make the then-current data obsolete. 
   From Dr. Jean Wright of the Egleston Children's Hospital at Emory University, we learned at the hearing that the age of viability has been pushed back from 28 weeks to 23 and fewer weeks since Roe v. Wade was decided.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Surgical advances now allow surgeons to partially remove an unborn child through an incision in the womb, to repair the congenital defect, and slip the previable infant back into the womb. However, I think the most interesting thing we learned at the hearing was that unborn babies can sense pain in just the seventh week of life. These facts should help inform this debate. 
   For instance, if we know the unborn can feel pain at 7 weeks, why is it such a struggle to convince Senators that stabbing a 6-month, fully developed and partially delivered baby with forceps, and extracting his or her brain is painfully wrong. It should be very easy to convince people that it is painful and that it is wrong. 
   I realize, however, that not everyone agrees with my view on abortion. Indeed, I recognize the American people remain divided on this issue. Where there is a consensus, we need to move forward to protect life. The measure being discussed today to end the cruel, brutal practice of partial-birth abortion presents such an opportunity where consensus exists. The American people agree that a procedure which takes an unborn child, one able to survive outside the womb, removes it substantially from the womb and then painfully kills it is so cruel, so inhumane, so barbaric as to be intolerable and that it should be illegal. Legislatures in more than 20 States have followed Congress' lead and passed laws outlawing this procedure. Two-thirds of the House of Representatives voted to overturn the President's second veto last year. When this Chamber voted, more than a dozen Democrat Senators joined us in attempting to override the veto. A consensus has formed. 
   Americans want this gruesome procedure eliminated. They should not be thwarted by the twisted science and moral confusion that has been argued in this Chamber.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Now more than ever we need to pass this legislation to make it clear that human life is too precious to permit legally sanctioned infanticide. As we as a nation confront the terrible violence in our schools, we in Congress need to embrace a culture that celebrates life, not a culture that celebrates convenience. The values at issue are too important to be lost in the legislative shuffle.  
   We will pass this legislation again this year. If, again, the President vetoes it, despite the debunking of the so-called medical evidence that he used to justify that action in the past, we will continue to vote on this issue of life and death until the voice of the American people is heard and the lives of these unborn children, who are painfully destroyed while they are substantially born, are respected. 
   I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to make comments on the Agriculture appropriations conference report. It is a bill which I think is very important for America's farmers and ranchers. Clearly, the agricultural community in America is in dire straits. Farmers need relief quickly. But the irony about this bill is that farmers are getting, in my judgment, shortchanged. They are getting short-term financial relief, but they have been robbed of good policy; that is, a policy to reform the unilateral embargoes of food and medicine that have kept our farmers from being able to sell their products around the world. 
   Before I get substantially into my remarks, I thank the Senator from Mississippi, the chairman of the agriculture appropriations subcommittee, for his support and vote to end unilateral food embargoes, and for his very mannerly handling of this issue on the floor and in the Senate-House conference. He has a strong record of supporting an end to the food embargoes. I know he recognizes the incredible groundswell of support for this policy change that is in the Congress and, more importantly, in the farm community. Senator COCHRAN is to be commended. I thank him. He has done an outstanding job. 
   Farmers in America are aware that the current U.S. embargoes tie their hands and give an advantage to Canada, Brazil, Europe, and South America, farmers from around the world, when competing against the United States. Current U.S. policy favors foreign farmers--not U.S. farmers. It is a tragedy that our own policies throw roadblocks between our farmers and the world marketplace so producers in other countries have a better opportunity to be more successful than producers in our country. 
   Make no mistake about it. The history of U.S. food embargoes is that they almost uniformly hurt only two parties: the American farmer and innocent people overseas. 
   Food embargoes generally don't succeed in changing other nations. They succeed in taking dollars out of our farmers' pockets and in putting dollars in the pockets of foreign farmers. They succeed in undermining our farmers' reputation as reliable suppliers in the world market. We understand that because farmers have talked to us. Farmers have come to me. I have met with them. Senator BOND and I have several times sat down together and discussed it with farmers in the last 3 or 4 months at various places. We were in the foothills of Missouri. We were in the central part of the State. We have been at various places around the State. They have helped me understand this issue more clearly than ever before. 
   A number of other Senators are very attuned to this. This is something that goes on on both sides of the aisle. This is not an issue that is defined by parties in this Congress. Senators HAGEL, BAUCUS, DODD, BROWNBACK, DORGAN, KERREY, along with myself and many others--you notice this is one of those things where you can go back and forth across the aisle as you name the Members of the Senate--have been working on a bill that would lift embargoes involving U.S. farm products. 
   I wish to recognize the fact that Senator LUGAR has for a long time been working on measures to do the same and is chairman of the Agriculture Committee in the Senate. 
   This understanding about the need to have markets where farmers can sell what they produce is a pretty substantial understanding. It is not partisan. We did not surprise anyone with this proposal. Americans have long agreed it is generally unwise for the United States to use food as a weapon. The weapon usually backfires and hurts us more than it hurts anyone else.  
   Congress has endorsed the values of the American people. Our job is to represent the values of the American people and not to allow a select few inside Washington, DC, to go behind closed doors and impose their values on America. I am here today to do what I was elected to do--to promote farm policies that reflect the values of the farm belt instead of caving in to the values of the beltway. 
   If Members listen to their farmers, they will most likely hear what I have been hearing. This is a letter from Kansas City, MO, signed by 10 people with a strong interest in this issue. Let me read a part of it:  
   We believe that this legislation--  
   that is the legislation to allow farmers to market their products to change the way we have embargoes imposed so we don't have the unilateral embargoes against food and medicine imposed by the President without Congress.  
   We believe that this legislation will help the United States sell its valuable farm products and medicines as well as help the receiver countries. 
   The President and Congress ought to review more carefully unilateral embargoes against any country. Withholding food and medicine is an affront against human rights as well as a politically foolish practice. Such sanctions have never toppled governments, but only serve to perpetuate hatred, hunger, and poverty among the ordinary citizens.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, not only do members of my constituency and citizens of Missouri write letters to me, but they write letters to the editor. They talk to the press and farm focus forums about the significance of lifting food embargoes. Senator BOND and I not only were in Columbia at one of these farm forums, but we were at the State fair. 
   I am reading from a newspaper article out of Sedalia, MO, entitled, ``Farmers Meet with Bond, Ashcroft at State Fair.'' 
   This is what some farmers said. This is what the article begins with. It includes quotes by farmers.  
   Some farmers who are worried by low prices and the recent lack of rain felt encouraged after talking with Missouri's two U.S. Senators about emergency relief and trade barriers. 
   ``I hope the relief comes soon,'' said Brent Sandidge, a hog farmer. ``[But] rather than always giving us immediate relief, help us so that we can live so that emergency money won't be needed.  
   That is what the hog farmer was saying. Give us the capacity to sell our products so emergency money won't always be needed.  
   One such long-range plan is Ashcroft's Food and Medicine for the World Act.......  
   The article continues, and then Brent, the hog farmer who was with us, said:  
   ......lifting embargoes makes sense. We need to use the agriculture in this country to feed the grave hunger of people around the world.  
   I am pleased to have had that article in the Sedalia paper. The bottom line is this: The final Agriculture appropriations conference report should have included the embargo reform that was overwhelmingly supported by American farmers and adopted by the Senate. Frankly, it is a great disappointment to me that the Agriculture conference report does not include reform for food embargoes. First of all, this reform, which we had included in the Senate version of the Agriculture bill, was a reform that would have required the President to collaborate with Congress and get approval before imposing any unilateral sanction that would embargo food or medicine. 
   The Senate approved that amendment by an overwhelming vote of 70-28. That included a majority of positive votes from both sides of the aisle--both Democrats and Republicans. This vote shows that not only do we have more than a majority, but 70 votes would be more than enough to invoke cloture, 
   if these votes remain committed, more than enough votes to even override a Presidential veto. 
   After the Senate 70-28 vote when the Agriculture appropriations bill went to the conference, the House conferees voted on a proposal to make the Senate reform even stronger. This is significant because it reflects the view of many of the House Members with whom I have talked that embargoes be brought to the House of Representatives for a straight up-or-down vote, and the proposal would receive the same kind of overwhelming support in the House that it received in the Senate. They were confident of that if voted on by the House. Also, eight Senate conferees to three favored keeping the Senate provisions along with the stronger House provisions. 
   It is a mystery that the House wanted this, the Senate wanted this, we voted 70-28 to have it, and then behind closed doors a decision was made to strip out the reform provision that received overwhelming bipartisan support in the Congress. It is something that the American farmers want, that will help sell American goods overseas, that will help reverse the currently depressed prices, that will help provide food and medicine to people all around the world, and a reform that would reverse the rather ridiculous policy in which America finds itself alone so often as a nation using food and medicine as a weapon of foreign policy. 
   A select few in Congress have tried to make the issue of embargoes on food an issue about Cuba. I reject this narrow interpretation. It is about the importance of consistent U.S. policy on food and medicine embargoes. Since Cuba is one of those countries that we sanction or embargo exports of wheat, rice, pork, and other vital farm products, let me address that. Does it really make sense for the United States not to sell food to Cuba when the entire rest of the world already does? I don't think so. Does it really make sense for the United States to deny food and medicine and thereby bolster Castro's anti-American distortions? 
   Let's hear from the countryside on this issue. Here is an e-mail I received from one of my constituents, Thomas Capuano, from Kirksville, MO:  
   Dear Senator ASHCROFT, I want you to know that I favor loosening the embargo on Cuba. The best way for understanding between our two peoples is by means of free markets, free exchange of ideas and goods and services, and freedom of movement.......

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Here is another e-mail received from Ms. Janelle Sharoni:  
   The blockade against Cuba has been going on for so many years we have nearly forgotten about the terrible suffering of the Cuban people and the total lack of any results to point to from this blockade. The blockade has not worked and has alienated us from other Latin Americans. 
   All this does is exempt food, agricultural supplies, medicine and medical supplies for the trade embargo. It does NOT indicate any change in American policy, just a change in how we deal with the poor and suffering.  
   That is a description of the Food and Medicine for the World Act.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I received many letters about this issue. Here is one from a constituent in St. Joseph, MO, Mr. Craig Drummond, who is the Drake University student body vice president. 
   I don't know why he went all the way to Iowa to get his education, but Drake is a fine institution. 
   He states it this way:  
   The United States is a country that was founded on the premise of freedom, democracy and sovereignty. We enact policies, laws and regulations that best exhibit the highest ideals of democracy and the American public. For the most part, we do a good job and function well as a powerful global leader. I am a proponent of democracy and capitalism and hold the values and ideas of the aforementioned paramount to any other country or government. The United States has problems and for the most part we are aware of these and have good people working to rectify our problems and wrongs. That is why this whole Cuba situation intrigues me so much. 
   Why does America continue to have an embargo against trade with Cuba? Why have we chosen to isolate Cuba and ourselves from each other?  
   I think the point here that ought to be made is a point that needs to be made over and over again. For food and medicine, we don't strengthen the regime; we strengthen the people. Strengthening oppressed people is what is fundamentally appropriate in terms of eventually allowing them to survive oppressive regimes.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Comments about lifting the food embargo come not just from the Midwest. An editorial from the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, August 16, 1999, states:  
   It clearly would be in America's best interest to expand trade in food and medicine to Cuba, for more reasons than one.  
   I continue to quote:  
   If nutrition and health-care conditions don't improve in Cuba under the easing or lifting of U.S. trade restrictions, Castro won't have the embargo to blame for his government's failures.  
   In other words, we provide Castro with an opportunity to blame America for hungry people, to blame America for sick people, as long as we embargo food and medicine. 
   Quite frankly, there is a ground swell of support to lift the food and medicine embargo on Cuba--and other countries. 
   An article from the Omaha World-Herald commends the cosponsor of this legislation, Senator CHUCK HAGEL of Nebraska, who has been such a leader in this respect. I will read from that article:  
   Sens Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., and John Ashcroft, R-Mo., added to the Senate's recent farm spending bill an amendment that would exempt most food and medical supplies from U.S. sanctions against foreign nations. 
   As an editorial in this space said on August 10, Cuba provides the closest example of why Hagel and Ashcroft have a good idea: Such sanctions usually harm only the people who deserve it least, and they pointlessly exclude U.S. farmers and pharmaceutical manufacturers from significant international markets.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Most people realize it is the good thing to do for our farmers and it is the right thing to do in terms of humanitarian interests of those abroad. That is why the Senate overwhelmingly approved this concept, and that is why it should have been retained in the conference report which provides relief for American farmers. 
   We provide financial relief, but we ignore the need for structural relief so that their market can be expanded. It is no secret that what happened to the appropriations bill for farmers has been construed by some as an affront to farmers. Missouri farmers are not duped; they are not fooled. They understand that while there is additional financial assistance being given out, they are still being deprived of their markets, and Missouri farmers want to be able to produce and to sell. That is what farming is all about. They are bewildered as to how their freedom to market, which had majority support from both sides of the aisle, could be stripped out of the bill. I will do everything I can to make sure they get the freedom to market we have been promising them for years; we must deliver. 
   Quite frankly, there is growing consideration of an idea that says we can't have Freedom to Farm if we don't have freedom to market. We have never given it a real chance to work. We have to give our farmers the chance to market what they produce as well as the freedom to be producers. 
   If what happened over the last 2 weeks on sanctions policy keeps up, I do not think we will be seeing this program work. We have to have both freedoms: The freedom to farm and the freedom to market; and who will be to blame but those who kept us from passing the freedom to market? 
   Our amendment, the Food and Medicine for the World Act, is designed to allow our farmers to market around the world and is designed to restructure the way in which agricultural embargoes, or food embargoes, would be imposed--if at all. That proposal would have put United States farmers on more competitive ground with the Canadians and more competitive ground with the Europeans and South Americans in world markets. It would have put money in the pockets of U.S. farmers--clear and simple; just a fact; there would have been money in the pockets of American farmers. 
   It is hard to believe we simply--we? I should not say ``we.'' From somewhere, in the dark of night in the conference committee, out goes that provision which had overwhelming support, I believe, in both Houses of the Congress. It would have restored the credibility of the Congress worldwide, across America, and would have restored our farmers' credibility worldwide as suppliers. 
   I will continue my efforts to win final approval for ending unilateral food and medicine embargoes. Next week the sponsors of the amendment, that was approved 70 to 28 and was added to the Agriculture appropriations bill, intend to introduce the embargo reform as a freestanding bill. We will bring it to the 
   Senate and the Congress. We will say to the Congress: This is not part of the Agriculture appropriations measure as it was before, but we want to present this to the Congress. I am grateful the majority leader of the Senate has made a commitment to me to bring the proposal back to the Senate floor for separate consideration this session. That is important to me. 
   I wanted the measure approved as part of the Agriculture appropriations bill and sent to the President for signature. It would have been easier. It certainly was an overwhelming consensus of this body and I believe an overwhelming consensus of the House. But if that can't be, then we try plan B. Plan B is to bring it up separately and get it passed through the Senate, get it passed through the House of Representatives, and sent to the President. 
   I thank the majority leader of the Senate who has made a commitment to bring the proposal back to the Senate floor for separate consideration. This debate will continue, therefore. 
   Let me reiterate a few points that are vital to the proposal we are advancing. The general framework is this. We do not make it impossible to have an embargo. We just say, before there can be an embargo, the Congress has to approve it. So we do not tie the hands of the President, but we ask him to shake hands with the Congress before you take this draconian, drastic step which hurts American farmers, before you have sanctions on food, fiber, and medicine. We will not allow the President, with the stroke of a pen, to damage the livelihood of American farmers or to cut off the subsistence of oppressed people around the world. It will require consultation with the Congress. 
   I want to make one thing as clear as I can. This is genuinely a proposal that supports the policy of helping our farmers and putting products which will eliminate suffering and hunger into the hands of those who need them most. This is not about shipping military equipment or even dual-use items--things that could be used in the military setting--to other countries. We want to keep those kinds of things out of the hands of tyrants. But we do not want to assist tyrants, or strengthen the hands of tyrants, by allowing them to blame America for hungry people who are oppressed or people who are ill in health, so that the tyrant can say: The reason you are ill and the reason we don't have good medicine is the United States of America won't allow you to have good health or won't sell us food. 
   Our approach helps us show support for the oppressed people who need to be strengthened in these countries, at the same time we send a message that the United States in no way will assist or endorse the activities of the rogue  leaders of these nations which threaten our interests. If these rogue leaders don't spend the money with the American farmers to buy food, that leaves them hard currency to buy weapons and destabilize countries around the world. We ought to hope they spend all their money on food for their people instead of weaponry they use either to repress people in their own regimes or destabilize neighboring countries. 
   Ending unilateral embargoes against sales of U.S. food and medicine is good, solid foreign policy, it is good farm policy, and it promotes U.S. interests around the world. In the past, we have imposed embargoes that have done exactly the opposite from what we intended. If we use food as a weapon, we have to be careful it doesn't backfire. Using food as a weapon has 
   really resulted in more backfiring than forward firing. We have actually enriched the people we were seeking to hurt, and we have hurt the people, the American farmers, who have been the producers of what has made this Nation the greatest nation on the face of the Earth, where hunger has been virtually abolished--or it should be. 
   Let me just give this example. It is a tragic example. It is not humorous, but it is almost funny because it backfired so badly. Everyone remembers the Soviet grain embargo in the 1970s. We canceled 17 million tons of high-priced exports from the United States. We told farmers: You cannot make those sales; we are not going to allow you to ship that grain to Russia. 
   Here is what happened. The Russians, having been relieved of their contractual obligation to buy what they wanted to buy, went into the world marketplace. Do you know what they did? They bought all the stuff which we refused to sell them, and they saved $250 million in the process. We really hurt the Russians with that one. Robert Kohlmeyer of ``World Perspectives'' brought that story to the committee as we had hearings on sanctions. I thought to myself, that gun backfired in a big way. The only people with powder burns, the only people suffering as a result of that volley, were American farmers and individuals in the production of American agriculture. 
   Our market reputation as a supplier in the world went down, and other people decided they would bring on land to be producers, in South America and other settings, so they could supply what we would refuse to supply. All of a sudden, we brought new competitors into the arena; we destroyed our reputation; we helped our enemy get $250 million he wouldn't otherwise have gotten, and we hurt American farmers. Seldom can a gun backfire so accurately in so many directions. I say seldom, but it is just generally so in the arena of embargoes. Our embargoes more often deny people who suffer under such regimes the food and medicine they need and desire rather than hurting the leaders in those countries. 
   America has been a nation that promotes freedom worldwide. We should continue to talk truthfully about political oppression in other countries. We should do so, though, without denying food and medicine to the oppressed people who need to be strengthened, not weakened. How can we ever expect to topple a regime by starving those who populate it? Our foreign policy interests should be to strengthen, not to weaken, those who could resist an oppressive regime. 
   We need to stop using food as a weapon against the innocent. It is not good foreign policy. It is failed foreign policy. That gun backfires. It is not working. It is hurting those abroad and is hurting those of us who are back home. In terms of market access for farmers, we can talk about the roadblocks that are laid down by foreign governments--and I am pretty distressed about those roadblocks. The Europeans have vast subsidies that make it hard for us to compete with them overseas. But let us also be aware we have to stop throwing roadblocks in the way of our own farmers here at home. We have built a solid brick wall in front of our own farmers. Simply, it is an impenetrable wall when it relates to embargoes and sanctions imposed unilaterally on food and medicine against a number of countries around the world. My message today to the 
   Congress is simply this: Tear down this wall we have built. 
   Let our farmers be free. Our food embargoes have failed. Our food embargoes are not effective. Food embargoes are not the way for us to win. That gun backfires. It is time to tear down this wall. And we will. Starting next week, we will do our best to bring this measure up as an independent, freestanding measure. 
   While I believe it is important to help our farmers in the Agriculture appropriations bill upon which we are going to be voting, that is a financial assist in the short term for a disastrous year, but we need the long-term structural reform that the hog farmer in Sedalia, Brett, came to me and said: We need the ability to market so we don't need to come back for financial assistance over and over again. Tear down this wall. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). Signed by the President on September 24, 1996, and submitted to the Senate approximately one year later, the CTBT bans all nuclear explosions for an unlimited duration. 
   Every member of the Senate would like to strengthen the national security of the United States. Every member of the Senate would like to leave this country more safe and secure. There are time-honored principles which undergrid genuine security, however. As George Washington stated over two centuries ago, ``There is nothing so likely to produce peace as to be well prepared to meet an enemy.'' Washington believed that if we wanted peace, we must be prepared to defend our country. 
   The CTBT is not based on the national security principles of Washington or any other President who used strength and preparedness to protect our way of life and advance liberty around the globe. This treaty is based on an illusion of arms control, dependent on the unverifiable good will of signatory nations--some of which are openly hostile to the United States. The CTBT will do nothing to stop determined states from developing nuclear weapons and will degrade the readiness of the U.S. nuclear stockpile. The U.S. nuclear arsenal is still the most powerful deterrent to aggression against the United States, but this treaty would place the reliability of that arsenal in question. 
   Is such a step worth the risk? What does the CTBT give us in return? Is the treaty really the powerful weapon in the war against proliferation that the Administration claims? Several critical deficiencies of the CTBT make this treaty a genuine threat to U.S. national security. 
   First, the monitoring system of the treaty will not be able to detect many nuclear tests. The International Monitoring System (IMS) of the CTBT is designed to detect nuclear blasts greater  than one kiloton, but tests with a smaller blast yield may be used to validate or advance nuclear weapons designs. Tests larger than one kiloton can be masked through certain testing techniques. By testing underground, for example, the blast yield from a nuclear test can be reduced by a factor of 70. The bottom line is that countries will be able to continue testing under this treaty and not be detected. 
   The unverifiability of the CTBT was highlighted by the Washington Post on October 3, 1999. In an article entitled ``CIA Unable to Precisely Track Testing,'' Roberto Suro writes that ``the Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that it cannot monitor low-level nuclear tests by Russia precisely enough to ensure compliance with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.....'' Twice last month, Russia may have conducted nuclear tests, but the CIA was unable to make a determination, according the Post article. 
   Senator JOHN WARNER, the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, is quoted in the Post article concerning a broader pattern of Russian deception with regard to nuclear testing. According to a military assessment mentioned in the Post, Russia has conducted repeated tests over the past 18 months to develop a low-yield nuclear weapon to counter U.S. superiority in precision guided munitions. 
   Such behavior reinforces the central point that proponents of the CTBT seem to miss in this debate. When nations have to choose between the communal bliss of international disarmament or pursuing their national interest, they follow their national interest. Countries such as Russia have the best of both worlds with an unverifiable treaty like the CTBT: Russia can continue to test without being caught and the U.S. nuclear arsenal cannot be maintained or modernized and eventually deteriorates over time. 
   A second critical problem with the CTBT is that countries do not have to test to develop nuclear weapons. The case of India and Pakistan provides perhaps the best example that a ban on nuclear testing can be irrelevant. Pakistan developed nuclear explosive devices without any detectable testing, and India advanced its nuclear program without testing for twenty-five years. 
   Proliferation in South Asia also lends itself to a broader discussion of this Administration's nonproliferation record. The Administration's rhetoric on the CTBT has been strong in recent weeks, but has the Administration always been as committed to stop proliferation? 
   The case of Pakistan is particularly illustrative of this Administration's flawed approach to nonproliferation and arms control. In an unusually candid report in 1997, the CIA confirmed China's role as the ``principal supplier'' of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program. Although the Administration has been careful to use milder language in subsequent proliferation reports, China is suspected of continuing such assistance. Rather than take consistent steps to punish Chinese proliferation, however, the Administration is pushing a treaty to stop nuclear testing--testing which is not needed for the development of nuclear weapons in the first place. 
   This Administration would have more credibility in the area of nonproliferation if it had been taking aggressive steps to punish proliferators and defend America's interests over the last seven years. When China transfers complete M-11 missiles to Pakistan, 
   this Administration turns a blind eye. When China is identified by the CIA in 1997 as the ``..... the most significant supplier of WMD-related goods and technology to foreign countries,'' the Administration rewards China with a nuclear cooperation agreement in 1998. 
   These severe lapses in U.S. nonproliferation policy cannot be covered over with the parchment of another unverifiable arms control treaty. 
   A third problem with the CTBT is that it places the reliability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal at risk. While other countries can develop simple nuclear weapons without testing, such tests are critically important for the maintenance and modernization of highly sophisticated U.S. nuclear weapons. In that it forbids testing essential to ensure the readiness of the U.S. stockpile, the CTBT is really a back door to nuclear disarmament. The preamble of the CTBT itself states that the prohibition on nuclear testing is ``a meaningful step in the realization of a systematic process to achieve nuclear disarmament .....'' 
   Proponents of the CTBT argue that we have the technology and expertise to ensure the readiness of our nuclear arsenal through the Stockpile Stewardship Program. The truth of the matter is that only testing can ensure that our nuclear weapons are being maintained, not computer modeling and careful archiving of past test results. As Dr. Robert Barker, a strategic nuclear weapons designer and principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense on all nuclear weapons matters from 1986-92, stated, ``..... sustained nuclear testing ..... is the only demonstrated way of maintaining a safe and reliable nuclear deterrent.'' 
   Dr. James Schlesinger, a former Secretary of the Defense and Energy Departments, is one of the most competent experts to speak on the national security implications of the CTBT and the Stockpile Stewardship Program. His comments on the Stockpile Stewardship Program should be heeded by every Senator. In testimony before Congress, Dr. Schlesinger stated that the erosion of confidence in our nuclear stockpile would be substantial over several decades. Dr. Schlesinger states that ``In a decade or so, we will be beyond the expected shelf life of the weapons in our nuclear arsenals, which was expected to be some 20 years.'' 
   The real effect of the CTBT, then, is not to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, for less developed countries can develop simple nuclear weapons without testing and countries like Russia and China can test without being detected. The real effect of the CTBT will be to degrade the U.S. nuclear arsenal, dependent on periodic testing to ensure readiness. 
   Modernization and development of new weapons systems, also dependent on testing, will be precluded. The need to modernize and develop new nuclear weapons should not be discounted. New weapons for new missions, changes in delivery systems and platforms, and improved safety devices all require testing to ensure that design modifications will and be effective. In supporting this treaty, the President is saying that regardless of the future threats the United States may face, we will surrender our ability to sustain a potent and effective nuclear deterrent. Mr. President, such shortsighted policies which leave America less secure are completely unacceptable and should be rejected. 
   It is difficult for me to understand how a President who determines that ``the maintenance of a safe and reliable nuclear stockpile to be a supreme national interest of the United States'' can support the CTBT, a treaty which could jeopardize the entire nuclear arsenal within years. 
   Those who favor the CTBT argue that the treaty will create an international norm against the development of nuclear weapons. If the United States will take the lead, advocates for the treaty state, then other countries will see our good intentions and follow our example. 
   Mr. President, moral suasion carries little weight with countries like North Korea, Iran, and Iraq. Moral suasion means little more to Russia, China, Pakistan, and India. These countries follow their security interests, not the illusory arms control agenda of another international bureaucracy. 
   It is folly to degrade the U.S. nuclear deterrent through a treaty that has no corollary security benefits. I am not opposed to treaties and norms which seek to reduce the potential for international conflict, but arms control treaties which are not verifiable leave the United States in a more dangerous position. When we can trust but not verify, the better path is not to place ourselves in a position where our trust can be broken, particularly when the security of the American people is at stake. 
   I thank the Chair for the opportunity to address this important matter and I urge my colleagues to oppose the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I took great interest in the statement that Senator from Florida (Mr. GRAHAM) made expressing his displeasure that this legislation contains  a provision--Section 214--halting implementation of the Medicare Prepaid Competitive Pricing Demonstration Project both in Arizona and in the Kansas City metropolitan area. 
   The Senator from Florida claimed that the inclusion of this provision was accomplished by HMOs. I would like to take this opportunity to point out to him that it was Medicare beneficiaries and doctors who alerted me to their grave concerns that the project would create huge patient disruption in the Kansas City area.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. After hearing from a number of doctors and patients in my State over the past few months, I concluded that Kansas City is an inappropriate location for this project and that it will jeopardize the health care benefits that seniors currently enjoy in the area. I believe that halting this project is necessary to protect the health care of senior citizens and to assure that Medicare beneficiaries continue to have access to excellent health care at prices they can afford. HCFA's project is a clear and present danger to the health and well-being of my constituents. 
   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created the Medicare Prepaid Competitive Pricing Demonstration Project to use competitive bidding among Medicare HMOs. Through the appointment of a Competitive Pricing Advisory Committee, HCFA was to select demonstration sites around the nation. Kansas City was one of the selected cities. 
   As I understand it, the intent of the project was to bring greater competition to the Medicare managed care market, to address concerns that Medicare HMO reimbursement rates in some areas are too high, to expand benefits for Medicare HMO enrollees, and to restrain the cost of Medicare to the taxpayers. When considering these factors, it is clear that the Kansas City metropolitan area is not an appropriate choice for this demonstration. 
   First, managed care competition in the Kansas City market is already vigorous, with six managed care companies currently offering Medicare HMOs in the area. Participation in Medicare HMOs is also high: As of July 1 of this year, nearly 23% of Medicare recipients in the Kansas City metropolitan area were in Medicare+Choice plans--approximately 50,000 of 230,000 total beneficiaries. Nationally, only 17% of Medicare recipients are enrolled in such plans. 
   Second, Medicare managed care payments in the Kansas City area are below the national average. According to a recent analysis by the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress, 1999 payment rates per Medicare+Choice enrollee in Kansas City are $511, while the national rate is $541. Documents provided to me by HCFA also demonstrate that 75 other cities had a higher adjusted average per capita cost (AAPCC) rate for 1997 than Kansas City. I wonder why Kansas City was chosen for this experiment, when so many other cities have higher payment rates. 
   Third, I am concerned that this demonstration project will not provide expanded benefits to Medicare HMO enrollees, but will instead cause severe disruption of Medicare services. It is important to note that customer dissatisfaction is low in current Medicare managed care plans in the Kansas City area. Only one in twelve seniors disenrolls from Medicare HMOs each year. 
   Currently, 33,000, or 66% of the seniors in Medicare managed care plans in the Kansas City area do not pay any premium. Under the bidding process set up by CPAC for the demonstration, a plan that bids above the enrollment-weighted median--which becomes the reimbursement rate for all plans--will be forced to charge seniors a premium to make up the difference between the plan's bid and the reimbursement rate paid by the government. In essence, the penalty for a high bid will be imposed upon seniors. Under this scenario, it is virtually assured that some seniors who pay no premium today will be required to start paying one. 
   Moreover, seniors who cannot afford to pay a premium would be forced to abandon their regular doctor when it becomes necessary to change plans. Both individual doctors as well as the Metropolitan Medical Society of Greater Kansas City have warned that the demonstration could cause extreme disruption of beneficiaries away from current doctor-patient relationships. 
   I have also heard concerns that both health plans and physicians may withdraw from the Medicare program if reimbursements under the demonstration project prove financially untenable. As a result, Medicare beneficiaries may be left with fewer choices in care. This would be intolerable. I question why we should implement a project that will create more risk and uncertainty for my State's seniors, who are already satisfied with what they have. 
   Finally, I question how the demonstration project would be able to provide us with useful information on how to improve the Medicare program if fee-for-service plans--which are generally the most expensive Medicare option--are not included in the project. In its January 6, 1999 Design Report, the Competitive Pricing Advisory Committee expressed the judgment that the exclusion of fee-for-service might ``limit HCFA's ability (a) to measure the impact of competitive pricing and (b) to generalize demonstration results to the entire Medicare program.'' 
   After studying this issue, I concluded that implementation of the Medicare Managed Care Demonstration Project in the Kansas City metropolitan area should be halted immediately. HCFA must not be allowed to risk the ability of my State's seniors to continue to receive high quality health care at affordable costs. I have been working closely with my Senate colleagues from Missouri and Kansas to protect our Kansas City area seniors from the dangers and uncertainty of a planned federal experiment with their health care arrangements. 
   So, I want to make clear to my colleague from Florida that patients and doctors speaking on behalf of their patients were the ones who approached me and asked for my assistance in stopping the Medicare managed care demonstration project in the Kansas City area. I heard from a number of individual doctors, as well as medical societies in the State, expressing grave concerns about the project. The President of the Metropolitan Medical Society of Greater Kansas City even made the prediction that the unintended risk of the demonstration ``could dictate 100% disruption of beneficiaries away from their current relationships'' with their doctors. Clearly, this is unacceptable. 
   Inclusion, Mr. President, I would like to quote from some of the letters I received from the seniors themselves, voicing their opposition to the Medicare managed care demonstration project coming to their area.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for affording me this opportunity to make some remarks regarding the vote on the nomination of Ronnie White. 
   Yesterday, in accordance with the unanimous consent agreement entered into last week, we set aside substantially over an hour to debate not only the White nomination but a number of other nominations which came before the Senate today. I was here for that debate, I engaged in that debate, and I outlined my opposition to Judge White, not my opposition based on anything personal or based on my distaste in any way for the judge, but based on my real reservations about his record as it relates to law enforcement. 
   After the conclusion of the vote today, there were a number of individuals who secured integrals of time to speak about that nomination and about that vote and raised questions that more properly should have been raised in the debate, and, secondly, deserve a response. So I come to respond in that respect. 
   I want to explain why I believe Judge White should not have been confirmed, and I believe the Senate acted favorably and appropriately in protecting the strong concerns raised by law enforcement officials. 
   The National Sheriffs Association expressed their very serious opposition to the nomination of Judge White. The Missouri Federation of Chiefs of Police expressed their opposition. The Missouri Sheriffs Association raised strong concerns and asked for a very serious consideration. In my conferences with law enforcement officials, prosecutors and judges, they raised serious concerns; so that when those who come to the floor today talk about this nomination in a context that is personal rather than professional and is political rather than substantive, I think they miss the point. 
   There are very serious matters addressed in his record that deserve the attention of the Senate and which, once having been reviewed by Members of the Senate, would lead Senators to the conclusion that, indeed, the Senate did the right thing. 
   Judge White's sole dissent in the Missouri v. Johnson, a brutal cop killer, an individual who killed three law enforcement officials over several hours, holding a small town in Missouri in a terrified condition, that opinion which sought to create new ground for allowing convicted killers who had the death  penalty ordered in their respect, allowing them new ground for new trials, and the like, is something that ought to trouble us. We do not need judges with a tremendous bent toward criminal activity or with a bent toward excusing or providing second chances or opportunities for those who have been accused in those situations. 
   Missouri v. Kinder is another case where he was the sole dissenter, a case of murder and assault, murder with a lead pipe, the defendant was seen leaving the scene of the crime with the lead pipe and DNA evidence confirming the presence of the defendant with the person murdered. 
   The judge in that case wrote a dissent saying that the case was contaminated by a racial bias of the trial judge because the trial judge had indicated that he opposed affirmative action and had switched parties based on that. 
   Another case, Missouri v. Damask, a drug checkpoint case. The sole dissent in the case was from Judge White who would have expanded substantially the rights of defendants to object to searches and seizures. 
   I believe that law enforcement officials had an appropriate, valid, reasonable concern. That concern was appropriately recognized and reflected in the vote of the Senate. Not only Missouri needs judges, but the entire country needs judges whose law enforcement experience is such that it sends a signal that they are reliable and will support appropriate law enforcement. 
   I am grateful to have had this opportunity. No time was 
   expected for debate on this issue today, and as an individual who was involved in this matter, I am pleased to have had this opportunity. I thank the Senate. I thank the Senator from Arizona for helping make this time available to me. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of Judge Ronnie White to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. 
   Confirming judges is serious business. People we put into these Federal judgeships are there for life, removed only with great difficulty, as is evidenced by the fact that removals have been extremely rare. 
   There is enormous power on the Federal bench. Most of us have seen things happen through judges that could never have gotten through the House or Senate. 
   Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist Paper No. 78, put it this way:  
   If [judges] should be disposed to exercise will instead of judgment, the consequence would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body.  
   Alexander Hamilton, at the beginning of this Nation, knew just how important it was for us to look carefully at those who would be nominated for and confirmed to serve as judges. 
   A judge who substitutes his will or her will for the legislative will, by displacing the legislative intent in enlarging the Constitution or amending it by saying, it is an evolutionary document and I am going to say now it has evolved to this state or that state, as opposed to an earlier state--that kind of judge is involved in what I call ``judicial activism.'' Judicial activism is simply the substitution of one's personal politics instead of the legislative will as expressed in our documents of the Constitution or in the law. 
   At no other place in our Republic do voters have virtually no recourse. This is an important thing for us to consider as we evaluate judges and we seek to determine whether or not their confirmation would be appropriate. 
   So as it relates to Judge Ronnie White, who serves now as a supreme court judge in the State of Missouri, upon his nomination I began to undertake a review of his opinions, and especially those circumstances and dissents where, as a judge on the Missouri Supreme Court, Judge White would have sought to change or otherwise extend or amend the law as it related to a variety of matters, especially in the area of criminal law. I also heeded carefully his answers during his confirmation  hearing and his answers to followup questions. 
   I believe Judge White's opinions have been and, if confirmed, his opinions on the Federal bench will continue to be procriminal and activist, with a slant toward criminals and defendants against prosecutors and the culture in terms of maintaining order; he will use his lifetime appointment to push law in a procriminal direction, consistent with his own personal political agenda, rather than defer to the legislative will of the people and interpret the law rather than expand it or redirect the law. 
   I believe the law should be interpreted as written, as intended by the legislature, not as amended or expanded by the courts. I believe Judge White will, as Alexander Hamilton so aptly described in Federalist 78, improperly ``exercise will instead of judgment.'' This is particularly true in the area of criminal law. 
   I am not alone in this view. Judge White's nomination has sparked strong concerns from a large number of Missouri law enforcement officials. Seventy-seven of the 114 sheriffs in the State of Missouri have decided to call our attention to Judge White's record in the criminal law. I do not take lightly the fact that 77 of these law enforcement, ground-zero sheriffs--people who actually are involved in making the arrests and apprehending those who have broken the law--would ask us to look very carefully at this nominee. They cite specific opinions he has written and say these are the kinds of opinions that give them great pause. 
   Anyone who knows something about Missouri's political system knows that 77 out of 114 sheriffs would be a bipartisan delegation. As a matter of fact, over 70 percent of all the public officials in Missouri who are nominated and elected are Democrats. So you have 77 of the 114 sheriffs of Missouri on record saying: Look carefully. Evaluate very carefully this nominee to the federal bench. 
   The Missouri Federation of Police Chiefs, an organization of police chiefs that spreads all across the State of Missouri, has indicated to us that we ought to tread very lightly here. As a matter of fact, they express real shock and dismay at the nomination. Prosecutors have contacted me with their public letters. And, frankly, other judges in the State have suggested to me I should think and consider very carefully whether or not we 
   proceed in this matter. 
   The letter from the Missouri Federation of Police Chiefs is very direct. It says:  
   We want to go on record with your offices as being opposed to his nomination and hope you will vote against him.  
   I want to express that the concern about Judge Ronnie White is far broader than some of us in the Senate; it goes to a majority of the sheriffs in the State, with an official letter of expression from the Missouri Federation of Police Chiefs. There are prosecutors who have come to me and asked me to think very carefully about the qualifications and the philosophy expressed by this nominee. 
   This opposition stems largely from Judge White's opinions in capital murder cases. These opinions, and particularly his dissents, reflect a serious bias against a willingness to impose the death penalty. 
   Judge White has been more liberal on the death penalty during his tenure than any other judge on the Missouri Supreme Court. He has dissented in death penalty cases more than any other judge during his tenure. He has written or joined in three times as many dissents in death penalty cases, and apparently it is unimportant how gruesome or egregious the facts or how clear the evidence of guilt. He has been very willing to say: We should seek, at every turn, in some of these cases to provide an additional opportunity for an individual to escape punishment. 
   This bias is especially troubling to me because, if confirmed, Judge White will have the power to review the death penalty decisions of the Missouri Supreme Court on habeas corpus. In the seat of district court, Judge White's sole dissents are transformed into a veto power over the judicial system of the State of Missouri. I do not think that should happen. 
   Let me give you an example of Judge White's sole dissent in the highly publicized case of Missouri v. Johnson. 
   James R. Johnson was a brutal cop killer. He went on a shooting rampage in a small town called Carolina, MO. It sent shock waves across the entire State in 1991--during the time I had the privilege to serve as Governor of the State. At that time, James Johnson stalked and killed a sheriff, two sheriff's deputies, and Pamela Jones, a sheriff's wife. 
   Johnson first shot a deputy who had responded to a call about a domestic dispute at Johnson's house. He shot the deputy in the back and then walked over, as the deputy lay on the ground, and shot him in the forehead, killing him. 
   Johnson then reloaded his car with guns and drove to the local sheriff's home. There the sheriff's wife, Pamela Jones, was having a Christmas party. Johnson fired a rifle repeatedly through the window, hitting Mrs. Jones five times. Mrs. Jones died of those wounds in her home in front of her family. 
   Then Johnson went to another deputy sheriff's home and shot him through a window as the deputy spoke on the phone. That deputy was lucky and survived. 
   Johnson then went to the sheriff's office, where other law enforcement officers had assembled to try to address the ongoing rampage that was terrorizing the town. Johnson lay in wait until officers left the meeting and then opened fire on them, killing one officer. 
   Then as another officer arrived on the scene in her car, Johnson shot and killed her. It was then that Johnson fled to the house of an elderly woman who he held hostage for 24 hours. She eventually convinced Johnson to release her, and she notified the authorities who apprehended Johnson. He was tried and convicted on four counts of first degree murder and given four death sentences, convicted on all counts, received four separate death sentences. In a sole dissent urging a lower legal standard so that this convicted multiple cop killer would be allowed a second bite at the apple to convince a different jury that he was not guilty, Ronnie White sought to give James Johnson another chance. 
   Sheriff Jones, obviously, opposes this nomination. He is urging law enforcement officers to oppose it because he believes there is a pattern of these kinds of decisions in the opinions and dissents of Judge White. He believes there is a pattern of procriminal opinions, and I think if one looks carefully, one might see that pattern. 
   Judge White was also the sole dissenter in a case called Missouri v. Kinder. In that case, the defendant raped and beat a woman to death with a lead pipe. White voted to grant the defendant a new trial, despite clear evidence of guilt, including eyewitness testimony that Kinder was seen leaving the scene of the crime at the time of the murder with a pipe in his hand, and genetic material was found with the victim. White dissented based on the alleged racial bias of the judge, which he urged was made evident by a press release the judge had issued to explain his change in party affiliation. The judge changed parties at sometime prior to this case, and the judge, in explaining his change of party, said he was opposed to affirmative action, discriminating in favor of one race over another race. He left the one party he was in because he disagreed with their position on affirmative action. That was the only basis for Judge White to provide a new opportunity for this individual to get a second bite at the apple, not the evidence about his conduct, the genetic material, or the eyewitness testimony. 
   Judge White's procriminal jurisprudence is not limited to murder cases. It extends to drug cases as well. In the case of Missouri v. Damask, Judge White's sole dissent in a drug and weapons seizure case, I think, reveals this same tendency on the part of this judge to rule in favor of criminal defendants and the accused in a procriminal matter and procriminal manner. 
   This was a case, Missouri v. Damask, about a drug checkpoint set up by the Missouri State police. The State police had erected a traffic sign on the highway in the middle of the night indicating ``drug checkpoint ahead.'' The sign was placed just before a remote exit, one which only local residents would have cause to use. Those seeking  to avoid the ``drug checkpoint'' by exiting met with a real drug checkpoint at the top of the exit ramp. There were no gas stations, no restaurants or facilities at that exit. Motorists exiting at that exit were stopped and asked why they exited. If police were able to determine from their answers that they were suitably suspicious to warrant a search, they searched their cars. It was a very successful program, netting numerous arrests. 
   The Missouri Supreme Court upheld the practice as a reasonable search and seizure under the fourth amendment, consistent with many rulings of our Federal courts interpreting the fourth amendment. 
   Judge White was the sole dissenter in an opinion that seemed less concerned with the established fourth amendment precedent than with whether the search was intimidating. Judge White's opinion would have hamstrung this effective tool in the war on drugs.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Utah. 
   It is these opinions and other opinions like them that have generated the concern in the Missouri law enforcement community about Judge White and have caused me to conclude that I must oppose his confirmation. It doesn't mean I oppose his coming to the floor. I am entirely willing to let the Senate express itself in this respect. But I urge my fellow Senators to consider whether we should sanction the life appointment to the responsibility of a Federal district court judge for one who has earned a vote of no confidence from so many in the law enforcement community in the State in which he resides. Many of my fellow Senators on the Judiciary Committee determined we should not and voted against his nomination. 
   I ask my fellow Senators to review Judge White's record carefully. Keep in mind that he will not only sit for life, but he will still have occasion to vote on death penalty cases reviewed by the Missouri Supreme Court. 
   Again, as a district judge, he will be able to hear habeas corpus petitions challenging death sentences that have been upheld by the Missouri Supreme Court; only, as a district judge, his sole dissenting vote will be enough to reverse a unanimous opinion by the Missouri Supreme Court. He will have a veto over the Missouri Supreme Court in death penalty cases. And based on Judge White's track record, this is not a situation that the law-abiding citizens of Missouri should have to endure. 
   As I conclude my remarks, I will read some of the text of communications I have received concerning this nominee. Sheriff Kenny Jones, whose wife was murdered by James Johnson, put it this way: Every law enforcement and every law-abiding citizen needs judges who will enforce the law without fear or favor. As law enforcement officers, we need judges who will back us up and not go looking for outrageous technicalities so a criminal can get off. We don't need a judge such as Ronnie White on the Federal court bench. 
   I quote again from another paragraph: The Johnson case isn't the only antideath penalty ruling by Judge White. He has voted against capital punishment more than any other judge on the court. I believe there is a pattern here. To me, Ronnie White is clearly the wrong person to entrust with the tremendous power of a Federal judge who serves for life. 
   A letter from a prosecutor: Judge White's record is unmistakably antilaw enforcement, and we believe his nomination should be defeated. His rulings and dissenting opinions on capital cases and on fourth amendment issues should be disqualifying factors when considering his nomination. 
   A letter from the Missouri Sheriffs Association: Attached please find a copy of the dissenting opinion rendered by Missouri Supreme Court Judge Ronnie White in the case of State of Missouri v. James R. Johnson. 
   Then a recitation of how James Johnson murdered Pam Jones, the wife of the Moniteau County sheriff, Kenny Jones. And then: As per attached, the Missouri Sheriffs strongly encourage you to consider this dissenting opinion in the nomination of Judge Ronnie White to be a U.S. district court judge.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I think I can go to the question here that I think the Senator is driving at. I will be happy to do that. The judges that the Senator from Vermont has named have served a variety of tenures, far in excess of the tenure of Judge White. 
   The clear fact is that, during his tenure, he has far more frequently dissented in capital cases than any other judge. He has, I believe, participated in 3 times as many dissents as any other judge. To try to compare a list of dissents or items from other judges from other timeframes, longer intervals, and a variety of different facts, with the tenure that Judge Ronnie White has served is like comparing apples and oranges. And the numerics thereof, without that additional aspect of the situation being revealed, may appear to cause a conclusion that would be different. 
   With that in mind, if you will think carefully about what I said, I believe I thought carefully when I said ``Judge White's record during his tenure''; that is what you have to be able to compare, judges during the same interval of time. With that in mind, during that same interval of time, he has been the champion of those dissenting in death penalty cases and has dissented in ways which, very frankly, have occasioned an outcry from the law enforcement community in Missouri. None of the other judges that I know of have been the recipients of that kind of outcry. 
   There is one final point that I will make. Those are other notable judges and they have records and serve on the Missouri Supreme Court. They are not persons against whom the law enforcement community has raised issues. But they are also not persons who have been nominated for service on the U.S. District Court, a court which could set aside the verdicts of the Missouri Supreme Court in habeas corpus cases. So while I think those particular judges are important--and if they are nominated for the Federal Court, I think we ought to look carefully at their work product. 
   So there are two points to be made here. One, the relevance of the numbers is only relevant in the context of the interval. To suggest that the numbers are out there, without defining the interval, would be inappropriate and misleading. So I would not do that. 
   Secondly, I think the relevance of a record that is unsatisfactory is directly appropriate to the judge who has been nominated. So we are not here to talk about other judges so much as we are to talk about whether or not Ronnie White ought to be confirmed as a member of the U.S. District Court. In my judgment, the law enforcement community in Missouri has expressed serious reservations about his lean toward defendants, and I think we should not vote to confirm him. I urge my colleagues not to vote to confirm Judge White, based on this understanding of the Missouri law enforcement community and a reading of his judicial papers. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I will try to say what I have to say in less than 10 minutes, especially because of my regard for my esteemed colleague from the State of Connecticut, who I see has entered the Chamber. 
   I appreciate the intensity and commitment of the Senator from Nebraska. He is correct; we do not have on the drawing board a long-term remediation for the long-term problems of Social Security. But if we just spend and spend and spend so we continue to elevate the debt of the United States rather than curtail the spending by not spending the Social Security surplus, we are going to make it more difficult, when the time comes, to pay for the Social Security benefits for which we are committed to pay. 
   So I think it is important not to spend Social Security surpluses to expand Government and to make Government more and more committed and deeper and deeper in debt. It is a major benefit to the future of this country if we decide to refrain from spending Social Security surpluses, which will allow us to protect the integrity, not only of Social Security, on a more persistent basis, but certainly to protect the integrity of the finances of this Government so when the time comes for us to make payments, we will have the fiscal integrity to do so. 
   I know we are in morning business, but particularly today I rise to comment on and to support the Nickles amendment to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. I support the amendment because it puts the Senate on record demanding we protect the Social Security trust fund from being raided to pay for other Government spending. The less we go into debt for other Government spending, the more likely we are to be able to honor the claims of Social Security. 
   So the theft of Social Security funds this year must stop. We should stop spending as if Social Security were a funding resource for all kinds of other spending programs. I am concerned the Labor-HHS bill will result in the Senate's completion of all 13 appropriations bills and, as a result, perhaps take us into the Social Security trust fund. 
   Some estimates have been as high as $5 billion. I would work to delay the bill if I did not have assurances from the majority leader that the conference reports will not touch the Social Security surplus, even if Senate appropriations have, that the entirety of the package of bills we send to the President after negotiation with the House will not touch the Social Security trust fund. 
   The majority leader has worked tirelessly to protect the Social Security trust fund. I commend him for it, and I appreciate his ongoing effort. 
   Furthermore, the Congressional Budget Office has stated in a letter to Speaker HASTERT that the House plan to spend $592.1 billion will not touch the Social Security trust fund. 
   If we do dip into the Social Security trust fund this year, it would erase all the hard work we have undertaken to protect Social Security. 
   In January, President Clinton proposed bleeding $158 billion out of Social Security surpluses over the next 5 years. This Congress objected to President Clinton's proposal, and I am glad to say that the Congress got the President to change his mind and to take far less out of the Social Security surpluses over that 5-year period of time. I wish I could say that he had agreed to take none, and sometimes he represents it that way. 
   In the President's midsession review of the budget process, he said that Social Security surpluses should be spent for Social Security, period. That is right. That is the Social Security lockbox philosophy. Unfortunately, his new budget still took $30 billion out of Social Security over the next 10 years, but that is a lot better than $158 billion. I commend the President for moving so aggressively in the direction of the Congress. 
   Still the President's midsession review, while it is a vast improvement, and Congress has succeeded in moving him as far as he has moved, it is not far enough. We need to work throughout this year to demonstrate our commitment to protect every single penny of the Social Security trust fund. 
   In April, we passed a budget resolution that does not spend 1 dime or 1 cent of the Social Security trust fund surplus. In addition to protecting the Social Security surplus, the budget resolution sticks to the spending caps from the 1997 balanced budget agreement. It cuts taxes and increases spending on education and defense. 
   In addition to ordering our spending priorities correctly, the budget resolution contained a majority point of order preventing the use of Social Security surpluses for non-Social Security purposes. The Senate voted unanimously in favor of this point of order. I had the privilege of sponsoring this particular provision, and since that point, the Congress has continued along its responsible spending path and has also repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to the Social Security lockbox concept, which is to limit Government spending to the revenues designed for Government spending, and not to have general Government spending come out of the revenues designed to provide for the retirements of America's workers. 
   The House of Representatives passed the Herger bill which created a supermajority point of order of protecting Social Security. 
   These actions demonstrate a strong commitment and dedication to protecting every dollar of the projected Social Security surplus to shoring up Social Security, making sure we 
   treat it with integrity. 
   In addition, a majority of Senators have repeatedly voted for the Abraham-Domenici-Ashcroft Social Security lockbox provision. Unfortunately, the lockbox, which was approved by the House, has been endorsed by the President, and a majority of the Senate has been held hostage in the Senate by those on the other side of the aisle. 
   Despite this setback, we have made great progress in protecting Social Security, the integrity of the fund, and limiting the kind of spending that would jeopardize our capacity to make good on our commitments at some date when Social Security needs to call upon us. 
   The most important thing we can do right now is demonstrate our commitment to protecting every cent of Social Security resources to make sure they are available for Social Security and to make sure they are not spent on the operations of Government generally. This is a plan that we have agreed to under the budget resolution. We promised the American people that Social Security surpluses will be reserved for Social Security, and now is the time when we are testing that resolve. 
   Last year, when faced with this test, Congress failed, agreeing to an omnibus appropriations bill that raided--and I think that is the right word--$21 billion from our retirement security fund. I voted against the bill but was unable to prevent the raid by doing so. 
   This year, we have all been committed to completing all our spending bills on time and avoiding the omnibus spending train wreck such as we saw in last year's $21 billion raid. 
   I approve of this plan, but a necessary element of the plan is that Congress not spend resources on operating Government that were destined to and designed to support the Social Security trust fund. 
   The Nickles amendment would put us on record stating we categorically oppose a raid on our retirement system and will support spending cuts to let us meet that goal. As I said, according to unofficial Budget Committee estimates, the Congress is now poised to spend as much as $5 billion out of the Social Security trust fund. If that is the case, I will vote against any plan that would do so. We must avoid filching resources from the Social Security trust fund to support the operations of Government.  
   This spending bill, the Labor-HHS fiscal year 2000 appropriations bill, is the last of the 13 appropriations bills to reach the floor. It is also the largest of the nondefense discretionary appropriations bills. If the estimates about this year's spending that I have referred to are correct, we are going to dip into Social Security, and this is the bill that will push us over the edge. For this reason, I commend Senator NICKLES for bringing up this amendment on this bill at this time. 
   Now is the time for us to stand up and say we will not support taking any money out of the Social Security trust fund to finance the operations of Government. Making sure that Social Security funds do not go for anything other than Social Security is essential to the protection of long-term Social Security integrity. 
   Social Security is expected to meet all of its obligations until the year 2034--until then. Starting in 2014, however, Social Security will begin spending more than it collects. It will begin spending the trust fund, the surpluses. By saving 
   Social Security surpluses and using those surpluses to pay down the debt, Congress will ensure the Nation is on secure economic footing when Social Security surpluses diminish and then disappear. If we do not save Social Security now, it will make it that much harder for us to meet our own obligations later. 
   We need to protect Social Security now for the 1 million Missourians who receive Social Security, for their children, and their grandchildren. We need to protect Social Security now, and this bill fails to do that. It certainly threatens not to do it, and it is time for us to vote in favor of the Nickles amendment, and to vote against any plan that would invade the Social Security trust fund. 
   It is for this reason I urge my colleagues to support the Nickles amendment calling for the full protection of our Social Security resources. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a very important subject. I am referring to teen smoking. 
   Currently, teen smoking rates are far too high and they continue to rise. Since I left the Missouri Governor's office, teen smoking in Missouri has increased from 32.6% to 40.3%--almost a 24% increase! In fact, today, Missouri ranks sixth in the nation in teen smoking. 
   While there is disagreement in this body on where teen smoking policies should be set--at the federal or state level--we all agree that it must be addressed. 
   Seven years ago, in an attempt to tackle this problem, the United States Congress passed what is now known as the Synar Amendment. This amendment required the states to meet specified targets in reducing teen access to cigarettes. It did not tell the States how to meet the targets but just that they had to meet them. 
   I believe, as I argued during the debate on the Federal tobacco tax legislation, that States are in the best position to tackle the serious problem of teen smoking. Governors, state legislatures, mayors, and city councils know how to target their programs. They know how to tailor educational programs for the local schools and communities. They have better access to convenience store owners and other retail establishments where teens buy cigarettes. 
   With that in mind, I am deeply troubled about our current situation.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, as I think everyone in this Chamber understands, I am advocating that there be sanctions reform with regard to the unilateral embargo imposed by this country on agricultural and medicinal products as it relates to sales in other settings. 
   I say ``unilateral embargo.'' This means that the United States alone decides to deprive people in the United States of the right to sell to some other country. So it is not when we are involved in multilateral embargoes but unilateral embargoes. 
   Secondly, the kind of embargo we are talking about is an embargo of medicine or agriculture. We are talking about the kind of thing that will keep people from starving or keep people who are in need of medicine from dying. 
   Senators HAGEL, BAUCUS, DODD, KERREY, BROWNBACK, and a host of others have joined with me in working on a bill that would lift embargoes of this kind against U.S. farm products. 
   In a sense, the bottom line is this: We offered our embargo proposal as an amendment to the agricultural appropriations bill. That is a bill that is supposed to serve the interests of farmers. The result? I have to say that the result in the Senate was a heartwarming and commendable result. 
   Senators, understanding that we ought to improve the capacity of our farmers to market their products around the world, and to keep farmers from being used as pawns in diplomatic disputes through the imposition of unilateral agricultural and medicinal embargoes, considered the proposal, debated the proposal, and overwhelmingly concluded, in a vote of 70-28, that we should stop using our farmers as pawns in the world of international diplomacy. Also, the Senate conferees agreed, with a vote of 8-3. Furthermore, we had the agreement of House conferees. 
   So what went wrong in the conference committee, after the Senate made a part of its agricultural appropriations bill a reform in this way, where farmers have been deprived of their right to market food and medicine--and pharmaceuticals are also marketed--what happened? What happened to us? 
   The reason I am down here today is to talk about that. If there is such overwhelming support in the Congress for such reform, what happened to the Democratic process here? 
   A few Members of the House and Senate leadership decided that they did not agree, and they basically vetoed something that was passed by the Senate--expressed by those who represent the people as the will of the people. 
   Most of the time, in order to veto the Senate, you have to be elected President. But apparently sometimes you are going to be able to overrule a 70-28 vote in the Senate by just saying that your own position is more noteworthy than that of a virtually overwhelming majority of the Senate. They vetoed the Senate-passed provision and inserted their own policy into the agricultural appropriations bill. 
   I am on the floor now to let farmers and ranchers across 
   America know exactly what happened. 
   First of all, I would like to explain to America's farmers--and particularly to those in Missouri and the Midwest--how I fought for their interests but was prevented from doing what they wanted because of a small minority--from the leadership--who worked against sanctions reform. 
   Second, I would like to explain what my colleagues were proposing in the amendment with me, what was the nature of this reform. 
   And then third, I would like to show how it is good public policy to have a reform in sanctions not only to help farmers and ranchers but also how it is good foreign policy. 
   Here are the events of the House-Senate conference committee. 
   Let me be perfectly clear. The Senate voted on agricultural embargoes. This was not something that was interjected in the committee. We agreed, with a 70-28 vote, to end the embargo on farmers. After I and the other sponsors of the amendment made additional concessions to those opposing sanctions reform, the amendment was passed by  unanimous consent in the Senate. So not only do you have a unanimous consent in the Senate, but it was after a serious negotiation, a good-faith negotiation, that followed a 70-28 vote. So we moved to elevate this from something that was just overwhelmingly supported to something that was passed with unanimous consent. 
   Then the House-Senate conferees began consideration of the agricultural appropriations bill. Did they first consider what was passed by the Senate? Not really. A select few in the leadership unilaterally changed the Senate-passed amendment and imposed their personal agenda into the conference committee. 
   The House leadership offered some sanctions reform but carved out Cuba. At this point, the Senator from North Dakota stood up for our farmers and for the will of the Senate and asked that the Senate amendment, as passed, be considered. 
   Very frankly, I would not think it would be necessary to take a unanimous consent passage, that had followed a 70-28 vote prior to the final details being worked out to harmonize things--that it would be necessary to have an extraordinary event in the conference committee to ask that that just be considered in the committee. But, as I indicated, the Senator from North Dakota stood up for the farmers in my State and across the Midwest and America and stood up for the will of the Senate, as expressed in the unanimous consent and the 70-28 vote. 
   So, again, the Senate conferees overwhelmingly voted to reinstate the amendment we had passed on the floor. The Senate conferees said: Wait a second. This is an effort by some leaders to substitute their own judgment for the expressed will of the Senate that was overwhelmingly passed by a vote of 70-28, and then negotiated further to gain unanimous consent, and it at least ought to be in the bill. 
   I am grateful to the Senator from North Dakota, and I appreciate his effort. At this point, the House conferees were to vote. It was at this point that the democratic process broke down. The conference was shut down for a week because the Senate and the House conferees decided they would stand strong. They made a decision to vote the will of their constituents instead of the dictates of a few leaders in the Congress.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I am very pleased to respond to those questions. There is a very strange anomaly here. What appears to be fundamentally and unmistakably clear is that the conference committee was not shut down because it couldn't work. The conference committee was shut down because it was about to work. The conference committee was discontinued and suspended in its operation, not because they couldn't come to an agreement but because it was on the verge of an agreement. They were on the verge of agreeing how, House and Senate conferees together, this important kind of reform related to the embargoes of food and medicine, that important kind of reform should be included in what we are doing. 
   It was not the breakdown of the democratic process. It was the suspension of the democratic process. The real threat was not that democracy doesn't work. The threat was that democracy would work. It was going to work against the interests of a very few people. 
   After all, the vote in the Senate was 70 to 28, before we made the harmonizing concessions that brought us to a place of unanimous consent. So there were very few people here who sought to displace the will of what had appeared to be the conference committee and which was clearly the expressed overwhelming will of the Senate. This veto power is strange indeed, especially when the democratic process was in the process of working itself.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. No question in my mind. It was not the threat that the conference committee could not function. It was the threat that the conference committee was functioning. It was functioning toward an end with which some people were unhappy. 
   That brings us to today's events. A few in the House and Senate among those who oppose this legislation, in the leadership of both the House and Senate, got together and made a unilateral decision, as has already been described by the Senator from North Dakota, to strip out provisions in the bill that had the broad support of Congress and broad support among the conferees and in the farm community. 
   These were the kinds of things that they wouldn't allow to be voted on, at which point I began to wonder, with  great seriousness, is this a bill that is right for the agriculture community, or is this a bill for special interests, is this a bill for some individuals who want to determine things on their own rather than to have the expressed will of the American people, as reflected in the Senate and House, become a policy of America, good farm policy, good foreign policy. 
   As we all know, the House and Senate leadership are proposing a new conference report, a report that hasn't been voted on by any of the conferees and a report that is opposed by the farm community. Farmers have repeatedly asked simply that the democratic process be allowed to work. If we vote and lose, then that is what is fair. The American Farm Bureau has already said it will oppose a conference report that was forced on the American farmers without their short- and/or long-term interests in mind and that it did not address the issue of sanctions reform. 
   I have a letter signed by Dean Kleckner, President of the American Farm Bureau Federation, urging conferees not to sign the proposed agricultural appropriations conference report unless, and then listing conditions that aren't in the sort of fabricated conference report to be imposed by leadership.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. The fact remains that leadership does not want the democratic process to work because this proposal which they are against has very broad support. This isn't just good farm policy; it is good foreign policy as well. 
   Before I explain what the bill does, though, I simply ask that my fellow Republicans and Democrats in the Senate and House do what is right for farmers. Don't vote for a bill that farmers oppose and then claim you are helping the farmers. Our farmers need money, but the only thing that is holding that up, and has been holding it up for a week, is a few in the leadership who oppose the will of the farmers and the Congress. Our farmers also need open markets, and that is what our amendment would have done. That was the expressed will of the Senate, which first voted 70 to 28 and later voted unanimously, by unanimous consent, to be a part of the bill. That opening of the markets would have been fair. We don't just get by by having the freedom to plant. We need to have the freedom to market for our farmers, if we are going to be successful. 
   Let me take this opportunity to summarize briefly what the bill was designed to do. It was originally entitled ``The Food and Medicine for the World Act.'' I would like, then, to show how our approach to ending unilateral embargoes on food and medicine is good policy, both foreign policy and farm policy. 
   The general framework of the bill is what I call a handshake approach to sanctions. The bill would not tie the hands of the President, who now has the ability just to snap embargoes into place, but it would require the President, before he said it was illegal for farmers in this country to sell their goods to certain customers around the world, to get the consent of Congress. 
   So instead of tying the hands of the President, it would really require that the President sort of shake hands with the Congress, make sure this is a very serious thing, and if there is a need to embargo, in that case an embargo could be achieved. But it could not be achieved just on the whim of the executive. It would require the President to cooperate with Congress. 
   This bill would not restrict or alter the President's current ability to impose broad sanctions in conjunction with others; nor would it preclude sanctions on food and medicines. Rather, it says that the President may include food and medicines in a sanctions regime, but he must first obtain congressional consent. 
   So we really just ask that the President of the United States, before shutting off the markets of our farmers, consult with the Congress and that he obtain the consent of Congress. Under the bill, Congress would review the President's request to sanction agriculture and medicine through an expedited procedure--no stalls in the Congress. 
   Mr. President, the Senate of the United States, offered with the opportunity to stop a program of curtailing markets for our farmers--that program called sanctions and embargo--voted 70-28 to change the rules about that so our farmers have the right to sell food and medicine--not things generally but food and medicine--around the world. 
   If the President wants to stop the sale of food or medicine, these things that are essential to the existence of people, the things that make America a friend to other people, the things that bind people around the world to America, knowing that we have the right motives in our mind--if we are going to stop the sale of those things, the President has to confer with the Congress rather than to do it unilaterally. In other words, don't let the farmers of America just be used as political pawns in diplomatic disputes, having markets shut down arbitrarily or unilaterally, markets for medicine. 
   The Senate came to the conclusion, by a vote of 70-28, on what was called the Food and Medicine for the World Act. It was an amendment that I offered to the Agriculture appropriations bill. And then, because some people in the 28 were not happy about all details, we negotiated with those individuals, so that the next day the Food and Medicine for the World Act became a part of the Agriculture appropriations bill by unanimous consent in the Senate, and it went to conference. 
   Little did we know that some of the leaders would decide to displace this overwhelmingly endorsed item by members of both parties--a majority of Republicans and Democrats, voted with a 70-majority vote, and of course everybody agreed to the unanimous consent order. But certain leaders decided they would displace that. So when the bill got to conference, this wasn't in the bill. And the Senator from North Dakota decided to stand up for the farmers of America and stand up for the Senate and what it had decided and say, ``I want that in the bill.'' He said, let's vote on whether we would put in the bill what the Senate voted on. 
   You really wonder about things when the conference committee has to ask permission and vote to have the content of what the Senate enacted appear in the conference bill. But it was voted on and put in the bill, and properly done so. 
   The House was ready to do the same thing when it became apparent to  those who wanted to stop this, curtail it, didn't want this reform to take place, didn't want to offer to American farmers this set of markets, didn't want to say to them you are free to farm and now you are free to market, that they wanted to have these strings still attached. So just when the conference committee was about to operate to express its will, when it was clear how that will would be expressed, the conference committee was shut down for a week and has not been reassembled. 
   Today, we learned that the leadership has said to the conference committee: You are not going to reassemble. All the issues are closed, and we have decided this is the way the report will be written. You are being asked to sign the report. 
   So we find ourselves where the will of the Senate is stripped arbitrarily from the bill before it goes to conference. It is added back in conference, and it is again stripped arbitrarily. The conference committee is shut down when the House conferees express a signal of their intent to include that in what they had to say. We collapsed the democratic process and started the autocratic process, and we put a conference report before people, asking them to sign it in spite of the fact that it wasn't something that had been voted on or discussed; it was something to be imposed by leadership. 
   That kind of suspension of the democratic process has been injurious. It loses the confidence of very important groups. 
   I have submitted for the RECORD the letter of the American Farm Bureau saying that is not the way to run a conference. It is not the way to run polic 
   There are some very strong policy considerations that recommend a modification in our approach. Having the President use farmers as a pawn in diplomatic disputes to open and close markets at will undermines the reliability of the American farmer as the supplier of food and fiber. It is very difficult for people to expect to buy things from you if they never know whether you are going to have them available for sale. Customers like a constant supply. 
   We tried to solve this. We tried to say there wouldn't be this kind of arbitrary use of American farmers as pawns. We tried to say that in order for the sanctions to be effective and an embargo to be imposed it would have to have the consent of Congress. 
   We have the special provision in legislation with regard to countries already sanctioned so that if there is any need to continue those sanctions in effect, the President could come and get those instated and up to speed and qualified so we would not have any interruption. 
   The bill wasn't to take effect for 180 days after it was passed. So if the President wanted to make sure there were sanctions in place and imposed, there wouldn't be any exposure to gaps. Both branches of government would be given enough time to review current policy and to act jointly. 
   Of course, there are times when the President should have the authority to sanction food and medicine without congressional approval. A declaration of war is one of those. The legislation maintains the President's authority in wartime to cut off food and medicine sales without congressional consideration. 
   The bill has a few additional provisions that were not addressed in previous agricultural sanctions reform proposals. The first specifically excludes all dual-use items. That means products that could be used to develop chemical or biological weapons. There are not very many agricultural products or medicinal products that have military value. But the bill provides safeguards to ensure our national security is not harmed. 
   Let me make clear that this is genuinely a bill that supports a policy of putting products which will eliminate suffering and hunger into the hands of those who need these products most. It is not about providing dual-use items for tyrants to use for military or acts of terrorism. 
   Second, we make sure that no taxpayer money would be used to go to the wrong people. We specifically exclude any kind of agricultural credits or guarantees to governments that have sponsored terrorism. However, we allow present guarantees to be extended to people all over the world--to private sector institutions, groups, and nongovernmental organizations. This is targeted to show support for the very people who need to be strengthened in these countries--the people, rather than the dictators. And by specifically excluding terrorist governments, we send a message that the United States in no way will assist or endorse the activities of nations that threaten our interests. 
   Now that Senators HAGEL, DODD, and I have explained what we have done in this bill, let me explain why it is good foreign policy and why it is both good foreign and farm policy. 
   First of all, ending unilateral embargoes against sales of U.S. food and medicine is a good foreign policy. As the leader of the free world, America must maintain adequate tools to advance security and promote civil liberty abroad. The last thing I want to do is send a message to state sponsors of terrorism that the United States is legitimizing its regime. As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, sanctions are necessary foreign policy tools against governments which threaten our interests. 
   Richard Holbrooke, who not long ago was before the Committee on Foreign Relations seeking confirmation as the U.S. Representative to the United Nations--and we have since confirmed him--explained in his book ``To End a War'' how sanctions on Yugoslavia were essential to push Slobodan Milosevic toward peace negotiations in Bosnia. 
   Regardless of whether we agree with U.S. deployment in the Balkans, effective sanctions saved American lives. They helped advance American policy without resorting only to the use of military force. So we have to have sanctions. But these sanctions must be deployed, very frankly, in a realistic and appropriate way. 
   This measure is good policy because we don't want to say to terrorists: You can blame starving your own people on the United States by saying they won't sell us food and medicine. So we will starve you and we will not provide you with food and medicine. We will take the money we have in our country and buy arms, or explosives, or we will destabilize communities in which we live--world communities in one part of the world or another. 
   I think we should deprive the dictator of the right to say, ``You are starving because America won't sell us food,'' because if we ask that dictator to spend his hard currency buying food, and we make it possible for him to do so, he absolutely cannot spend the same currency again buying weapons. 
   Frankly, our farmers ought to be able to sell their food so that the people in those countries all around the world know that America is not in the business of starving people around the world. We are in the business of feeding people around the world. That is good foreign policy. If we can encourage people to invest their money in food rather than in armaments, if they will buy medicinal supplies rather than destabilizing various regions of the world, that is good foreign policy. But it is also good farm policy. 
   The sanctions that have been imposed haven't been effective to hurt our enemies. They have been very injurious to farmers. I would simply refer you to the so-called Soviet grain embargo of the late 1970s. That is perhaps the classic, the biggest, of them all, where the United States of America canceled 17 million tons of contracts that the Soviets had to buy from American farmers. It hurt American farmers immensely by not getting the payments for those farm products. We thought we were punishing the Soviet Union. They went into the world marketplace and they replaced those purchases and saved $250 million for our adversary at a time when we inflicted the loss of markets on our own farmers. It didn't make much sense then, and it doesn't make much sense now. 
   Policy reform in sanctions protocol would make our efforts in this respect far more reasonable, and it would require the President to get an agreement from Congress. It would not put us in the position where we embargo the sale of goods and where our customers start to look elsewhere to get their goods supplied. When we stopped the sale of 17 million tons of grain to the Soviet Union in the 1970s, it  brought on new suppliers. Rain forests could then be plowed and planted. Other countries seeing that the United States was retreating from the major segment of the world markets could say: We can supply that. Those who were in the world marketplace said: We will start looking to reliable suppliers that won't be turning over the supply depending on diplomatic considerations that would, as a result, interrupt our supply. 
   So it is both good farm policy to give our farmers the right to market, and it is good foreign policy to give our country the right and the opportunity to provide people with food and medicine to signal that the United States of America wants their government to spend money for food and medicine and not for military hardware. 
   So it is in the context of this very substantial reform that would help the U.S. farmers. 
   It would also help our foreign policy. 
   It is in that context that I express my real disappointment in terms of what has happened. The conference committee was shut down, the democratic process suspended, and an autocratic process imposed. As a result, we are unlikely to have in the agricultural appropriations conference report on which we will be asked to vote--the kind of thing upon which there was so much agreement--a reform in the sanctions policy. The American Farm Bureau is opposed to this agricultural appropriations bill conference report unless sanctions reform is included. 
   I think Members of this body ought to be aware of the fact we need sanctions reform. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated there has been a $1.2 billion annual decline in the U.S. economy during the midnineties as a result of these kinds of sanctions. This is a serious loss in jobs as well. 
   The Wheat Commission projects if sanctions were lifted this year, our wheat farmers could export an additional 4.1 million metric tons of wheat, a value of almost half a billion to America's farmers. 
   I want to emphasize, we have missed for the time being a great opportunity to reform sanctions protocols regarding our farm products. We have also interrupted what is a beneficial and therapeutic democratic process in the conference committee. I think Members of this body should seriously consider whether they want to vote for the conference committee report when it is the product not of the kind of collaboration that is to be expected in the development of consensus in our policy but it is as a result of an effort to impose the will of a few instead of to respect the will of the majority. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for reminding us of the greatness of the American people. We think we debate great policies here, and we do; we have very serious discussions. But there is nothing more important than to remind ourselves that the greatness of America isn't really in Washington, DC, it is in the little towns, villages, and cities in States all across this country and individuals who can do more in dedicated lives to their fellow citizens than we could ever do in complicated statutes. 
   I thank the majority leader.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Michigan and the Chair. I also thank the Senator from Michigan, Mr. ABRAHAM, for his enlightening remarks about this important challenge we face --a challenge which would seriously undermine and erode America's competitive position in the production of automobiles. 
   I want to focus on a different aspect of the corporate average fuel economy debate. 
   Most Americans, if you talk about CAFE standards, think you will be talking about health standards in a restaurant or cleanliness in corporate a local coffee shop. In this particular setting, CAFE means average fuel economy. Basically, it is the average fuel economy of the car produced by a particular company. A company that had a car that had a very high corporate average fuel economy also would have to build very small vehicles because it takes less fuel to run a small vehicle than it does a large vehicle. 
   The concept of a corporate average fuel economy standard was developed during the oil crisis of the 1970s. It required automobile manufacturers to develop vehicles that could travel further with less gas. This was due to the shortage of the gasoline that had been imposed by the oil industry cartel which had curtailed the availability of energy resources to this country. 
   The CAFE standards at that time required automakers to maintain, fleetwide, an average fuel efficiency of 27.5 miles per gallon for cars and 20.7 miles per gallon for trucks. 
   This is how the CAFE standards got started. It was to try to help the United States get past the energy embargo imposed in the 1970s. It was not instituted--I repeat--it was not instituted for clean air purposes. Rather, it was adopted to conserve gasoline. 
   In fact, Federal regulations require that big cars emit no more pollution per mile than small cars. I have to confess, with all Americans, that our air is cleaner today than it was 5 years ago or 10 years ago, and we are pleased that we continue to make progress. The air continues to get cleaner and that is a good thing. 
   I will focus on the safety impact of increasing CAFE standards. In doing so, I will talk about the consequences of imposing CAFE standards--but not in terms of making sure we have enough gas to burn in the country because the embargo was lifted decades ago. 
   I want to focus on the safety aspects of what happens when you demand that cars get more and more efficient--that somehow they must be able to go farther and farther on a gallon of gas. It does not take any special level of intelligence, you do not have to be a rocket scientist to understand that in order to meet fuel economy standards, cars and trucks have to be made lighter. So in an effort to make cars go further on a gallon of gas, the cars and trucks had to be made lighter and lighter. Common sense tells us when a lighter and smaller vehicle is involved in an accident, passenger injuries will be more severe. 
   Since CAFE standards were enacted in the 1970s, the average weight of a new car has dropped by about 1,000 pounds. So if you look at the weight of a car as being protection--the protective barrier that surrounds a passenger--there is 1,000 pounds less of protection in the new car than in the cars prior to CAFE standards. 
   A recent study from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the agency that administers CAFE standards, found that increasing the average weight of each passenger car on the road by 100 pounds would save over 300 lives annually. So if instead of decreasing the weight of cars  in order to reach higher levels of fuel economy we were to add 100 pounds to the weight of cars, we would save 300 lives every year. 
   We are really not debating whether or not we are going to add weight to cars; however, this is a debate over whether we are going to mandate that car manufacturers make cars out of lighter and lighter materials. When you do that, it has a cost in terms of the relatives of the Members of this body, our families and our constituents and our constituents families. 
   A number of studies have been conducted to determine the actual effect that the CAFE standards have had on highway safety. I want to emphasize that these studies are conducted by very credible agencies--agencies that would not be anticipated to try and develop information that would somehow support the car industry. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is a Federal agency that administers the CAFE standards. 
   This agency is talking about the standards, which are its job to administer, when it says that if we could increase the weight instead of decrease the weight and we did so only by 100 pounds per vehicle, we would save 300 lives a year. One person a day, roughly, would be saved in America if we had slightly heavier cars. The Competitiveness Enterprise Institute found that of the 21,000 car-occupant deaths that occurred last year, between 2,600 and 4,500 of them were attributable to the Federal Government's new car fuel economy standards. We have between 2,500 and 4,500 people who don't exist anymore, who died because we have demanded lighter and lighter cars in order to meet the so-called CAFE standards, just last year. 
   That is from the Competitiveness Enterprise Institute. This is not from the car manufacturers. This is from an independent think tank. 
   A 1989 Harvard University-Brookings Institution study determined that the current CAFE standard of 27.5 miles per gallon is responsible for a 14- to 27-percent increase in annual traffic deaths. These are deaths--they argue that would not have happened but for the fact that the new car fleet must be downsized in order to meet the stricter standards. As long as 10 years ago, researchers at Harvard University and the Brookings Institution determined that the CAFE standards and the imposition of the CAFE standards then extant were responsible for between 1/7 and 2/7 of the increase in the annual traffic deaths--just that much of a reduction in the weight of cars. 
   So we have the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, we have the Competitiveness Enterprise Institute, the Harvard University-Brookings Institution study. We have the National Academy of Sciences in this decade. This is not a wholly-owned subsidiary of GM, Ford, or Daimler-Chrysler. 
   The National Academy of Sciences 1992 study concluded that the downsizing of automobiles due to fuel economy requirements has a direct impact on passenger safety. That study found:  
   Safety and fuel economy are linked, because one of the most direct methods manufacturers can use to improve fuel economy is to reduce vehicle size and weight.  
   I really don't want to pick at the National Academy of Sciences. It is not just one of the most direct methods used to boost fuel economy; it is a very important method. 
   The most troubling conclusion from the National Academy of Sciences study was:  
   It may be inevitable that significant increases in fuel economy can occur only with some negative safety consequences.  
   We could go over the litany again: The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, the Harvard University/Brookings Institution study, the Competitiveness Enterprise Institute, and the National Academy of Sciences--all of these organizations understand that it is not a cost-free operation to say we will save a few gallons of gas and sacrifice our citizens and their safety on the highways. 
   Continuing to quote the National Academy of Sciences:  
   The CAFE approach to achieving automotive fuel economy has defects that are sufficiently grievous to warrant careful reconsideration of the approach.  
   I personally say we ought to carefully reconsider this approach. One study said in 1 year between 2,600 and 4,500 individuals died because we have mandated that car manufacturers lighten automobiles so substantially that they become death traps for the occupants. I think safety ought to be foremost in our consideration. When the National Academy of Sciences says we ought to reconsider the approach of lightening these cars by demanding more and more fuel economy, I think we ought to take that particular admonition seriously.  
   The CAFE approach to achieving automotive fuel economy has defects that are sufficiently grievous to warrant careful reconsideration of the approach.  
   It is with that in mind that when the National Academy of Sciences says we ought to carefully reconsider this approach, I think we ought to reject attempts by Members of this body to extend this approach. 
   What is at the core of the National Academy of Sciences argument is this: They care about these lives that are lost on our highways, people who are riding in cars without adequate protection. 
   The proponents of this measure dismiss the safety considerations as if they are an aside. Frankly, in a setting where our environment continues to improve, where our air continues to get cleaner and cleaner, we ought to be careful about the number of people we are willing to put in jeopardy and at risk. We are not talking about risk of a stubbed toe or a hangnail; we are talking about situations where individuals lose their lives. 
   These standards, according to these studies--whether it is Harvard-Brookings, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, the National Academy of Sciences--are responsible for Americans losing their lives. 
   There are those in this body who want to make these standards even tougher, in the face of very clear predictions and a conceded understanding that to make these standards tougher means more and more people die on the highway. Based on experience and research, increasing CAFE standards to 40 miles per gallon--that is less than proposals supported by the President and Vice President of the country; they want to take the standards even higher than that--would cost up to 5,700 people their lives every year. 
   I am not even beginning to address the aspect of the government telling its citizens what kind of cars they should be driving. This is to say that we won't let people buy safe cars, we will make them unavailable, and 5,700 a year will lose their lives because we have decided that we know better what kind of car people should drive than people could know by making their choices in the marketplace. 
   I want you to know that this isn't all. I am pleased that Senator ABRAHAM submitted for the RECORD this particular item, which was a reprint from the USA Today: ``Death by the Gallon.'' I brought this particular chart to show that a USA Today analysis of previously unpublished fatality statistics that 46,000 people have died because of a 1970s-era push for greater fuel efficiency that has led to smaller cars. 
   As far as I am concerned 46,000 is 46,000 too many. But to think that we want to extend this so as to invite the deaths of as many as 5,700 more people a year by downsizing this container in which people travel called an automobile and lightening it to the extent that it provides no cushion of safety for people, or an inadequate cushion of safety, is a very serious proposal. 
   Forty-six thousand people have died due to the implementation of CAFE standards. Is it time to reexamine those standards, or is it time to expand those standards? Forty-six thousand angels looking at the Senate should be telling us: Reexamine; do not extend those. Forty-six thousand people is the equivalent in my State to Joplin, MO. The deaths of 46,000 people in my State would wipe out the entire town of Blue Springs, MO, or all of Johnson or Christian Counties. 
   The average passenger vehicle in 1975 was 14 miles per gallon; today it is 20 miles per gallon. That averages 7,700 lost lives for every gallon of increased fuel efficiency. I don't think 46,000 lives are worth it. I know they are worth more than that. I mean that is not worth the 46,000 lives. 
   I asked the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety to give me an opinion on raising CAFE standards and on the  impact it would have on highway safety. I will insert their response in the RECORD. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print this correspondence with the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in the RECORD.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. The institute found that even in single-vehicle crashes, which account for about half of all passenger vehicle occupant deaths, single-car crashes, people in lighter vehicles are at greater risk. I think we could have figured that out. It is pretty clear from 46,000 deaths that that is understandable. 
   The letter also stated:  
   ..... the more ``safer'' vehicles a manufacturer sells, the more difficult it becomes to meet the CAFE standards.  
   So if a manufacturer tries to sell safer, heavier vehicles, it makes it impossible for them to meet the Federal standards. 
   I want to make one thing very clear. I believe in promoting cleaner air. I believe we should be environmentally responsible, and we are getting there. I don't believe we should do it at the risk of human lives. CAFE standards have killed people. They will continue to kill people because cars have been lightened to the extent that they don't protect individuals. 
   Consumers are not choosing small cars. They look at convenience and safety, and then they buy a larger automobile. According to a national poll, safety is one of the three main reasons for the popularity of sport utility vehicles. Small cars are only 18 percent of all vehicles that are on the road, yet they accounted for 37 percent of all the deaths in 1997. They are one out of every six vehicles on the road, and they are involved in more than one out of every three deaths on the highways. 
   Some argue these numbers are so high because the small cars are getting into accidents with the bigger SUVs. The data does not support that. Based on figures from the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, only 1 percent of all small-car deaths involve collisions with midsize or large SUVs--1 percent. The real tragedy is that these cars are unsafe in one-car accidents or in accidents with each other. 
   Car-buying experts have said that only 7 percent of new vehicle shoppers say they will consider buying a small car. And according to that same source, 82 percent who have purchased small cars say they would not buy another. Safety-conscious consumers, whether they are my constituents in Missouri, or others, are purchasing larger automobiles, or sports utility vehicles. But now Washington wants to tell them what kind of car to buy, to disregard a value which they place on their own safety. We spend millions of dollars a year trying to make our highways safer: We fight drunk driving; we mandate seatbelt use; we require auto manufacturers to install airbags. Yet today we are being asked to support a policy to make our highways more dangerous and more deadly than ever before. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject this attempt to impose higher and higher CAFE standards. The attempt to impose higher and higher CAFE standards is clearly headed for a consequence of higher and higher levels of fatalities. We have seen data from the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. We have seen data from the Harvard/Brookings Institution. We have seen data from the National Academy of Sciences. We have seen the kind of comprehensive review of data published in the USA Today. It is pretty clear, as the Competitive Enterprise Institute chimes in, that lightening cars--taking the strong substances out of the vehicle so that it goes farther for marginal gains in economy, results in more and more people dying. 
   I urge my colleagues to be sensitive to the fact that America can ill afford to elevate the carnage on our highways by eliminating the kind of substance in our vehicles that would be required if we were to adopt the amendment that is pending. So I urge them to reject the attempt to elevate CAFE standards and, in so doing, protect the lives of themselves and their families. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, as we look to the future, most of us, in our families, in our businesses, in our civic organizations, in our churches, like to deal with some sort of plan. As a matter of fact, there is a lot of buzz or talk these days about financial planning, making sure we have the capacity to meet the demands of the future when they come to us and when they fall upon us. 
   It is incumbent on the Congress of the United States to engage in some planning, to take a look at the future and find out exactly where we ought to be going and how we ought to get there, and the things that are important and what we ought to do to protect our interests. It is with that in mind that we, the Members of the Congress, are delivering to the President a financial plan for the next decade. He will have an opportunity to act on that plan this week. That plan has been talked about, the tax relief contained in the plan, but it has not been spoken of very generously in terms of the other major features of this financial plan for America for the next 10 years. I think we can only understand the plan by looking at it as a whole, understanding what we are doing to protect the interests of this country in the years ahead. 
   The first thing I think people want us to start to do is to be more responsible in the way we in Washington handle their money. One of the areas of irresponsibility in the past has been the Social Security trust fund. When there has been a little bit more in the trust fund--or a lot more in the trust fund--than was needed for that particular year, Members of the House and Senate have been a part of budgeting that money for expenditures not related to Social Security, to 
   support the operational costs of Government. 
   Americans are duly concerned because they know the reason there is a surplus in the Social Security trust fund is that big bulge of us baby boomers are paying in, but they know when this big bulge of baby boomers starts to consume instead of contribute to the trust fund, we are going to need the surplus. So the first thing we have done in our financial plan for the future is to put an end to that. We are going to stop the practice of spending the trust fund. So the financial plan which will go to the President this week says $1.9 trillion--trillion being a thousand billions and a billion being a thousand millions; I mean, it is almost impossible to think of it that way--$1.9 trillion is going to be reserved for Social Security, a major step forward. Americans have a right to expect us to plan to do that and we are doing it. That is a big part of the financial plan for the future. 
   No. 2, people say over time most families, most organizations want to reduce their debt; they would like to get their debt down to manageable levels. Most of us take 30 years to pay off a home. We have decided to start paying down the national debt. In a part of the plan which I think is very important, we are taking the publicly held debt of the United States of America from $3.8 trillion down to $1.9 trillion, a 50-percent decline in the national debt held by the public of the United States of America. What a tremendous decline in debt. As part of a rational plan, the debt to the gross domestic product ratio goes from 43 percent to 14 percent over that 10-year plan we are sending to the President. First, we protect Social Security. Second, we pay the debt down by 50 percent. 
   No. 3, as the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, has indicated, we put aside about $505 billion for contingencies over the next 10 years, things we might want to spend money on over and above what we are spending now. So not only do we have a reservation of $1.9 trillion for Social Security, not only do we cut the publicly held debt of this country in half, but we also reserve a half trillion dollars for expenditures we are not now making. 
   It is only in the context of these three items--the saving of the Social Security surplus for Social Security; reducing the national debt, the publicly held debt of America, by 50 percent; putting aside a half trillion dollars for contingencies--that we understand what the tax relief is all about. The tax relief is what is left over. Americans earn the money. We trust Americans to earn this money; we should trust them to spend it. The question is whether we are going to fund families or bureaucracies. 
   We got the President to agree with us on saving Social Security to the extent of putting $1.9 trillion aside, and I commend him for getting there. He wasn't there in his State of the Union Message. I commend the President for being willing to pay down the national debt. But the President, after that, wants to spend so much more of what is left over on more Government programs. 
   Frankly, we ought to be giving a tax relief package, 1 percent, to every bracket. We ought to be doing away with the marriage penalty tax. We ought to allow parents and grandparents to invest money so their kids can have money for education, and the growth of that money can have a tax preferred 
   status. We ought to allow people to buy health care in a more tax beneficial way, especially the self-employed who do not get it on their jobs. 
   It is with that in mind I think this package is delivered to the President to say this is a comprehensive financial plan for the future. The tax relief only amounts to 23.8 percent of the total surplus as we have defined surpluses historically because we have been so responsible as to set that Social Security surplus aside. It is not part of what we will spend. And we start to knock down the national debt, take down the publicly held debt of the country 50 percent in the next 10 years and set aside a half trillion dollars for contingencies, and then work on abolishing the marriage penalty and tax, saving for education and expanded IRAs, and knocking every tax rate down by 1 percent--a 1-percent decline for folks at the top brackets and a 1-percent decline for folks at the bottom brackets. 
   It seems to me that is the kind of plan upon which a nation can march  forward. I call upon the President of the United States to reevaluate his position. He has expressed real doubts, serious reservations about this. Seeing it in the context of a financial plan for the future of the United States is to see it as a roadmap to opportunity and success and prosperity. 
   I close with this. Because we had the two biggest tax increases in history in this decade, Americans have paid in far more money than we are going to need. It is like going to the grocery store and you hand the man a $10 bill for a $2.45 gallon of milk. You expect change. You expect to get something back when you pay more than is needed for what you have ordered. You would not think much of the grocer who said: I'm going to give you two more gallons of milk and a pound of bacon, whether you need it or not. That is what has happened. The President said we have the Government covered, the costs are covered, but they have overpaid. Now we are going to give them a whole bunch more Government, whether they have ordered it or not. 
   I think we need a little change. Americans deserve some tax relief, and I am pleased to have had this opportunity to present this financial plan which the President should sign. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia. I thank in particular Rev. Mike Coleman, of Hannibal, MO, for coming to this Chamber today to call us to our highest and best. He prayed about justice and he prayed about mercy, he prayed about the components of attitude and spirit that will help us achieve that which the people have sent us to do. The real opportunity we have is to live at the maximums of our existence rather than to perform at the minimums. When we invite the presence of the Almighty as we begin these proceedings, we equip ourselves to point toward the maximums instead of to dwell on the minimums. 
   So as we approach this day, I thank Rev. Mike Coleman for coming from Hannibal, MO, hometown of Mark Twain. I think it was Mark Twain, the philosopher, who said there is nothing quite so embarrassing as a good example. Well, I do not think the Reverend is embarrassing to us, but he does set a good example as he calls us to our highest and best, and it is the prayer of all of us together with him that today we would serve the people with compassion and dignity and with justice and mercy. 
   I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from Virginia for allowing me to make these remarks.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this amendment offered by Senator Bob SMITH of New Hampshire. 
   This amendment, which eliminates the $99 million appropriated to the NEA, gives Senators the opportunity to decide whether the Federal Government should be in the business of judging and funding art. 
   There are only two ways a Federal government could be involved in funding art: either by judging it or by funding it randomly. I don't think either of those is a good alternative for the Federal Government. 
   I hope a majority of my fellow Senators will agree with me that the Federal Government should resign from its role as a national art critic--telling us what to enjoy or what not to enjoy, and spending our money to tell us that this is good or that is bad. 
   It seems to me that to have the Federal Government as an art critic to determine what type of art is superior to another type of art is not something that a free nation would want to encourage. Government should not be in the business of subsidizing free speech, putting its so-called ``Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval'' on certain pieces of so-called art. 
   When the government funds art, it will always have to make value judgments on what is art and what it is not. I don't think that is an appropriate function of government. The only way to get out of this business is to stop government from funding art. 
   I guess you could fund art randomly--spin the wheel, and whichever artist's name comes up, give them the money. But you would have to decide who got to be part of the lottery. 
   For those who say this is an issue of free speech, my view is that speech is not free if government funds it. As a matter of fact, it is funded speech, and not free speech. 
   When we tax people, we take their dollars coercively. We simply say that if you do not give us the money, you go to jail. Try not paying your taxes and find out whether it is enforced or not. You will find out that the IRS can be very convincing and very persuasive because they have this independent capacity to coerce the dollars. 
   Government subsidies, even with the best intentions, are dangerous because they skew the market toward whatever the government grantmakers prefer. The National Endowment for the Arts grants place the stamp of official U.S. Government approval on funded art. This gives the endowment enormous power to dictate what is regarded as art and what is not. 
   A number of art critics and people in the arts community, have observed this. 
   Jan Breslauer, Los Angeles Times art critic said in 1997 that,  
   [T]he endowment has quietly pursued policies rooted in identity politics--a kind of separatism that emphasizes racial, sexual and cultural differences above all else. The art world's version of affirmative action, these policies ..... have had a profoundly corrosive effect on the American arts--pigeonholing artists and pressuring them to produce work that satisfies a politically correct agenda rather than their best creative instincts.--The Washington Post, March 16, 1997.  
   I would like to call myself an artist because I like to engage in musical performances. I like to engage in the writing of music, and the writing of poetry. But I feel a little below par, so I can't really call myself an artist. There have been some who have said that some of my stuff might qualify for art. But I have never qualified for a grant, and I don't want a grant. My wife always teases me, saying: You can't sell it. You can't even give it away. 
   But the idea of government funding art means that we would begin to bend the artist away from true expression towards something for which the government was providing a subsidy. That is the point that Jan Breslauer makes--that this subsidy has had ``a profoundly corrosive effect on the American arts''--taking people away from the true expression of art, ``pigeonholing artists and pressuring them.''  
   The concept of pressure and art is a very difficult concept to reconcile. I think of Michelangelo painting on the Sistine Chapel and the Pope demanding one thing and another. I don't know if it is true, but it is said that in response to that pressure, Michelangelo painted certain people in hell as a way of indicating that he would resist the pressure. 
   Joseph Parisi, editor of Poetry Magazine, the nation's oldest and most prestigious poetry magazine, has said that disconnecting ``artificial support systems'' for the arts, such as cuts in NEA funding, has had some positive effects. Parisi has said that cuts in federal spending for the arts are causing ``a shake-out of the superficial. The market demands a wider range, an appeal to a broader base. Artists and writers are forced to get back to markets. What will people buy? If you're tenured, if the government buys, there's no response to irrelevance.''--Atlanta Constitution, Nov. 8, 1996. 
   In short, the government should not pick and choose among different points of view and value systems, and continuing politicizing the arts. Garth Brooks fans pay their own way, while the NEA canvasses the nation for politically correct ``art'' that needs a transfusion from the Treasury. It is bad public policy to subsidize free speech. 
   Why I should pay full freight to go see a country star, and the Mercedes limousine set should get a subsidy to go to the ballet, I don't know. 
   On this point I refer Senators to section 316 on page 106 of the Senate bill, which makes a case for elimination of the funding of NEA. It says the NEA can only fund those individuals who have received a ``literature fellowship, a National Heritage Fellowship or''--I am still quoting--an ``American Jazz Masters Fellowship.'' 
   I know very little about music, but I spend a lot of time in music. I know and appreciate that jazz is a great form of American music. But for the life of me, I cannot understand why the Federal Government believes it has the wisdom to use taxes paid by a hard-working plumber or a policeman or a painter to decide which jazz master should be subsidized and which jazz master should not be subsidized. Even if we could subsidize all jazz masters, is it fair to fund jazz masters and not pay stipends to a master classic pianist, a composer, a struggling rhythm and blues artist, or a rock-and-roller? 
   The fact that the Federal Government does not have infallible wisdom to serve as the Nation's art critic underscores the brilliance of our Founding Fathers who, in writing the Constitution, specifically voted against provisions calling on the Federal Government to subsidize the arts. This is not a new request. The founders considered this and rejected it. 
   Although funding for the NEA is small in comparison to the overall budget, elimination of this agency sends a message that Congress is taking seriously its obligation to restrict the Federal Government's actions to the limited role appropriately envisioned by the framers of the Constitution. Nowhere in the Constitution is there a specific threat of authority that could reasonably be construed to include promotion of American jazz masters as compared to or in contradistinction to classical pianists or ordinary guitar pickers. 
   During the constitutional convention in Philadelphia in 1787, Delegate Charles Pinckney introduced a motion calling for the Federal Government to subsidize the arts in the United States. Although the Founding Fathers were cultured individuals who knew firsthand of various European systems for public arts patronage, they overwhelmingly rejected Pinckney's suggestion because of their belief in limited constitutional government. 
   Accordingly, nowhere in its list of powers enumerated and delegated to the Federal Government does the Constitution specify a power to pick jazz masters over guitar pickers. 
   It is noteworthy what the Constitution does provide. Article I, section 8, states:  
   The Congress [of the United States] shall have Power ..... To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Rights to their respective Writings and Discoveries;  
   We can protect the work of artists from unlawful and inappropriate appropriation by those who would steal those works and profit from them. In other words, our Founding Fathers established the noble goal of protecting intellectual property of those who are involved in science or the arts. The Founding Fathers did not think the way to protect the rights was to subsidize them or contaminate them or to prefer one or another. Instead, they believe Government protection should extend to protecting their initiative, their creativity, and their 
   discovery. 
   Some have taken comfort in the recent Supreme Court decisions that have upheld the Federal statute directing the NEA to take into consideration ``general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public'' in making grants. 
   While some have said this ruling will appropriately address the concerns over the type of art the NEA will fund, I don't think that is the case. Moreover, in response to the Finley decision, Chairman Ivey said the ruling was a ``reaffirmation of the agency's discretion in funding the highest quality of art in America'' and that it would not affect his agency's day-to-day operations. That was a quote from the New York Times. 
   These court cases do nothing to solve the underlying issue of whether Government should fund and decide what is art. Suffice it to say the time has come to end the Federal Government's role of paying for and thereby politicizing art. Art should be pure, not politics, and it shouldn't ever become pure politics; it can, when art is elicited, shaped, and coerced in order to comply with Federal guidelines. 
   I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for offering this amendment. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware and commend him for his outstanding work in respect to this piece of important legislation. The Republican plan is a good plan for several reasons, the first of which is that the Republican plan protects every single cent of the Social Security surplus. None of it is to be consumed in the tax cut or in tax relief. Every penny of money from the Social Security trust fund is to be protected--$1.9 trillion over 10 years. 
   When the President presented his budget earlier this year he said we should protect 62 percent of the Social Security trust fund. There is an important distinction. We would protect every cent. The President proposed spending $158 billion of the Social Security benefits over the next 5 years. We said zero. I am happy to say he went back to the drawing board. He still comes back with a plan that spends $1 trillion more in 10 years, including about $30 billion of the Social Security surplus, but it is closer to the Republican plan which protects Social Security. It is very important to understand the Republican plan does not invade Social Security in order to have a tax cut. 
   Since Congress took Social Security off budget in 1969, the Democrats have never protected every dime of Social Security surpluses, and frankly neither have we until this year. 
   In addition to protecting Social Security, the Republican plan pays down the national debt. What is important is that over the next 10 years we will pay off almost half of the national debt. That is responsible. Most homeowners do not pay off half their mortgage in 10 years. On a 30-year mortgage, it takes about 15 years to get halfway through the process.  
   Mr. President, $1.9 trillion of the $3.6 trillion in publicly held national debt will be paid off. We will reduce the national debt from 41 percent of the gross domestic product to only 14 percent of the gross domestic product. 
   On the other side, in contrast, they want to spend more money and leave Americans with a higher national debt. President Clinton's plan provides $223 billion less in debt reduction than does ours. 
   The Republican plan also saves more money for Medicare. Over the next 10 years, the Republican plan sets aside $90 billion for fixing Medicare, in contrast to President Clinton's new Medicare entitlement that provides only $46 billion for additional funding over that period. 
   After attending to all these priorities, after setting aside Social Security, after attending to and making sure we pay down half the debt, running it down from 41 percent of the gross domestic product to 14 percent of the gross domestic product, the Republican plan cuts taxes for every taxpayer; it cuts taxes for married couples, for savings in IRAs, for college education, for health care, cutting the bottom rate and every other rate by 1 percent. 
   In addition, the Republican plan reduces the marriage penalty for couples, thanks to the outstanding work of Senator HUTCHISON of Texas. I was pleased to have joined her, along with Senator BROWNBACK of Kansas, in accelerating that kind of relief in our effort. The Republican plan will make the standard deduction for married couples double that for singles. We will also increase the rate bracket for married couples, making it possible for them to become married couples without paying a penalty. In contrast, the President's plan and the Democratic plan would spend more money on Government, leaving less money for our families. 
   If your faith is in government and in bureaucracy and your faith is not in families and in our communities, then you want to sweep resources to Washington and spend it here. If you believe the greatness of America is in the families and the hearts of the American people, then leaving some of their resources, which they have earned, with them is wise policy. 
   President Clinton's plan calls for $1 trillion more in spending over the next 10 years. The American people did not balance the budget just so they could be the victims of more spending. Out of approximately $3 trillion in total surpluses over the next 10 years, our plan devotes only $792 billion, less than a quarter of the entire total surplus, to tax cuts. The Republican plan protects Social Security, cuts the publicly held debt in half, and provides needed relief to every taxpayer while protecting the opportunity to reform and address the needs of Medicare.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President. I stand before this body today to strongly oppose any attempt made by the United Nations to tax the American people. In its recently released Human Development Report, a proposal was included that would impose a one cent tax on Internet e-mail. This proposed tax would violate every virtue of the American people. The United States should not be subjected to an internationally levied tax. 
   The United States was founded on the principle of ``no taxation without representation.'' John Locke said, ``If any one shall claim a power to lay and levy taxes on the people,...... without ...... consent of the people, he thereby ...... subverts the end of government.'' Consent, according to Locke, could only be given by a majority of the people, ``either by themselves or their representatives chosen by them.'' Among the first powers that the Constitution gave to the Congress, the government's most representative branch, was the power to tax. And, notably, bills to raise revenue must originate in the House of Representatives. The United Nations does not hold the power, authority or right to levy taxes on the American people. This tax would be in direct violation of American sovereignty. 
   There are currently 150 million Internet users in the world, 80 percent reside in the United States. Therefore, the United States would bear the biggest burden of this proposed tax. The American people are already overtaxed by the U.S. government, without being subjected to a tax imposed by the United Nations. By 2001, this number is expected to grow to approximately 700 million. If imposed, this tax would raise an estimated $70 billion in tax revenue annually, in addition to the United States' share of the UN's regular budget of $298 million. Mr. President, I firmly believe the Internet should be allowed to progress without government involvement or taxation. Instead of trying to tax the Internet we should be taking every action necessary to encourage its development. 
   Mr. President, the American people are constantly burdened by the affects of local, state, and federal taxes. Last week alone, we historically voted to give the American people a reprieve, cutting taxes by $792 billion. The American people do not deserve this unfair and unjust tax. The Internet and e-mail are possibly the greatest inventions of modern technological history. They have revolutionized communication and have changed modern society. This proposed tax by the United Nations, or any other tax suggested by the UN--or any other international organization--should be aggressively opposed by the U.S. government.

Mr. President, I want to make a couple of remarks by way of appreciation to the other Senators as well, to Senator HAGEL, to Senator GRAHAM of Florida, Senator MACK of Florida, Senator TORRICELLI, and to all the Senators who worked together. It was important for us to make the fine-tuning adjustments that make this a better piece of legislation, and I commend them for their cooperation. 
   I trust, even expect, that in implementing this process, the administration will endeavor to streamline to the maximum extent possible the process by which food and medicine can be exported pursuant to this provision. This is what our farmers and ranchers and those who produce our medicinal supplies expect from their Government and the people expect from America. For example, I urge the implementing agencies to use general licenses to the maximum extent possible, but obviously this provision provides some judgment and exercise by the administration in this regard. 
   I thank my colleagues, and I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his patience in this respect. I am grateful to him and pleased to have had this opportunity to make this contribution to the measure. I yield the floor.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair. And I am grateful to the Senator for asking for order in the Chamber. 
   I intend to send an amendment to the desk relating to something that I think is very important to the members of the agricultural community in the United States of America. 
   This is an amendment that relates to farmers because it relates to their ability to sell the things they work hard to produce. Currently, it is possible for the President of the United States to sanction--meaning, to curtail--the right of farmers to export and sell that which they produce on their farms. 
   The farmers work hard, they get a bumper crop, and then, because the President would decide that he wanted to make some foreign power or another respond to his interests or his requirements, or our interests or our requirements, the President would impose an embargo, a trade embargo, which would forbid our agriculture community to export corn or wheat or soybeans--agricultural products--to these other countries. 
   Sanctions do play an important and vital role in the U.S. foreign policy. But I think when you talk about unilateral sanctions that the Government of the United States enters into alone, and you talk about food and medicine as the subject of sanctions, you have to ask yourself a variety of different questions that I think really result in sort of a different conclusion about food and medicine type sanctions than a lot of other sanctions. 
   Put it this way. I think it is important that we make sure we do not provide countries with the wrong kind of hardware, the wrong kind of commercial assets. But it makes very little sense, in most circumstances, to say to other countries: We are not going to let you spend money on food; we are not going to let you spend money on medicine. 
   This amendment, which I will be offering, is an amendment that is designed to involve the Congress in the important decision about whether or not we should have sanctions that relate to food and medicine that are unilaterally imposed by the United States of America, not in conjunction with any other powers. 
   To summarize the kind of regime that would be specified in this amendment, the bill would not tie the hands of the executive by making it necessary for the President to get the consent of Congress. The President's hands wouldn't be tied. He could still get sanctions. He would simply have to have the agreement of the Congress so that while the President would need the agreement of Congress, his hands would not be tied. He would literally have to shake hands with Congress before he embargoes agriculture or medicine. The amendment would not restrict or alter the President's current ability to impose broad sanctions with other nations. It certainly does not preclude sanctions on food and medicine. It simply says the President may include food and medicine in a sanction regime, but he must first obtain congressional consent. 
   We did add a special provision to this amendment with regard to countries that are already sanctioned. For the seven countries under a broad sanctions regime, we want to afford the President and the Congress some time to review the sanctions on food and medicine on a country-by-country basis. Therefore, the bill would not take effect until 180 days after it is signed by the President. This gives both branches of Government enough time to review current policy and to act jointly, as would be necessary if jointly they were to decide that sanctions against food and medicine should be maintained. 
   There are some exceptions. If Congress declares war, there is no question about it; the President should have the authority to sanction food and medicine without congressional approval. The President's authority to cut off food and medicine sales in wartime obviously should exist and would continue to exist. 
   The bill specifically excludes all dual-use items and products that could be used to develop chemical or biological weapons. There are not many agricultural or medicinal products that have military applications, but the bill provides safeguards to ensure our national security is not harmed. 
   We made sure that no taxpayer money could be used to subsidize exports to any terrorist governments. We specifically exclude any kind of agricultural credits or guarantees for governments that are sponsors of international terrorism. However, we do allow credit guarantees to be extended to private sector and nongovernmental organizations. This targeted approach helps us show support for the very people who need to be strengthened in these countries, and by specifically excluding terrorist governments, we send a message that the United States will in no way assist or endorse the activities of nations which threaten our interests. 
   Just last week, the American Farm Bureau and all State farm bureaus across the Nation released an ag recovery action plan. It requested $14 billion in emergency funding. I think it is a serious request. It is not a request that I take lightly. We are now considering proposals in the Congress from about $7- to $11 billion. We need to be addressing the emergency needs of farmers, but we also need to reduce our own barriers that our own farmers suffer under such as unilateral agricultural embargoes. 
   The USDA estimated that there has been a $1.2 billion annual decline in our economy during the mid-1990s as a result of these kinds of embargoes. The National Association of Wheat Growers estimated that sanctions have shut U.S. wheat farmers out of 10 percent of the world's wheat market. The Washington 
   Wheat Commission projects that if sanctions were lifted this year, our wheat farmers could export an additional 4.1 million metric tons of wheat, a value of almost half a billion dollars to the United States and to American farmers. American soybean farmers could capture a substantial part of the soybean market in sanctioned countries. For example, an estimated 90 percent of the demand for soybean meal in one country, 60 percent of the demand for soybeans in another. Soybean farmers' income could rise by an estimated $100- to $147 million annually, according to the American Soybean Association. 
   For us to raise barriers for the freedom of our farmers to market the things they produce and hold them hostage to our foreign policy objectives would require that we could get great foreign policy benefit from these objectives. And there isn't any clear benefit. 
   One of the most ironic of all the case studies about agricultural sanctions was the study of our grain embargo against the Soviet Union in the late 1970s. Indeed, there we were upset about activities in the Soviet Union, so we indicated we wouldn't sell to the Soviet Union the grain we had agreed to sell to them. It was something like 17 million tons. 
   It turns out that by canceling our agreements, the Soviets went to the world market, according to the best studies I know of, and they saved $250 million buying grain on the world market instead of buying it from us. So our embargo not only hurt our own farmers but aided the very country to which we had directed our sanction. It seems to me we should not be strengthening our targets when we are weakening American farmers through the imposition of unilateral sanctions on food and medicine--the idea somehow that we allow foreign governments to starve their people and to spend their resources on things that destabilize regions of the world, telling their people: We can't have food in this country, the U.S. won't sell us food, when I think we should be glad for any country to buy things like soybean and wheat and rice and corn so that they are not buying things that are used to destabilize their neighbors or weaponry and the like. I believe it is important for us to say to our farmers that we are not going to make them a pawn in the hands of people for international diplomacy. The rest of America continues to go merrily forward, and they are bearing the brunt because they operate in a world marketplace where there are markets for these commodities that, in the event the foreign powers want them, they get them and replace them very easily.  
   It is with that in mind that this amendment has been constructed, carefully constructed, and designed to respect the need for sanctions where they are appropriate. When we engage in sanctions multilaterally, this does not come into play. This is designed to affect unilateral sanctions on food and medicine, and it doesn't prohibit them. It simply says that in order for the President to impose them, he would have to gain the consent of the Congress. 
   I am pleased that there is a long list of individuals who have been willing to cosponsor this amendment with me. Frankly, this amendment is a combination of provisions that were in a measure Senator HAGEL of Nebraska and I had proposed. We have come together to work on it. Senator BAUCUS, Senator ROBERTS, Senator KERREY of Nebraska, Senator DODD of Connecticut, Senator BROWNBACK of Kansas, Senator GRAMS of Minnesota, Senator WARNER of Virginia, Senator LEAHY of Vermont, Senator CRAIG of Idaho, 
   Senator FITZGERALD of Illinois, Senator DORGAN, Senator SESSIONS, Senator LINCOLN of Arkansas, Senator LANDRIEU, Senator HARKIN, Senator CONRAD, Senator INHOFE and others have been willing to cosponsor this amendment. I think it is an important amendment. I am pleased to have this opportunity to offer the amendment. 
   I send the amendment to the desk.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Florida for his question. 
   This bill is to harmonize the regime of potential sanctions and basically requires an agreement by the President and the Congress for any unilateral sanction that would be expressed by this country against exporting agricultural or medicinal commodities to other countries. 
   This results in having to come back to reestablish any existing sanctions, and that has been considered in the drafting of this bill. This bill is not to go into effect for 180 days after it is signed by the President, to give time for the consideration of any sanctions that exist in the measure, and if the President and Congress agree that there are additional sanctions to be levied unilaterally against any of these countries, then those can in fact be achieved. 
   The intention of the bill is to give the Congress and the President the ability to so agree on those issues.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, in response to the inquiry of the Senator from Florida, it is clear that the intent of this bill and the language which would be carried forward is that sanctions should be the joint agreement between the Congress and the President. This bill does set aside existing sanctions and establish a singular regime in which sanctions would exist unless another bill or enactment changed that. 
   Now, a Congress in the future could impose, with the agreement of sanctions, sanctions in a regime that was contradictory to this bill because Congress always has the capacity to change the law. One law we pass today doesn't bind future Congresses from changing that law and future enactments. 
   I think the Senator from Florida is correct that this measure sets aside existing sanctions and requires that future sanctions, be they initiated by the Congress or by the President of the United States, involve an agreement between the executive and the legislative branches. There is a timeframe during which that is to happen provided for in this amendment.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. It is our intention, absent an agreement by the President of the United States and the Congress, to so embargo such sales. Such entities would be able to use their hard currency to buy from American producers, agricultural or medicinal products. Our underlying reasoning for that is that when these governments invest in soybeans or corn or rice or wheat, they are not buying explosives; they are not repressing their population. As a matter of fact, if we could get them to use all of their currency to buy American farm products instead of buying the capacity to repress their own people or destabilize other parts of the world, we want them to do that. The conspicuous absence here, obviously, is we will not provide credit for them which would release them to spend their hard currency in these counterproductive ways. 
   So the philosophy of this measure is such that we think any time these people will spend money on food and medicine, they are not spending their resources on other things which are much more threatening, not only to the United States but to the community of nations at large.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. No, I do not think so. I really think what we are saying is no matter how much money you have, if you are a terrorist state we would rather have you spend that money on food and medicine than we would have you spend that money on weaponry or destabilizing your surrounding territory. No matter how much money you have or you do not have, we are willing and pleased to have you spend that to acquire things that will keep you from oppressing individuals. 
   I suppose you could argue rich terrorist states are going to be better off than poor terrorist states. I think that is something that exists independent of this particular proposal of this particular amendment. Rich nations, be they good, bad or 
   indifferent, generally are better off than poor ones. But I think it is pretty clear that we do not have an intention of saying we are going to take a regime which is in power and we are going to sustain it by allowing it to displace what would otherwise be its purchases of food by providing credit so they can then use their hard currency to buy arms or other things that would be repressive. 
   Our intention is to make sure, if the money is spent, they spend it on food and medicine to the extent we can have them do so.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I think one of the things we have sought to do in this legislation is to indicate we are not at war with the people of many of these regimes. As a matter of fact, these regimes are at war with their people. Our intention is to be able to provide food and medicine to those people because we are not at war with them. As a matter of fact, too frequently their government is. 
   That means we are willing to sell it to them. We are willing to sell it to nongovernmental organizations, to commercial organizations, even to governments, if the governments will put up the money for it. I find that to be an acceptable indication that we are not against the people of these countries; we are against these countries' repressive, terrorist ways. 
   The terror is worse on their own people, in most of these cases. When we align ourselves with the people, align ourselves with the population in terms of their food and in terms of their health care and in terms of their medicine, that is good foreign policy. It shows the United States, while it will not endorse, fund or sustain, creditwise, a terrorist government, is not at war with people who happen to have to sustain the burden of living under a terrorist government. 
   So, yes, this allows people in those settings to make purchases if they have the capacity to do so. But it does not allow the government to command the credit of the United States, and in our view it should not.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Let me just say, if it is permissible for me to respond, I thank the Senator from Florida for his careful questioning and the opportunity to make a response. I think this is a very constructive way to handle this. 
   I do not think there is anything that is not humanitarian about allowing nongovernmental organizations, commercial organizations, to buy food so people can eat. I think that is humanitarian. I do not find that to be inconsistent with the title. I do not think in order to have the character of being assistance and humanitarian, they have to be gifts or they have to be credit guarantees. The mere fact that Americans would make possible the sale of vital medicinal supplies and vital food supplies in a world marketplace to people who are hungry and people who need medicinal care is humanitarian. 
   We do make it possible for certain kinds of nongovernmental organizations and commercial organizations to get credit, but we simply draw a line in extending credit to governments which have demonstrated themselves to be unwilling to observe the rules of human decency and have been perpetrators of international terrorism and propagators of the instability that such terrorism promotes in the world community. 
   So it is with that in mind that we want people to be able to eat, understanding that the United States is not at war with the people of the world but has very serious disagreements with terrorist governments. We want people to be able to get the right kind of medicinal help, understanding that we are not at war with people who are unhealthy and who need help medicinally, and understanding that when people get that kind of help, and understand that the United States is a part of it, it can be good foreign policy for the United States. 
   But we do not believe that addressing the needs of the Government itself, especially allowing them to take their hard currency to buy arms, by our providing them with credit guarantees for their purchase of foodstuffs, would be appropriate.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from Texas for her outstanding work correcting a pernicious discrimination against the most valuable institution in our society, the family. I thank the chairman for his sensitivity to this important issue, for placing in this bill procedures to remedy the marriage penalty. 
   The marriage penalty simply is an anomaly. It is a strangeness in the tax structure that has evolved, that penalizes people for being married. It puts them into higher tax brackets when they get married than when they were single. When people get married, they start paying a tax penalty. That is something we should stop. 
   The Senator from Texas and the chairman of this committee have agreed that we should stop it. And we should, as a matter of fact, according to the amendment of the Senator from Texas, of which I am an original cosponsor along with Senator BROWNBACK, accelerate the time at which we begin to stop this very serious fault with the tax system. 
   America should not penalize the family. It should not make it harder for people to have families. It should not make it financially more difficult for two people to be married and live together than unmarried and live together. That is a simple fact. It is because the family is the best department of social services, the best department of education; it is the best place in which individuals are enriched to learn individual responsibility and the values and character our culture needs to survive.  
   I am very pleased to be a part of this tax measure which will say about America's families that we cherish them rather than punish them and it is time for all of us to join together and eliminate the marriage tax penalty.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, this amendment simply eliminates from this bill a special tax cut aimed at foreign technologies for converting poultry waste into electricity. I agree with converting poultry waste into something useful, but I disagree with giving a tax break to foreign corporations when there are U.S. companies capable of achieving that end. 
   Two such companies exist in my home State. Agri-Cycle of Springfield, MO, processes chicken manure into pollution-free fertilizer pellets. The British company that wants to build the facility here and burn the waste claims they need the tax break because without it, they would not be able to expand here because they are used to large subsidies they receive from the British Government. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

I would also encourage the Chairman to include these essential provisions in the conference report.

This principle is consistent with the growing support for expansion of charitable choice and recognizes that empowering faith-based and other charities is an essential next step in welfare reform.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for her leadership in this respect. She has understood the challenge, the special challenge that comes to families as a result of this pernicious discrimination in our Tax Code. She has fought long and hard for its removal. I am honored to be a participant as a cosponsor of this amendment with her and Senator BROWNBACK. 
   I also thank the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, who understood the fundamental value that is expressed in neutralizing the tax policy toward families. I say ``neutralizing.'' I really mean that, in the sense that we have been at war with families in our Tax Code. Mr. President, 21 million American couples, 42 million Americans, are spending an average of $1,400 per year more, each couple, because of the marriage penalty. It makes it tough for that couple to make choices that they ought to be able to make to benefit their families. So I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, for placing this in the bill, for seeing to it that this category of remediation, this effort to repair an injury to the very fabric of America's culture, is included in this tax measure. 
   We would not be here this evening with the capacity to say we want to accelerate that remedy, that we want to provide this antidote to a malady which has been afflicting the American culture, we could not move it up in the bill had it not been there in the first place. I commend him. 
   I would like to just take us, for a minute, back to some very substantial fundamentals about America. I think the first of those fundamentals is that this is a culture where the most important things are not in Government. The most important things are not in the institutions of Government, not in the corporate responsibility of Government. The most important things are with individuals. This is a society that honors great freedom and expects great responsibility. 
   America has prospered. America is distinguished from, different from, differentiated from, we are different from other countries, other cultures. We have gone farther, we have soared father, for that reason. We expect individuals to do things for themselves; not to be reliant, always, on Government, but, where possible, to build the sense of independence, responsibility, judgment, self-reliance that makes Americans unique in the community we call the world. 
   When you believe the future of America is dependent upon that spirit, you have to ask yourself what are we going to fund in America? Are we going to fund the bureaucracy and the institution or are we going to fund the family and individuals? Are we going to give families the opportunity to take care of themselves or are we going to give all the resources to the sort of second best alternative? 
   I do not think there is a Member of this Chamber who would say it is ever better to have a vast Government program than it is to have a good family. I just do not think we have anyone who believes that because we know the family is the best Department of Education, it is the best Department of Health, it is the best teacher of responsibility and character, which is as important as anything else. It is where it really must happen. 
   Yet our Tax Code has been sweeping the resources away from this essential institution of the culture, the family, into the coffers of the Government, and plan B, the second priority, the 
   sort of safety net, has gotten all the resources. We have left in an anemic place the family, which ought to be doing the front-line defense. It would be similar to giving all the guns and weapons to the rear guard and not having the guys on the front line with any bullets. It is time to load the resources into the families, at least to give them a fair shake. It is just a fundamental part of America. We believe families are important. If we really get our job done in the families of America, Government will not really have much responsibility and much problem. 
   If we destroy the families of America, there is no amount of Government that will solve our problems. 
   So here we have a choice. Are we going to endow families with the resources they create, they earn? Are we going to let them keep some of those resources or, when they form these durable, lasting, persistent bonds and a relationship that teaches people how to rely on each other, to live with each other, how to be individually responsible and self-reliant, are we going to take that institution and continue to punish it? Or are we going to wake up and say: Hello, it is time for us to say about families we are going to let the families have some of the resources which they earn and they should keep. 
   I do not think it is a hard question. It is pretty simple. The proverbial rocket scientist is not needed here. It is an anomaly of our tax law. It is unfair to say the Congress at some point went forward to try to hurt families. But in this topsy-turvy tax environment that has grown by just a snippet here and a little piece there and a few hundred thousand words there--this Tax Code was, what, 750,000 words in 1955 and it is 5 million words now. You would have a hard time reading it if you started at birth and read as fast as Evelyn Woods to get through the thing before the end of your life. 
   So we have a situation where this code has grown up and it discriminates against families. It hurts families, and we have a great opportunity now, thanks to the chairman of the committee who placed this concept of remediating this pathology right here in this bill. 
   I predict Members on both sides of the aisle are going to say: We want to vote in favor of marriages; it is time to correct this inadvertent, but very damaging, prejudice against marriage in the Tax Code. 
   That is where we ought to be. No one in this Chamber believes that Government is more important than families. No one believes that our front line, in terms of developing this culture, is so unimportant that we ought to load all the resources to the guys at the back of the operation. We ought to put some of our ammunition in the hands of the front line. 
   Let's let families, let's let parents, who make these kinds of lasting commitments to each other and to their children, build an America tomorrow  which has all the promise of the America you and I inherited. 
   I will add that it is not a great tradition in America to discriminate against marriage. This has happened in the Tax Code as our tax bite on the American family has accelerated with the growth of social programs. It was not until the sixties that we had anything of a marriage penalty, and it began to get worse and worse until now, as I have indicated, $29 billion a year is what Government takes from families as it robs 21 million families of about $1,400 per couple, and it sweeps that money away from the families into the Government, into the bureaucracy, into the plan B, the second best, yes, important safety net. Yes, we need it, but let's not deprive the first line of this culture's conditions for greatness--the families--let's not deprive them of the resources they ought to have. 
   I thank Senator ROTH, chairman of the Finance Committee, for placing this concept in the bill. I thank Senator HUTCHISON from Texas for having been alert to this since before I came to the Senate. She was working hard in this respect. I am always delighted to be a part of any measure with Senator BROWNBACK whose sensitivity to the values and the need for character in this culture is unsurpassed. 
   I do not think Government should be dictating our culture and pounding in values, but, on the other hand, our Government should not be at war with our values, and it is time for us to call a peace conference around the kitchen table of America and say to husbands and wives: You have a very important job to do, and we want you to have the resources to do that job. We must eliminate the marriage penalty, and this bill, with the Hutchison-Brownback-Ashcroft amendment, can get that down. 
   I reserve the remainder of the time and yield the floor.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I thank my colleague for this opportunity to address what I consider to be a very important issue. Of all the freedoms we enjoy, I think the freedom to use and to spend and to devote the product of our own hands, the work we do to benefit our own families, is perhaps one of the most cherished freedoms of a free society. In our debates about the theories of government and resources and whether we should have tax cuts or increased taxes, sometimes we forget that it is a fundamental freedom--a cherished opportunity for individuals--to accept the incentive, the opportunity, and the responsibility of providing for themselves. 
   One of the things we want to provide for ourselves, obviously, is government, so that we have a framework in which to work, which protects our property, protects us, and protects our families. That is an important thing we do. 
   We have to be careful that we do not think we are working for government rather than for ourselves, or that government should do for us those things we can do for ourselves. 
   As we think about how we deal with the resources that are generated by the enterprise and the productivity of the American people, we ought to think about the American people and the fact that the fundamental freedom we cherish is being able to work, to produce something, and then to manage that which we produce for our own benefit.  We as a people have been so successful at it that we even are able to be generous with that which we produce. But it is our own generosity. America is the most giving nation in the world. Philanthropy here dwarfs philanthropy in other settings, but it is, in part, because we are allowed to keep that which we produce. Giving is greater here than any place on the planet because we allow people to keep that which they produce, to manage it for their own benefits and for their families, and then to give it according to their desires. 
   We stand on the threshold of a debate about what happens when a person works hard and creates something, creates resources, earns wages, creates wealth--that is what wages are. People earn that, they create it with work and decide how it will be devoted, what will happen to it. 
   We have a situation now where our Government has taxed the American people to such an extent that if those taxes are just collected over the next 10 years, we will have collected in that 10-year period about $3.3 trillion that we will not need to spend in that 10-year period. That is why we call it the general surplus, the sort of global surplus, the entirety of the surplus. 
   A number of us realized it would not be responsible to spend all of that, so we said: Wait a second, there is a part of that surplus which we will not spend, and that is the part that is the surplus related to Social Security. We said there will be no expenditures of the Social Security surplus. It sounds simple and it sounds like something that should always have been the case, but the truth of the matter is, for the first time in recent history, in memorable history, for the first time we had a budget in this body that said we are not going to spend the Social Security surplus. 
   Frankly, on this side of the aisle, I am very proud of the fact that we have been able to do that. It was not a budget that was voted for by the people on the other side of the aisle. They did not vote for that. That is not something they have ever done with one of their budgets or one of the things they have done with their leadership, but it is something they fought against. We have done it, and it is now an achievement of the Senate that we have a budget which is designed to protect every cent of Social Security, none of it to be spent to cover operating budget demands of this Government. That is a major achievement. That is something for which we can be grateful. 
   Secondly, we have a plan in place, even with the proposed tax relief for the American people, that will cut the national debt, 
   the publicly held debt of America, in half over the next 10 years. That is pretty responsible. They are talking about lots of things, saying we are not addressing the debt properly. 
   Never have I seen any budget in a previous setting ever purport to move forward to cut the deficit in half in the next 10 years. Very few families will try to pay off a mortgage in that period of time--very few. We have an opportunity now, very responsibly, to set aside Social Security, which the American people want us to do, to take the budget deficit of publicly held debt in this country, and cut it in half, paying down the publicly held debt by half in the next 10 years. And then we will have some money, some resources that are left over in this vast infusion of Government resource that has come from the people. What are we going to do with the rest of it? 
   The Republican plan simply says a good part of that, some significant part of it, ought to go back to the American people. They should be able to spend it on their families, to do for themselves what they do not need Government to do for them, because the best department of social services is the family, the best department of education is the family, the best department of health is the family. 
   Let's let our families operate. Let's fund families, not just bureaucracies. Let's fund people in their homes, not just the bureaucracy in its Government. That is what the Republican plan is. 
   There is a lot of debate now: If we can afford a tax cut for the next 10 years, we have to make sure we do not promise the American people we can have tax cuts on a permanent basis. 
   We are making this tax relief on very modest presumptions regarding the prosperity of this country. We are presuming a very modest growth, very limited. This is conservative. 
   It is not appropriate for us to say we will provide tax relief now and not provide it later. If we repeal the marriage penalty tax now, we should not repenalize you ten years later. That does not make sense. 
   We simply ought to put the tax rates where we believe they reflect the integrity of the American people and the productivity of the American people and the fact that the American people are now being asked to pay more than it costs to provide the service. And we ought to reduce them, and we ought to reduce them permanently, not on a piecemeal basis, not with an automatic reinstater of a tax which is the highest in history. 
   Why is it we are asked to have a tax cut and those on the other side of the aisle want to make sure we cannot make it permanent relief for the people, that we have to promise somehow that the highest rates in history will be revisited after a 10-year lapse? 
   I do not believe that is good government. I do not believe that is good judgment. 
   I believe when we lower taxes, when we lower the burden on the American people, we are beginning to direct the assets of the culture to America's families instead of governmental bureaucracy. It seems to me we ought to do that on a permanent basis. 
   I do not remember tax increases that have said they only last 10 years. It seems to me that when taxes have been raised in this culture, they are just raised. I think we would be well served to say we are going to provide a tax structure that respects families. We are not going to say we will take the marriage penalty out of the code for 10 years and then reimposed it. 
   If we are going to provide tax equity for people so that the lowest-rate taxpayers in America have an even lower rate, and more people are paying at that lower rate, we should not say this is a sale which goes off and later on your taxes will automatically be raised by some Congress in the future or at some certain date in the future. 
   It is time for us to say that the American people have simply paid in more than it takes to provide the services. When you pay in more than it takes to provide what you are buying, you get change. 
   I go to the grocery store. When I pay in more than it takes to buy the gallon of milk that I want to buy for my family, the grocer does not say to me: I tell you what I'm going to do for you. I'm going to give you a stalk of celery and a bag of broccoli and two boxes of cereal so you use up all the money you paid me. He says: You paid more than is necessary for the services, and you get change. You get a refund. You get relief. You get some of your resource back. 
   I think that is where we are as a Senate. It is time for us to look at this country, where our cost of government is higher than it has ever been in the history of this Republic, and to say that it is time to give people relief. That relief is appropriate. And it should be permanent, not relief upon which we could not rely, but that it should be relief upon which we can rely, plan, and build for our future. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you very much. I thank the Senator from Michigan. 
   Mr. President, it would be amusing, if it weren't tragic, to hear the representations made by those on the other side of the aisle that the Republicans are indifferent to our senior citizens and to Medicare, or indifferent to Social Security. 
   Let us not forget the Social Security lockbox is a Republican concept. 
   They come to us saying how aggressively they are supporting what happened in the House. It is about time they started to support a lockbox of some sort. They filibustered that at least six times previously to keep it from being here. It is time we have a lockbox. 
   We enacted a credible lockbox to protect Social Security so our seniors won't be jeopardized by a reckless sort of effort to spend. 
   There is real distress on the part of our colleagues on the Democrat side of this Chamber who are afraid we are not going to leave enough money to spend. Their spending habit is hard to break. 
   But I think we ought to understand the American people are paying in over the next 10 years $3.3 trillion of surplus, and they don't want to buy that much more government. They want some change to go to the store. 
   You by a gallon of milk, and you give them 10 bucks. You don't expect them to start adding other items to your order to fill up what you could have bought with your 10 bucks. You expect to get your money back when you pay in a surplus, and the American people should do that. 
   They suggested we don't have any money to deal with a Medicare problem. It is pretty clear we have $505 billion available to deal with Medicare, if we choose to, over the next 10 years. 
   Just for example, the President said he could fix it for $48 billion. And $505 billion is 10 times that much. But I don't recommend that we allocate a specific amount to fix Medicare before we have decided how to reform Medicare. 
   The Senator from Tennessee eloquently stated the position of the Comptroller General of the United States, our sort of auditor, the person who looks at things and asks: How are you doing? Is this reasonable? Does it make sense? 
   He indicates that just pouring more money into a system that is broken--well, you know, if you just step on the gas in a car that is going in the wrong direction, it doesn't get you to your destination any more quickly. The key is to reform Medicare and have a resource available when you reform it. That is the Republican plan. 
   Are we being irresponsible by taking 23.8 cents out of every surplus dollar and saying to the American people who earned it that we are going to return it? 
   There is an old slogan in Washington. ``You send it; we spend it.'' 
   People are a little tired of that. 
   We have the highest tax rate in the history of the country. Even State and local rates are higher in many cases caused by our mandates on State and local government. 
   We have a $3.3 trillion surplus, and someone says we should save tax cuts for when it is the right time for tax cuts as if the timing is contingent on the Government. 
   I tell you. It is the American people's money. Their 
   timing ought to be considered. 
   I think the American families need resources to do for themselves now, that they should have the money to do it for themselves, and not have to rely on government. We should make that choice. 
   I rise to say that this business about us not having a regard for Medicare should be dismissed. 
   We want to reform Medicare. We don't want to pour more resources into a bucket, the bottom of which is like a sieve. 
   Sure. We will do what we can to sustain the system. It is sustainable, according to the most recent data, until the year 2014. It is good. But we shouldn't decide to just pour money into that system. We should reform it. 
   There was a bipartisan commission led by Senator BREAUX that would have reformed it. The proposed reform led by Senator BREAUX wasn't to take a lot of money. As a matter of fact, it was to save money. 
   We are willing to make resources available. But the idea that somehow we have to lock up $300 billion in order to make possible a reform of the system when the $300 billion will keep people from wanting to reform it, and just wanting to spend what is there is not the way to handle the problem. 
   The chairman of the bipartisan commission, Senator BREAUX, I don't believe supported that provision when it was before the Finance Committee. I don't think we should support it now.  
   But it is time for us to say to the American people what we said in our budget process, what the Senate voted, I believe, 99-0 to do; and that is to lock up the Social Security surplus. 
   It is a program which we promised to the American people. It is a program that can go forward. We ought to have that resource available to them. We agreed on that. The House agreed on that. 
   Talk about the House agreement on the other side of the aisle, yes. This is what the House agreed to--lock up Social Security. I think that is what we ought to do. 
   We expect to have $2 trillion in Social Security surpluses over the next 10 years. We ought to make sure we don't spend it on anything else. That is the Republican plan. It ought to be the Republican plan. It is the Democrat plan, and the President's plan. The President agreed to it. He said we needed a durable lockbox, ``period.'' He didn't say a lockbox for Social Security and add Medicare. The President didn't say that. He said we need a Social Security lockbox, period. The ``period'' was his language, not mine. It is not some Republican plot. The President said it. The House of Representatives said it. The Republican Senate has been asking for it, filibustered on the other side of the aisle time after time after time after time after time after time, and now trying to keep us from doing it again. 
   I think we need to make sure we honor and respect the retirement security of individuals who expect us to protect Social Security. 
   Having done that, and we find out there is roughly half of the next 10 years' surplus that is not earmarked for Social Security and it is not paid in for Social Security, that money could be divided between tax relief and resources for contingencies that come up in this body, or to the United States Congress. That is why we planned $792 billion in tax relief. 
   Some say: Is that too much? Is it too little? It is 23-plus percent of the total surplus. 
   The lion's share of the total surplus should go right into this lockbox. This proposal that Senator DOMENICI, Senator ABRAHAM, I, and other Senators have been talking about, taking Social Security money and earmarking it for Social Security benefits alone, and then reserving the $505 billion that is available in addition to that for future contingencies and needs including, if necessary, transitional costs for reform in Medicare. The Senator from Tennessee eloquently related comments by the Comptroller General of the United States. 
   This is a resource we now have that we do not have a right to keep, in my judgment. The American people have overpaid their taxes. Like a shopkeeper, who has a responsibility to give back change when they are paid too much for an ordered item, rather than trying to foist off an extra gallon of milk, another ham or another box of cereal, another box of nails or hammer if you are at the hardware store, when a person has paid more for the item than requested, they get their money returned. 
   Return the money to the American people. The American people earned this money. This is not money that came from Government. This is not from the magic of the Congress. This is not from the creativity of the President. This isn't the product of the bureaucracy. This is the product of the hard work of American families. In many families, both parents work. In some families, both parents are working two jobs or extra work. They have sacrificed and sweat. It is their money. 
   We have to make a decision. Are we going to fund families in this country or are we going to fund bureaucracy? Are we going to let families have an opportunity to spend the resources which they have created? We must. In order for them to be confident about the fact we are not giving away the future, make clear that the President has said we need what the House of Representatives voted 416-12 in favor of, and that is a lockbox to protect Social Security. 
   With that in mind, I say we have a responsibility to the American people to put the Social Security proceeds in the lockbox, to have a prudent approach to the rest of the expenses. Say to the American people with that $800 billion over the next 10 years: You earned it; we returned it. Let's end this idea of: You send it; we spend it. Our desire and appetite should not be unlimited. 
   I thank the Chair for this opportunity to support the concept of a lockbox. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Chairman of the Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary Appropriations Subcommittee, for joining me to discuss the urgent need to provide funding for defense conversion in the greater St. Louis area. Over 7,000 Missourians are in danger of losing their jobs if the F-15 production line shuts down at the Boeing plant in St. Louis. These are high-paying, high-skilled jobs, and I am committed to doing everything I can to help these hard-working Missourians find other sources of employment in the greater St. Louis area. 
   These workers have helped keep America strong through their work on the F-15 and other military systems that are so integral to our national security. Their skill and knowledge are a national asset--a national asset which I think should be preserved through keeping the F-15 line open. I have worked toward that end, and Senator BOND and I successfully secured funding for additional F-15 purchases in the Defense Appropriations bill last month. But hundreds of F-15 workers will lose their jobs even with additional purchases of the plane, and those workers should be assisted in the transition process. 
   The distinguished Senator from New Hampshire is well aware of the Economic Development Administration (EDA) and the good work EDA does to facilitate economic adjustment in so many parts of the country.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I appreciate the Senator's reference to the defense conversion work performed by the EDA. In fact, EDA has assisted St. Louis before, as the regional economy has adjusted from defense layoffs over the past decade. St. Louis has one of the most effective and highly respected economic adjustment offices in the country, as the Defense and Commerce Departments would attest. The city has a demonstrated track record of using federal dollars effectively and is well-prepared to use EDA funding to meet the current, pressing needs of these F-15 workers. I would like to ask the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire if he will work with me in the coming months to address the defense conversion needs in the St. Louis area.

The future of this fighter, perhaps the most successful in the history of U.S. aviation warfare, is in jeopardy. While both the Senate and the House have taken steps to save the F-15, the Administration has resisted efforts to preserve a plan that is critical for our national security. 
   I was heartened by the recent action of the House Appropriations Committee to follow the Senate's lead and provide additional funding for the F-15. Last month, Senator BOND and I successfully added an amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill to provide $220 million for four F-15s. Last week, the House Appropriations Committee provided $440 million to purchase eight F-15 fighters.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his insightful comments. There are two distinct funds. To commingle those funds would be irresponsible--not only irresponsible, but it would go against the intentions of the American people in developing those two separate funds for separate purposes. I believe we should proceed to do what we responsibly should do with the money we have taken from the American people for Social Security, and that is to make sure that we spend the money for Social Security, for which we taxed the American people saying we would use it for Social Security. 
   We have spent a little time this morning in the Senate jargon of exchanges on procedure. It is enough to make the head of a Philadelphia lawyer swim, with all deference to the Senator from Pennsylvania. The American people are not interested in convoluted explanations of Senate procedure. They want to know why is it that this body alone stands between them and the integrity of protecting Social Security resources for the exclusive use of Social Security.  
   They have heard the President of the United States come forward--belatedly come forward, but he has come forward--and say: I want a lockbox for Social Security. Those are his words. Not a lockbox for Social Security that starts doing other things for other trust accounts, a lockbox for Social Security. 
   They have watched as the House of Representatives voted 416 to 12. Talk about bipartisan support; talk about a near unanimous vote. You have it in the House of Representatives. They see on the Republican side of the Senate a very strong desire, reflected now in our sixth effort to get the Democrats 
   to break the filibuster against reserving Social Security taxes for the use of Social Security. We are determined to keep voting to break this logjam. The American people have seen that everyone wants this: The President, the overwhelming majority of House Democrats, and Republicans, all but 12 of a 435-Member body want a lockbox, and we need it in the Senate. 
   President Clinton's budget this year, prior to his endorsement of the lockbox, would have spent $158 billion out of the Social Security trust fund over the next 5 years. That is the kind of thing we need to guard against. The President has now said we need to guard against that. 
   In March, Senator DOMENICI and I introduced S. 502, the Protect Social Security Benefits Act, which would have instituted a point of order preventing Congress from spending any Social Security dollars for non-Social Security purposes. In April, the Senate budget resolution included language endorsing the idea of locking away the Social Security surplus. The language in the Budget Act passed unanimously. Those on the other side of the aisle have passed this language already, including the point of order process. Also in April, Senators ABRAHAM, DOMENICI, and I introduced the Social Security lockbox amendment, about which we have been talking today. 
   In May, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed Congressman HERGER's measure to protect the Social Security surplus, and the vote there was 416 to 12. That is an amazing vote for the House of Representatives. 
   In late June, after Senate Democrats had blocked four efforts to proceed to the lockbox, after Senate Democrats had said, we won't let you move to this, President Clinton announced that he had changed his position and that he finally supported a lockbox that would protect 100 percent of the Social Security surplus. His quote is this: ``Social Security taxes should be saved for Social Security, period.'' Not Social Security taxes should be saved for Social Security and tax cuts, no, and Medicare, no, and anything else; it is Social Security, period. That happens to be what Senator ABRAHAM, along with Senator DOMENICI and I, has brought to the floor as an amendment. That happens to be what we are asking Senate Democrats to allow us to move forward on. 
   A few days after the President's announcement, we obtained a motion to proceed on the lockbox. But now we are faced, again, with the prospect of Senate Democrats blocking a forward motion on this lockbox concept. The House has voted for it. The President has come out in favor of it. Senate Republicans support it. The American people are demanding it. Senate Democrats still stand in the way. 
   Over the next 5 years, Social Security taxes will bring in an estimated $776 billion in surpluses--not just in revenue, $776 billion in surpluses. The lockbox would protect every dollar of those current Social Security surpluses for future obligations to America's retirees.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from Georgia. I thank the Senator from New York for his allowing me to accommodate a previously developed schedule. When I had asked for time during this special order, I had anticipated being able to begin at about 11, so I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues. 
   This morning the Senate voted on a Social Security lockbox to protect every dollar of Social Security, protect the surplus and the integrity of Social Security. We were not able to do that. We had a majority of the Senate vote in favor of it, but there is still the filibuster on the part of others who are unwilling to guarantee a vote on this issue. 
   The supporters of the lockbox believe the money Americans pay for Social Security ought to go for Social Security, period. That happens to be the language of the President of the United States who has endorsed that position. But Social Security taxes are only one of the many taxes, as we all know, that are placed upon the American people. Too many taxes, forms of taxation, proliferate in this place. These taxes place an enormous $1.8 trillion burden on the American people annually. That is 1.8 trillion, trillion being a thousand billions and a billion being a thousand millions. It is more money than one can virtually imagine. 
   These taxes also bring in more money than the Government needs. It is amazing. What we have is a Government which is charging more in taxes than it needs in order to provide services. I find it interesting that over the next 10 years there will be a trillion dollars more than are needed to provide the services we now provide. 
   Normally, if you go into a store and you give them $20 and you are buying something worth $8, they give you change. When you pay in excess of what you need to buy the product you are getting, they give you change. I think the U.S. Government ought to do that. We ought to say: There is a surplus coming in. The people have paid more than is needed for these services. We ought to give the money back. 
   If a store owner came to me and said: You have bought two bottles of milk and you get some change from your $10 bill, but instead of the change, I want to give you six more bottles of milk, I would say: Wait a second. 
   I think the American people want some change. They want change in the way Government is consuming their resources. I believe it is time for us to begin to address the idea that we have tax relief for the American people. 
   Never before in history have we paid as high a tax as we pay today--State, local, Federal taxes--and a lot of the State taxes are really disguised Federal taxes. I say that because the Federal Government forces the State governments to do things. Then the State government has to charge the people for that. The truth of the matter is, it is a mandate from the Federal Government. It is an expense occasioned by the demand of the Federal Government through the system. 
   And when you put all of our taxes together, they are higher than any time in the history of the country--higher than in wartime, the First World War, Second World War, Korean war, Vietnamese war, Gulf war; you name it, we are higher than ever before. Now, it seems to me we ought to be asking ourselves with whom we are at war. I had one taxpayer say to me: I think you are at war with the American people, because we are taxing them the way we are. 
   I think the American people deserve a break. The Republicans in Congress agree with that. We believe we should return the tax overpayment. Senator ROTH has offered an $800 billion tax cut over the next 10 years. This tax cut is deserved; it has been earned. The American people are the ones who are responsible. This Congress didn't create the surplus. The American people earned the surplus. It is just as if you hand $20 to the grocer and you are entitled to change; it is money you earned. 
   It is the same with the American people who are overpaying for Government services now, creating a surplus. It is money they earned. They earned it, and we should return it. So we should change the slogan of Washington from, ``You send it, we spend it,'' to, ``You earned it, we returned it.'' 
   I think one of the things we ought to do as we begin to provide relief to the American people is to scrub out of our system those things that are discriminatory and those things that are harmful, pernicious punishments in the Tax Code, especially punishments for things that are very important to our culture. One of those things is marriage. 
   I don't believe there is an institution in this country more important to the future of America than marriage. We want people to be married. We want the durable, lasting commitments of families to undergird this culture with the kind of principles and responsibilities and values that will keep us from having really serious social problems. I believe we will minimize the difficulties and trauma we have in this culture if we have strong marriages, things we need to minimize such as the tragedies we experience. 
   What we find out when we look at our Tax Code is, for the last several years Americans have been paying a tremendous penalty in taxes merely because they are married; $29 billion is paid by people as a penalty to the Tax Code simply because they are married, and 21 million couples pay that penalty. It is an average of $1,400 per couple, per year. That is over $100 a month. Think of the food, the shoes, the schoolbooks, the entertainment that could pay for. That is at least a very nice vacation for that family. Think of the relief to families if we simply say, we are not going to punish you for being married. 
   It is time for us in Congress to say that among those items of tax relief,  we sure ought to be doing something about the marriage penalty. This CRS study projected that over the next 10 years the average household will be paying $5,000 extra in taxes than it needs to pay. We ought to address that. 
   I think the Roth plan will return that hard-earned money to those who earned it, the American people. I urge the American people to call the Congress and urge us to give them the change they deserve, give them their money back. They earned it, and we should return it. It is time for us to get together with Senator ROTH and support an idea that he has, and get our ideas in that measure, of refunding the $800 billion in tax overpayments that the American people are scheduled to make in 
   just a very few years. 
   I thank the Senator from Georgia.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Republican Members for their effort on assembling a very good plan. It is a plan designed to protect the interests of individuals who receive their health care through HMOs. It is designed so that, if the HMO denies a particular kind of treatment as not being necessary, there is an appeals process, and the appeals process is first to the HMO, asking them to correct a faulty decision. But if the HMO does not respond constructively, there is an appeal to an independent appellate authority, an independent appeals officer. 
   I wanted to make sure the Republican bill's effort to have this appeals process, which gives people the chance to make sure they are treated fairly, has the right enforcement to it. The right enforcement, in my judgment, is to send people to treatment, not to send people to trial. It would be possible to have a big legal arrangement where the person does not get treatment, they die, and the relatives then go to court. Instead of getting treatment, you get a trial and you may get a lot of money, but you have a dead relative. I think it is important to understand this is a health care effort we are waging. 
   So I wanted to do some things to strengthen the enforcement provisions in the Republican proposal which relate to the 
   external review. That is the final appeal to a person outside the HMO, a qualified individual. This is what I think we must do. 
   First of all, we must make sure that the HMO acts promptly. While the Republican bill provides there should be certain designations within 5 days, there is a place where the HMO has to provide the reviewer, or the appeal authority, with the documents of the case. We put in a time limit on that. We put in a stiff penalty for failure to meet that time limit. It simply is saying we will not allow an HMO to drag its feet in order to avoid the review by an independent authority. So I wanted to make sure we had that. 
   Second, I want to make sure the person whose case is being reviewed has the right to present evidence to the appeal authority. I think this is implicit in the Republican bill, but I want it to be explicitly stated that when a person files a review petition, they have the right to say this is the reason you should set aside your judgment; this is the reason you should make a determination that the treatment is appropriate in my case--not only the person but the doctor who made the original decision. And that is important as well, making sure they are involved. 
   Then I want to make sure the person conducting the review of a physician's work would be a qualified physician or would be a person who was qualified to be the same kind of specialist the treating physician was so we would not have some bureaucrat or some individual who was interested in or more well trained, perhaps, in business making judgments about things that were medical. That is provided for in this particular matter. So it makes it clear we want to have the physician doing the kind of assessment in the appellate process. 
   However, I wanted also to make sure we had HMOs willing to carry through on the decision of the appeals process. I thought to myself, what if the patient lost the appeal in the HMO, made the appeal to the external authority--and this can be done very rapidly because the timeframes are tight in this instance, and should be, and we always include even expedited timeframes for medical exigencies-- 
   what if the appeal goes to the external appeal authority and then the HMO refuses to provide the treatment in spite of the determination by the external authority? 
   One option in that situation, I suppose, would be to say you go to court. But if you are sick and you call an ambulance, you expect the ambulance driver to take you to the hospital, not to the courtroom. What we need for people is not to be provided with a trial; we need people to be provided with treatment. 
   What we have done in this amendment is simply this: If you had this opportunity for an expeditious appeal that has gone through the HMO and the external authority, the external appeal officer is to write in any appellate decision a date by which treatment is to be commenced. If treatment is not commenced as of that date, the system converts to a fee-for-service system so the patient has the right to get whatever service is needed at the expense of the provider which failed to provide it in accordance with the directive of the appellate officer. 
   Furthermore, it provides a penalty, an immediate $10,000 payment to the patient--not to the Government, not to the Department of Labor, not to an administrating bureaucracy--to the patient for having been dislocated and for having arranged for other things. 
   The business of the HMO is to arrange for medical services, and this is a plan which simply says we are going to deliver to people medical services. We are not going to deliver them somewhere else. We do not want you to end up with a good lawsuit; we want you to end up with good health care. And if the HMO does not provide the health care in accordance with the appeal, then it is time we turn loose the patient who paid the premium, and that patient has the right to access the care of his or her choice to get it done, and the responsibility of payment for that falls upon the noncomplying health care provider in the HMO. That makes sense. Instead of getting a good lawsuit because you did not get health treatment and you got sick, you get good treatment. It seems to me that should be the objective to have. That is basically what we have done. 
   We have made sure there are time lines.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, that is kind of you, and I yield myself an extra 30 seconds. We made sure there are enforceable time lines. We have made sure physicians will be the appeals officers on the work of physicians. We have made sure the responsibility to deliver the process to the appellate appeals officers, both internal and external, is expedited. And we have made sure, in the event of noncompliance, the patient gets treatment. We convert the system to fee for service, and you can access treatment on your own. 
   It is with that in mind that I am pleased to conclude my remarks and yield to the Senator from Florida 5 minutes for his remarks.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, we have a great opportunity, which we will capitalize on this evening, by voting for this measure which has been the result of hard work by a team and task force of individuals dedicated to improving the health care of Americans and access to health care. I am grateful for it. I totally reject the notion that this is a victory for the status quo. One person can make this a victory for the status quo. Bill Clinton can. He could veto this. I do not believe we should think that he will. I believe we should continue to work and present him with this great opportunity to lift the status of health care of Americans. 
   One area I was concerned was that people ought to get the right treatment from HMOs and that, if they have a disagreement with an HMO, they ought to be able to settle that disagreement in a way that gets them treatment. So an appeals process was established for an internal appeal by the patient and an external appeal. 
   I sought to improve the bill. It did not include this provision, but I offered an amendment which said, if the external appeal agreed with the patient and said that the patient deserved the treatment and ordered the HMO to do it, and if the HMO would not provide the treatment--we have amended this bill now so the person is eligible to go and get the treatment elsewhere and charge the HMO, and the HMO that wrongfully refused the treatment to the patient has to give a $10,000 penalty payment to the patient. 
   This really gives the patient what the patient needs, health care. The Democratic proposal sends the patient to court. How disappointed would you be, as a person, if you called for an ambulance and you found them taking you to the court instead of to the hospital? 
   We do not want to end up with a dead relative and a good law case. We want to end up with good treatment, and that is what this bill will do. It has a strong set of enforcement provisions to respect the rights of individuals, and if the HMO fails to comply with that enforcement, we send the people to the hospital, not to the courtroom.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for her kind remarks and for allowing me to speak on this important issue. 
   Americans are now paying taxes at a higher rate than ever before. The burden and cost of the government are more, and the Federal Government is responsible for the overwhelming lion's share. As a matter of fact, we are not just responsible for the Federal taxes, because we have mandated so many programs on State and local governments we are responsible for a lot of what they are taxing people. So we are being taxed at the highest rates in history--at the highest rates in history. 
   Now we announced, in spite of that, we are paying more in those taxes than it costs to run Government. We are paying more in than it costs to fund the programs we are getting. If you go to a grocery store and you are buying $8 worth of groceries and you give them a $10 bill, you are paying more than it costs for the service and they give you a couple of dollars in change. 
   There is a stunning debate in Washington. We are debating over whether or not to give people the change back. They are paying more than is required for the programs they have requested, and we are debating whether or not we are going to give them the change back. We ought to give the money back. They own it. They have overpaid. 
   No. 1, we are paying the highest taxes in history. No. 2, those taxes pay for more than what our programs cost; therefore, we are overpaying. No. 3, we ought to refund that overpayment to the American people. 
   I submit among those who ought to be the first in line to get money back are those who have been particularly abused, those who have been the subject of discrimination, those who have been the subject of wrongful taking of the money by Government. That is where you come to this class of people who are not normally thought of as being a special class. They are married people. Forty-two percent of all the married people in the United States end up penalized for being married. That is 21 million families. Mr. President, 21 million families pay an average of over $100 a month--that is $1,400 a year--because we have what is called the marriage penalty tax. 
   Before we decide on tax relief for the population generally, let's take some of these gross inequities out of the system, especially inequities that target one of the most important, if not the most important, components of the community we call America--our families. Our families are the most important department of social services, the most important department of education. The most important fundamental component of the culture is the family. It is where we will either succeed or fail in the next century. Our Tax Code has been focusing on those families and has been saying we are going to take from you more than we would take from anybody else. 
   This idea of penalizing people for being married is a bankrupt idea, and it is time to take the marriage penalty part of this law and administer the death penalty to the marriage tax. 
   I say it is time for us to end the marriage penalty. This will mean a substantial improvement in income for people who have been suffering discrimination because they are married. It is time for us to end the marriage penalty in the tax law.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for his outstanding leadership on this issue. 
   Today the Senate will vote for the fifth time to stop filibusters on legislation to protect Social Security trust funds. It is time for us to stop, to end the delay. It is time for us to align ourselves with the American people who overwhelmingly want us to protect the money they put into the Social Security trust fund and to reserve it for Social Security payments. We should pass this bill so protecting Social Security will be the law of the land. It is time to build a tough law, a firewall if you will, between politicians' desires to spend and the Social Security trust fund. 
   There is no addiction more pervasive in this city than the spending of money. It is a tough habit to break, but we are in a position to do so. We are in a position to say we can manage our affairs without this money; let us make a commitment forever to break this habit of spending the Social Security trust funds. 
   President Clinton's proposed budget in January would have spent $158 billion in Social Security surplus over the next 5 years out of the trust fund, but, thank goodness, this last week President Clinton announced that he does not want to do that. That concept is no longer his plan. Instead of spending that $158 billion over 5 years in other projects, he said he wants to reserve it for Social Security--every penny for Social Security. ``Social Security taxes should be saved for Social Security, period.'' 
   What a tremendous concept. It is one which we have been working on and we have been working to pass. The President has announced his support for it. It is a general concept which the House of Representatives has supported. In its recent vote a couple weeks ago, the House voted 416-12. 
   We look for bipartisan things to do in this city, things that unite us instead of divide us, things that mobilize the American people, things that find common objectives and common ground. Here is an item the American people overwhelmingly endorse. Here is an item on which the House of Representatives really reflects the American people, 416-12. That is an overwhelming vote. And the President of the United States endorses the lockbox. 
   What is interesting is that the President's endorsement is of the lockbox. He just did not say we should not spend Social Security as a general concept or a general idea or a principle by which we operate Government. When we talk about a lockbox, we are talking about institutionalizing the prohibition, not just saying this is something we hope to do in future years. By saying we want to build a lockbox, we have to build a structure for protecting Social Security, and that is something the President has said he wants--a structure, a lockbox, something that keeps us from making these expenditures. 
   For the past 6 months, this Congress has been devoted to protecting all the Social Security surplus. In January, congressional Republicans began working to ensure that Congress would protect every penny of the surplus. In March, Senator DOMENICI and I introduced S. 502, called the Protect Social Security Benefits Act, which would have instituted a point of order preventing Congress from spending any Social Security dollars for non-Social Security purposes. 
   What does a point of order mean? A point of order means that if there is a point of order and someone tries to do it, the Chair, the Presiding Officer, can say it is out of order. Most Americans have been part of some kind of meeting somewhere when someone brought something up that was out of order. The gavel goes down, and the person presiding over the meeting says: We are not going to discuss that; that is not a part of what we do. There is a point of order against it. It is out of order, and you move on to something else. 
   That is the way we propose to treat proposals that will spend the Social Security surplus. We will simply say: We don't do that; it is against our rules; it is out of order, we will move on to something else. That was S. 502. 
   Then in April, together with Senator DOMENICI, the Senate 
    passed a budget resolution that did not spend any of the Social Security surpluses for the next decade. Included in the resolution was language endorsing the idea of locking away the Social Security surpluses, sort of a rules of the Senate lockbox but not a statutory lockbox. A statutory lockbox, of course, would bind the House, the Senate, and the President. This language passed the Senate with unanimous approval. 
   Also in April, Senators ABRAHAM, DOMENICI, and I offered the Social Security lockbox amendment which would have added executive responsibilities to the congressional requirement to protect the Social Security surpluses. By ``executive responsibilities,'' we were really saying the President had to submit a budget that did not invade the Social Security surplus as part of the President's plan. 
   The Senate has voted on the Abraham-Domenici-Ashcroft plan three times so far, and I believe we will agree to the motion to proceed today. But until today, the Senate has filibustered, has said we will not go there. Frankly, the President of the United States wants to go there, the American people want to go there. The President had the courage to reverse his position, first saying, ``I want to spend some of that money,'' then saying, ``No, we should reserve every cent for Social Security, period.'' 
   On May 26, the House of Representatives, reflecting, I believe, the people of America--and that is really what we are supposed to do in many respects; that is why we are sent here--overwhelmingly passed H.R..1259, Congressman HERGER'S measure to protect the surpluses. The vote in that case, as I have already mentioned, was 416-12. That means for every 100 votes in favor of the measure, there were only 3 votes against the measure. Mr. President, 100 to 3 is a pretty strong margin. That is a bipartisan consensus. This reflects the will of the people. 
   On June 10, Democrats in the Senate blocked the Herger measure. They voted against moving even to consider it. 
   It is time we stop this kind of parliamentary maneuver. We all know what the will of the American people is. We know what the clear statement of the President of the United States is. We know what we have done on five previous occasions, refusing to discuss it. Today we should vote to move forward on this issue. 
   The lockbox will accomplish an important goal: Protect Social Security taxes. It will reserve those taxes for Social Security, and Social Security alone, so that when someday those who need Social Security want to call on this Government for the payment of their benefit, the Government will be stronger, having less debt, having more discipline, having a greater capacity to meet its obligations and to honor the commitments made under Social Security. 
   Those who say they want to protect Social Security should join us in our efforts to save every dime--no, let me correct that--every penny, every cent of this money for Social Security's future beneficiaries. This lockbox is a way to make this happen. 
   Congress has been moving to create a Social Security lockbox this entire year. President Clinton has now stated he agrees with us, and I welcome the support of the President and Senate Democrats in finishing the Nation's business in supporting the toughest possible lockbox measure, one that protects not 20 percent, not 40 percent, not 60 percent, not 80 percent, not 99 percent, but 100 percent of the Social Security 
   surpluses, protects them so they are available to meet the responsibilities of the Social Security system. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time of those in support of the motion.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for accommodating me from the time reserved for his control. 
   I am glad for the opportunity to stand in the Senate today to honor Rabbi Morris Sherer, who passed away on May 17 last year. Today, I believe the very best way to pay tribute to Rabbi Sherer's memory is to celebrate his inspiring accomplishments. 
   When Rabbi Sherer became the executive vice president of Agudath Israel in America in 1941, the organization was but a small group with but a few members. Rabbi Sherer transformed Agudath Israel from the small organization that it was in 1941 to a respected and influential force in the culture and community we call America in both our political and religious life. 
   Rabbi Sherer's success came primarily from two strong leadership characteristics or character traits for which he was most respected. One was that he was not one just to talk about something. He would do something. He was an activist. Second, he knew getting something done required more than just activism or motivation or inspiration. It required persistence. He could stay with a task until there was an achievement. 
   One often cited example of Rabbi Sherer's activism occurred almost immediately after he became a part of the leadership of Agudath Israel. During Hitler's reign of terror, when all too many here and around the world remained silent about the unspeakable atrocities committed against the Jews in Eastern Europe, Rabbi Sherer spoke and insisted that action was necessary. 
   While Rabbi Sherer attempted to get others involved in his efforts, he always understood that he must take the initiative and lead, and whether others would be involved or not was not the criterion for his own involvement. He knew that real leadership required the ability and willingness to stand alone. He knew he could not simply wait for someone else to do what he believed should be done. 
   With his still tiny organization, he sent shipments of food 
   to Jews suffering under the terrible injustices of Hitler's regime, and he helped many to escape to gain refuge here in the United States of America. 
   Not only was Rabbi Sherer a man of action, but he was a man of persistence. He followed through. When the war ended, he didn't forget about the brothers and sisters who still remained in the ruins of Europe. Under his leadership, Agudath Israel shipped food and religious articles to Jews in displaced persons camps and he helped those who wanted to emigrate. 
   Rabbi Sherer's story, as we all know, continues in this same line and his philosophy of activism and persistence guided Agudath Israel in America for decades. He fought on behalf of Jews endangered behind the Iron Curtain, those who were endangered in Syria, Iran, and anywhere in the world where he saw that injustice was an imposition upon the liberties of individuals and discrimination that deprived individuals of their opportunity to reach the potential that God placed within. 
   He brought this attitude with him as he ascended to the presidency of Agudath Israel of America in 1963 and to the chairmanship of Agudath Israel World Organization in 1980. 
   In all of these roles, Rabbi Sherer demonstrated the unique talent, unique character that provided him with the capacity to unite people from disparate backgrounds and interests. While this was partially a result of his contagious warm personality and charisma, there was something deeper, too. People knew him as a man of integrity. This was rare ore, precious metal to be mined out of the character of this great leader. Though they might have disagreed adamantly with his views, they had to respect the purity of his position, his sincerity and his honesty. 
   This loyalty and integrity often placed him at odds with or at other times in alliances with unlikely groups. This, however, was Rabbi Sherer's great charm. This is why he was so highly respected. He was loyal and passionate about ideas and truth, never letting political maneuvering get in the way of his ultimate mission. 
   I am pleased to be on the Senate floor to honor Rabbi Sherer's memory. He taught us that in the face of injustice we must act; in the face of failure, we must persist. 
   When the battle is over, he taught us there is still a war to fight: to continue to bind up those who had been injured, those who had been separated, and those who had suffered. 
   Finally, he taught us that there is a way to achieve success and ultimately respect. It is not by trying to appease all sides but by standing firm in one's convictions and holding fast to one's beliefs. 
   That is the legacy of Rabbi Moshe Sherer. That is what he passed on to Agudath Israel and to all here today who respect his wondrous accomplishment and his faith. 
   I am delighted and personally privileged to have the opportunity from this podium, in this body, to extend my condolences again to Rabbi Sherer's wife, children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren, and to recommend his stature, his principle, his integrity, his persistence, and his activism as models to all Americans. 
   I thank the Senator from New York for according me this time and this privilege. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I am delighted to commend the Senator from Georgia for his outstanding remarks. He is right about giving people a chance to spend their own money in the way they choose to spend it. 
   So much of our so-called tax relief from time to time is given in ways that try to coach people that they should have it the way we want it done. Freedom is the ability to spend one's own resources the way one particularly wants to spend them. So I am delighted with his remarks. 
   I rise today in support of Congress' plan to provide over $778 billion in tax cuts over the next 10 years. 
   The President has already announced that the budget surplus will be larger than expected. This onbudget surplus is another name for a tax overpayment. Talk about a budget surplus. It means we are collecting more than we need. 
   Having collected more than we need from the people who worked hard, the least we could do would be to give it back to them. When you go into a business and hand a $10 bill to the clerk for a $7 item, they don't say: Well, we are going to increase your spending level. We are going to throw in four extra pairs of shoelaces and a can of polish, if you are in a shoe store. They say: No, here is your change. This is your money. You have overpaid. 
   That is where we are. In the days ahead, Congress will be deciding what to do. Are we going to try to find more ways to spend the money the people have earned or are we going to say our faith is in families; we are going to focus the resources of this country where we have our faith, and that is in the private sector and in families? That is what has made America great. 
   Or are we going to say our real faith is in bureaucracy; we are going to take more of this money and fund bureaucracy? 
   I think it is time for us to think about funding families, not funding bureaucracies; funding Main Street, not funding Washington, DC. When we have challenges in this country, I think all of us know they aren't going to be solved by government. As terrible as Littleton, CO, was and is, the real challenge is a cultural challenge. 
   We need strong families with the right values. We don't need stronger government bureaucracies. If bureaucracies could have solved the Littleton situation and many other challenges, we would have expected to have no challenges by now because we have great bureaucracies. We have more bureaucracy in America than ever before, but we have greater problems. 
   Instead of the high tax load that really almost forces the second parent to be in the workforce, maybe we ought to think about allowing people to keep some of the money they earn so they don't have to have both parents working and competing with the needs children have for the shaping, the nurturing, the developing, the teaching, and the parenting that is so necessary. 
   This year, the average American will have to work 173 days just to pay for government. This includes the burdens of Federal taxes, State taxes, and local taxes. We pay more in taxes than at any other time in history. 
   Some people say: Well, there was a year or two in the Second World War. I dispute that. I don't think they are counting local taxes as well. Some people say: What does the Congress have to do with local taxes? Very frankly, a good bit of the load of taxes at the State and local level is a result of Federal mandates, the Federal Government wanting to force things to be done by government and the bureaucracy, not having the courage to charge for it but just saying to the States: You must get this done. 
   It is sort of similar to going in to order something without paying for it. We have done that at the Federal level. It is a shame, but it has happened. 
   It is time for us to say that we need to allow some of the individuals who have built this great Nation to enjoy the fruits of their own labors. When we have overcollected, we have taken more than we need. We have a surplus. Let us give the folks the change back instead of trying to force them to buy more 
   bureaucracy, which they didn't want, didn't order, and don't need. They do need the capacity in families. 
   According to a Congressional Research Service study, the surplus means that the average household will be paying $5,000 more in taxes over the next 10 years than the government needs. Well, let's just let the American people have some of that money back. 
   I want to go quickly to one of the most important things we can do to correct a serious error of our Tax Code. For a long time, Members of this body have understood that our Tax Code penalizes people for being married. The way the Tax Code is administered, there is what is called a marriage penalty for people who enter the durable, lasting relationship of marriage, which is the place where children learn and where society and the social order, our culture, renews itself--in durable, lasting, committed marriages. They get taxed more heavily, very frequently, than if they were not married. That is called the marriage penalty. 
   I may not be one for lots of little nuances in the Tax Code, but it is time for us to take this massive prejudice out of the Tax Code that charges people elevated rates because they are doing the thing government most needs. If government is to promote safety and the stability of the community so people can reach the potential that God has placed within them--and that is what I think government is for--the family does that more effectively and in concert with government better than anybody else. If anything, marriage ought to be the subject of a subsidy, not the pernicious recipient of a penalty that punishes people for being married. 
   I know KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, the Senator from Texas, has focused for  years on this idea. I have been one who has stood up to say that we ought to focus on this idea. If we have an opportunity to let people keep some of what they earn, let us stop punishing people for the persistent, durable commitment of dedicated marriage that is fundamental to the success of this society in the next century. That would be a tremendous first step. 
   We all know that we are paying more in taxes than ever before. We have watched, as the tax burden has gone up, families struggle to meet their responsibilities, moms and dads trying to juggle how they can accommodate their schedules and still raise a family. Finally, the second parent goes into the workforce to make ends meet because government demands so substantially. 
   Let us give the American family the kind of tax relief that allows families to make America great again and to make their own decisions. It is with that in mind that I think one of the tremendous opportunities we have is the opportunity to abolish the marriage penalty in the tax law. 
   I urge my colleagues, as we consider our responsibilities, to relieve American marriages of this pernicious penalty which punishes people for doing that which we all need. 
   I thank the Senator from Minnesota and the Presiding Officer.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today is a great day for American taxpayers and especially for senior citizens. I come to the floor to welcome the President's endorsement of the lockbox plan to protect the Social Security surplus. I am gratified to hear that he now agrees with our congressional effort to protect every dollar of the current Social Security surplus for future obligations that the Social Security trust fund has to America's retirees. 
   I believe the President's statement today can lead to a bipartisan agreement to protect Social Security. It is a fact that the President's statement today reverses his earlier policy to use $158 billion out of the Social Security trust fund surpluses over the next 5 years to finance increased spending. So this is welcome news. It is good news. It provides us with the basis for an agreement and the achievement of a public good--to help American citizens, particularly older Americans, in their concerns about their retirement. 
   When the President first submitted his budget proposal that included spending, instead of saving, a portion of the Social Security surplus, congressional Republicans, in the House and in the Senate, began working to ensure that every dollar--not just some of the money but every dollar--of the forthcoming Social Security surplus was reserved for one thing--for Social Security. 
   In March, Senator DOMENICI and I introduced S. 502, the Protect Social Security Benefits Act, which would have instituted a point of order preventing Congress from spending any Social Security dollars for non-Social Security purposes. 
   In April, under the strong direction of Senator DOMENICI, the Senate passed a budget resolution that did not spend any of the Social Security surpluses for the next decade, and included in the resolution was language endorsing the idea of locking away the Social Security surpluses. This language passed with the unanimous approval of the Senate. 
   Also in April, Senators ABRAHAM and DOMENICI and I introduced the Social Security lockbox amendment which would have added executive responsibilities to the congressional requirement to protect Social Security surpluses. That executive responsibility would have demanded that the President submit budgets that did not invade the Social Security surplus as a means of covering deficits in the rest of Government. The Senate has voted on the Abraham-Domenici-Ashcroft plan three times, and the measure has yet to win a single Democratic vote. 
   On May 26, the House overwhelmingly passed H.R. 1259. That was Congressman HERGER's measure to protect the surpluses of Social Security. It did so in a bipartisan vote in the House, a vote of 416 to 12. On June 10, the Democrats in the Senate blocked the Herger measure as well, just as they had blocked the measures which had been proposed in this body. But the House, in a bipartisan way, voted 416 to 12. 
   These repeated votes on a Social Security lockbox demonstrate congressional Republicans' dedication to protecting every dollar of the projected Social Security surpluses and using them to shore up the Social Security system. It is essential to protect Social Security so we can ensure the long-term viability of America's most vital social program. We must restore the public's confidence that money paid into Social Security will be paid out only for Social Security benefits. The lockbox would accomplish this important goal. 
   Over the next 5 years, Social Security taxes will bring in an estimated $776 billion in surpluses. Those who say they want to protect Social Security should join us in our efforts to create this lockbox so that every dime, every cent, of this money for Social Security, paid in for Social Security, will be reserved for Social Security's future beneficiaries. 
   The lockbox is the way to make this happen. 
   The Congress is and has been moving to create a Social Security lockbox for this entire year. The President's staff said yesterday that the President will unveil his own Social Security lockbox proposal. If the President does, indeed, have a plan he wishes to offer, I urge him to bring it to Congress immediately so we can examine it and perhaps even vote on it before the Independence Day district work period for the Congress. If he does not have his own plan, I urge the President to support the existing congressional lockbox proposals, one of which has already passed the House with substantial momentum; 416 to 12 is not a vote to be disregarded. In spite of that, it has been disregarded by those on the other side of the aisle in the Senate. 
   In addition, I ask that the President reach out to his Democratic colleagues, now that he has joined the idea of building a lockbox, and a strong one, to protect Social Security and urge the Democrat Members of the Senate to support efforts to protect Social Security. This is the best way to ensure Social Security's financial integrity for this and future generations. 
   Again, I say that the American people are the winners when the President of the United States announces that he will support the efforts in Congress to protect all of the Social Security surplus, basically changing his position from spending $158 billion over the next 5 years to saying that he wants to stop the raid and no longer cover shortfalls in Federal spending programs by using Social Security surpluses. 
   The President's Rose Garden announcement is welcome news. It is a rosy scenario, if it can be carried out.  I urge President Clinton to join us in demonstrating his commitment to Social Security protection by backing the congressional Social Security lockbox, which we have been working so carefully to bring into place, as a means of protecting Social Security taxes that people across America work day after day after day to pay. They should be entitled to look forward to the day when those taxes will come back to them in terms of Social Security retirement benefits.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield myself as much of the 25 minutes as may be necessary to make my point. 
   I rise today with substantial concern and significant frustration. The pending business before the Senate is the agriculture appropriations bill. 
   But for the second day in a row, it appears that we will not work on this important legislation. Those on the other side of the aisle have said they will not let any legislative work get done until they are able to have, apparently, an unlimited debate on a so-called Bill of Rights for health care patients. 
   Those on the other side claim that they must have a debate on their bill, but that is not the point. What they are really doing is thwarting this body, the Senate, in its constitutional duty to pass appropriations bills so that we can make sure that important components of our Government remain viable and continue to do their job. 
   The agriculture appropriation bill is a very important measure, not just in one State in America but in every State in America. Let me remind all Senators that our responsibility to pass appropriations bills is defined by the U.S. Constitution, which requires ``appropriations made by law''--that means we have to pass them--``prior to the expenditure of any money from the Federal Treasury.'' That is article I, section 9. 
   I see nothing in my reading of the Constitution that says the Senate must have unlimited debate on some other issue of interest or that the Senate even has the authority to speak on all the issues between a patient and a doctor. 
   Granted, we have until October 1 to conclude the appropriations process. That seems like a long way off, summer having just started. But I am not sure exactly why we would be dragging our feet now, because I am sure I do not have to remind anybody of what happened last October when we did not do our work early. Congress did not complete its job on time, and the American people are the ones who ended up paying for our irresponsibility with a $20 billion-some so-called emergency appropriation that came when, instead of constitutionally addressing our responsibility on appropriations, the President and a few Members of this body combined to invade the Social Security trust fund for about $22 billion in emergency spending. 
   Members on both sides of the aisle complained bitterly for months about the process and the outcome. Members from both sides pledged to work together to make sure that history did not repeat itself this year. 
   I commend the leadership and the Appropriations Committee for the wonderful start that has been made on the appropriations bills. It is June 24, and the Senate has passed four appropriations bills and has five more ready for the floor. If those on the other side ever allow us to return to our duties, we can do the job and do it well. 
   Let me caution all of us that summer will pass quickly. We should not put off our responsibilities. We are sent here by our constituents to do our jobs for  them, not to sit in endless quorum calls and have days of morning business because some group wants a special interest measure to be addressed and demands unlimited debate without any end in sight. 
   In addition, I am concerned that certain Senators are holding this agriculture appropriations bill hostage at a time when many in our farm communities are undergoing great hardship. America may be in the midst of great prosperity, but it is not a prosperity that has reached the farms. Many of our farmers are working harder and harder, and times are tougher and tougher, not better and better. 
   Just a few months ago, we passed an emergency supplemental appropriations bill that dealt, in part, with the crisis in the agriculture sector. Members on both sides of the aisle agree 
   that farm families are not enjoying the prosperity that other Americans have recently been enjoying. So this is not the time for the Senate to deal another blow to those who are already hurting. It is not the time for the Senate to kick agriculture while it is down. We need to stand up for our farmers, and we need to stand up for our ranchers, not to try to make political hay out of an issue unrelated to agriculture on the agriculture appropriations bill. 
   Since we are not on the agriculture appropriations bill, and I am not sure when we will return to it, I want to spend a few minutes talking about an amendment I plan to offer to the agriculture appropriations bill. It is an amendment that will help farmers by opening, and keeping open, foreign markets to their goods. 
   I want to discuss a commitment the Congress made to America's farmers and ranchers when we passed the Freedom to Farm bill 3 years ago. Then, we promised that as the Government reduced farmer price support programs, we would ensure that farmers had ascending opportunities to be competitive in international markets. As we withdrew the Government involvement in farming, we would expand the opportunities for farmers in markets overseas. This was a promise to open new markets. However, in order to do so, we had to not only remove foreign barriers to U.S. farmers and ranchers, we needed to remove our own barriers to U.S. exports of farm goods. Removing U.S. barriers means agricultural sanctions reform, which is important to America's farmers and ranchers, and especially important to me as a Member who represents a farm State. 
   For more than 200 years, farmers and ranchers have been vital to the growth and the economic prosperity of the United States. We were an export country, agriculturally, from the beginning. We always responded to challenges in our competitive free market system. I believe the United States has the best farmers in the world--first class in production, processing, marketing, both abroad and at home. However, we are now seeing the effects of depressed farm prices across the Nation. No doubt, we need to face the crisis head on, but while we are passing multiple spending bills this year, there are some basic questions we should answer: 
   Have we done everything we can to allow farmers to be independent, to allow farmers to have the freedom to compete, to give them opportunities and not just send them money, to consider the long-term well-being of family farms? In the absence of us fulfilling our promise to open markets, is our spending merely keeping farms solvent this year only to be lost in the future? 
   We have had 3 years to answer these questions, and the answer to all of them is still a resounding no. 
   The administration and the Congress have many words about open markets and more export opportunities, but our actions have been to bog ourselves down with turf battles and procedural maneuvering. How can we explain this to the agricultural community across America? How can we tell our family farmers in the Midwest, in Missouri, in the Far West, or in the East and the South, that we really want to give them increasing opportunity in world markets, and then thwart our own goal with institutional barricades, and tell them we want to sell abroad but forbid them to sell abroad by having embargoes of our own products, sanctions against countries that are unnecessary and counterproductive, so it makes it impossible for them to have 
   the same markets they would otherwise enjoy? 
   I believe we must enact reforms that give farmers and ranchers the opportunity both to be productive and to be competitive. Such reforms will strengthen farm families. I believe these policies are ones rooted in the American tradition of increasing opportunity. 
   One-hundred-plus years ago, my grandfather, John M. ``Cap''--they called him Cap--Larsen left northern Norway as a 13-year-old to sail the high seas. He changed his name and, with all his earthly endowment contained in a duffel bag, he switched ships and boarded one destined for the United States as a crew member. He could not speak the language, but he knew that America was a place of ascending opportunity, and he came here. 
   We have a responsibility to America to keep our opportunity growing. We can't keep our opportunity growing if we are closing the markets in which American farmers can sell their produce. So, clearly, our opportunity is to say to American farmers--and I would like to say to Missouri farmers--we want you to have an opportunity to sell your goods in as many places as is possible. 
   The agricultural industry is the backbone of my State's economy, accounting for more than $4 billion annually. 
   While the United States can produce more food than any other country, we account for only 5 percent of the world's consuming population. That leaves 95 percent of the world's consumers outside of our borders. This is an astounding statistic when we put it in terms of creating opportunities. Exports account for 30 percent of the gross cash receipts for America's farmers, and nearly 40 percent of all U.S. agricultural production is exported. However, with the consuming capacity of the world largely outside our borders, our farmers and ranchers need increasing access to foreign demand. 
   Farmers and ranchers tell me repeatedly that they want more of our help abroad and less of our interference on their farms. They need us to open foreign markets, and they need us to keep those markets open. 
   Our first task--opening foreign markets--looms before us like a brick barricade. With the same will and authority of President Reagan before the Berlin Wall--when he said, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall''--we must face head-on the barricades before our farmers and ranchers. It is not an easy task, but then again neither was dismantling the Evil Empire. 
   The Europeans are standing on their massive wall of protectionism built across the trail of free trade and simply rejecting U.S. beef. For example, May 13 was the last date for them, according to the orders from the World Trade Organization, in which they had exhausted every appeal. That was the last day for them to finally say they will accept U.S. beef. They refused to do so. 
   We have to blaze a trail. The Europeans cannot be allowed 
   to make a mockery of our competitive spirit, especially that of our cattle ranchers. 
   Our second task--keeping markets open--is why my colleagues and I are here on the floor today. The picture of ascending opportunity for farmers is incomplete without a view of foreign markets unimpaired by U.S. embargoes. 
   We have gone from the idea of trade barriers on the part of the Europeans to embargoes on the part of the United States. We keep a number of our farm products from being sold around the world, and unnecessarily. 
   I might add that using food and medicine as weapons creates a cumbersome trail, an environment of descending opportunities. Agricultural embargoes amount to a denial of much-needed food and medicine for the innocent people of foreign lands with whom we have no quarrel and to a unilateral disarmament of the farmers in a competitive world market. We have simply pulled our farmers out of competition in a number of areas where we need not. We must not use our farmers or innocent people as pawns of diplomacy or allow our embargoes merely to add bricks to the walls of protectionism that other countries have erected. 
   Our farmers have jumped through all the hoops of foreign trade barriers and redtape to establish trusted relationships with foreign buyers. That has  happened. And the U.S. Government should be extremely cautious about interrupting their sales by imposing trade sanctions. 
   Many farmers' livelihoods depend on sales overseas. For instance, in the mid-1990s, more than one-fourth of Missouri's farm sales were made to overseas consumers. But because the U.S. Government has sanctioned agricultural trade, there has been an estimated $1.2 billion annual decline in the U.S. economy during these years. 
   In other words, our whole country suffered to the tune of an annual decline of $1.2 billion as a result of agricultural embargoes. This translates into 7,600 fewer U.S. jobs. Even one-third of those 7,600 jobs lost translates into the loss of a family farm. So we have lost about 2,500 family farmers in each of the last several years because of agricultural embargoes. 
   Sometimes I think we need to ask ourselves: Who are we hurting? We think we are hurting other countries that go into the world market and buy from other suppliers. I don't think we are hurting them badly--perhaps not nearly as badly as we hurt America when we lose 2,500 family farms a year. That is 50 family farms a week. That is a tradition that they no longer pass on--a tradition of resourcefulness, a tradition of independence, a tradition of providing food and fiber to a hungry world. 
   Additionally, this debate on agricultural sanctions reform is broader than the effect sanctions have on America's farmers. In addition to hurting our sales and damaging our farmers' credibility as suppliers, embargoes deny food and medicine to those who need it most--citizens who have to live under the rule of some of those who are most oppressed. 
   Also, the United States, by imposing unilateral agricultural embargoes, can actually end up benefiting instead of punishing foreign tyrants. For instance, one of the little-known aspects of the Soviet grain embargo concerns how much money the Soviets saved as a direct result of the United States ``punishing'' them with an embargo. There may be a number of people who do not remember the U.S. grain embargo with the Soviet Union in the late 1970s, I believe it was. We thought, 
   well, they are not doing things the way we want them to, so we will make it tough on the Soviets. We will embargo exports from the United States to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, when we said we would no longer trade with them, was able to cancel 17 million tons of relatively high-priced purchases from the United States. So they wouldn't buy these quality well-produced items from American agriculture. They replaced those purchases they were going to get from American agriculture with purchases from other countries. What do you know? They even bought from other countries at lower prices.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I welcome the opportunity to congratulate Payne Stewart for his recent victory at this year's U.S. Open. Payne captured the championship with a dramatic 15-foot putt on the 72nd hole, the final hole of the tournament. Originally from Springfield, Missouri, Payne has continually brought an air of class and dignity to the game of golf that is a true inspiration to all Americans, myself included. In fact, his recent performance has inspired me to hit the greens again. 
   For his triumph in the tournament, Stewart drew strength from the memory of his late father, William Stewart, a two-time Missouri State Amateur Champion. On June 20, the final day of the U.S. Open and also Father's Day, NBC ran a special on the relationship between Payne and William Stewart. Taking the time to watch the special, Payne was moved to tears. This time of reflection may have provided the inspiration needed to make the difference in the tournament. I, too, had a father who was a major influence on my life. I, too, find strength and guidance in the moments I take to remember. 
   Payne Stewart is a credit to the game of golf and an example for all Missourians of what dedication and perseverance bring forth. With his second U.S. Open championship, he has shown the entire world that with enough determination and faith--coupled with a crucial putting tip from his wife--dreams really do come true. Again, I offer an enthusiastic congratulations.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. The defense of American citizens is the highest duty of our government. That duty is fulfilled not only by protecting Americans at home, but U.S. citizens when they are abroad. This nation is a city on a hill, and our stand against oppression often has made us a target for those dark forces of violence and tyranny in the world. Terrorism is and will continue to be a principal weapon of those who would seek to threaten the United States and all for which our country stands. 
   The Middle East is the region of the world with the greatest amount of terrorist activity. Five of the seven state sponsors of terrorism are located in or border on the region the State Department defines as the Near East. Our close ally Israel is often the target of terrorist groups operating in the Middle East, and the deaths of Americans due to terrorist attacks in Israel has been of particular concern to me. 
   My amendment to the State Department Authorization bill simply requires the State Department to compile a report on U.S. citizens who have been killed in terrorist attacks in Israel or in territory controlled by the Palestinian Authority. The report will include a list of terrorist attacks in which U.S. citizens were killed and information on the groups of individuals responsible for the attack. The whereabouts of suspects implicated in the attacks, whether each suspect has been incarcerated or incarcerated and released, the status of each case pending against each suspect, whether the State Department has offered any reward for these terrorist suspects, and an overview of U.S. efforts to investigate and apprehend these suspects are particular points of concern my amendment addresses. 
   Since the signing of Oslo in 1993, at least 12 American citizens have been killed in terrorist attacks in Israel or territory controlled by the Palestinian Authority: Nachson Wachsman, Joan Davenny, Leah Stern, Yael Botwin, Yaron Unger, Sara Duker, Matthew Eisenfeld, Ira Weinstein, Alisa Flatow, David Boim, Daniel Frei, and Yitzchak Weinstock. 
   Responsibility for almost all of these murders has been claimed by Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad, two terrorist groups supported by Iran and Syria and dedicated to the destruction of Israel. 
   Terrorism's toll on Israel has been high as well. Since the beginning of the Oslo process in 1993, Israel has lost more than 280 of its citizens to terrorist violence in over 1,000 terrorist attacks (a portion of the Israeli population comparable to 15,000 Americans). 
   Jean-Claude Niddam of the Israeli Ministry of Justice testified before the Senate Appropriations Foreign Operations Subcommittee on March 25, 1999, and gave an 
   overview of the difficulties related to prosecuting suspects implicated in the murder of U.S. citizens. 
   First, Mr. Niddam notes that terrorists suspected of killing Americans have found shelter in the Palestinian Authority. For the last 4 years, Israel has submitted almost 40 official requests to the Palestinian Authority to transfer suspects implicated in terrorism against Israelis and Americans, but has yet to receive a reply. Out of 38 requests to arrest and transfer terrorist suspects, only 12 suspects are currently under arrest and 7 are serving or served until recently in the Palestinian police force. 
   Mr. Niddam's testimony focused on eight terrorist suspects involved in terrorist attacks against Americans. Three of these suspects have been detained by the Palestinian Authority. One of those imprisoned, Imjad Hinawi, confessed in a Palestinian court to the murder of David Boim. The confession was witnessed by a U.S. embassy official present at the trial. If there is a good reason why the Administration has not indicted Mr. Hinawi, it is the time for a clear explanation.  
   Another suspect, Ibrahim Ghanimat, linked to the shooting deaths of Yaron Unger and his wife Efrat, spends his nights in prison but is free to come and go during the day. Adnan al-Ghul, Yusuf Samiri, and Mohammad Dief, three other suspects involved in the killings of Americans, are all at large. Nafez Sabi'h was implicated in a bombing that killed three Americans, but was believed to be serving in the Palestinian police force until several months ago. 
   In recent years, other suspects implicated in the murder of American citizens have served in the Palestinian police force. In July 1998, the Israeli Government released a report stating that four terrorist suspects involved in the February 1996 Jerusalem bus bombing, in which three American citizens were killed, were serving in Palestinian security forces. 
   A climate conducive to terrorism is the most serious threat to a lasting peace settlement in the Middle East. When Abul Abbas, the hijacker of the Achille Lauro, lives freely in Gaza and is a close associate of Yasser Arafat; when the Palestinian Authority's official media arm, the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation, airs programming which teaches Palestinian children to hate Israelis; when terrorist suspects are given positions in the Palestinian security forces--genuine peace is undermined and U.S. interests endangered in the Middle East. 
   It is time for the United States to get serious about defending its own. President Clinton promised that no quarter would be given to terrorists who killed 12 Americans in the Africa embassy bombings in August 1998. But I fear this administration has not been pursuing aggressively terrorist suspects implicated in the murder of a similar number of Americans in Israel. 
   Recent testimony by top administration officials does not indicate that our resolve to prosecute these cases is strengthening. Martin Indyk, Assistant Secretary of State for the Near East, was called to testify before the Senate Appropriations Committee last March on terrorism against U.S. citizens, but his written testimony did not even discuss these cases or what the State Department is doing to resolve them. 
   George Washington once said that if we desire to avoid insult, we must be able to repel it. A credible defense deters aggression and war, and a similar principle is at work in meeting the threat of terrorism today. If terrorists know they will suffer for attacking Americans, they will be less likely to engage in such violence. President Reagan's response to Libyan terrorism quieted that government for over a decade. 
   While we cannot prevent violence against every American abroad, we can ensure that terrorists who attack U.S. citizens are pursued relentlessly. I call on the administration to wage a more aggressive campaign against terrorists who have killed Americans, and this report will give Congress the ability to review the administration's efforts more effectively. I thank Senator HELMS and Senator BIDEN for their assistance with this amendment.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Texas, Senator HUTCHISON, and myself, I am pleased to reintroduce the Family Friendly Workplace Act. I also am pleased to include a list of 34 colleagues as original cosponsors. It is an opportunity to address a very important need for American families--spending more time together. 
   Over the past four years, we have been talking about the difficulty that parents have balancing work and family obligations. I do not think there are two values that are more highly or intensely admired in America than these. The first one is the value we place on our families. We understand that more than anything else the family is an institution where important things are learned, not just knowledge imparted but wisdom is obtained and understood in a family which teaches us not just how to do something but teaches us how to live. 
   The second value which is a strong value in America and reflects our heritage is the value of work. Americans admire and respect work. We are a culture that says if you work well, you should be paid well. If you have merit, you should be rewarded. If you take risks and succeed--you represent the engine that drives America forward. 
   The difficult issue that faces us as a nation, is how are we going to resolve these tensions? I think that is one of the jobs, that we have to try and make sure we build a framework where people can resolve those tensions and where Government somehow does not have rules or interference that keeps people from resolving those tensions. 
   For example, there are a lot of times when an individual would say on Friday afternoon to his boss or her boss, ``My daughter is getting an award at the high school assembly today. Can I have an extended lunch hour, maybe just 1 hour so that I can see my daughter get the award? I would like to reinforce, I would like to give her an `atta girl,' I would like to hug her and say, `You did a great job, this is the way you ought to work and conduct yourself, it is going to mean a lot to yourself and our family and our country if you keep it up.' '' 
   Right now, it is illegal for the boss to say, ``I will let you take an hour on Friday and you can make it up on Monday,'' because it is in a different 40-hour week. You cannot trade 1 hour for 1 hour from one week to the next. That  will make one week a 41-hour week and will go into overtime calculation. Since most bosses do not want to be involved in overtime, it just does not happen. 
   This tension between the workplace and the home place, juxtaposed or set in a framework of laws created in the 1930's that does not allow us flexibility, is a problem. For example, you might be asked to do overtime over and over and over again, and you do overtime, and then you are paid time and a half for your overtime. But at some point, you would rather have the time than the money. If the employer agreed to it voluntarily--both parties--we ought to let that happen. It is against the law. 
   Some employers even want to go so far as to help their families by saying instead of doing 1 week for 40 hours, we would be willing, if you wanted to and on a voluntary basis, let the worker average 40 hours over a 2-week period regularly, so you would only work 9 days in the 2 weeks, but you would work 45 hours the first week and 35 hours the second week and have every other Friday off so you could take the kids to the dentist or drop by the department of motor vehicles and get the car licensed or visit the governmental offices that are not open on Saturday. It is against the law to do that now. 
   What I have described are two ways to tackle these time problems. First, is the option--when you work overtime, to get in time rather than money--if that is what you want to do. Second, you could schedule a work schedule to fill your needs by spreading 80 hours over two weeks to better accommodate your needs and the needs of your families. 
   Both of these things are available in the Federal Government and for governmental entities. Since 1978, the Federal Government has said it is OK to swap comp time off instead of overtime pay. The Federal Government also said if you want to have some flexible scheduling so that every other Friday or every other Monday is off, that is something we can work with you on. 
   It is totally voluntary--voluntary for the worker, it is voluntary for the Federal Government employer or administrator. Neither can force the other because we do not want to force people to work overtime or take comp time, but we want to allow Americans to make choices which will help them resolve the tensions between the home place and the workplace, these two values that are in competition. 
   These potentials, which exist for Federal workers, it occurs to me, ought to be able to be available to workers in the private sector as well, were we not to be locked into the hard and fast rules of the 1930's. That was a time when Henry Ford said, ``You can have your Ford any color you want so long as it is black.'' Things were not quite as flexible then as they are now, and families did not need the flexibility then as they do now. With 70 to 80 percent of all mothers of school-age children now working and two parents working in all those settings, and the tension between work and home, I think we ought to have more flexibility at the option of both the employer and the worker, only when it is agreed to. 
   That is really the subject of the Family Friendly Workplace Act which we reintroduce today. It is a way of saying we need to allow families to work out the conflict that exists between these important values that are crucial and so fundamental to the success of this culture in the next century, not just fundamental to the success of our culture, but fundamental to the success of our own families.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I rise in support of the motion to invoke cloture on the Herger Social Security safe deposit box. This legislation will create a much-needed mechanism to protect Social Security surpluses from being spent on non-Social Security items. 
   We need this legislation because, despite his promises to save Social Security and to protect Social Security, the President keeps forwarding budgets which would take a massive bite out of Social Security. 
   We need this legislation. For example, under President Clinton's proposed budget, $158 billion from the fiscal year 2000 to 2004 budget will be diverted from debt reduction--which is getting the obligations of the country down so we can honor the responsibilities we have to Social Security--it will be diverted by the President, $158 billion, toward more spending. 
   According to the Senate Budget Committee, that would represent 21 percent of the Social Security surplus over that period.  In fiscal year 2000 itself, that represents $40 billion, or 30 percent of the surplus. 
   While President Clinton has been proposing that we spend the Social Security surplus, this Congress has been working to protect Social Security. 
   In March, I introduced S. 502, the Protect Social Security Benefits Act. This legislation, which the Herger legislation before us follows--very similar--called for the establishment of a point of order that would prevent the House and Senate from passing or even debating bills that would spend money from the Social Security trust fund for anything other than Social Security benefits or reducing our debt so that we have a better capacity to pay for Social Security. 
   In April, we passed a budget resolution that does not spend a dime out of the Social Security surplus. In addition to protecting the Social Security surplus, the budget resolution sticks to the spending caps from the 1997 balanced budget agreement. It cuts taxes and it increases spending on education and defense within those limits. That is the way we ought to operate in terms of protecting Social Security and setting priorities. 
   Folks may not understand the entirety of what it means to have a point of order. It simply means when a person proposes spending that would require us to invade the surplus of Social Security in order to cover the spending, a point of order can be raised and that proposal will be ruled out of order. In other words, when someone proposes invading Social Security, the Chair can say that is out of order, and we cannot debate it, let alone discuss it. We cannot vote on it unless we change the rules of the engagement, unless we set aside the rules. I do not think Members of this body are going to say we want something so bad that we are going to invade the retirement of Americans in order to get it. Not only is the point of order established, but it is a 60-vote point of order, meaning you have to have an overwhelming majority of the Congress in order to make sure that is done. 
   I believe this is the kind of durable, workable protection for the Social Security surplus that will make sure we do not continue what we have done for the last 20 years; and that is, to pretend that that money is available for spending on social programs, the normal operation of Government. We, as a result of that, boosted Government spending monumentally by acting as if the Social Security surplus was merely available for ordinary spending. It should not be. It should be protected. The Social Security surplus, therefore, should be the subject of the point of order called for in this measure upon which we will vote shortly. 
   This vote is all about protecting Social Security surpluses. It is a vote about making sure that the surpluses are not used to pay for new budget deficits or operations in the rest of Government. 
   The vote supporting the Herger plan should be bipartisan and unanimous. Think about what the vote was in the House of Representatives. In the House of Representatives, this vote was 416 to 12--416 to 12. That is an overwhelming endorsement. During the debate on the budget resolution, the Senate voted 99 to 0 in support of legislation to protect Social Security. 
   We are calling on every Senator to vote with us to pass the legislation implementing this unanimous resolution. 
   As I said, in addition, the House recently passed the Herger bill, 416-12. There is no reason that the Senators on the other side of the aisle should not join with us on this vote to protect Social Security. 
   I want to commend Congressman HERGER for his hard work in bringing the bill to the floor and obtaining such an overwhelming vote in favor of protecting Social Security. I hope that we can do the same on the Senate side and put this bill on the President's desk immediately. 
   We need to pass this bill because we need to implement procedures to protect Social Security now. 
   Social Security is scheduled to go bankrupt in 2034. Starting in 2014, Social Security will begin spending more than it collects in taxes. 
   Despite this impending crisis, over the next 5 years, President Clinton's budget proposes spending $158 billion of the Social Security surpluses on non-Social Security programs. We need to stop this kind of raid on Social Security. 
   We need to protect Social Security now for the 1 million Missourians who receive Social Security benefits, for their children, and for their grandchildren. 
   This provision will help do that, by making sure that Social Security funds do not go for anything other than Social Security. 
   Under this provision, Congress will no longer routinely pass budgets that use Social Security funds to balance the budget. A congressional budget that uses Social Security funds to balance the budget will be subject to a point of order, and cannot be passed, or even considered, unless 60 Senators vote to override the point of order. 
   One of the most important lessons a parent teaches a child is to be responsible--responsible for his or her conduct and responsible for his or her money. America needs to be responsible with the people's money. 
   The Herger bill, like the original Ashcroft point of order, will show the American people that we are being responsible, by protecting the Social Security system from irresponsible Government spending. 
   Americans, including the 1 million Missourians who receive Social Security benefits, want Social Security protected. This bill does what America wants, and what every Senator has said they want to do. 
   I urge my colleagues to join in support of this bill.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to commend the sesquicentennial celebration of the founding of McDonald County, Missouri. On March 3, 1849, the Missouri State Legislature established McDonald County, which was named in honor of a hero of the Revolutionary War, Alexander McDonald. 
   McDonald County is rich in hospitality, heritage and history. During the Civil War, McDonald County was the scene of many battles, including battles at Pineville on November 19, 1862, and August 13, 1983. Through the hardships of the war, and through the challenges of peace, the good people of McDonald County stood fast for the values of faith, family, freedom, and hard work. Today, the county celebrates 150 years of history. 
   An exciting time came in 1938, during the Great Depression, when Hollywood came to McDonald County to make the movie ``Jesse James,'' which starred Tyrone Powers, Henry Fonda, and Randolph Scott. 
   Each Christmas, the city of Noel in McDonald County receives thousands of cards from all over the country, and affixes the ``Christmas City'' message on cards that wish the joy of the season to family and friends all over the U.S. 
   In addition to agriculture and industry, McDonald County is a paradise for outdoor recreation. Its rugged hills and valleys, watered by springs, rivers, and streams, attract thousands of anglers, boaters, hikers, and others. 
   It is an honor to join with the people of McDonald County in celebrating 150 years of history. Mr. President, I ask that members of the Senate join me in recognizing this historic milestone for McDonald County, Missouri.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in response to the amendment proposed by the Senator from Wisconsin. 
   The senior Senator from Missouri has stated eloquently the need to respond to the military demands of America in ways that the military believes are effective. We have in the E/F a program that is under budget, under cost. It is on schedule. It is certified ready for operational test and evaluation. 
   Those who have had the ability and opportunity to fly it have certified to its character and its characteristics as those that are needed. Every aircraft that we have in our arsenal has some characteristics which preclude others. There are tradeoffs. So there will be those who attack this aircraft and say it doesn't do this as well as something else does, or it doesn't do that as well as another plane does. The fact of the matter is, a plane must do what it is designed to do. When it does what it is designed to do, it meets the needs of the defense of this United States of America. 
   Aircraft fighters and attack aircraft are designed to do specific things. There is a need--and we have seen it; we are seeing it plainly in the arena of conflict today in the Balkans--for additional mission radius. There is a need for the ability to fly further. There is a need for increasing the payload. If you look at the strike-sortie to just general sortie ratio in the war in the Balkans, it is far different than it was in the war in Desert Storm. That is because we are basing our planes in a different place. 
   This particular aircraft has a 37-percent increase in mission radius. That is important. It is a design feature. It is needed. It is something the Defense Department and those who fly these airplanes understand we have to have in order to defend our interests and to protect the most important resource we have in our defense operations, and that is the human resource of our pilots. 
   There is a 60-percent increase in recovery payload. Depending on the mission, the E/F has two to five times the strike capability of the earlier model, two to five times the strike capability, being able to put destruction on a target. That is an important thing to understand. 
   There is a 25-percent increase in frame size to accommodate 20 years of upgrades in cooling, power, and other internal systems. That is important. 
   It may be said this aircraft is only marginally better. Well, the margin is what wins races. The winner in the 100 yard dash does it in 10.4 seconds. The loser does it in 10.5 seconds. It is only marginally better, but marginal superiority is what wins conflicts. It is what saves lives. It is what makes a difference. 
   In testimony before the Armed Services Committee, Phil Coyle, Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, Department of Defense, said it this way:  
   The Department of Defense embarked upon the F/A-18E/F program primarily to increase the Navy's capability to attack ground targets at longer ranges.  
   Does that sound familiar? That is where we are right now in the Balkans. We are having to fly lots of sorties, because we have to have lots of refueling and other things, because the current things that we have do not have the ability to attack and increase our ability to attack ground targets at longer 
   ranges. 
   In order to obtain this objective, the principal improved characteristics were increased range and payload; increased capability to bring back unused weapons to a carrier; improved survivability; and growth capacity to incorporate future advanced subsystems........ 
   Three to five times the strike capability. We need to be able to add improved technology. It is my understanding the Senator from Wisconsin wants to flatten the plane out, simply to say it can be this plane and no further. If there is a generation of technology available to upgrade this, we need to be able to add the upgrades. 
   I think we need to be in a position where we can do for those who fight for America and freedom that which will serve their best interests. The idea, somehow, that the GAO should make a determination about whether an airplane is ready--I served as an auditor. For 2 years I was the auditor for the State of Missouri. It is a great job. It is a wonderful responsibility. But those flying green eyeshades and walnut desks in Washington should not be compared to those who fly fighters to defend freedom. We shouldn't have the green eyeshade accountant flying a desk in Washington telling us whether or not the fighter is fit to fight. We need to rely on the responsible testimony and information provided to us by those whose job it is to defend America and whose lives depend on the fighter being fit to fight.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the F-18 is underbudget and early. The Department of Defense is making very, very careful evaluations, and will continue to do so. This contracting will not go forward without their professional critical evaluation that the plane succeeded. 
   The Senator from Wisconsin says these two different planes in the F-18 package, the single-seater and the two-seater, must meet the same flight characteristics. That does not make sense. When you put an extra seat in an airplane it changes the characteristics, but it also changes the fighting capacity of the airplane. You can do with two pilots--or one plus a person operating radar or other things in a hostile environment in terms of locating targets--what you can't do with one person both flying the airplane and doing that. 
   The Senator from Wisconsin asks about oversight. Frankly, we have had substantial oversight here. We have had oversight in the Senate Armed Services Committee, oversight in the House Armed Services Committee, oversight in the Senate Appropriations Committee. There will be, again, evaluation in the House Appropriations Committee. 
   This is a circumstance where, obviously, there has been substantial oversight. The members of the committee and committee chairman are saying we should approve this. I believe we should. For us to say the Department of Defense, the fighter-fliers, those whose lives depend on this airplane performing, are to have their judgment about the airplane set aside or deferred or delayed until accountants or auditors from the General Accounting Office make a decision on this plane is unwise. It is not only unwise, it has been clearly demonstrated, I think, in the arguments that it is unconstitutional as well. 
   The F-18 is an outstanding aircraft with characteristics that will serve well--extended range, extended load-carrying capacity, and ability in the two-seat configuration to do things not available in the one-seat configuration. It is a well-made airplane that will serve our interests well by serving well those who fly them. It will serve us well by allowing those conflicts to be survivable. The margin of improvement provides the margin of difference that means we win instead of lose. 
   It is time for us to move forward with this program; stop unnecessary attacks on it. This is an airplane that will serve us well.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak for a few moments about the F-15 Eagle, the finest fighter plane in the world. The F-15 arguably has been the most successful fighter in the history of U.S. aviation warfare. Unfortunately, the United States is in danger of losing this aircraft. The Administration is well aware of the performance record of the F-15, but in not taking the steps necessary to save the line. 
   The Senator from Wisconsin, Senator FEINGOLD, and I had a debate this morning on congressional oversight of the Department of Defense. I agreed with the Senator from Wisconsin that Congress has oversight responsibilities for the Pentagon, but disagreed with abdicating that responsibility to GAO. 
   In the case of the F/A-18E/F, Congress has exercised its oversight responsibilities. Three of the four oversight committees already have approved the multiyear contract for the E/F, and the House appropriators are expected to next month. 
   But Congress does have a responsibility to address deficiencies in judgment within the Defense Department when it sees them. The loss of the F-15 is just such a case. General Richard Hawley, Commander of the Air Force's Combat Command, stated just this month that ``..... the F-15 is the most stressed fighter in Air Combat Command's inventory right now in terms of its use in engagements and the operational tempo of the aircrews.'' 
   Given the nature of the threats we face today, which require the strike, range, and versatility of the F-15, it is easy to see why this fighter is the most tasked plane in the Air Force. The loss of the F-15 will harm national security and harm my home state of Missouri. Seven thousand highly skilled aerospace workers will lose their jobs if the F-15 line closes. Those workers and their knowledge is a national security asset that must not be lost. 
   On almost every front, the arguments are compelling for maintaining this national security asset. There is plenty of work for the F-15 to do. Purchasing more planes provides a critical fighter to the Air Force. Purchasing more planes would preserve the production capability of this critical national security asset. Finally, Congress wants to encourage budgetary discipline in other tactical fighter programs. Purchasing more F-15s would encourage budgetary discipline in the F-22 program. 
   I and many of the members from the Missouri and Illinois delegations have written to the President requesting a meeting regarding the F-15. We have not received a reply. We have asked the President that he take the steps necessary to keep the F-15 line open. Unfortunately, the Clinton administration has blocked efforts to do so. 
   The F-15 program was initiated with a Request for Proposal in December 1968. The first model, the F-15A, entered operational service in 1976. The F-15A was a single mission, air superiority fighter with a maximum gross weight of 56,000 pounds. 
   The F-15 entered the world stage as the dominant air superiority fighter in 1976, and the evolution of the program demonstrates just how much this great fighter improved over the years. After twelve years and subsequent models of the F-15 were developed, the latest model, the F-15E, was delivered to the Air Force in 1988. 
   The F-15E's gross weight was 45 percent greater than the A model. Engineers increased fuel capacity over 50 percent to 34,000 pounds, giving the aircraft record range. Payload was enhanced and the dominant air-to-air platform was given critical air-to-ground capabilities. Avionics, engine, and weapons technology were also upgraded. 
   The F-15 is arguably the most versatile and effective fighter in the history of the U.S. Air Force. The F-15 has never lost in air-to-air combat. It has the best air-to-air kill ratio of any fighter in the history of U.S. aviation warfare: 96.5 to 0. That was certainly the case in Desert Storm, where F-15s destroyed 33 of the 35 fixed-wing aircraft Iraq lost in air combat. The F-15E maintained a 95.5 percent average mission capable rate, the highest of any fighter in the war. The F-15's stellar performance also has been on display in Kosovo. General Johnny Jumper, Commander of U.S. Air Forces Europe, has lauded the performance of the F-15 as the workhorse of the operation. 
   In addition, the F-15 has the best safety record of any Air Force fighter: 2.42 losses per 100,000 flying hours. With a record like that--the best safety record, the most successful air-to-air combat record, the most versatile aircraft in the Air Force inventory--it is not difficult to see why the plane is in such demand. 
   One of the major concerns about the F-15 is the cost of the airplane. When you compare a $50 million F-15 to an F-22 that costs over $100 million, the F-15 doesn't look so bad. But even against the cheaper F-16, the cost differential is not as great as it appears. 
   The greater capabilities of the F-15 over the F-16 negate much of the cost differential. RAND completed a study for the Air Force entitled ``Measuring Effects of Payload and Radius Differences of Fighter Aircraft.'' Let me mention several of the major conclusions of the report which were made in light of the nature of future conflicts. 
   First, increasing the use of inertially/GPS-aided weapons could exploit the inherent payload carriage advantage of the F-15E. Second, most regional conflict scenarios involve long distances from bases to targets, favoring aircraft having greater combat radius. Third, as the fighter force structure contracts, higher quality systems can help maintain force capability. 
   Each of those conclusions point to the desirability of the F-15. A major conclusion of the report was that ``Over a wide spectrum of cases, our analysis suggests that an equal cost but smaller force of F-15s is a more cost effective carrier of weapons to the target area than an alternative larger force of F-15Cs. Looking to the future, the employment characteristics of future precision weapons, the size of many potential regional conflict theaters, and the reality of expected force structure contractions seem consistent with the capabilities offered by large payload, long radius vehicles such as the F-15E.'' 
   Another reason to maintain the production capability of the F-15 is uncertainty over the future of the F-22 and Joint Strike Fighter. These fighter programs may have additional developmental difficulties. The F-22 is not expected to be in operational service until 2005. The Joint Strike Fighter will not be in service until 2010 or later. Remember, these are the best case scenarios. 
   Since its inception, the F-22 program has been restructured three times, with a 50 percent reduction in the number of planes to be procured. The F-22 is up against a budget cap and has run out of political capital in Congress. Additional, significant increases in cost could jeopardize the program, which still has five years to go to Initial Operational Capability. 
   Because the Air Force has had to reduce the number of F-22s it will buy, it will need to rely more on the F-15. Colonel Frederick Richardson, chief of F-22 requirements at Air Combat Command, states ``From a pure numbers standpoint, we're clearly not going to  be able to replace the F-15 with F-22s on a one-to-one basis, which means we'll have to assume some more risks and probably keep the F-15 around for longer than 23 planned.'' But if the F-15 line is shut down, there won't be the production capabilities to fill the gap. 
   To conclude, Mr. President, the F-15 is the best fighter in the world. Its unique capabilities have made it the most heavily tasked aircraft in the force today, according to General Hawley, Commander of the Air Force's Combat Command. 
   The RAND study concludes that the F-15E is the kind of airplane we need to meet the security threats of the future. The Air Force is not infallible. The RAND study itself encourages the Air Force to pursue a better mix of fighter aircraft, stating that ``To maintain force capability as its force structure contracts, the Air Force may need to strive for a higher quality mix of forces. The Air Force should be alert to opportunities for maintaining and in some cases enhancing overall force effectiveness despite cuts in force structure'' (From the report ``Measuring Effects of Payload and Radius Differences of Fighter Aircraft). 
   By purchasing additional F-15Es, not only are we taking appropriate steps to meet our current force needs, we are preserving a critical national security asset for an uncertain future. I reiterate my call on the President to take the necessary steps to keep the F-15 line open.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, in recent years the advent of the wireless phone began an extraordinary advance in the cellular telecommunications industry. As a result the cellular phone has become an accessory and a necessity in the modern technological world we currently live in. It has revolutionized communication, and has helped individuals to constantly stay connected. Today, there are over an estimated 200 million wireless phone users around the world. The wireless telephone gives individuals the powerful ability to communicate--almost anywhere, anytime. 
   With the ability of having a cellular phone comes responsibility. As National Wireless Safety Week comes to a conclusion, we must recognize the dangers of having and using cellular telephones, especially when driving. We must also recognize the benefits of having these phones in situations where they are desperately needed. Today, there are over 98,000 emergency calls made daily by people using wireless phones--saving lives, preventing crimes and assisting in emergency situations. Furthermore, according to a recent government study, decreasing notification time when accidents occurs saves lives--a wireless phone is a tool to reduce such a time. 
   The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) is the international organization of the wireless communications industry for wireless carriers and manufactures. It is also the coordinator of Wireless Safety Week, and promotes using phones to summon assistance in emergency situations to save lives. It also promotes the concept that when driving a car, safety is one's first priority. The CTIA has six simple rules to driving safely while using a wireless phone, including: 
   Safe driving is one's first responsibility. Always buckle up; keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road. 
   Make sure that one's phone is positioned where is easy to see and easy to reach. Be familiar with the operation of one's phone so that one is comfortable using it on the road. 
   Use the speed dialing feature to program-in frequently called numbers. Then one is able to make a call by touching only one or two buttons. Most phones will store up to 99 numbers. 
   When dialing manually without using the speed dialing feature first, dial only when stopped. If one cannot stop, or pull over, dial a few digits, then survey traffic before completing the call. 
   Never take notes while driving. Pull off the road to a safe spot to jot something down. 
   Be a wireless Samaritan. Dialing 9-1-1 is a free call for wireless subscribers, use it to report crimes in progress or other potentially life-threatening emergencies, accidents, or drunk driving. 
   In a recent national poll, it was found that over 60 percent of wireless phone users have called for help in cases of car trouble, medical emergency, or to report a drunk driving crime. Close to 90 percent of wireless phone users polled said safety and security were the best reasons for owning a wireless phone.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the legislation being introduced by the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee--the senior Senator from Arizona. I strongly support the reforms to state vicarious liability laws contained in the ``Motor Vehicle Rental Fairness Act of 1999'' and urge my colleagues to support this important bill and move it swiftly towards enactment. 
   I commend the chairman for taking the lead on this important legislation. His bill, of which I am proud to be an original co-sponsor, seeks to put a halt to an absurd aberration in our legal system. Under the vicarious liability laws of a very small number of states, companies that rent or lease motor vehicles are held strictly liable if their renters or lessees are negligent and cause an accident. The company does not have to be negligent in any way. The vehicle may operate perfectly and be maintained properly. These states simply hold the company liable because of their ownership of the vehicle. 
   The only way for these companies to avoid this liability would be to stop renting or leasing these vehicles. This is not an acceptable resolution to this problem. The American justice system should be based on the general principle that a defendant should be held liable only for harm he or she could prevent--not merely because the defendant has a ``deep pocket.'' 
   Vicarious liability laws undermine competition in these states and have driven smaller rental and leasing companies out of business. In fact, vicarious liability acts as a tax on all rental and leasing companies--and their customers--nationwide because these companies must try to recover their losses from vicarious claims through rental rates nationwide. 
   It is time to put a stop to this legal disconnect. Hold these companies liable if they are negligent. Hold them liable if they fail to properly maintain one of the vehicles they rent or lease. But do not hold them liable simply for being in business--for fulfilling the needs of our traveling constituents. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to hearings on the Senator from Arizona's legislation at the earliest possible date and hope to move this legislation through this body as quickly as possible.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I stand before this body to congratulate yet another truly remarkable Missourian, Mr. Thomas Michael Dunn--the Small Business Administration's Young Entrepreneur of the Year. Mr. Dunn, at the age of 26, is the second Missourian to win a national award from the Small Business Administration this year. 
   This young man's story is impressive. Tom began his lawn care business while still attending St. Louis University High School, and continued to operate his business during the summers while pursuing a double major in marketing and management at Indiana University. In his junior year of college, Tom began his first venture, operating a party favor franchise. By his senior year, the business was transformed into a flourishing million dollar industry. 
   Beginning in 1994, Dunn Lawn and Land employed only two staff members, and had only two lawn mowers. By 1998, Dunn Lawn and Land employed over 22 employees, eight trucks, over 12 lawn machines and $1.2 million in revenue. Today, Dunn Lawn and Land offers a variety of services including lawn mowing, landscape bed and plant maintenance, lawn renovation, leaf removal, fertilizer and weed control, irrigation services and complete landscape design and installation. 
   In addition to his thriving lawn maintenance business, Tom remains an active community leader. He has created the Impact Group of Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, which provides funds for special projects at the hospital. 
   Mr. Dunn was selected for this prestigious award because of his extraordinary success as a small business owner and demonstrated entrepreneurial potential for long-term economic growth. The Young Entrepreneur of the Year award is part of the SBA's National Small Business Week celebration. This annual event is held in recognition of the nation's small business community's contributions to the American economy and society. Winners are selected on their record of stability, growth in employment and sales, sound financial status, innovation, ability to respond to adversity, and community service. 
   It honors me to stand before you today to congratulate Mr. Dunn as the Small Business Administration's Young Entrepreneur of the Year. I envy Mr. Dunn's initiative, and am proud to say he is a Missourian. He is a role model for the children of the next generation, and is living proof that with hard work and dedication any one individual can succeed no matter how old they are. Mr. Dunn's success exemplifies the ``American Dream,'' and what it means to be ``a man with a mission.''

   Mr. ASHCROFT. 
   Mr. President, America's best ideas for helping the poor have come from grassroots communities and private organizations of people who know and care about their neighbors. These groups see people and their life experiences, not theories or statistics. We have known for years that government solutions have failed miserably in moving people from dependency and despair to responsibility and independence. For years America's churches and charities have been leading the way in helping the poor achieve dignity and self-sufficiency. This is why I have been advocating that government should find ways to help these organizations unleash the cultural remedy our society so desperately needs. 
   Therefore, it was with great interest that I heard about Vice President GORE's statements Monday in Atlanta expressing his support for Charitable Choice. The Vice President's interest in Charitable Choice is welcome news. Governor Bush is in the forefront of Charitable Choice solutions. Truly, where once there was contention and debate, there now is swelling bipartisan agreement on the promise of Charitable Choice. 
   Congress has been in the forefront of encouraging the type of faith-based solutions that the Vice President was promoting yesterday in Atlanta. The 1996 welfare reform law contains the Charitable Choice provision I authored, which encourages states to partner with faith-based organizations to serve welfare recipients with federal dollars. 
   Last fall, we expanded Charitable Choice to cover services provided under the Community Services Block Grant program, which provides funds to local agencies to alleviate poverty in their communities. And just last week, the Senate approved a juvenile justice bill containing Charitable Choice for services provided to at-risk juveniles, such as counseling for troubled youth. 
   The Charitable Choice provision in the 1996 welfare reform law was one way to achieve the goal of inviting the greater participation of charitable and faith-based organizations in providing services to the poor. The provision allows charitable and faith-based organizations to compete for contracts and voucher programs on an equal basis with all other non-governmental providers when the state or local government chooses to use private sector providers for delivering welfare services to the poor under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. 
   In the past three years, we have begun to hear about how Charitable Choice is opening doors for the government and communities of faith to work together to help our nation's poor and needy gain hope and self-sufficiency. For example, shortly after passage of the federal welfare law, Governor George Bush of Texas signed an executive order directing ``all pertinent executive branch agencies to take all necessary steps to implement the `charitable choice' provision of the federal welfare law.'' Cookman United Methodist Church, a 100 member parish in Philadelphia, received a state contract to run its ``Transitional Journey Ministry,'' which provides life and job skills to welfare mothers and places them into jobs with benefits. In less than a year, the church placed 22 welfare recipients into jobs. Payne Memorial Outreach Center, an affiliate of a Baltimore church, has helped over 450 welfare recipients find jobs under a state contract. 
   In light of these success stories around the nation, more and more states and counties are beginning to see what a critical role the faith-based community can play in helping people move off of welfare. They are eager to put the Charitable Choice concept into action in their communities. 
   We have always known that Charitable Choice is truly bipartisan in nature, and has the support of over 35 organizations that span a wide political and social spectrum. Members from both sides of the aisle here in the Senate have voted in support of this provision. And now, with the Vice President's support for Charitable Choice, I am reintroducing legislation that I introduced in the 105th Congress, the ``Charitable Choice Expansion Act,'' which would expand the Charitable Choice concept across all federally funded social service programs. 
   The substance of the Charitable Choice Expansion Act is virtually identical to that of the original Charitable Choice provision of the welfare reform law. The only real difference between the two provisions is that the new bill covers many more federal programs than the original provision.  
   While the original Charitable Choice provision applies mainly to the new welfare reform block grant program, the Charitable Choice Expansion Act applies to all federal government programs in which the government is authorized to use nongovernmental organizations to provide federally funded services to beneficiaries. Some of the programs that would be covered under this legislation include housing, substance abuse prevention and treatment, seniors services, the Social Services Block Grant, abstinence education and child welfare services. 
   With this recent expression of bipartisan support for Charitable Choice from the Vice President, now is the time for Congress to move quickly to pass the Charitable Choice Expansion Act, so that we can empower the organizations that are best equipped to instill hope and transform lives to expand their good work across the nation.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I stand before this body today to congratulate a truly remarkable Missourian, Mr. Gregory Sullivan--the Small Business Administration's Person of the Year. Mr. Sullivan founded G.A. Sullivan in 1982 with just $300 in start-up capital. Today, it is one of the fastest growing technology companies in the nation. This custom software company has appeared on Inc. Magazine's 500 list of fastest growing companies for the past two years. G.A. Sullivan also is leader in the St. Louis community--ranking among the top seven fastest growing technology companies in St. Louis for the past three consecutive years. 
   In reading Greg's story, I was intrigued by his biggest challenge. To me it shows the remarkable risks taken by America's entrepreneurs. Ten years after starting the company--after paying his dues programming computers and building the foundation of the business--he knew that there would be a huge growth in information technology industry. At that point, he had to decide on his business' future. In December 1992, he decided to go forward with an aggressive business expansion program. He engaged an advertising agency, developed a business plan, designed a logo, hired a marketing consultant to build a sales staff and started aggressively recruiting technical talent. Since that time, sales have grown over 1,400 percent and he now employs nearly 175 people--his clear vision paid off. 
   While Greg's custom software development services company provides leading edge information technology in the business arena--he personally is a leader in the community. He was recently appointed Vice Chairman of Science and Technology for the St. Louis Regional Commerce and Growth Association. I understand that he personally conducts workshops on r&#233;sum&#233; writing skills, interviewing and networking to help students be competitive in the after-graduation job market. He also has established the G.A. Sullivan Scholarship fund. 
   Mr. Sullivan is the 36th recipient of this annual entrepreneurial award. He was selected from a field of 53 state small business persons of the year winners representing the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam. The national entrepreneur award is the highlight of the Small Business Administration's national Small Business Week celebration. Small Business Week honors contributions of the nation's small business owners who are the backbone of this great nation. The SBA selects winners on their record of stability, growth in employment and sales, sound financial status, innovation, and the company's response to adversity and community service. 
   It honors me to stand before you today to congratulate Mr. Sullivan as the Small Business Administration's Person of the Year. Mr. Sullivan exemplifies the ``American Dream,'' and is living proof that with hard work and dedication any one individual can succeed.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the $15 billion supplemental appropriations conference report before us. The supplemental spends far more than is necessary to support our effort in Kosovo and, worse, will take vitally needed money out of the Social Security surplus, thereby raiding the Social Security Trust Fund. 
   Protecting the Social Security trust fund is one of my highest priorities. The Social Security system is expected to go into deficit in 2014 and we will need every dollar of that surplus today in order to be prepared for the tomorrows ahead of us. 
   Until this point, the Senate has been headed in the right direction on Social Security. The Budget Resolution, which I strongly supported, called for reduced debt and taxes, increased funding for education and national defense, and maintaining the spending caps so necessary to control spending. 
   Perhaps most importantly, the budget resolution built in on-budget surpluses from the year 2001 and beyond. This is significant because surpluses that are accumulating in the Social Security Trust Funds will no longer be used to finance on-budget operations of government. Social Security surpluses should not be used to finance deficits in the rest of government. 
   The Budget Resolution stood in stark contrast to President Clinton's budget, which, over the next five years, proposed spending $158 billion of the Social Security surpluses on non-Social Security programs. 
   The Budget Resolution, in addition to preserving every penny of Social Security surpluses, also contained procedural hurdles blocking future budgets from spending Social Security surpluses. 
   These procedures included a point of order against on-budget deficits and an amendment calling for reducing the debt ceiling by the amount of the Social Security surplus--the lockbox provision. 
   The Senate voted in favor of both the point of order and the lockbox by unanimous votes during the budget resolution. 
   In addition, the Abraham-Domenici-Ashcroft lockbox legislation, which is still pending in the Senate, would put these procedures into law, and ensure that Congress could not spend the Social Security surpluses on non-Social Security purposes. 
   Unfortunately, the supplemental appropriations package before us would undo some of the good work that we have already done this session. 
   By not offsetting $13 billion of the spending, the supplemental takes money from the Social Security surpluses, money that is necessary to protect the Social Security trust funds. 
   Thus far, Congress has been committed to stopping the raid on Social Security. This Congress has passed a budget that is balanced without using Social Security funds. 
   This conference report, however, not only spends Social Security funds, but also contains $1.2 billion in traditional pork spending. 
   I refer to such spending as $45 million for Census funding, $3.76 million for the House page dormitory, and $1.8 million for the O'Neill House building. 
   If this bill were just for Kosovo and true emergency spending, I would vote for it. If this bill were fully offset, I would vote for it. But this bill is neither all emergency nor all offset. This bill, like the $21 billion omnibus appropriation last fall, is an abrogation of our responsibility to protect the Social Security surplus. 
   Mr. President, this is not the way that we should handle Congress' responsibility over the federal purse  strings. If we face real emergencies, we should fund those emergencies. 
   But funding those emergencies is not free. We need to pay for all spending, emergency or not. This is why I support Senator ENZI's attempt to make sure that this entire appropriation is offset. 
   If we do not offset our spending, the money comes out of the Social Security surplus. There is no getting around this fact. We must pay for any new funding. If we do not pay for it, it comes out of the Social Security surplus. 
   The Social Security program is too important to be raided. While I recognize the importance of emergency funding, particularly for Kosovo, I also recognize that spending needs to be paid for. 
   Mr. President, this request is not unreasonable. All across this great land, when families face unexpected expenses, they must offset their spending by readjusting their priorities. No family in America would react to an unexpected crisis by going out and spending more money on other discretionary, non-budgeted items. All I am asking is that the Congress do the same. 
   This supplemental spends too much money and offsets too little of it. If we are to keep our financial house in order, and to protect the Social Security trust funds, it is time that we in Congress started to change our behavior. 
   If we are to maintain our Social Security obligations, we need to learn how to spend less money, and offset more. It is with regret that I feel obligated to oppose this conference report.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his leadership on this issue. I began to be concerned about students carrying guns in and out of our schools quite some time ago. On the Ed-Flex bill, which passed this Senate just a couple months ago, I put an amendment to close another loophole which would allow students who possessed guns in school--not just carried guns to school--to be removed from the school environment. 
   This responsibility for us to close these loopholes is a serious one. It is a responsibility that relates to school safety. That is what we are talking about here. School safety is a responsibility that we can work hard on, and I am glad Senator FRIST of Tennessee and I have been able to join on this amendment. 
   It should not have taken this long. This is a simple amendment. This amendment merely allows local schools to treat all children who bring guns to school in the same manner. It does not target children with disabilities--simply not so. It protects children with disabilities. This is not a matter of scapegoating. This does not say that any group of students is subject to more severe punishments than any other group of students. 
   This is a bill that provides for equity, simply saying that principals and superintendents should have the power, without interference from the Federal Government, to remove students from school who come to school with a firearm, an explosive or a gun. I believe we need to make sure we close the loophole in the Federal law that made it very difficult to discipline certain students who came in that setting. 
   There are those who say: Well, the law is this way and the law is that way. And they will argue about how the law is applied here in the Senate Chamber. 
   We have a lot of experience from around the country about how the law is applied in the schools. The Senator from Tennessee has eloquently spoken to the fact that as applied in the schools, you frequently find that individuals who, if they were not the subject of an individualized education program, would be gone for a year because of a mandated expulsion, are back in the classroom within 45 days, in spite of the fact that they brought a gun or a bomb to school. 
   It is simply our intention to let local school boards and school officials decide how they should be able to make the school a safe place and not to reinsert a student in the school environment who has threatened the safety and security of the school by bringing a bomb or a gun to school. We must have zero tolerance for guns in school. I think we must let school officials decide on discipline policies. 
   We should not have taken this long on this amendment, but I am glad that we are at this point. 
   After we vote on this amendment, there is a consent decree which is going to allow the Harkin amendment to be voted on.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes of the remaining 3 and ask to be notified. 
   The Harkin amendment makes the current law even worse by imposing a new requirement upon schools that they couldn't remove any child for bringing a gun to school unless they provide special services to the child. I will oppose this amendment. 
   When you tell people that you will make them special for bringing a gun to school, I think you do a great disservice. You are not making victims out of people by pulling them out of school. You are not making them unsafe. If you tell them clearly that if they bring a gun to school that they are not going to be allowed to stay in school, you will make them safer, and you will make the school safer. 
   This is a school safety issue. It is an issue that requires our attention. The simple fact of the matter is, the current law, as applied and as implemented, is a real impediment to school safety. 
   There will be arguments that we have yet to have a student shoot someone under these circumstances. I can tell you that we have come very close. I talked to one school superintendent in my State who had such a student threaten seven other students in the classroom, to kill them. When the student finally shot one of the other students, it wasn't in the classroom. It was off the school premises so that it really didn't qualify under IDEA. But we don't have to wait until there is blood on the blackboard or on the floor of the classroom in order to take steps to make sure we don't have guns in the classroom. 
   The truth of the matter is, we should simply and clearly make it possible on an equal footing to say that no matter who the student is, there are no excuses, there are no special exceptions; if you bring a gun to school, the local school authority should have the opportunity to take that student and to remove that student without regard to other status.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield myself such time as I have remaining. 
   Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa indicates there is not a loophole here. Well, it is strange to me, but the statistics indicate otherwise. 
   One county in Tennessee, clear evidence, Davidson County, the home of the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. FRIST, four people who squeezed through the nonexistent loophole were back in class within 45 days in that setting. 
   I think we have to make sure that that nonexistent loophole, if that is what we are talking about, gets closed. It is impossible to have people coming through a door that is not there. There is a loophole that needs to be shut. 
   Last but not least, it is no accident that the National School Boards Association wants us to pass this. This isn't discriminating against one class of students or in favor of another. It simply says our priority for learning has to be a safe and secure school environment. This particular amendment would enhance the safety of all students from gun violence, according to the National School Boards Association. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, in our amendment, which we just passed in the Senate, Senator FRIST and I proposed important changes to federal law to give schools more authority to remove from the classroom any student who brings a gun or firearm to school. Schools need current federal barriers removed so that they can preserve a safe and secure classroom for our children. 
   The Senator from Iowa has proposed an amendment which makes it even more difficult for schools to remove any dangerous student--including one who brings a gun to school--from the classroom. I rise to state my opposition to the Harkin amendment. 
   The Harkin amendment makes the current law even worse by imposing a new requirement upon schools when they desire to remove any child--disabled or non-disabled--from the classroom for bringing a gun or firearm to school, or for committing any act of violence. 
   The Harkin amendment takes the unprecedented step of telling schools across the country that if they want to remove any child from school--even a nondisabled student--for possessing a weapon, or for committing any act of violence, schools must provide the child with ``immediate appropriate interventions and services, including mental health interventions and services,'' in order to ``maximize the likelihood that such child shall not engage in such behaviors, or such behaviors do not reoccur.'' 
   This amendment would overturn the discipline policies of schools across the nation, and intrude upon the right of parents, teachers, school administrators, school boards, to set their own discipline policies regarding weapons and violence in schools. Not only this, but it jeopardizes the ability of schools to remove any student from class who has a gun or firearm, and prevents them from keeping their schools safe. 
   The Harkin amendment would also handcuff schools even more than the current IDEA law does regarding removal of disabled students who possess weapons. 
   The Harkin amendment says that a school that takes action to remove a child with a weapon from school ``shall ensure that immediate appropriate interventions and services, including mental health interventions and services,'' are provided to the child. This is a new requirement in addition to current IDEA law. 
   Current IDEA law requires that a school that removes a child from the regular classroom for 45 days for a weapons possession must already conduct a series of procedures in connection with the removal. Let me describe some of these procedures. 
   First, a school must conduct a functional behavioral assessment. Second, it must implement or modify a behavioral intervention plan for the child. Included in this is the requirement that the IEP team must meet to develop or modify an assessment plan to address the behavior at issue. Third, the school must conduct a manifestation determination review to determine if the child's disability caused the behavior at issue. 
   The Harkin amendment adds yet another requirement to the list of procedures that a school must undertake when removing a child with a weapon from the classroom, by requiring that schools ``ensure that immediate appropriate intervention and services, including mental health interventions and services,'' are provided 
   to the child. Why do we need to handcuff schools even more with another procedure? 
   Additionally, the amendment says that these additional interventions and services must be provided ``in order to maximize the likelihood that such child will not engage in such behaviors, or such behaviors do not reoccur.'' We are not simply asking the schools to try to reduce the likelihood of reoccurring behavior: we are requiring them to maximize that likelihood. 
   School principals, administrators, teachers, school boards, and parents have told me about how difficult the current IDEA makes it to discipline students, and especially in the case of guns and firearms. 
   Senator HARKIN's amendment adds yet another layer of procedure. Rather than providing schools with more authority to take actions school officials deem appropriate to maintain a safe and secure classroom free from guns and firearms, Senator HARKIN's amendment is going backwards from current law by imposing more federal responsibilities. 
   The Harkin amendment's attempt to provide funding for the new procedures required under the amendment is disingenuous. 
   The amendment authorizes ``such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2000 through 2004'' to pay for the ``interventions and services'' that schools must conduct before they can remove a student with a gun from school. If the Senator from Iowa and others were unwilling to vote for giving schools more IDEA funding during debate on the ed-flex bill earlier this session, what makes us think they really would provide more funding at this time? 
   In conclusion, the Harkin amendment actually makes current law worse by imposing a new set of requirements on schools when they need to remove any child with a firearm from the classroom. He would require schools to provide ``interventions and services'' to non-disabled students who are expelled for bringing a gun to school. And, he imposes a new requirement upon schools that take action to remove IDEA students from school for weapons possession. 
   At a time when parents, teachers, school officials, and our children are asking for help in keeping our classrooms safe, we cannot afford to take a step backward and further handcuff schools from taking steps to get guns out of schools. We need to move forward by giving schools more authority to get--and keep--firearms out of the classroom. For these reasons, I oppose the Harkin amendment.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of final passage and explain why I plan to vote for final passage of S. 254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act of 1999. At the outset, I must make clear that I do not support every provision in this bill. There is much in this bill that is simply extraneous--provisions that do not address the problem of youth violence. Moreover, there are items included in this bill by amendment that I opposed. There are also items that were included through the manager's amendment, such as the creation of new federal judgeships, that I oppose. 
   However, there are many provisions in this bill that I have long championed and have worked hard to include in the bill. Let me briefly summarize these key provisions of this law: 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-ashcroft-mo-1-19990519</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I want to thank a number of Senators before I begin making my remarks because this amendment is the culmination of the work of a number of individuals, including Senators HUTCHISON, DEWINE, ALLARD, ABRAHAM of Michigan, GREGG of New Hampshire, HELMS of North Carolina, and Senator COVERDELL of Georgia. All of these individuals participated to assemble the components of this amendment, which is an amendment designed to promote safety in our schools and to prevent violence in our schools. So I thank all of those Senators. If any of them comes to the floor, I will happily yield to them for them to give particular emphasis to the items they brought to the table here. 
   This amendment contains a number of provisions that give schools and communities additional ways to prevent youth violence. It would free local school districts to put Federal money to use where the Federal money will do the most good to prevent future violence. 
   Under this amendment, schools will be able to choose where best to spend Federal resources under titles 4 and 6 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. These are allowable uses which would include violence prevention training, school safety equipment such as metal detectors, or for school resource officers. 
   The amendment clarifies that nothing in Federal law stands in the way of a local decision to introduce a dress code or school uniform policy. Without taking the time at this moment, a number of schools would like to be able to do this. In the places where they have been able to do it, they have found that it reduces violence and increases student productivity. It has been good. 
   This would allow schools, if they are going to use their Federal resources, to use them, and one of the permissible ways would be to invest in establishing such a policy. 
   The amendment contains a provision that provides certain liability protections for school personnel when they undertake reasonable actions to maintain order and discipline in safe educational circumstances or to promote an environment of safety for education. This is a very important provision. This one, sponsored by Senator COVERDELL of Georgia, offers teachers limited civil liability against frivolous and arbitrary lawsuits. 
   We don't really need for teachers, who need to be involved in disciplining students, to be thinking about the fact that they are going to be sued if they exercise the right kind of discipline. 
   The limits are reasonable. They are against frivolous and arbitrary lawsuits--the kind of limit that we placed to help 
   encourage volunteerism last year when we had the Volunteer Protection Act. That is the kind of thing we want to do to make sure that teachers can have better control and are free to take necessary steps to provide discipline in the classroom. 
   Senator HELMS' language makes certain that a school discipline record follows a student when a student transfers to another public or private school. The language allows schools to run background checks on any school employee who works with children. I think this is reasonable. We should  know who the individuals are who are employed in our schools. Providing this kind of capacity and opportunity is a step in the right direction, a step forward. It is necessary for schools, especially given the mobility of students and families, to be able to know about the discipline record of a student who comes to the school. Learning too late can be a deadly matter, as I learned a few years ago in a tragic case in St. Louis, where a student transferred from one school to the next and the discipline record didn't follow. And before they learned of this student's propensity to stalk young women, he murdered another student, stalking a woman, a young woman, into the restroom of a high school. 
   Senator DEWINE has a provision that allows the coordination of adolescent mental health and substance abuse services. That is part of this amendment. 
   The amendment includes language from Senator ABRAHAM that allows schools to use Safe and Drug Free Schools funds for drug testing. Students who are the subject of serious discipline problems may well be better off if we have the capacity of asking them to undergo drug tests. We fund it and provide the availability or the freedom to use funds in that respect. 
   I really want to thank my colleagues who worked with me on this task force: Senators DEWINE, HUTCHINSON, GREGG, ALLARD, COVERDELL, HELMS, and HATCH. 
   I look forward to the passage of these proposals that are included in this education task force package: The amendments on school safety and violence prevention, and safety and security in our schools. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Tennessee, when a student is subject to an IEP and is disciplined for bringing a gun to school now, is it not an immediate discipline of expulsion for a year as it is for others; is it for a limited period of time? What is that first interval of discipline that is provided for under IDEA?

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Under an IEP, you have an initial 10-day suspension, and legal proceedings start to determine whether or not the carrying of the gun, brandishing of the gun, or bringing the pipe bomb or a firearm into the classroom was a manifestation of your disability?

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Earlier the Senator said that it is hard to imagine a person would have brought a gun to school based on a disability. But in fact the determination from Davidson County, Nashville, TN, is that over the last couple of years they apparently found that a number of the individuals involved--two in 1 year and three from another year--the determination was made in this process that bringing the gun was related to a disability and therefore the student was not to be treated the same as other students but would have a very tactical set of bureaucratic rights to remain in school, or reenter school. 
   It seems to me that goes to the heart of what we are talking about--whether or not a student who has a problem that causes the student to be involved in bringing a gun--that is, the manifestation proceedings. Part of the evidence or manifestation of the problem is that you come to school with a gun. That provides the authority for reentering school. The fact that you have a problem which causes you to bring guns to school becomes your license to get back into school.  
   I think that describes the loophole we have talked about. We created it here in the Senate. 
   Am I getting to the heart of it?

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I think it is important to accept the fact that you have faith in the school administrator and the principal, because under the proposal of the Senator from Tennessee, and under my proposal and under the Gun-Free Schools Act for schools, which we passed, a principal has the discretion of being able to allow a student to reenter. And, if you trust the principals, you trust the school official, that is an available opportunity as it exists and would exist if we were to pass this amendment providing for uniformity, because we allow the treatment under our proposal to be 
   identical to the treatment for any other student not the subject of an IEP. And principals have the discretion to allow such other students back into the classroom. 
   So what we want to do is not punish anybody, we want to allow that principal to exercise his discretion in a way that is likely to promote safety in the classroom and in a way that it does not hamstring the principal. 
   Just to give you an idea, people do not understand, and I didn't understand, what a manifestation determination is. This is a flow chart of how a manifestation determination is made under IDEA. This is a very serious process. To go through these kinds of processes and to have to jump through these legal hoops and to cause the school districts--the cheapest hearing I have been able to talk to a school superintendent about in my State is between $7,500 and $10,000, just to conduct a hearing to do in the special settings what the principal is able to do given his need to protect the safety of the school environment on his own in another setting. 
   I think that is what we are looking at. We are not here to try to say that we want to abuse individuals who are the subject of IEPs. We passed the statutory framework designed to help disabled children. We want them to get a good education. But I submit to you that among those most exposed to the threat to safety and security in the schools when a student with a disability comes with a weapon are other disabled students. 
   This is not a question of pitting students with a disability against other students in the classroom, this is a question about safety and security in the classroom and allowing those individuals charged with the awesome responsibility of providing for the education of our youngsters the authority to take the steps that are necessary, absent intermeddling bureaucratic barriers from Washington, to secure the school environment. 
   Given the fact that every principal has the authority in other settings to be able to reenter a student who is appropriately at a stage to reenter the classroom, this bill would not prevent principals from having the same approach to students who were the subject of IEPs.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. It is an interesting letter on behalf of the Nation's 95,000 local school board members. This is from the executive director, Anne L. Bryant, executive director of the National School Boards Association:  
   The National School Boards Association urges you to support the Frist-Ashcroft amendment to S. 254 that would enhance the safety of all students from gun violence.  
   We are not talking about the vast number of individuals that are participants in the IDEA program. The number is vast, with 13 or 14 percent in Tennessee, and 13 or 14 percent of the students in Missouri and Iowa. These are not people who show up for school with guns very often. When some of them do, they are threatening the others. 
   When a person shows up with explosives or a gun at school, the objective there ought to be school safety. It ought to be to address that. 
   The amendment provides school officials with the discretion to suspend or expel students covered by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in the same manner as other students in cases where they bring firearms to school. 
   It has been stated there is a lot of opposition. This is a letter from the 95,000 members of the School Boards Association stating this is the right thing to do.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask him if his experience has been similar to mine. I have probably gone to 30 or 40 school districts in the last 3 months, visiting school districts. I have found people are very concerned about the safety of students. My own view of it has been totally different from that suggested by the Senator from Vermont, saying that school safety is not the question here. I talked to one superintendent. This did not happen to be an IEP student who carried the gun to school but who threatened to kill other students in school seven times. 
   Of course, because of the problems in effecting discipline, they kept the student in school. Finally the student shot another student. Safety issues are involved here. Make no mistake about it. When someone brings a gun into the school, safety issues are involved.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. This is not just a financial issue when someone brings a pipe bomb to school. That is a safety issue. Sure it costs money to put the person in alternative settings, and it costs money to have a hearing every month and a half, every 45 days. Those are massive costs. I will not deny those are very serious costs. But let us not suggest--at least to the school districts 
   that I dealt with--that there are no safety issues involved when people bring guns and pipe bombs to school. Does that comport with the Senator's experience in Tennessee?

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Not providing them at the school. That is where you do get into expensive treatments, where you get to $60,000, $70,000, $80,000 a year to provide the student with individualized home-based education. 
   But the point is, the purpose of the amendment of the Senator from Tennessee, which I am very grateful for the opportunity to participate in with him, is to provide an equity in services. When you suggest that there is an equity for those who are subject to an IEP, but the violation is not a manifestation of the disability, that there is not any requirement for services, that is simply not true. The law provides the services must continue. 
   I think the fundamental point the Senator from Tennessee and I want to make is this. There are not very many people who are bringing guns to school. There are very few of them. And even fewer who would bring guns or pipe bombs to school are students with a disability. 
   But for those who do, the school officials ought not to have to go through torturous legal proceedings and laborious determinations of manifestations and the like for those who bring pipe bombs and guns to school. We ought to be able to trust the principals to say: You don't belong here in school. You will come back in the same manner that other students do.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. That is exactly the kind of parity we are talking about. If  a person brings a weapon to school, the principal has the right to say: You do not belong in school and you are not going to disrupt or threaten the safety of this school environment and you are not entitled to special services, especially in cases where bringing a weapon to school had nothing to do with your disability. 
   I believe it ought to be the case, and this amendment provides we give school administration officials the kind of discretion they have in their own States and under the Gun-Free Schools Act we passed a couple years ago where the principal has the discretion to expel them for a year, with the discretion to allow them to reenter on his or her determination or school authorities' determination.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I want to bring the attention of the Senate to what I believe to be the law in this situation, that absent specification in the IDEA law itself, the extension of continuing services is not required according to, I think, the best on-point legal decisions in cases where a person would otherwise have forfeited his right to school because of the disciplinary problem. 
   The case of Virginia Department of Education v. Riley, from the Fourth Circuit, found that the plain language of IDEA did not condition the receipt of IDEA funds on the continued provision of educational services to expelled children with disabilities and that in order for Congress to place conditions on the State's receipt of funds, Congress must do so clearly and unambiguously. Therefore, that is one of the reasons the law was changed following that.

<DOCNO>106-ashcroft-mo-58-19990519</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ASHCROFT. That is prior to the change in the law, I say to the Senator from Iowa. I am explaining, that is one of the reasons the law was changed. I think you changed the law, and the source of the mandate that services be provided, according to that case and according to the response of the Congress, was the change of the law. 
   So the Constitution does not provide a mandate that people have to be given continuing services forever in discipline cases, which has been suggested. 
   The point is, the Constitution hasn't been so construed, I don't believe. I think what the law has basically said is that that comes from what we did in the amendment of the law a year or two ago. Was that in 1997? Given that, if the source of that responsibility is the law, it becomes clear to me that we can change the law and alter the responsibility. 
   Now, I think this has been both entertaining and somewhat instructive.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I want to get back to the fundamental point, and there are about three of them. I will try to make these quickly: One, that the law does provide for differential treatment. If it didn't provide for differential treatment, we wouldn't have the law. As a matter of fact, part of it was in response to this Fourth Circuit opinion, and the Congress acted. In so providing, we created a big loophole for guns and firearms in the school. 
   We basically provided a basis for differential treatment for people who are the subject of IEPs, these special education students, who might be--I forget what the Senator from Alabama said--emotionally distressed, or troubled, or severely emotionally distressed. They might be able to come to school and have different treatment if they carry a gun to school than if someone else does. 
   The simple fact is that the Senator from Tennessee and I believe we ought to give authority to school principals to deal with such cases as forthrightly as they do with other cases. This is in light of the fact that when you get out, not in the Chamber of the Senate, not in the theory of the bureaucracy, but when you get out into local schools, the law operates to constrain those school officials to have students come back to school who have carried guns to school and pipe bombs to school. They have carried them in, and it is not in the best interest, according to school officials, to have the students back in, but they are back in. 
   We simply want to liberate school principals and school officials to say to people who bring guns and pipe bombs, firearms, to school, you can't do that, you are out until we say you can come back, in the same way we say that under the Gun-Free Schools Act, which is the Federal Government's mandate, students are entitled to go to school in a place that is not full of guns and firearms. 
   I thank the Senator from Vermont for according me this opportunity to make that simple statement, that we want to provide parity for students: No matter who you are, when you bring firearms and guns to school, we want the principal to be able to send you home.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Reserving the right to object, and I don't intend to object, I want to indicate that this is about the fourth time we have displaced this amendment, which I have been working on in conjunction with Senator FRIST. This amendment has been the pending business since last Friday. This is not a novel amendment. 
   I just want to indicate that I intend to get a vote on this amendment. Votes have been taken on amendments on both sides. The right way to resolve any dispute on this amendment is to vote on it. I have been ready to vote on this amendment for quite some time. I think everyone on both sides of the aisle knows what the amendment is about. 
   I would just indicate that when this amendment comes back up I will persist in expecting the same courtesy that this body has accorded all other amendments to be accorded to this amendment, and I will work hard to make sure we have an opportunity to vote on it.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to join every member of this body in mourning the loss of Admiral James W. ``Bud'' Nance. His loss is felt especially among those Members and staff who worked closely with the Admiral on the Foreign Relations Committee. He is survived by his wife of 53 years, four children, and seven grandchildren. 
   The much-celebrated friendship between Admiral Nance and Senator JESSE HELMS set the tone for the work of the Foreign Relations Committee. Few committee chairmen have known their staff directors since first grade. The level of trust between those two elevated the work of the Committee to a distinct level. 
   Born in 1921 in Monroe, North Carolina, Admiral Nance went on to graduate from the Naval Academy, fight in World War II, and serve 35 years in the U.S. Navy. That was all before he began his second career after 1979 in the Legislative and Executive branches of Government. In the Navy, the Admiral was a first rate aviator, involved in some of the more dangerous testing and developing programs for naval fighters. He served as Commanding Officer of the Attack Carrier Air Wing Eight aboard the U.S.S. Forrestal and later became the Commanding Officer of that aircraft carrier--a ship that had more sailors (5,000) than his hometown of Monroe, North Carolina. 
   The Admiral concluded his naval career as Assistant Vice Chief of Naval Operations and Director of Naval Administration. He went on to serve as a staff member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1979-80 and Deputy Assistant for National Security Affairs under President Reagan. In that capacity, he was responsible for managing the entire staff of the National Security Council at the White House. 
   Admiral Nance returned specifically to naval aviation by running Boeing's Navy Systems program from 1983 to 1990. In 1991, he returned to the Foreign Relations Committee as Deputy Staff Director for the Minority and has served the last four years as Majority Staff Director for the Committee. 
   The Admiral's commitment to service can be seen throughout his life, and  that was certainly the case in the four years that I worked with him as a Member of the Foreign Relations Committee. In assuming the position of Staff Director, Admiral Nance told Senator HELMS he viewed the job as a service to his country and wanted no compensation. Senate rules required some level of compensation to be an official Senate employee, however, so Admiral Nance began his tenure with the exorbitant income of $3.36 a week. When Congress became bound by the laws of the land, Senator HELMS was forced to raise Admiral Nance's salary to minimum wage. 
   We smile as we reflect on the Admiral's paltry salary, but what a selfless display of service that was to his country and this body. Earning the minimum wage was not a publicity stunt. Admiral Nance operated behind the scenes almost entirely. This man was truly motivated by gratitude to the United States. 
   Admiral Nance was a dedicated conservative, and his conservatism was rooted in respect for his fellow man and an unshakeable commitment to the best interests of his country. His partisanship was good-humored and balanced. The Admiral had a verse displayed prominently in his office from Ecclesiastes which read ``The heart of the wise inclines to the right, but the heart of the fool to the left.'' Whether as a formidable opponent or valued ally in the work of the Senate, Admiral Nance respected--and won the respect of--all members of the Foreign Relations Committee. 
   This man was a warrior his entire life, placing himself in harm's way for the good of his country. He died as he lived--he fought to the very end. Many Members of this body probably are not aware of the health difficulties he struggled with during his entire tenure as Staff Director of the Foreign Relations Committee. It would have been easy to walk away. There was a reason he stayed, though. 
   Admiral Nance was a true American. His life was a testament to the ideals which have made this country great. He believed in the United States of America. He believed in prudent and decisive American leadership in the world. He believed in what this country stood for and what it could accomplish. 
   As we reflect on his life in the coming days, may each of us gain a renewed sense of commitment to preserve the blessings of freedom which the Admiral defended. My sympathies are with the Admiral's wife Mary Lyda and their children. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you very much. 
   Mr. President, 50 percent of all arsons, 37 percent of all burglaries are committed by juveniles, 17 percent of all forcible rapes. 
   Our juvenile justice system is no longer being asked to deal with chewing gum and spitballs in the hall but real violent crime. 
   This amendment is very straightforward and simple. It says that while juveniles are committing adult crimes with firearms, they should be treated as adults; that if juveniles are going to be involved in rapes, murders, armed robberies, armed assaults, that kind of violent crime, using firearms, that we  want to provide the encouragement, incentive, and resources from the Federal level for States to treat those individuals as adults. So this amendment provides States with incentives to try juveniles as adults when they commit armed violent crimes. 
   Specifically, this amendment encourages States to try juveniles as adults when youth over 14 use firearms. This is not just any kind of crime, but when youth over 14 use firearms to commit murder, forcible rape, armed robbery, armed assault, and use firearms in major drug crimes. We have a real serious situation where young people are committing crimes that we once thought were reserved to adults. 
   Juveniles should understand that we will not consider this to be some sort of status offense or delinquency, that the commission of real violent crime by juveniles will be treated as adult crime. The unpleasant fact is that all too many juveniles commit serious armed crime. The answer is to prosecute these crimes vigorously to the full extent of the law. 
   This amendment provides States with substantial incentives to give adult time to juveniles who commit adult crimes. The purpose and thrust of this amendment, thus, is very narrow. For a narrow range of crimes--murder, rape, robbery, assault, major drug crimes--committed with a firearm, we provide 
   Federal incentives and resources to try those criminals as adults with adult penalties. 
   It is with that in mind that this amendment obviously is one which I believe merits the support of all the Members of the Senate.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, violent crime by juveniles is a major problem: forcible rape, murder, armed robbery, armed assault. This amendment simply says if you are going to commit armed robbery, forcible rape with the use of a firearm, murder using a firearm, assault using a firearm, or major drug crimes using a firearm, you should be tried as an adult. This is a way of sending the clearest message that adult crime deserves adult time and that use of a firearm is unacceptable. Chapter 44 in the code addresses the use of a firearm over and over again. Use of firearms is something we care about federally. We spend a lot of time debating it. 
   The question is, are we serious about curtailing the use of firearms, especially among young people? I think we should be. This amendment provides for trying those as adults and provides access to resources in return for so doing.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, developing trade policy that will increase Americans' competitiveness in the 21st century must be a priority of this Congress and of the administration. That is why I rise today, joined by Senators DANIEL INOUYE, CHUCK GRASSLEY, CONRAD BURNS, PAT ROBERTS, CHUCK HAGEL, and MIKE ENZI, to introduce the World Trade Organization Enforcement Act of 1999. It is a bill that will increase transparency and give the public more input into the dispute settlement process of the WTO. It is analogous to a ``Sunshine Law'' for the WTO. 
   The United States plays a major role in leading the world and shaping its economy and must continue to do so. We must be leaders, not simply participants. Our leadership as a country will be effective only if our trade policy is clearly defined and is based on the vital interests of the American people, because if Americans do not accept our leadership on trade policy, neither will the rest of the world. 
   Our success of more than 200 years has been because American is a nation dedicated to We the People. We are a nation whose greatness flows not from government, but from the creativity and ingenuity of the American people. Our service providers, manufacturers, retailers, farmers and ranchers, and investors are top notch compared with their competitors, and it is time for us in public service to lay aside the values and priorities of Washington, D.C., and promote the values and priorities of the American people. 
   As I have traveled around Missouri, one thing is clear: citizens want America to be defined today as she was 100-plus years ago. We have been known as a land of ascending opportunity, that every generation in America has more opportunity than the previous generation. This is a definition of America that we must maintain--``the best is yet to come.'' 
   Already, U.S. companies are first-class in their production, processing, and marketing at home and abroad--always responding to the challenges of our competitive free-market system. While the United States can produce more goods and provide more services than any other country, we account for only five percent of the world's consuming population. That leaves 95 percent of the world's consumers outside of our borders--this is an astounding statistic when we put it in terms of creating opportunities. 
   For example, nearly 40 percent of all U.S. agricultural production is exported, but in September of last year, American farmers and ranchers faced the first monthly trade deficit of U.S. farm and food products since the United States began tracking trade data in 1941. Our farmers, or any other sector, simply will not succeed if they face descending opportunity. With manufacturing productivity increasing and with the consuming capacity of the world largely outside of our borders, our companies need equally increasing access to foreign demand. The prosperity of the next generation of Americans is tied to our current competitiveness in global markets. 
   We must develop policies that will shape opportunities for the 21st century--opening new markets, ensuring that our trading partners live up to their commitments, and to the greatest extent possible avoiding sanctions that hurt only our market opportunities abroad. 
   I still believe we must make a concerted effort to pass fast track trade negotiating authority. Because fast track has languished, U.S. businesses are increasingly being put at a competitive disadvantage. While Canada has already concluded a free trade agreement with Chile, and Mexico is expanding its free trade arrangement with Chile, the United States lags behind. Our companies clearly are being put at a competitive disadvantage in our own hemisphere. America must lead, not follow--in our back yard and around the world. 
   As we approach the next round of negotiations in the WTO, fast track is crucial to U.S. businesses. Clearly, trade negotiations designed to reduce or eliminate barriers and trade distorting practices have benefited our companies and our economy, and we need to continue our leadership role in multiple trade fora. 
   However, support for fast track and new negotiations is tied in the public mind to the benefit they receive from existing trade agreements. It is of utmost importance that the United States closely monitor and vigorously enforce our trade agreements. The private sector must be able to rely on U.S. agreements to be productive and long-lasting. 
   Opening foreign markets looms before us as a brick barricade. With the same will and authority of President Reagan before the Berlin Wall when he said--``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall''--we must face head-on the barricades before our exporters. It's not an easy task, but then again, neither was dismantling the Evil Empire. As John Wayne said in ``The Big Trail'': ``No great trail is ever blazed without hardship. You've got to fight. That's life.'' 
   Just last week, the Europeans stood on their massive wall of protectionism built across the trail of free trade and simply rejected U.S. beef, even in the face of having lost the WTO case. We've got a trail to blaze--the Europeans cannot be allowed to make a mockery of the competitive spirit of our cattle ranchers. In this case, results, not words, count the most. 
   Failing to implement agreements already negotiated creates an environment of descending opportunity. It is imperative, therefore, that the Administration follow through with enforcing the decisions the U.S. has won in the WTO. What good is winning a case if we are unable to enforce the judgment? 
   It is clear that the most contentious issues ever to be brought before the WTO--whether it is negotiating new agreements or suing the dispute settlement process to enforce existing ones--have been about the agricultural policies of the United States and the European Union. 
   One of the significant changes in the dispute settlement process in 1994 was that panels would be set up and panel  decisions would be adopted but for a consensus against doing so. Also, strict time lines were built into the process. Soon thereafter, the U.S. took two agriculture cases against the EU through the new WTO dispute process--the banana case and the beef case (which had already been before the GATT panel). The new dispute settlement changes in the WTO worked, and the United States won these two agriculture cases without the EU having the ability to block unilaterally the cases from moving forward. 
   For every triumph, however, the United States has suffered multiple defeats. Our most recent triumphs were getting the EU to accept a WTO dispute settlement process that is quick and binding, and winning agriculture cases against the EU in that settlement process. However, the EU is now denying U.S. farmers and ranchers the benefits of the WTO cases we won by stalling endlessly in the implementation of those decisions. 
   If the EU, or any other country, is allowed to use delaying tactics, there could be detrimental effects on these agriculture cases and on future cases regardless of the sector litigated. Also, the public support for the WTO system and its ability to benefit U.S. interests will be undermined. 
   It is essential that the administration make the EU beef ban a top priority. The United States has won this case against the EU numerous times, and we are clearly within our rights to benefit from the cases we litigate and win. 
   We must take the position that if the EU insists on ``paying'' for its protectionism, the EU should ``pay'' at the highest levels allowable and on products that will hurt it the most. While U.S. ranchers can never be compensated fully for the EU's protectionist policies, the value of concessions withdrawn from the EU must at least equal the value of the beef producers current damage. 
   Beef producers in Missouri will not benefit if the level of retaliation is not such that will induce the EU to change its protectionist policies. A strong response to the EU's treatment of U.S. agricultural products is long overdue. We must have reciprocity in our cross-Atlantic agricultural trade. If U.S. meat is not welcome in the EU, then EU meat should not be accepted in the United States. 
   The EU's repeated, damaging actions against America's cattlemen must not go unaswered--that is why I have called on the Administration to retaliate with authority and that is why I am introducing the WTO Enforcement Act. 
   The WTO Enforcement Act has two major objectives: ensure that the U.S. government affords adequate transparency and public participation in the U.S. decision-making process, and begin multilateral negotiations with a view toward incorporating more transparency and consultation in the multilateral context of the WTO dispute settlement process. 
   If the farm groups and U.S. companies were to increase their public comment in the implementation and post-implementation stages of the WTO dispute settlement process, this will heighten the pressure on the foreign country to comply with the Panel decisions. Currently, while the USTR, Congress, and industry groups consult during the implementation stages of Panel decisions, making the comment and reporting requirements more established and anticipated will increase accountability. The WTO system needs to be given a chance to work, but the best way to do so is to increase pressure on those countries that would try to circumvent the implementation of panels. This is imperative not only for agriculture and our relations with the EU, it could affect all sectors that are litigated under the WTO dispute settlement process. 
   The proposed modifications to U.S. domestic rules regarding dispute settlement will prove more effective if the losing party to a WTO dispute provides to the winning party its plan to comply with the WTO decision and if the winning party is given meaningfully opportunity to comment on the plan prior to its implementation. 
   The WTO is currently in the midst of a review of the organization's dispute settlement procedures. Therefore, under the WTO Enforcement Act, the United States must request reforms that would oblige member government's to submit a proposed remedy well in advance of the deadline to comply to the decision and as well as consult with the other parties to the proceeding on the proposal. 
   If the WTO Enforcement Act is passed, the U.S. public would be able to obtain more information about the foreign government's plans for compliance with WTO panel decisions and would be afforded a more formal opportunity to comment on how the process is working. If we negotiate trade agreements for American citizens wishing to do business in foreign markets, they have every right to voice their support for or objections to the way foreign governments or the U.S. government is making those agreements beneficial. 
   It is time for us to enact policies that reflect our support for U.S. companies' efforts to reach their competitive potential internationally and policies that create ascending opportunity for Americans for the 21st century so that we can say, with confidence, ``the best is yet to come.''

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I thank you. I thank the Senator from Utah for his kindness in allowing me this opportunity to address what I consider to be a very serious national problem. It is a problem of the increasingly violent nature of juvenile crime. 
   First, I would like to address my amendment that gives States incentives to try armed and violent juveniles as adults. That is amendment No. 348. 
   I thank Senator SESSIONS for his outstanding leadership on this problem. He has traveled far and wide across the country. His experience as an attorney general, his experience as a U.S. attorney, is most valuable in helping us approach this problem with the kind of sensibility that I think will give us an opportunity to make a real difference. 
   It seems that nearly every day we hear encouraging news about the progress we are making in the fight against crime. There is no doubt that this is good news. 
   But reports about reductions in the crime rate obscure two unfortunate realities: First, although the rate of crime has dropped over the past few years, the level of crime remains far too high. 
   The rate may have gone down but crime is still too high. 
   Second, whatever progress has been made in the reduction of overall crime rates, we are still confronted with a serious problem with violent juvenile crime. 
   Statistics about crime rates are useful, but what really matters is the level of violent crime. 
   Let me just give you an example. 
   On last Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down almost 200 points. If we were to focus on that fact alone, it would appear that the stock market was down, when in fact the Dow is near its all time record high. The same is true of crime, especially juvenile crime. 
   We had a little dip in crime recently. But juvenile crime and violent juvenile crime are still very high. 
   Although the most recent data show some drops in the crime rate, the overall level of crime, especially juvenile crime is unacceptably high. 
   There are about as many violent crimes committed today as in 1987. The number of violent juvenile crimes is at roughly the 1992 level and at 150 percent of the 1987 level. I do not think anyone thought they were safe or secure enough in 1987 or in 1992, that we could afford to get to be 150 percent of that level, which was the 1992 level, and that is the level to which we have returned. But it is still far above a level acceptable in our culture. 
   Statistics about crime rates also mask the increasingly violent nature of juvenile crimes. Seventeen percent of all forcible rapes, 50 percent of all arsons and 37 percent of all burglaries are committed by juveniles. 
   Finally, the recent dip in crime rates is cold comfort for victims of violent crimes. My constituents in Missouri continually identify violent juvenile crime as a paramount concern, and you only have to read the newspaper to understand why. When parents read in the newspaper about a 16-year-old who raped four young girls in St. Charles County, they understand the importance of targeting violent juvenile crime. When parents in Hazelwood read about a 13-year-old convicted of murder for fracturing his victim's skull with the butt of a sawed-off shotgun, they understand the importance of targeting violent juvenile crime. And when people in Poplar Bluff read about a 16-year-old, encouraged by his 20-year-old accomplice, who held a pizza delivery man at the point of a shotgun to steal $32, they understand the importance of targeting violent juvenile crime. 
   Madam President, that is precisely what we need to do. We need to target violent juvenile crime. We need to update our current juvenile justice laws to reflect the new vicious nature of today's teen criminals. We must treat the most violent juvenile offenders as adults and punish them as adults. 
   For too long now we have treated juvenile crime as something less than real crime. Even the language we use--referring to adult crimes, but to acts of juvenile delinquency--suggests that juvenile crime is not real crime. 
   To those young girls who were raped, to those individuals who are murdered, to their families, these crimes are real crimes. We are not talking about spitballs in the hall or the old Charlie Brown song of the 1950s. We are talking about murder, assault, and rape. And I assure you that for the victims of these crimes, the crimes are all too real--no less so because the perpetrator was under eighteen. The time has come to take junveile crime seriously and protect our children from violence. 
   Juveniles are increasingly committing adult crimes. What is more, all too often, juveniles are using adult means to facilitate these crimes. Armed crime among juveniles is at unacceptably high levels.  
   These adult crimes committed with adult means cannot be dismissed as youthful indiscretions. They cannot be dismissed as delinquencies or status offenses. These are crimes. These are horrendous crimes. People lose their lives. People are victims of serious assaults, and the crimes should be treated and prosecuted as adult crimes. 
   Accordingly, this amendment provides States with incentives to try juveniles as adults when they commit armed violent crimes. 
   Specifically, this amendment encourages States to try juveniles as adults when youth over fourteen use firearms to commit murder, forcible rape, armed robbery, armed assault, and major drug crimes. 
   We need to send a message that crimes committed with firearms will be prosecuted and taken seriously. This administration has dropped the ball in prosecuting the Federal gun laws. We tried to address this by funding firearm prosecutions in the Hatch/Craig amendment--this is the so-called project CUFF. Having sent a message to the administration to prosecute Federal gun crimes, now is the time to send a message to the States--violent gun crimes are serious ``adult'' crimes and deserve ``adult'' time. 
   In the ``juvenile Brady'' provisions in the core bill, we are treating juveniles as adults for purposes of preventing gun ownership in the future, just like if you commit a felony as an adult, you disqualify yourself from owning guns in the future. There is no basis for treating juveniles as anything but adults when they use firearms to commit violent crimes. 
   The unpleasant fact is that all too many juveniles commit serious armed crime. The answer is to prosecute these crimes vigorously--to the full extent of the law. This amendment provides States with substantial incentives to give adult time to juveniles who commit adult crimes. 
   This is not a direct mandate on States. The amendment simply says that the new pot of Federal money authorized by this bill--the juvenile accountability block grants--will only be available to States that try juveniles as adults. 
   In short, this is an incentive tied to new money that is designed to curtail the violent juvenile crime in this country, not a mandate to the States. 
   It is ironic that some of the same individuals who clamor now for Federal gun control object to this proposal on the grounds of federalism. 
   They say the Federal Government has no business being involved here and encouraging States to take a serious approach. The Federal Government has long asserted a role in policing crimes committed with firearms. 
   The entirety of chapter 44 of title 18 of the United States Code is a testament to the Federal interest in policing crimes committed with firearms. Rather than following the lead of chapter 44 in directly criminalizing firearm offenses for juveniles, this amendment takes the less drastic step by encouraging States to treat violent juvenile offenses committed with a firearm as seriously as the same offense would be if committed by an adult. 
   States remain free to define the elements of and set the penalties for the underlying crimes. We simply ask, as a condition for being the recipient of Federal funds targeted on reducing serious violent juvenile crime, that States treat violent juvenile firearm offenses as seriously as adult firearms offenses. 
   Those who complain about this mandate should take a look at the 1974 Juvenile Justice Act, passed by a Democratic Congress, full of mandates from the beginning. As amended, the act now includes more than two dozen mandates. Some of these mandates are just administrative, but others are putting real burdens on the States, preventing the incarceration of status offenders, and mandating complete sight and sound separation of juvenile offenders from adults. These are costly mandates, especially in rural areas. 
   With so many mandates that are designed to protect the juvenile offenders, it wouldn't hurt to have some incentives that protect the rest of us. Violent juveniles who commit armed violent offenses with a firearm are a serious threat to all of us. We need to treat those adult crimes as just that--adult criminal acts and require juveniles who commit them with firearms to answer accordingly. We need to send a message that violent firearm offenses will be prosecuted. Age should not be a defense to serious gun crimes.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, all across our Nation, local schools are trying to ensure that tragedies like the one in Littleton do not happen again. 
   The Federal Government in Washington is not in a position to make the best decisions for those local schools. No government--let alone the Federal Government--can produce a single solution, to prevent school violence. 
   The problems have deeper roots in our culture. Nonetheless, there are some important steps we can take to help local school districts and parents make schools safer. 
   In a few moments, I will send to the desk an amendment on behalf of Members of the Youth Violence Education task force, a task force which I helped Chair, that will help ensure that our schools once again become safe havens, rather than places of jeopardy. I thank those who came together on this task force to contribute to the amendment. Specifically, Senators HUTCHINSON, DEWINE, GREGG, HELMS, COVERDELL, ALLARD, and ABRAHAM. 
   This package is comprehensive in that it contains numerous provisions that give tools to schools and communities to prevent youth violence. First and foremost, we need to put local schools at the top of our agenda and free them to use Federal money where it will do the most good to prevent future violence. Time and experience have exposed as an utter falsehood the notion that we know what is best in every educational setting. 
   One-size-fits-all regulations won't help local schools reduce their particular risks or solve their unique problems. As we provide resources, we need to provide freedom. 
   The cornerstone of our education amendment would open up existing Department of Education funds to allow school districts new options for putting Federal dollars to work. Under this amendment, schools can choose where best to spend Federal resources under titles IV and VI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--specifically, the Safe and Drug Free Schools program, and Innovative Educational Program Strategies funds. 
   Schools can decide whether to spend the money on training, equipment, school assessments, or more personnel. For example, under this amendment, local school districts could use Federal money for purchasing metal detectors and surveillance cameras, for training school officials in recognizing and averting potentially dangerous situations, or for introducing school uniform policies, if they so chose. 
   Local school districts would remain free to choose the use that best addresses local needs. The Federal Government provides a great deal of money for education and related funding. The fiscal year 2000 budget resolution conference report called for $66.3 billion in education and related funding for fiscal year 2000; $404.1 billion over 5 years; and $782.4 billion over 10 years. 
   Compared to current spending levels, this represents an increase of $8.1 billion over 5 years and $33 billion over 10 years. 
   As a result of this budget resolution, Congress will be providing much-needed funding to education programs in fiscal year 2000. While we know that local schools need our help, we do not always know how best to provide that help. We need to provide the opportunity and authority for local schools  to do what they can to improve the climate for safe and secure learning environments on campuses. For this reason, this amendment will give schools the flexibility they need to best provide for the safety and security of their students. 
   Another component of this amendment would clarify that nothing in the Federal law stands in the way of local decisions to introduce a dress code or school uniform policy--not to mandate from Washington, but make it clear that the Federal law does not 
   prevent it or preclude it. To make sure that we don't constrain efforts to build working communities, this legislation makes it abundantly clear that Federal law does not prohibit schools from instituting dress codes. Dress codes can create a sense of belonging and unity among students and help eliminate the division of schools according to cliques. By doing so, dress codes can help schools have a sense of community among students, and Federal law should not block local educators from fostering this sense of community. 
   In Kansas City, MO, the George Washington Carver Elementary School, a magnet school, established a dress code policy for the 320 elementary school students in 1990. The results are positive. Philomina Harshaw, the principal for all 6 years that Carver has had uniforms, observed that a new sense of calmness exists throughout the school after students began wearing uniforms. ``The students feel good about themselves, as uniforms build a sense of pride,'' she has reported. 
   Long Beach, CA, has a school uniform in all its elementary and middle schools. District officials found in the year following the implementation of the school uniform policy, overall school crime decreased 36 percent, fights decreased 51 percent, sex offenses decreased 74 percent, weapons offenses decreased 50 percent, assault and battery offenses decreased 34 percent, and vandalism decreased 18 percent, sending a clear message that some of the resources which can be used to implement such a policy is sending a clear message of freedom to our schools that they are free to act in the best interests of their students. 
   The federal government should be in a position to assist schools in making decisions that they believe can make a difference, particularly when the record is clear about the difference made in other districts. 
   In addition, this task force, which was formed to look at our federal education policy to see if anything could be done to reduce the impact of violence in schools, included in the amendment a provision which provides certain liability protections for school personnel when they undertake reasonable actions to maintain order, discipline, and a safe educational environment. 
   This provision, to which Senator COVERDELL will speak shortly, is based upon similar liability protections for volunteers that was signed into law, as well as a number of state laws that offer teachers limited civil liability against frivolous and arbitrary lawsuits. We must assure that teachers and other school personnel are able to do what is necessary to provide a safe and stable learning environment for all students. 
   This amendment also includes language that makes certain that school discipline records follow a student when a student transfers to another public or private school. 
   The receiving school should have information about the discipline records of a student coming into that school environment. In the last Congress I sponsored an amendment that ensured that juvenile records were available to schools when students transferred. 
   My involvement on this issue began with the 1995 killing of 15-year-old Christine Smetzer in a restroom at McCluer North High School in St. Louis County. The male special education student convicted of murdering Smetzer had a juvenile record and had been caught in the women's restroom at a previous school. However, teachers and administrators at McCluer North say they were not informed of the student's record when he transferred to their school. 
   It was tragic the transfer didn't involve the disciplinary records, because it cost Christine Smetzer her life. 
   In response, I secured a provision in the law requiring that, under IDEA, student disciplinary records must transfer to a new school when the student goes to a new school. 
   The language in the task force amendment expands that provision, so that any student's discipline record--whether or not the student is served under IDEA--will be available to any school--public or private--to which the student transfers. 
   We need to send all the information we can about a student to a new school when a person transfers. 
   These provisions and others were developed by the Republican Education Task Force which I chaired. I want to again thank my colleagues who worked with me on the Task Force--Senators DEWINE and HUTCHINSON, GREGG, COVERDELL, and HELMS. I look forward to working with them to ensure that these proposals are included in the final bill. 
   It is in response to these considerations. As a result of the work product of this task force, we developed a package of considerations in an amendment. 
   I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from Tennessee, first of all, for his sensitivity to what is happening in the schools of America. His visiting the schools is something which I find to be very important. You can sit here in Washington for a long time and cook up all sorts of theories about how schools ought to be, but until you talk to the people in the schools--and in his case Nashville, Davidson County--until you talk to the principals and teachers and parents, you do not understand the problems created by our current Federal IDEA law. The Senator from Tennessee has found out that in a 1-year snapshot there were eight detected possessions of weapons in the schools, six of which were from students covered by individualized education plans, and three of which our law--the law that we made--says schools can't expel those students the way they ought to be able to expel them. 
   He has pointed out we should fix the law. 
   What is interesting to me--and I commend the Senator from Tennessee. I have visited school districts all across the State of Missouri. I have gone to district after district to try and assert exactly what it is we should be doing. I have had school superintendents mention to me time after time this same problem. I talked to one small school district superintendent who talked about the dangers of not being able to have discipline in these settings. He talked about a student who threatened to kill other students seven times--threaten to shoot them. 
   Finally, the individual shot another student. Fortunately, the shot took place off the school premises so that the legal authorities incarcerated the student. They didn't have to go through the painful procedure of trying to discipline him within the confines of this law which makes it virtually impossible to exercise the kind of discipline necessary. 
   This bill is very simple. This bill is not designed to hurt any group of students. This is designed to secure the classroom. There isn't any class of students that is better off being favored and being able to bring guns or bombs to school. That is not in the interest of any group of students. 
   This bill basically takes off barriers that the Congress placed in the path of good school administrators, parents, teachers and local school boards. We erected barriers that kept from taking students who had guns in their possession out of schools--merely because they were determined to be in some way disabled. 
   This amendment simply says in spite of the fact that you are a student--of  course, one out of every eight students nationally turns out to be disabled; one in seven in the State of Missouri--the fact that you are in this category called IDEA, doesn't mean you can bring a gun or a bomb to school with impunity. 
   We simply take the barriers, the roadblocks out of the system. We say to school administrators and principals: You are free to discipline these students uniformly, just like you would discipline other students. 
   I think that is a very important, profoundly simple point. It is the kind of correction which we only make when we get out and talk to people out there who are running the schools. When they tell you they can't discipline kids who are threatening over and over to kill other students, who eventually shoot other students, when they tell you they can't keep kids who brought guns to school out of school or from bringing guns back into school, and because of Federal procedures that say disciplines are more difficult the second time because we set up a Federal bureaucracy that keeps schools from being able to exercise discipline, it is time to say the most important thing for students--whether disabled, conventional, mainstream or not--the most important thing for that classroom is safety. 
   When you keep guns and bombs out of the school, you promote the safety of all students. 
   I am here to say how much I appreciate the opportunity to be able to sponsor this amendment that gives local schools, principals, teachers, parents and school boards the right to maintain gun-free, bomb-free schools, to have safe learning environments where students, without the feeling of threat and insecurity, can actually learn. 
   It is a pleasure to be a cosponsor of this amendment with Senator FRIST. I commend him. We all want to do everything we can for the education of all of our students. Our students who are disabled deserve our special compassion and attention, and more than any others, they deserve the protection that is afforded when we can have the ability to have secure, safe learning environments. We can do that when we allow our administrators to make sure that those individuals who bring guns to school can be disciplined. 
   One last point: The law that provides for expulsion of students who bring guns to schools gives principals discretion to allow students to reenter the school. That same discretion would apply to these kinds of students as it applies to conventional students. 
   This is a field leveler. It puts people on the same level and it puts the safety of our schoolchildren in first place--not part of our schoolchildren, all of them. Disabled children, other individuals, the entire school population must have the assurance that school officials have the capacity to enforce safe schools. 
   I thank the Senator from Tennessee and others for joining in this. I am honored to be an original cosponsor of this amendment.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the advent of the television began the extraordinary advance in video technology. Families came together to witness such great programs as: The Andy Griffith Show, I Love Lucy, Leave it to Beaver, and Father Knows Best. The television revolutionized technology and media, and replaced the radio as the main source of family entertainment. The television is an instrumental part of American society, it provides us with news, education, and entertainment and will likely continue to do so. 
   In recent years, however, the entertainment industry has promoted programming unfit for the children of the next generation. No longer can families come together to watch television without having to see material unfit for their children. In the wake of recent events, it has become clear that exposure to violent programming does in fact play an influential role in children's behavior. It is regrettable that it has come to the point where it may be necessary for Congress to take action in the oversight of television programming. The Children's Protection from Violent Programming Act creates a ``safe harbor'' and eliminates the broadcast of violent programming aired during hours when children are likely to be a substantial portion of the viewing audience. 
   While I have reservations with this amendment, I am willing to stand in support of it. Admittedly, this amendment gives the Federal Communications Commission additional power to regulate television programming--even when two-thirds of American households have no children under the age of 18. Clearly this amendment will restrict the programming available to viewers of all ages. I also have reservations since the TV rating system, already in place, will provide parents with specific information about the content of a television program. V-chips will be incorporated into all new television sets by January 1, 2000. In addition, I am concerned that by passing this legislation, we will be giving the Federal Communications Commission additional authority to define violent programming far beyond that which is necessary. 
   The fact of the matter is that to date the entertainment industry has not yet taken responsibility for themselves. Television programs of an adult nature are undermining and contradicting the virtues parents are trying to teach. Likewise, research from more than ten thousand medical, pediatric, psychological, and sociological studies show that television violence increases violent and aggressive behavior in society. Astonishingly, the murder rate in the United States doubled within 15 years after television was introduced into American homes. 
   It pains me to stand before you today and say that the federal government may need to regulate yet another industry. What we need is smaller, smarter government. Without the cooperation of television networks, however, Congress has no choice but to give the FCC the authority to impose itself upon the entertainment industry. Each of us, Congress, television networks, and parents need to come together for the sake of our children. Our children are the future of this country, and if we as a nation are going to live together in peace, each of us must take the responsibility to teach our children the difference between right and wrong.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, all of us are concerned and deeply so about what we think is a changing landscape in American culture. We are concerned about the fact that young people whom we once felt were the repository for the innocence of the culture are no longer that repository. We find ourselves being outraged and stunned when we find activity in juvenile quarters which are really threatening to all of us. That is why the whole juvenile justice topic is before us. We are amazingly aware, painfully aware, of the fact that we need to take steps to improve the way we deal with young people and to curtail the amount of criminal activity and behavior among those who are the young people of our culture. 
   It is important that we debate this issue in the Senate. It is important that we offer legislative responses to this serious challenge to the public safety and security of people and their families. But we shouldn't try to telegraph or to communicate the fact that we are addressing this, that we think that we can do everything that is necessary for a safer and saner approach to life by all of our citizens including young people. 
   There is much that simply can't be done by government. The resources of the State are inadequate to shape the culture totally and completely and to bring the kind of result that we want. 
   The fact that we are here to talk about things that we can do doesn't  mean we believe that what we can do will totally accommodate or otherwise remediate the problem. We should do what we can do. I believe it is important to look around and ask how can we improve the situation and the legal framework. 
   One of the aspects of juvenile justice that we are discussing today is the access that juveniles have to firearms. In my hometown of Springfield, MO, and towns and cities across Missouri and across the United States, parents have long played an active and crucial role in teaching children the safe and responsible use of firearms. 
   However, Federal law already recognizes that certain firearms involve a higher level of responsibility than others. Handguns, for instance, have long been recognized as requiring greater restrictions than other firearms. Of course, any restriction must respect the second amendment rights of American citizens, one of the fundamental rights enjoyed under the Bill of Rights under the U.S. Constitution. 
   The amendment I propose today does exactly that. It simply extends the recognition of the need for increased responsibility to certain military-style semiautomatic assault weapons such as AK-47s and Uzis. In part, this mirrors a bill which I introduced recently in the Senate, Senate bill 994. The amendment which I have sent to the desk restricts the acquisition and possession of semiautomatic assault rifles and high-capacity ammunition-feeding devices--those holding over 10 rounds of ammunition--by juveniles. 
   Let me say again what this amendment does. This amendment restricts juveniles from acquiring semiautomatic assault weapon rifles and high-capacity ammunition-feeding devices--meaning 
   those feeding devices which hold over 10 rounds of ammunition. It says juveniles do not have the authority to acquire, to purchase, or to possess those rifles generally. 
   Let me be clear about what this amendment does not do. This amendment does not affect the lawful ownership or possession of semiautomatic hunting or target rifles or semiautomatic shotguns, the kind of firearms that are routinely used responsibly by young people and American citizens across our country in hunting. It does restrict the possession and purchase of semiautomatic assault weapons and the high-capacity ammunition-feeding devices associated with them. 
   Current Federal gun law can be awfully complicated, but this amendment is not complicated. It is a straightforward commonsense amendment. Let me refer to a chart which shows the existing law. Already, the law requires elevated levels of responsibility in terms of handguns so that a juvenile individual is prohibited from purchasing a handgun from a federally licensed dealer, prohibited from purchasing a handgun in a private transaction or sale, and must have the permission of a parent in order to possess or use the handgun. I repeat, cannot buy from a licensed dealer, cannot buy in a private sale, and must have permission to use or possess. 
   Current Federal law in regard to semiautomatic assault rifles prohibits the sale by a federally licensed dealer to a juvenile, but permits juveniles to purchase semiautomatic assault rifles from individuals in private sales, and does not require a juvenile to have parental permission in order to possess or use such a firearm. 
   We have a disparity. Handguns have been prohibited for sale both privately and through licensed dealers and require parental permission; semiautomatic assault rifles, or AKs or Uzis, although prohibited for sale by a licensed dealer, juveniles are permitted to purchase at private sales; and juveniles require no parental permission. What we are proposing takes care of this disparity. 
   It says we will treat semiautomatic assault weapons as we treat handguns, that we will prohibit the acquisition of these weapons and firearms by juveniles from private sales just as they have been prohibited from federally licensed dealers, and we would require any possession by a juvenile of such a firearm to be an acknowledged and permitted possession of that firearm by the adult or the guardian parent of the juvenile. 
   It is pretty clear that what we have done here is to simplify the law by saying the same basic rules that apply to juveniles on handguns will apply to juveniles in semiautomatic assault weapons or assault rifles. 
   The law currently says in regard to a handgun you can teach your child to shoot a handgun but he can't shoot it without your permission. Basically, this would harmonize semiautomatic assault rifles with the law regarding handguns. 
   Now, there are under existing law some permitted uses of handguns by juveniles. If a juvenile is in the military service or if a juvenile is in lawful defense of himself against an intruder into his house, he is allowed to use a handgun--eminently reasonable. Those basic exceptions ought to be transferred or ought to exist for other firearms, as well. 
   Transfer of title to a firearm like this to a juvenile is permitted by inheritance, though the juvenile may not take possession until age 18, absent the kind of permission which would be required not only for this but for handguns. 
   My amendment simply treats semiautomatic assault weapons such as the AK-47s and the Uzis, street-sweeper shotguns, and high-capacity ammunition-feeding devices the same way for juveniles that we treat handguns. Private parties can no longer sell them to juveniles, and the juvenile needs parental permission to possess one unless he is in the military or uses it for self-defense. 
   What kind of weapons are we talking about that have been permitted to be sold to juveniles but would be prohibited under this amendment? The list includes: the AK-47, the Uzis, the Galil, Beretta AR 70, Colt AR-15, Fabrique Nationale FN or FAL, SWD M 10, M-11, M-11 1/9, the Steyr Aug, the TEC-9, street-sweeper shotgun, Striker-12 shotgun, and other semiautomatic rifles and shotguns with at least two military features, such as folding stocks, pistol grips, bayonet gloves, and grenade launchers. 
   These are serious firearms. Because they are serious, they create some new serious penalties. This amendment creates a new penalty of up to 20 years' incarceration for possession of handgun ammunition or semiautomatic assault weapon or high-capacity ammunition-feeding device with the intent to possess, carry, or use it in a crime of violence in a school zone. It raises the penalty for transferring a firearm to a juvenile, knowing that it will be used in a crime of violence or drug crime, to 20 years.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator. I appreciate his work, coming to Missouri to participate in the hearing. 
   It became clear to us that adults using children to commit crimes--hoping the children would be excused because of their youth and they would all escape penalty--brings children into a criminal environment. It starts them down a path of crime. That is very dangerous, and this proposal which we are considering today obviously would elevate the penalties for that about threefold. I am delighted.  
   Again, let me refer to this amendment that really harmonizes the law so the same kinds of prohibitions apply to semiautomatic assault weapons as apply to handguns. There are a few clarifying changes in the existing law. It makes it clear that parental permission allows possession, either with parental supervision or with prior written permission of a parent. Even with this parental permission, juveniles can only possess these weapons for three narrow purposes: For target shooting; for gun safety courses; or if required for their employment in ranching, farming, or lawful hunting. Such a firearm being transported by a juvenile must be unloaded and in a locked case, under this amendment. So for a juvenile, even if he was transporting for one of these lawful purposes--that also relates to handguns, I might add--the law requires the weapon be unloaded and in a locked case. 
   Likewise, this amendment allows prior written permission to be retained by a parent instead of carried by the juvenile in the case of juvenile possession incident to employment, ranching, or farming activities. In other words, if on a ranch a youngster is carrying a pistol, obviously the written permission can exist in the ranch house while the youngster is doing chores or away from the house with the pistol. 
   Finally, the amendment clarifies the self-defense provision of the law by permitting possession in lawful defense of self or others in a residence against any threat to the life of the individuals there. I think it is only reasonable to conclude it should not be illegal for a young person to pick up a handgun to defend himself and his family in the event he is in his home and is the victim of a threat to his own life. 
   If parents want to teach children to use firearms responsibly, the law should not stand in the way. This law encourages parents to play an active role in the lives of their children and respects the judgment of parents. It does not suggest we in Washington know best and are better equipped than parents to make decisions. But it does say, as it relates to semiautomatic assault rifles and weapons, the provisions that relate to handguns ought to be the provisions that relate to semiautomatic rifles. That means this amendment would prohibit the private sale of a semiautomatic assault rifle to a juvenile and the possession of any assault rifle or similar weapon by a juvenile, absent the specific permission of a parent. 
   With that in mind, I think we take another step forward. We do not cure all the problems attendant to our society related to law-abiding responsibilities of young people. But we do take a step forward to bring the law to a place of rationality and to prohibit possession of semiautomatic assault rifles where pistols or handguns would be prohibited, and to prohibit such possession without the permission of a parent in a similar way to the way in which it has been prohibited for handguns. 
   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for her kind remarks about the intent that is expressed in making sure we provide the same kind of restrictions for semiautomatic assault weapons that we provide for handguns. 
   I just say this is an important amendment. This is the subject of legislation I have previously filed in the Senate. I think this is appropriate because this addresses the subject matter of this bill, which is the juvenile justice framework. This is not, obviously, a comprehensive approach to such weapons but it is very clear and specific in terms of its reference to juveniles and their possession of not only the weapons but the kind of expanded or substantial clips or magazines, and it simply says juveniles are ineligible to possess those kinds of expanded clips or magazines. 
   So I believe this measure is appropriate and it will harmonize the law to say that juveniles do not have greater authority to possess semiautomatic assault rifles than they do to possess handguns. This harmonizes the law and brings it into a place of reasonability. 
   I am grateful for the opportunity to present this amendment. I appreciate, and will appreciate, the support of colleagues who intend to vote on behalf of this amendment. 
   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, this is a simple amendment. It simply says that what we ought to do in regard to semiautomatic assault weapons in our schools, for young people, is to require them to have the same kind of rules we have for handguns. Most people think that a semiautomatic assault weapon is much more dangerous than a handgun. Yet, under current law, you are permitted to buy one as a juvenile. You don't have to have your parents' permission like you do with a handgun, where you are prohibited and you do have to have your parents' permission. 
   So what we are talking about in this law is, for semiautomatic weapons, you are prohibited from buying them as a juvenile. And you cannot even possess one unless you have a clear indication of your parents' permission. 
   We have also dealt with juveniles in these clips that are being spoken of and simply said that they are not eligible to possess these clips, that this kind of automatic ammunition-feeding device is not appropriate for and, therefore, is prohibited, in terms of selling to, in the same way that we would prohibit the sales to young people of semiautomatic assault weapons. It does not include traditional hunting weapons, and we are not talking about these kind of things that are mentioned as spray-firing weapons. As a matter of fact, semiautomatic is not spray firing. Spray firing is a machine gun. 
   We are simply making the rules for semiautomatic assault weapons the same as they are for handguns. It a change that ought to be made. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the amendment.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   The Ashcroft amendment is a very simple amendment. It recognizes that in addition to handguns, which require some special responsibility and, therefore, are prohibited for sale to minors, and are even prohibited in private sales to minors, and for them to be in the possession of a minor requiring the permission of parents, that the same kind of rules ought to apply to semiautomatic assault rifles as apply to handguns as it relates to minors. 
   Right now, where handgun sales to minors are prohibited, semiautomatic assault rifle sales to minors are permitted. Where a minor, in order to have a handgun, has to have parental permission, a minor can own an assault rifle, a semiautomatic assault rifle without parental permission. 
   The Ashcroft amendment simply wants to remove this disparity, because it expresses a belief that a semiautomatic assault rifle, assault weapon, ought to have the same level of responsibility attendant to it as a handgun. 
   The Ashcroft amendment would prohibit private sales of semiautomatic assault rifles to minors, and it would require that they have parental permission in order for one even to be in the possession of a minor. 
   This really makes the rules about handguns and semiautomatic assault weapons identical for all basic intents and purposes. There are some exceptions in the law for purposes of the possession of handguns that relate to employment. There are some minors, for instance, who are required in their employment to be involved with a handgun. Those exceptions would be the same basically as well. 
   The thrust of this amendment is to say that this situation where semiautomatic assault weapons were not required to have the level of responsibility that we had assigned to handguns for juveniles, that should be changed so that assault rifles and the semiautomatic assault weapons have the same kind of responsibility requirements that had previously been applied to handguns resulting in the requirement that there be parental permission before there can even be possession, and that there would not be a potential for purchase in private sales. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this reasonable and simple change in the law.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Senator from Utah. 
   I rise to address a number of provisions in the Hatch-Craig amendment that I am particularly concerned with, provisions that I have sought to move forward over the last several months and in the last several years, provisions that set or increase mandatory minimum sentences for gun crimes and drug crimes which endanger juveniles. 
   First, we need to address federal firearms offenses and impose substantial penalties on violent firearms offenses. Those who misuse firearms to commit crimes impose a tremendous cost on American society and on our culture. They destroy lives, they destroy families, they destroy businesses, they destroy neighborhoods. We need to have a Federal policy with a zero tolerance for those who are misusing firearms to perpetrate violent crimes or to traffic in drugs--the kind of criminal activities that are destroying the very fabric of our culture. 
   An essential part of this zero tolerance policy are mandatory minimum sentences that creates a serious deterrent for those who commit Federal violent and drug crimes, including carjacking and violent crimes on school grounds. 
   In order for mandatory minimum sentences to provide such a deterrent, they need to be long enough to make the offenders think about committing these crimes. They need to think twice about what they are going to do. Those sentences also need to be long enough to protect our law-abiding citizens from these criminals for a long time, by putting the criminals away for substantial period of time. 
   Current Federal law provides mandatory minimum sentences for possessing or using a firearm in the commission of a Federal crime of violence or drug trafficking. The current minimum sentence for possessing a firearm during such a crime is 5 years. This is a serious penalty for simply having a gun, not even showing it or firing it; just having it on your person. My amendment doesn't increase this penalty. We think it is sufficient as it is, particularly because there is truth in sentencing in the Federal system. 
   We do, however, seek in this amendment to change the current minimums for using a firearm during such crimes. The current minimum sentence for brandishing a firearm in a violent Federal crime or drug trafficking crime is 7 years. In this amendment we raise that penalty to 10 years. We would raise the penalty for discharging a firearm and thereby endangering life and limb from a 10 year minimum to 12 years. The law does not presently provide any mandatory minimum for wounding, injuring or maiming with a firearm. We create a minimum 15-year penalty for those who actually cause physical harm with a firearm. 
   Finally, the law currently provides a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment for knowingly transferring a firearm, knowing that it will be used in the commission of a crime. We would impose a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years for knowingly facilitating gun violence by transferring a firearm to someone whom you knew was going to commit a crime. 
   These penalties are serious, but the problem is serious. These penalties will help create a real set of incentives to tell criminals they better leave their guns at home. 
   Let me also address mandatory minimum sentences for federal drug crimes. The current penalties for adults who target vulnerable juveniles by distributing drugs to minors or by selling drugs in or near schools are the same--both of these crimes currently carry a 1-year mandatory minimum for both the initial and subsequent offenses. This amendment raises the mandatory minimum term for each of these crimes from 1 year to 3 years for the initial violation, and 5 years for subsequent offenses. 
   This amendment is similar to two other provisions in the core bill we are debating, S. 254. One provision already included in S. 254 increases the mandatory minimum penalties for adults who use minors to commit crimes. Adults should not be able to use minors to  commit their crimes for them in order to escape penalty. Another provision in S. 254 increases the penalties on adults who use juveniles to commit crimes of violence. Penalties are doubled for first-time offenders and trebled for repeat offenders. 
   Together, these provisions send a clear message to adults who would prey on our children, attempting to ensnare them in the dangerous life of committing crimes, and often in the violent world of illegal drugs. 
   Last year, I introduced all of these provisions in a package designed to target adults who use and exploit juveniles to commit crimes. It is time for us to send an unmistakably clear message that we will not, as a culture, tolerate those who use juveniles, who lead them or point them in the direction of lives of crime in an effort to avoid penalties for their own criminal action. The system already lets young people off with a slap on the wrist and a clean slate when they turn 18. Why should any adult risk serious jail time by committing the crimes themselves? Instead, have a juvenile commit it for them. I think it is time to make it clear that we will deal harshly with adults who use juveniles in the commission of crimes. 
   Sadly, our current treatment of juveniles gives adults an incentive to exploit children in this way. We need to make sure it cannot be done. If a store sold candy for $5 to adults, but $1 to children, there would be a lot of adults sending kids in to buy candy for them. The same is sadly true with the criminal justice system. Lenient treatment of juveniles has too frequently caused adults to think they can get juveniles to perpetrate the crimes for them. We must make it clear that no adult can escape crime by having a juvenile commit a crime on his or her behalf. It is no wonder that in my home State of Missouri, a 20-year-old in Poplar Bluff had her 16-year-old accomplice take the lead in a recent armed robbery. Why should she risk serious adult time in prison when she could have a juvenile do the crime for her? We cannot continue to encourage this intolerable behavior. Those who would corrupt our children deserve our stiffest sanctions. We need these enhanced penalties on adults who use juveniles to commit federal violent offenses and drug crimes. 
   The provisions in S. 254 and those in this amendment correct the perverse incentives in the current system by severely punishing adults who endanger our children and attempt to ensnare them in the world of drugs and crime. 
   Mr. President, I ask how much time is remaining?

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize today the 8th annual Missouri Children's Mental Health Week, which was celebrated May 2-8. This year's theme is ``In a child's life, everyone is accountable.'' The Missouri Department of Mental Health and MO-SPAN, the Missouri Statewide Parent Advisory Network, teamed up to co-sponsor the week. 
   Some estimates indicate that 12 percent of all children and youth in the United States have an emotional, behavioral or mental disorder. While many of these children and their families need services ranging from therapeutic to educational and social services, only about one-third of these children and youth receive assistance. 
   Recognizing Children's Mental Health Week is one way to bring attention to the seriousness of mental health disorders in our children and spread the message of support for them. The week's events were begun with MO-SPAN's Second Annual Clayton Huey Memorial Benefit Walk-A-Thon and a kickoff event at the Missouri Capitol and continued throughout the week. 
   It is a privilege for me to be able to recognize the diligent work of families with children who have emotional, behavioral and mental disorders. Likewise, it is also important to celebrate the workers, volunteers, and organizations--like MO-SPAN--who provide vital support, services, information, and advocacy for these families.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. Individuals from strong families contribute to the society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment of ``till death us do part'' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country strong. 
   For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Robert and Nellie Livingston, who on June 4th, 1999, will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. Many things have changed in the 50 years they have been married, but the values, principles, and commitment this marriage demonstrates are timeless. As Mr. and Mrs. Livingston celebrate their 50th year together with family and friends, it will be apparent that the lasting legacy of this marriage will be the time, energy, and resources invested in their children, friends, and community. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we can celebrate a similar milestone. 
   The Livingstons' commitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserve to be saluted and recognized.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, in the past two weeks since the tragedy occurred at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, we have all had time to reflect on a number of issues. Our thoughts and prayers go to the families, friends, and other loved ones affected by this incident. We have asked ourselves why this happened. How it happened. 
   The Littleton tragedy requires reflection, thought and corrective action within our spheres of influence and responsibility. Children must learn respect and responsibility. Parents must be responsible for their children, including what they watch and what they do. Schools must have firm, fair and consistent discipline policies. Schools must be free to expel violence-prone students. State legislators must review state laws. Congress must review federal laws. 
   As a member of the United States Senate, I have been prompted to stop and examine our current federal education laws involving school safety, and see if our policies are promoting and encouraging school safety--or are in some way hindering our teachers, parents, principals, superintendents, and school boards from maintaining a safe place for our children to learn and our teachers to teach. 
   For much of the past year and before the Littleton tragedy, I traveled through Missouri talking to teachers, principals, school superintendents and school officials about the issue of school safety and school discipline. What I heard and learned was disturbing. After listening to school officials, I have concluded that there is, in fact, at least one federal law that actually jeopardizes our schools' efforts to provide a safe learning environment. Today I am introducing legislation, the School Safety Act, to amend this law and give schools the ability to remove from the classroom students who possess weapons or threaten to use weapons in the classroom, so that we can keep our children and teachers safe. 
   Once enacted, this legislation will help foster a safer environment in  schools. If this legislation had been enacted years ago, would it have prevented the Littleton tragedy? It would be wrong to claim for certain that it would. The truth of the Littleton tragedy is that those involved in the massacre violated at least 13 federal laws. The existence of those 13 laws did not stop the Littleton massacre. Still, we must examine our current federal education laws involving school safety and make necessary changes. 
   Across America, parents, teachers, and communities have made it clear that we want our schools to offer our students a world-class education that boosts student achievement and elevates them to excellence. If children are to attain high levels of academic performance, our schools must be able to provide safe and secure learning environments free of undue disruption or violence. 
   When we think of school safety, we obviously turn to one element that poses a threat to a secure environment: weapons in schools. 
   Our general federal policy is commendable: to have zero tolerance for weapons at schools. The federal Gun-Free Schools Act requires states receiving federal education funds to have a law requiring a one year expulsion of a student who has a weapon at school. I know that my state of Missouri has such a law on the books. 
   We would think that the Gun-Free Schools Act settles the issue of weapons in schools. But it doesn't. This law contains an exception for nearly one in seven students in my state, and one in eight nationally. This exception is for students covered by the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. 
   Hidden among the provisions of the Gun-Free Schools Act is section (c), entitled ``Special Rule,'' which says: ``The provisions of this section shall be construed in a manner consistent with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.'' When you turn to the IDEA law, you see a complex and elaborate set of roadblocks and barriers that hamstring schools in applying discipline to any IDEA student for situations involving weapons possessions. 
   When we talk about students who are subject to the IDEA law, we are not talking about any small number of children: In Missouri, over 129,000--or nearly 14% of our 893,000 students--are classified as ``disabled.'' That's one in seven students. Nationally, there are about 12-13% of all students who are under the IDEA law. We have to keep this in mind as we talk about this issue of school discipline and safety. 
   We must also consider which individuals qualify as ``disabled'' under IDEA. We are not just talking about blindness, deafness, orthopedic impairments, or MS. The federal IDEA definition of disability also includes individuals with serious emotional disturbances or specific learning disabilities. 
   Unlike the Gun-Free Schools Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act does not have a zero tolerance for students with weapons. In fact, the IDEA law makes it very difficult for schools to act effectively when a student subject to this law has a weapon at school. 
   While the Gun-Free Schools Act would require that any other student be expelled for a year, the ``special rule'' for an IDEA student who brings a gun or knife to school provides that he could be back in the regular classroom within 45 days. 
   Here is a federal law that creates dangerous situations by not allowing school officials to keep those students who have possessed weapons in school out of the classroom. 
   IDEA also hinders schools from taking effective action to protect their students and teachers from students who make threats to use weapons. School districts have developed policies to address student weapons threats. For example, a superintendent in my state told my office that under his school district's policy, he could suspend a student for up to 180 days for threatening to bring a weapon to school and shoot another student. 
   However, if that superintendent is dealing with a student under IDEA, the law makes it very difficult for him to remove the student even if he considers the student a serious threat to the safety of others. In fact, the school may be unable to remove this child from the classroom if he has already been suspended for a certain number of days during the school year. 
   Here is a federal law that creates dangerous situations by not allowing school officials to act on early warning signs to remove potentially violent students from school. 
   The costs involved with trying to keep a dangerous child out of the classroom are astronomical under IDEA. Schools have told me that the ``due process'' proceedings a parent can invoke in response to any disciplinary action taken toward a child is so expensive and time-consuming that schools do all they can to avoid these proceedings. The easiest, simplest due process hearing costs a school about $7500 in Missouri! 
   Not only must schools pay their own legal fees for a due process hearing under IDEA, but they also face the prospect of being responsible for the parents' attorneys fees in some cases. 
   Here is a federal law that discourages safe classrooms because schools cannot afford to take steps they deem essential to maintaining safety without risking serious financial jeopardy. 
   The problems created by IDEA are not simply theoretical. Just three weeks ago--before the Littleton incident--I traveled around Missouri to talk to parents, teachers, principals, and administrators about ways to offer each child a world class education. Again and again, I was told that schools are handcuffed by federal law in dealing with violent and dangerous behavior--often connected with weapons. Let me give you a few examples: 
   In one rural Missouri school, a 15-year-old IDEA student had been making numerous threats against both students and staff. He said such things as, ``I'm going to shoot you. I'm going to get a gun and blow you away.'' School officials were aware of the threats, but the federal law hindered them from taking steps they thought most appropriate to deal with the student. Unfortunately this student ended up shooting another student off school grounds. Fortunately, because he remained in the custody of law enforcement authorities, the student was not returned to the classroom. School officials in this district told me that had this student not been subject to the IDEA laws, they could have--and would have--removed him from the classroom when he made the threats of killing other students and personnel. 
   In an eastern Missouri school district, an IDEA student who was under school suspension was asked to leave a Friday night school dance that he tried to 
   attend in violation of school policy. The student tried continually to regain entry into the school and said to the principal, a teacher, and a parent who was helping supervise the dance: ``I'm going to go home, get my shotgun, come back, and blow your [expletives deleted] heads off.'' The superintendent says that the federal IDEA law constrained him to return this potentially dangerous student to the classroom early the next week. If the student had not had been under IDEA, the superintendent could have imposed a far longer suspension for threatening school personnel. 
   I learned of a Missouri grade schooler, subject to IDEA law, who announced at school, ``I'm going to bring a knife and cut the bus driver's throat.'' Was this an idle threat? This child had transferred from another school where he had been found with a knife and was suspended for 10 days. The federal IDEA law prevents this new school from imposing any more suspensions upon this child for the rest of the school year unless he actually shows up with a weapon again! 
   Let me emphasize that the vast majority of disabled students under the IDEA law--just like the vast majority of nondisabled students--are good kids who don't pose discipline problems in school. However, when it comes to something as serious as a student bringing a weapon to school or threatening to kill or harm someone with a weapon, school officials must have the ability to respond in the way they believe most appropriate to maintain a safe and stable school for all children. 
   When I hear these incidents from Missouri schools, I cannot help but think that there is something drastically wrong with our federal education laws. We have a mass tragedy waiting to happen if federal law keeps teachers from getting teenagers with weapons out of schools. We cannot afford to keep laws on the books that preclude schools from dealing with  early warning signs of danger and handcuff them from taking swift action to prevent violence. We must give schools the power to keep our children safe by allowing them to remove all students who have weapons or threaten to use them. 
   Schools all over my state have told me that they need the authority to discipline all students in a fair and consistent manner--for the safety of their schools and for the benefit of disabled children. Here are some examples of what schools have told me: 
   Maynard Wallace, Superintendent of the Ava R-I School District, has written: ``The discipline code must be the same for all if public education is to survive.'' He says that treating children with handicaps differently than other children in the area of discipline ``not only undermines the entire discipline of the school but is a definite disservice to the handicapped child as well.'' 
   Betty Chong, Assistant Superintendent for Special Services in the Cape Girardeau school district, writes: ``The educators are themselves advocates for children with disabilities. . . . Special educators directors and many principals were first teachers who were dedicated (and still are) to the education of students with disabilities.'' She goes on to say: ``Students with disabilities are held to the same standards as students without disabilities when they are adults. When do they learn how to be law abiding citizens?'' 
   Lyle Laughman, the superintendent of the Lincoln County R-IV school district has written: ``It is in the total best interest of the child and society for that [discipline] determination to be made on the local, individual case level rather than the Federal law which greatly restricts what a school can do in an individual set of circumstances.'' 
   Dale Walkup, Board of Education President of the Blue Springs School District gave me a copy of a letter he sent to President Clinton which says, ``The reauthorization of IDEA has not supported impartial and appropriate consequences for those students who choose drugs and are violent or dangerous to others. We hope the IDEA regulations become more reasonable, appropriate, and considerate of the needs of our total student population.'' 
   In response to both the incidents and recommendations that I have heard from schools, I am introducing the School Safety Act, which will allow schools to remove from the classroom any student who has a weapon or threatens to use a weapon at school. This legislation, which has been endorsed by the Missouri School Boards Association, will repeal the federal law that handcuffs schools from taking measures they believe appropriate to maintain a safe and secure learning environment for students and teachers. 
   A safe and secure setting is vital to success in the classroom. Any student who has a weapon at school, or who threatens to kill or harm someone with a weapon, should be removed from the classroom immediately. Whether a student is ``disabled'' under federal law should not prevent school administrators from dealing appropriately with weapons in school. We can no longer afford to keep a federal law that threatens the safety of the classroom. We can no longer afford to tolerate federal policy that invites a mass tragedy. Under the School Safety Act, schools will be empowered with the flexibility and authority they need to remove any dangerous and violent student from the classroom when weapons are involved. 
   This is not the first time I have introduced school safety legislation since I have been in the Senate. I have already worked to make improvements in the federal law to create a safer learning environment for students and teachers. 
   I began working on this issue in 1995, after a young woman was found dead in the restroom of a North St. Louis County high school. The male special education student convicted of murdering the woman had a history of dangerous behavior, but his discipline record hadn't been disclosed to his new school. In response to this situation, I sought for ways to give schools the crucial information they need to maintain a secure school environment. I authored legislation signed into law in June 1997 providing for the transfer of discipline records when students with dangerous behavior change schools. 
   In the recent ``ed-flex'' bill signed into law on April 29, 1999, I secured a provision that closes a loophole in federal law concerning weapons possession in school. Missouri school board officials had alerted me to a federal provision that allows a school to discipline a student only for carrying a weapon onto school grounds, but not for possessing a weapon at school. In response to this concern, I had the law amended to ensure that school officials can remove a student from the classroom whether he possesses--or carries--a weapon at school. 
   The legislation I am offering today builds upon this previous safe schools legislation by giving schools authority to remove any student from the classroom if he or she brings a weapon to school or threatens to kill or harm someone with a weapon. 
   Mr. President, a little over a year ago, the Senator from Washington, Senator GORTON, read from an editorial in the Seattle Post Intelligencer that recounted the story of a disabled student who attacked other students with a knife on a school bus. The editorial pointed out the disparities caused by the federal IDEA laws. It said: ``If the school district really is required by law to allow students back into class who carry weapons or otherwise have demonstrated intent to harm others, that law is in error and must be changed.'' 
   I could not agree more with this editorial. It is time to change this erroneous law, which jeopardizes students and teachers by forcing school officials to ignore early warning signs of disaster. Maintaining a safe learning environment requires that local school officials have the authority and flexibility to discipline all students in an equitable and effective manner, especially when it comes to weapons. Let's unshackle our teachers, principals, superintendents, and school boards from a law that prevents them from keeping our children safe and secure. Let's give them the power to stop a tragedy before it happens.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to S.J. Res. 20 to authorize the use of all necessary force in the NATO operation against Yugoslavia. Taking such a step at this time is imprudent, particularly in light of the poor management of the ongoing air campaign against President Milosevic. Nothing in the operation to date indicates we have defined strategic goals in Kosovo or summoned the political will to achieve those goals. Clearly, this is not the time to authorize the Administration to escalate a strategically flawed and poorly managed campaign in the Balkans. 
   A lack of foresight and planning has defined both the air war and the refugee relief effort, allowing Milosevic to seize and keep the initiative. The air war has been waged in a classic Vietnam-style fashion of escalation. Two principle elements of war, surprise and overwhelming force, have been sacrificed to the political whims of our European allies. The first three weeks of bombing in Allied Force were comparable to one day of bombing in the Gulf War. NATO has waited a full month before targeting Yugoslavia's electrical and television networks. In the Gulf War, such assets were destroyed in the first two days of the conflict. 
   Even as the President sends additional planes and personnel to enhance NATO's firepower, a lack of leadership continues to undermine our efforts to punish Milosevic. According to statements by NATO Military Committee Chairman, General Klaus Naumann, Apache helicopters will not be sent into Kosovo, but fire into the province from Albania. NATO Commander General Wesley Clark is requesting additional planes, but NATO is running out of basing areas in the Balkans. A lack of preparatory work to have these facilities ready has delayed 400 planes being deployed to the region. NATO has an oil embargo on Yugoslavia but will not use force to stop shipments into the country. 
   The refugee crisis has been compounded by poor planning for the relief effort. Before the air campaign began on March 24, the Administration had enough food in the region to feed 500,000 people for five months. Almost two-thirds of that amount was stationed in Yugoslavia, however. For relief supplies such as tents and blankets, Belgrade was the only staging area for the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance. 
   Clearly, the Administration's record to date on Kosovo is not a basis upon which to authorize the use of ``all necessary force.'' The Administration misjudged the enemy and started this war with inadequate means. Now that we are engaged, we need to deploy overwhelming air power to accomplish our objectives. I want to see an aggressive air campaign waged before we take the next step of deploying thousands of ground troops to the Balkans. 
   We should be patient and allow an aggressive air campaign to take its toll, but the air war must be combined with better political leadership if our objectives are to be achieved. An inability to explain why the United States is engaged in Kosovo has plagued this operation from the beginning. Until the Administration has demonstrated the political leadership to define and achieve clear objectives in Kosovo, authorizing the use of ground forces is ill-advised.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I rise today in favor of the provision to protect Social Security, to, in effect, put it in a lockbox to make sure it is not dissipated or misallocated or used to cover deficits in other parts of Government. 
   The votes we are about to cast are important votes. They relate to the future of Social Security, the integrity of Social Security, the strength of America and its ability to meet its obligations when individuals call upon Social Security to do what Congress has said Social Security would be able to do. 
   This vote is about making sure the Social Security surpluses are not used to pay for new budget deficit spending in other parts of Government. 
   Congress is committed to stopping the raid on Social Security. This Congress has passed a budget without using Social Security trust funds. This is historic and it is novel. We have not been passing budgets like this. We have not done it before. 
   It is important; we have passed a budget that says we are not going to raid the Social Security trust fund. In contrast, over the next 5 years, President Clinton's budget would have taken $158 billion from the Social Security trust fund to pay for non-Social Security programs. 
   I think Congress is on the right track. Should we have a $158 billion raid or no raid at all? I think Congress has it right: Don't have any raid at all on Social Security. 
   Frankly, this vote should be bipartisan and unanimous. Last month, the Senate voted 99 to nothing in support of legislation to protect Social Security. We are calling on every Senator to vote with us to pass the legislation that implements the unanimous resolution passed by the Senate 99 to nothing earlier this month. 
   The Abraham-Domenici-Ashcroft lockbox will make sure that Social Security funds do not go for anything other than Social Security. 
   The bill will achieve these three important results: 
   No. 1, the President will no longer be able to propose budgets that use Social Security funds to balance the budget. Write into the law the President is not to send us proposals for spending which include a backdoor raid on Social Security. It really establishes a priority. It says Social Security is more important than these other new programs or ideas for spending. 
   No. 2, Congress will no longer routinely pass budgets that use Social Security trust funds to balance the budget. A congressional budget that uses Social Security funds to balance the budget will be subject to what is called a point of order. 
   All of us have been involved at one point or another in meetings where someone tries to bring something up and the chairman simply says with a thump of the gavel, ``That's out of order; we are not going to discuss it.'' That is how it should be when people propose, for example, raiding the Social Security trust fund for other Government programs. 
   Mr. President, you, as the occupant of the Chair, should say, with a thump, ``That is out of order, that is off the table, we do not discuss those things, that is not part of what we do.'' A point of order then simply allows, provides for the Chair to say, ``That's out of order, that's not something we do, and if you want to do that, you have to change the way we do business around here, you have to change the rules or suspend them.'' I think that is a major step forward. 
   As a final tool to make sure Social Security trust funds are not used to finance new deficits, this provision will reduce 
   the amount of debt held by the public by the amount of the Social Security surplus, so that when the Social Security surplus is not spent on programs but is invested to pay down the national debt so that we are stronger when we need to pay for Social Security, this makes sure the money will not go into other programs. This will ensure that any and all Social Security surpluses will be directed toward reducing the debt, which means strengthening the capacity to pay Social Security when the time comes. 
   Americans, including the 1 million Missourians who receive Social Security benefits, want Social Security protected, and they have a right to have it protected. They paid for it, they have earned it, and we should protect the integrity of the fund. 
   This bill does what America wants and what every Senator has previously said they want to do as well in behalf of their constituents. It is time for the Senate to vote now to end the debate on this bill, to pass this bill, to do this month what we said last month we wanted to do when we passed the budget resolution; that is, to protect the Social Security trust fund, to reserve it for the benefit of the recipients of the fund, to strengthen and protect the integrity of the fund. I call upon other Members of the Senate to join in this noble cause to which they have already registered their serious commitment. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to extend appreciation to my spring 1999 class of interns: Lionel Thompson, Ryan Carney, Stephanie Harris, Kelly Owens, Daniel Lawson, Lacey Muhlfeld, Pete Johnson, Brian Kim, and J.Y. Brown. Each of these young people has served the people of Missouri diligently in my office. They have been invaluable members of my Operations Team over the past several months, and their efforts have not gone unnoticed. 
   Since I was elected in 1994, my staff and I have made an oath of service, commitment, and dedication. We dedicate ourselves to quality service. America's future will be determined by the character and productivity of our people. In this respect, we seek to lead by our example. We strive to lead with humility and honesty, and to work with energy and spirit. Our standard of productivity is accuracy, courtesy, efficiency, integrity, validity, and timeliness. 
   My spring interns have not only achieved this standard, but set a new standard on the tasks they were given. They exemplified a competitive level of work while maintaining a cooperative spirit. It is with much appreciation that I recognize Lionel, Ryan, Stephanie, Kelly, Daniel, Lacey, Pete, Brian, and J.Y. for their contribution to me and my staff in our effort to fulfill our office pledge and to serve all people by whose consent we govern.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is with great honor and privilege that I congratulate Dr. Robert T. Fraley, a member of the Monsanto team of scientists, on receiving the National Medal of Technology Award for developing biotechnology that will help meet the global agricultural challenges of the Twenty-First Century. 
   Dr. Robert T. Fraley is the co-President of the Agricultural Sector of Monsanto, and has worked extensively on the integration of Monsanto's chemical, biotech and seed businesses. He earned his Doctorate in microbiology and biochemistry in 1978, from the University of Illinois. Among his accomplishments, Dr. Fraley was a member of the science team that developed the world's first practical system to introduce foreign genes into crop plants.

   Agriculture is the foundation of many countries' economies, and consequently, the majority of the world's population makes its living in agriculture and food-based activities.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, as a parent and former teacher, it is a privilege for me to be able to recognize Missouri home schoolers, who will observe Missouri Home Education Week during May 2-8, 1999. 
   Home schooling has been legal in Missouri since the state's founding in 1821. Since that time, and especially in the last two decades, home schoolers have faced numerous challenges and successes. 
   Fortunately, legislators are increasingly recognizant of the importance of local decision-making and parental involvement in our children's education. Home Education Week reminds us that parents are the first and best educators of their children. Study after study has shown that parental involvement is the most important factor in a child's academic achievement. 
   It is, therefore, appropriate that we celebrate Home Education Week by acknowledging the hard work, dedication, and commitment to academic excellence of the more than 4,300 home school families in my home state. Recently, the Washington Post lauded the academic achievement of these families. The Post article describes a study of home-schooled children, stating that they ``score well above the national median on standardized tests [and] often study above their normal grade level.'' 
   It was an honor for me to proclaim Missouri's first Home Education Week in 1989. Now, in 1999, I look forward to the continued success of Missouri home school families, and to working with them to promote the kind of freedom that encourages parents to take an active role in guiding the course of their children's education.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to the passage of the Ed-Flex Partnership Act, which I believe will liberate schools and teachers from the costly burden of Federal mandates and regulations. It is very important that we free our teachers to teach and that we free the resources of the educational system to meet the needs of students, rather than to satisfy directives of the bureaucracy. 
   I believe this bill will give America's teachers more freedom to teach. It will release them from countless hours spent filling out forms from Washington, DC. The State of Missouri's 525 school districts will have more time to educate their children and a greater ability to decide how best to use the precious resource of taxpayer dollars, and how to use those to devote them to the best interests of students and student achievement, and not for a sort of edification of the bureaucracy in Washington. 
   So I want to thank Senator WYDEN, Senator FRIST, and Senator JEFFORDS: Senator JEFFORDS as chairman of the relevant committee, and Senators FRIST and WYDEN, who are the lead cosponsors of this important legislation. They have done wonderful work here. 
   This is work designed to find its way all the way to the student in the school system. So much of what is done in the name of education never finds its way  to the student. So often it edifies the bureaucracy, or builds it, or strengthens it. So often it applies to some hierarchical part of the State educational system. But Ed-Flex is designed to carry the benefit all the way to the student. There is one thing that we care about more than anything else, and that is the student in the school system. Sometimes we lose sight of that. I commend Senators FRIST, WYDEN, and JEFFORDS for their having kept the student in focus in this particular measure. 
   I am also pleased to support this conference report because it contains an amendment that I proposed, which makes an important change to a discipline provision within the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Now, this provision, which the Senate approved by a vote of 78-21, gives school authorities the opportunity and the right to discipline any student who possesses a weapon on school premises. This provision allows a school to place a student--even a student with a disability--in an interim alternative educational setting if the student carries or possesses a gun on school premises. This action closes a loophole in the IDEA law that only permitted a school to take disciplinary action if the child carried the weapon to school, but not if he or she possessed the weapon at school. 
   My intent in offering this provision over a month ago was to empower schools to maintain a safe and secure learning environment for students, teachers, and for other school personnel. 
   America is saddened today, and we all grieve at yesterday's tragic situation in the Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. That situation underscores the need for us to continue to find ways to help teachers, parents, and school officials maintain safer schools. We need to be creating a learning environment that is free of undue disruption or violence. We should give local school officials the authority to enforce zero tolerance of weapons brought to school. That is a step in which this bill goes when it includes the ability to discipline students who bring guns to school or possess guns at school. 
   I know all of us here offer our condolences, heartfelt sympathies, to all of the families, the loved ones, the teachers, and to the communities that surround or are involved in the tragedy in Colorado. 
   We don't know all the facts of this incident. We don't know the complete background on the students who are allegedly involved in this situation. But this incident should prompt in us a desire to examine our current Federal laws and to make whatever necessary changes there are, if there can be changes made to prevent tragedies like this from occurring. 
   Since I became a Member of the Senate in 1995, I have had concerns about school safety. I have already worked to make improvements in Federal law to create a safer learning environment for students and teachers. My involvement on this issue began with the 1995 killing of the 15-year-old in St. Louis named Christine Smetzer. She was killed in the restroom of a high school in St. Louis County. 
   Now, the male special education student convicted of murdering Christine had a juvenile record and had been caught in women's restrooms at a previous school. However, the teachers and the administrators at McCluer High School where he was transferred say they were not informed of the student's record when he transferred to their school. So here you have a student who should have been identified, could have been identified as a student who had a special potential for the kind of violence and danger that transpired. The student was transferred, but the information that would have alerted school officials to make the school a safer environment, to help that student avoid the commission of the crime, and certainly to prevent the kind of tragic outcome, the killing of another student, our Federal laws were part of the problem that kept that from happening. 
   So in response to that, I secured a provision in the law requiring that student disciplinary records transfer to a new school when the student transfers to a new school. That was just a small step taken in response to that 1995 problem with student discipline requirements that the Federal Government imposes. 
   Now, the discipline provision in the bill that we are discussing here today was something that I, frankly, came to understand as a result of discussing concerns with Missouri schools. A suburban Missouri school district told me it found a disabled student to be in possession of a weapon at school, but the school could not be sure that the student had actually carried the weapon to the school premises. This school told me it needed this loophole closed to ensure that it could act swiftly and with confidence to an obviously dangerous situation. 
   You can imagine the inability to discipline somebody because they said, ``I didn't carry the gun on to the premises, I just got it after I was here,'' or ``I found it in my locker or on the floor,'' or ``You can't prove that I brought it into the school. Therefore, you can't discipline me for having a gun at school.'' 
   What a terrible situation that is. So when I sought to offer this amendment--which was passed overwhelmingly by the Senate and remains in the conference committee report--it was in response to this need to make sure that the Federal Government doesn't have rules that make it impossible for local schools to be able to maintain a secure and safe school environment. 
   Interestingly enough, 2 weeks ago, I was traveling in the State of Missouri, talking with teachers and parents and principals and administrators to get their input about education. Time after time, they talked to me about safety and about discipline. Very often, they even mentioned weapons at school. 
   They mentioned that the Federal law was handcuffing their ability to take appropriate steps to keep their schools safe. 
   In a specific school--I was told by the administrator of that school, this is not a hypothetical, but I choose not to name the school because the school would prefer not to be identified--I was told of a situation in a rural Missouri school where a disabled student had made numerous threats against both students and staff, had threatened on at least seven occasions to kill other students or staff. The school was aware of the threats, but was hindered by the Federal law from taking steps that they thought were most appropriate to deal with the student. 
   Later, this high school student finally shot another student. The shooting happened off school grounds and the school was able to remove the student from the classroom once the shooting had taken place. 
   But I wonder if we might think carefully as to whether or not the Federal requirements which tie the hands of State officials and school officials regarding school discipline, whether those Federal knots, Federal handcuffs--ought to be taken off our school principals, our teachers, our administrators, our school boards so that they have the ability at an early time when there is an early warning to take steps to avoid the tragedy that can otherwise exist. In this situation they weren't able to actually get done what they needed to do until another student had been shot. I don't believe that resulted in a fatality. But the difference between someone wounded and someone killed is frequently not something we can take a great deal of consolation in because that bullet could have been deadly. 
   Another school superintendent reported to me that Federal law required him to return a disabled student to the classroom after the student threatened to shoot school employees. 
   We have seen the tragic gruesome events in States close to Missouri, in schools in Jonesboro, AR, in Paducah, KY, and now in Littleton, CO. I don't want to see this happen in my home State of Missouri. I don't want to see these kinds of things happen anywhere. 
   Again, I emphasize: We do not--I repeat ``do not''--know all of the facts of the Littleton incident. We do not know if they were special education students subject to the Federal IDEA laws or not. But we do know that this situation should prompt us to examine all of our Federal laws involving school safety. 
   We have a massive tragedy waiting to happen if we have Federal rules and regulations which keep our school officials across America from being able to control schools, control students, and discipline students appropriately.  
   We have a massive tragedy waiting to happen if we don't allow teachers and administrators to keep students who have guns from coming onto the campus and being on the campus. 
   The provision that is in this measure, which I have had the privilege of sponsoring, ends one of these laws and helps protect our kids from gun violence in schools. 
   The tragic events at schools across the nation in the last year or so say something very, very troubling about our culture. 
   In Springfield, MO, which is my hometown--I grew up there, went through school grades 1 through 12 in Springfield--just hours after the shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado, the school board voted to approve arming its school district security guards with weapons. I am saddened that the board had to take this action. But it reflects the harsh reality of our culture today. 
   I think all of us wonder why these incidents of violence happen. Children against children--what does it say about our culture? 
   Have we developed a culture of violence which degrades the value of life? 
   We wonder about the movies, movies and video games and music, the so-called gangster rap--I am not even sure how to label it--which 
   talk about this kind of killing and suicide, and the disrespect for fellow students and fellow human beings. 
   I think we need in our society to reexamine what our culture is teaching our children. 
   What are we saying? What are we promoting with the death, with the violence, with the glorification of drugs in so much of the literature, and as a matter of fact, in much of the music? 
   Parents need to be concerned. 
   These aren't all things that government can have much to do about, but I think our parents need to be concerned about the level of exposure that our children have to things which degrade the appreciation for life and desensitize our feelings toward death. 
   The joystick on a video game may punch out an opponent on the screen, and one might be able to kill, kill, kill, kill just by punching the button on the computer. 
   I think we have to be careful that we don't create in ourselves the mentality of disrespect of what ought to be an appreciation for life, and desensitize our feelings. 
   Obviously, Congress can't solve all the problems.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, we can act to ensure that our legislative policies empower parents, teachers, principals and administrators with the ability to ensure that our children have a safe learning environment. I believe that is something we owe America. 
   Current Federal education laws preclude schools from dealing with early warning signs of danger. It is time for us to end that. I am pleased that we have done it to a small degree in the Ed-Flex measure. 
   I am grateful for the sponsors of this measure and for the excellent work they have done for America and education.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am honored to cosponsor the Abraham-Domenici Social Security surplus preservation amendment. This amendment will protect Social Security for millions of Americans who now receive its benefits and who now pay taxes hoping that they someday, too, will receive Social Security. 
   I believe protecting Social Security is the highest priority we could have in the Congress. Protecting Social Security means we must make sure the current surpluses that will be needed to pay benefits later are not used to pay for new budget deficits in the rest of government. That is what this bill does. It is why I am for it, and it is why I urge swift passage of this legislation. 
   The legislation we are debating today logically follows and, in fact implements, previous policy decisions that have been made by this Congress. Let's review a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that the Senate passed by an overwhelming 99-to-0 vote just 2 weeks ago. That resolution made these points: 
   No. 1, Congress and the President should balance the budget excluding surpluses generated by the Social Security trust funds. 
   No. 2, reducing the Federal debt held by the public is a top national priority. 
   No. 3, the surpluses now held in the Social Security trust fund will reduce the debt held by the public by $1.7 trillion. 
   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that President Clinton's budget would spend $158 billion of Social Security surpluses on new spending programs over the next 5 years. That is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It simply says that the President's plan for spending is to use the Social Security surplus to go out and spend $158 billion which would not otherwise be spent over the next 5 years. 
   Social Security surpluses should be used for retirement security, for payment of current benefits, or to reduce the debt, and should not be used for other purposes. 
   These mandates should be implemented in two ways: 
   First, by providing for a Senate supermajority point of order against any bill or resolution that would use Social Security surpluses on anything other than the payment of Social Security benefits. 
   Second, by establishing a supermajority point of order in the Senate against raising the limits established on the level of debt held by the public. This resolution passed the Senate 99 to nothing. It passed unanimously. Not only did it pass unanimously, there was no dissenting debate. 
   The conference report on the budget resolution which we passed last week took the first steps necessary to protect Social Security by balancing the budget without using the Social Security surpluses, and it established for the next 2 years a point of order against budget resolutions that use Social Security surpluses to balance the budget. 
   Mr. President, I believe that is what we need to do. We need to basically say that it is out of order to go back and take Social Security surpluses to cover deficits in other parts of government. 
   The amendment we have before us implements the sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It simply takes what we did 2 weeks ago and makes permanent the Social Security protection measures that were included in the conference report. Specifically, this amendment accomplishes the following: 
   No. 1, this amendment creates a 60-vote point of order against future budget resolutions that use Social Security surpluses to balance the budget. This provision makes the temporary point of order included in the conference report permanent, and it is made a part of the law, not just part of the Senate and House rules on the budget. We simply would be able to say that it is out  of 
   order, it requires a supermajority setting aside or suspending the rules in order to devote the Social Security surplus to covering deficits in other parts of the operations of government. 
   This provision is identical to legislation I introduced earlier this year to protect Social Security. This amendment lowers the amount of debt held by the public by amounts roughly equal to the Social Security surpluses. So as you have a Social Security surplus, instead of spending it on new government, you use it to lower the amount of debt held against this country. 
   The effect of this provision is twofold: It helps ensure that the Social Security trust funds are not used to pay for aggressive spending programs or for tax cuts; and, secondly, it reduces overall Federal debt. By reducing debt, this amendment will strengthen our economy, strengthen Social Security, and our capacity to meet our obligations to it in the future. 
   Reducing the public debt makes it easier for America to meet its Social Security obligations in three ways. I think Speaker HASTERT was most eloquent about this. He said if you ever came into a surplus in your own life--maybe a rich uncle died, left you $50, $60,000--and you either could spend it on a bunch of new spending or pay down the mortgage on your house, which would help you meet the challenges of the future better? It is pretty clear, not going to Las Vegas and taking a lot of vacations but paying down your debt, paying down your mortgage, would be the best thing. 
   Over the long run, paying off the debt will lower interest payments, which are now over $200 billion annually. They equal about 15 percent of our budget now. 
   No. 2, they would ease the burden of the $3.8 trillion national debt, which would free up more resources to help us meet Social Security obligations in the future. Of course, No. 3, a debt-free America will have a stronger, faster-growing economy and will be better equipped to come up with the money to redeem the trust fund's IOUs when needed. 
   We cannot afford not to pay off the Federal debt. Federal debt incurs very real costs in the form of interest payments and higher interest rates. Under President Clinton's proposed budget, $158 billion from the fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2004 budget would be diverted from debt reduction and directed towards spending. According to the Senate Budget Committee, that represents 21 percent of the Social Security surplus over that period. In fiscal year 2000 itself, it represents $40 billion, or 30 percent of the surplus. 
   In contrast, our amendment would require us to reserve every penny, all of the Social Security surplus, for debt reduction. Under this plan, publicly held debt, which now stands at 44.3 percent of GDP, would be reduced to 10.3 percent of GDP by the year 2009. That is a 70-percent reduction over just 10 years. 
   Once this amendment is adopted, the President and Congress will no longer raid Social Security surpluses to pay for non-Social Security spending. This amendment would, therefore, protect Social Security at the beginning and at the end of the budget process. At the front end, Congress could no longer pass budgets that use Social Security surpluses. At the back end, the ratcheting down of the debt ceiling would ensure that Social Security surpluses go to debt reduction, thereby helping to keep our financial house in order. A strong financial house for the United States of America is fundamentally the best guarantee we can ever have that Social Security will be a house of integrity itself. 
   One of the most important lessons a parent teaches a child is to be responsible, responsible for his or her conduct and responsible for his or her money. America needs to be responsible with the people's money. The debt reduction proposed by this amendment is among the greatest gifts we can give to our children, and it is a great gift for our seniors. Imagine what our children could do if we were able to provide for them a next generation that is free, free to build their own dreams instead of pay for our past. 
   In addition to protecting our children from debt, this amendment will also protect the Social Security system from irresponsible government spending. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment, and I thank the Chair for this time on the floor. 
   Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, on this April 15, I would like to raise the issue of tax freedom and fairness. The American people are paying over one-fifth of Gross Domestic Product in taxes--the highest share of taxation since World War II and the highest peacetime levels in history. Too much of this burden falls on middle-income earners, who are struggling to juggle the high tax burden with the more important demands of their own families. 
   It is for these hard-working Americans that I am introducing the Taxpayer Freedom and Fairness Act--legislation that is designed to reduce the  tax burdens on lower and middle-income taxpayers. This goal can be accomplished in two ways, through marginal rate reductions for low and middle income earners, or by making the payroll tax deductible for individuals. Those individuals and families on the lower half of our income ladder need and deserve tax relief and I am committed to providing them that relief. 
   Tax relief is necessary because many middle-income earners are paying levels of taxes that severely diminish their ability to care for and support their families. Under current law, single taxpayers will pay 15% on the first $25,750 of taxable income they earn. Combining this with the 15% payroll tax, those earning under $26,000 are paying 30% of taxable income to the federal government. Those earning a taxable income of $26,000 are by no means rich--and should not be taxed as if they were. 
   Given the burden on workers, it is incumbent upon us to provide them with tax relief. The Taxpayer Freedom and Fairness Act provides two ways to deal with these unconscionably high tax levels. The first is to provide these lower and middle income earners with real rate relief. I have proposed reducing the 15% tax rate to 10%. According to Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation, reducing the 15% income tax rate to 10% over five years would provide taxpayers with $980 billion in tax relief over the next decade. That means the average two-income family of four would save $2,200 annually. An individual with a taxable income of $25,000 would save $1,250 annually once the rate reduction was fully in place. 
   This is a tax cut designed primarily to benefit hard-working low- and middle-income Americans. Reducing the rate from 15% to 10% would save the average Missouri households $1,170. This kind of tax relief is especially welcome in Missouri, where, according to the Tax Foundation, the burden of state and local taxes has grown dramatically in recent years. In recent years, the tax burden in Missouri has risen from the low rank of 47th in the nation to the 16th highest. 
   Across the country, nearly two-thirds of the relief would flow to households earning less than $75,000. Less than 4% of the tax relief would flow to households earning more than $200,000. This is real tax relief directed at middle class earners. 
   A second way to accomplish this important goal is through marriage penalty relief. It should be our goal as a society to encourage young couples to get married. Marriage is a sacred institution that promotes family and community stability. More marriage is an unmitigated good for this country. 
   Unfortunately our tax system does not see it as such. The current federal income tax system forces many married couples to pay a ``marriage penalty.'' That is, they are required to pay more federal income tax than they would have paid had they been single and filed their taxes separately. 
   This is fundamentally unfair. The tax code should not punish marriage, our society's most basic and essential institution. 
   Under current law, two single taxpayers, each earning $35,000 and claiming standard deductions, will each pay $4,558.50 in federal income tax. 
   If those taxpayers marry each other, the tax code would boost their combined tax bill by $1,478 to $10,595. This almost $1,500 penalty is a serious disincentive to middle-income couples looking to get married. This disincentive represents an unacceptable attack on the institution of marriage. This issue resonates particularly strongly in Missouri. 1,052,518 out of 2,416,434 Missouri tax filers file joint returns. 
   The marriage penalty has been part of the tax code since 1969. Since then, the burden of the penalty has grown enormously. In fact, the Joint Economic Committee estimates married couples now pay $29 billion in taxes every year that they otherwise would not have paid had they been single. It is time to abolish the marriage penalty and create a new day of freedom for American families to keep more of the money they work so hard to earn. 
   I have long advocated elimination of the marriage penalty. In addition to the Taxpayer Freedom and Fairness Act, I am also a co-sponsor of Senator HUTCHISON's bill to eliminate the marriage penalty. I also included the elimination of the marriage penalty as a provision in my Fair Flat tax proposal. Eliminating the marriage penalty should be one of the Senate's top tax priority for 1999. 
   It is time to provide real tax relief to those who need it most. The middle class should no longer have to pay 43% of incomes to the federal government. Married couples should no longer pay a penalty just for being married. The best ways to solve these problems are to reduce marginal tax rates and to eliminate this penalty on married couples. I urge my colleagues to vote for the Taxpayer Freedom and Fairness bill, and bring freedom and fairness to taxpayers this April 15th.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, on this April 15, Tax Day 1999, I rise in support of one aspect of our deservedly maligned tax code--the mortgage interest deduction. The mortgage interest deduction provides invaluable assistance to American families seeking the stability and comfort of a home they can call their own. 
   I purchased my first home, a small fieldstone farmhouse in the Ozarks, in the Spring of 1967, just before proposing to my wife, Janet. Like most families, paying for it was the single largest task in our young lives. It was, with the wisdom of 30 plus years, a transformational event. For it represented our first real taste of what James Truslow Adams called the ``American Dream.'' 
   The experience Janet and I had paying for that farm is not uncommon. In fact, the largest debt most families take on in their lifetimes is a home. Two-thirds of Americans own a home, as do approximately 80 percent of Americans over the age of 50 (unfortunately, Janet and I now fall into both categories). This represents real progress. In 1940, fully 56 percent of Americans were renters. Clearly, America has come a long way. 
   People buy homes for different reasons. For us, our Ozark farmhouse offered many things: a place of safety to raise a family, the potential of financial security, a sense of community. As I travel across this great country, couples of all ages suggest that they are looking for the same things Janet and I sought over a quarter century ago. They seem to know, as we did, that buying a home is among the essential steps a family takes to ensure stability and prosperity in their lives. 
   Unfortunately, while homes are a worthwhile investment, they also are expensive. Real estate experts recommend that families buy homes valued at over three times their annual income--a sum far greater than what families could pay back in a year, or two, or even five. So, most Americans take out a mortgage. It is, frequently, a commitment to repay the loan (with interest) over a 30-year period. 
   Historically, the Federal Government has encouraged such behavior. It has done so to promote stable families in stable homes. Through the home mortgage tax deduction, one of the best and most praise-worthy parts of our highly-flawed tax code, the government allows taxpayers to deduct the cost of interest on their mortgages from their income taxes. In the early years of a mortgage, nearly 90 percent of payments go to interest charges and are therefore tax deductible. 
   The home mortgage deduction not only encourages home buying, it also helps to promote community and family. In my home state of Missouri, 526,744 tax filers claim the interest deduction out of 2,416,434 returns. These are families trying to build their homes, getting what advantages they can out of the overly-burdensome tax code. 
   Across the rest of the country, homeownership is an important factor in promoting economic security and stability for American families. In fact, homeownership is one of the most valuable sources of saving for American families and, unlike other forms of saving, it is encouraged and facilitated by our tax code. 
   The home mortgage deduction is also of great assistance to many of our citizens who are trying hardest to establish the stability and security of homeownership. The greatest growth sectors in homeownership today are among minorities and first-time homebuyers, who are frequently just on the cusp of attaining the American dream. 
   Similarly, immigrants, who come to this country seeking a new way of life, are beneficiaries of the mortgage deduction. In fact, the level of homeownership among foreign-born naturalized citizens who have been in the United States for at least six years is the same as the level of homeownership of the Nation as a whole. When families such as these, who are new to our shores, prosper, we as a nation prosper. 
   In short, the home mortgage deduction is an important benefit to citizens across this great land. It is in our national interest to maintain this portion of the tax code so that new generations can also experience the safety and security of homeownership. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from the State of Missouri. I rise to commend, thank, and praise Senator DOMENICI for crafting a budget resolution that we can stand up for and speak about and be grateful for. I appreciate it. 
   The conference report balances need for responsibility, the need for setting priorities. When families gather around the kitchen table to make budgets, they set priorities. They say: If we are going to get the new car, we don't take the same vacation; we can't spend the same money twice. 
   For too long, I think the U.S. Government, thinking that it could always just go further and further into debt or raid the Social Security trust fund, didn't have to set priorities. This is a budget that sets priorities. It sets priorities that are important. 
   The conference report reduces the debt of this country. It will increase funding for education, it will reduce taxes, it will increase funding for national defense, and it will maintain the spending caps that are so very necessary if we are going to have the kind of discipline that keeps us from further invading the province of the next generation and their desire to be able to build their own future, instead of paying for our past. That is the real question when we decide whether we are going to have discipline in spending. It is a question of whether we will let the next generation build its dream or pay for our past. 
   This in great measure is due to Senator DOMENICI's great efforts. I especially appreciate his willingness to work with his colleagues. At the start of this process, several other Senators and I sent Senator DOMENICI a letter asking for a budget that saved Social Security surpluses, that reduced the $3.8 trillion public debt, that pursued at least $600 billion in tax relief over the next 10 years, that maintained the statutory spending caps, and included increases in funding for both education and national defense. These were specific items that we requested in a letter addressed to the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI. I know the occupant of the Chair understands what was included in that letter and endorses that as well. 
   What is gratifying about what the chairman of the Budget Committee did is that the budget that has been prepared both meets and exceeds these goals. It calls for the following: A substantial Federal tax relief package, $142 billion over the next 5 years, $778 billion over the next 10 years. The resolution requires the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee to report out their tax cut plans by mid-July, a major step forward for the American people, to say to them, ``You earned it, we returned it''--instead of, ``You sent it, we spent it.'' For so long the Congress has said, ``You send it, we will spend it.'' No matter how much they sent, we spent. We viewed the American people as somehow our ``sugar daddy'' for more and more programs and greater and greater spending. 
   I think it is high time we said to the American people: We believe in you for the future of this country, we believe in families more than we believe in bureaucracy, we believe in the private sector. You have earned so much, you have worked so hard, that we have an operating surplus down the road and we will share it with you by way of tax relief. 
   Second, it stays within the spending caps. The spending caps have enabled us to bring the budget into balance. I am happy that this budget maintains those caps. 
   It increases spending for education and defense. This is most important. We understand the ability to defend the country from foreign aggression and the ability for the country to have the kind of intense vigor and vitality that comes from 
   well-trained, bright citizens. These are the two cornerposts of our existence. Education spending goes up 40 percent. The budget fully funds the $17.5 billion in defense spending requested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff over the next 5 years. We accommodated both of those by setting priorities. Senator DOMENICI and the Budget Committee, including the senior Senator from the State of Missouri, have done a good job. 
   The conference report contains an amendment which I introduced directing that this new education resource be directed to the States and local education districts and not new Federal bureaucracy. We do need to increase the bureaucracy. We need to elevate the students' performance levels; their achievement levels need to soar. We don't do that by building bureaucracy in Washington. We need to get that resource directly to the classroom. I am pleased that the conference report will contain this amendment which I proposed, saying that the increase will go to school districts in schools where parents and teachers, principals, and school administrators will make decisions--instead of bureaucracy directing it from Washington. 
   The conference report also reduces the debt by $450 billion, $450 billion more than the President's proposal would have reduced the debt. It is time for us to reduce the publicly held debt of this country. 
   Perhaps most importantly, this budget saves $1.8 trillion over the next 10 years for our Nation's elderly. This money is vital to shoring up the Social Security system. This stands in stark contrast to the President's plan, which spends $158 billion over 5 years of Social Security surpluses for non-Social Security purposes. On the one hand, we save $1.8 trillion over the next 10 years for our Nation's elderly; the President's program over the next 5 years alone would have spent $158 billion of Social Security surpluses for non-Social Security spending. 
   In addition to the money that this budget saves for Social Security, the budget also takes procedural steps to build in onbudget surpluses from the year 2001 and beyond. In other words, there are Social Security surpluses saved, then there will be other surpluses that relate to the rest of the budget--and the budget is careful to make sure that those surpluses will materialize beginning in the year 2001. 
   This is setting priorities. This is kitchen table economics. This is understanding that in order to make some things work, you have to adjust other things and you have to work them together. It is not just a wish list, this is a real spending plan. It is a spending plan that honors the next generation and the future of this great country. 
   Under these new important procedures, Congress could no longer spend billions of dollars on so-called ``emergencies'' that were not really emergencies. These new procedures stop the mislabeling of ordinary expenses in the category of ``emergencies'' so that you could invade funds or take Social Security surplus and spend, which happened last year. There will be a point of order in this budget that says you cannot do that, you cannot mislabel, you cannot automatically categorize things as emergencies. 
   Last year, the President and the Congress together spent $21 billion from the Social Security trust fund on these so-called emergencies. We need to stop that. We must stop that. This budget will stop that kind of practice. 
   The conference report contains a 60-vote point of order ensuring that emergency spending will be limited to actual emergencies. In addition, surpluses that are accumulating in the Social Security trust fund will no longer be used to finance onbudget deficits in governmental operations. It is a fundamental first step of Social Security reform that the Social Security surpluses should not be used to funding deficits in the rest of government. This budget stops that. 
   In order to establish this first step, Senator DOMENICI and I introduced legislation that would establish a 60-vote  point of order against any budget when the Social Security surpluses are used to finance onbudget governmental deficits. 
   I rise to say how much I appreciate the work of the chairman of the Budget Committee, the members of the Budget Committee, and their cooperation with the Members of the House to work together to bring a budget that really does what family budgets do--sets priorities, looks to the future, understands we cannot have everything all the time, but protects Social Security and its surplus, protects our budget generally from mislabeling that gets us into emergency spending which puts us into debt or raids the Social Security surplus, keeps the caps in place, elevates the capacity for spending for education, and strengthens the military. These are the fundamentals that are important to America's strength in the next century. This budget does that. 
   There have been a number of years in which I have not voted for the budget. I haven't been able to in good conscience. I voted against last year's budget with the $21 billion raid on the Social Security trust fund. However, I will be able to vote for this budget. This is a budget for which we ought to be grateful. This is the kind of budget that we are grateful to have the opportunity to vote in favor of. I commend Senator DOMENICI and the other members of the Budget Committee and the House for its cooperation in getting us to a place where we can present this kind of spending plan to the people of the United States of America, for it is their money that we spend. This is a budget that they would be proud to develop, were they to sit around the table and make those kinds of hard-nosed judgments about the Nation that they make regularly about their families. 
   I thank the Chair and I yield the floor. 
   Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I commend the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee for the decisions made in this conference report that will protect the Social Security trust funds. First, it will be an honor for me to vote for this budget resolution which, for the first time in 30 years, balances the Federal budget and does so without using the Social Security surplus. Second, this budget further protects Social Security by creating a point of order against future congressional budgets which use Social Security surpluses to pay for budget deficits of the federal government. 
   These are great first steps to take to protect Social Security. Americans who have devoted a lifetime of working and paying their Social Security taxes deserve to have their Social Security reserved for nothing but their Social Security. That has not happened in recent years. Without reform, this practice of raiding Social Security would continue. In fact, President Clinton's budget for next year proposed using $158 billion of the Social Security Trust Fund to finance new government spending. We must stop these raids on Social Security. 
   The point of order included in this conference report is similar to legislation I have introduced with the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. The Ashcroft-Domenici bill writes into law the Social Security protection point of order. This conference report puts the point of order in the House and Senate rules for this year and next, the maximum amount of time allowed under House rules. This is a wise decision, and the right step to take now. Because a budget resolution does not become law, the only option available to the budget conferees to protect Social Security was to amend House and Senate rules. I support this action. 
   Later this year I will seek Senate passage of my bill to put this point of order into law, to make it permanent and to strengthen it by requiring that it can only be waived in the Senate with 60 votes, a super majority. I will also support the efforts by Senators DOMENICI and ABRAHAM to win passage of their Social Security lockbox bill which uses the debt limit as an enforcement mechanism to make sure neither the President nor Congress can use Social Security to finance new deficits. 
   I am also pleased that the conferees included in the final bill a resolution I offered and the Senate passed expressing the Sense of the Senate that the government should not invest the Social Security Trust Funds in the stock market. The President has proposed investing as much as $700 billion of the surplus in the stock market. This is an unwise gamble to take in my view, in the view of the Senate and, in light of its inclusion in this conference report, the Congress of the United States.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, for decades Americans have watched with awe and amazement at the invigorating achievements of the world's Olympic athletes. When Gail Devers and Wendy Williams won Olympic medals, they inspired their hometown of Bridgeton, Missouri. When Nikki Ziegelmeyer won a speed skating Olympic medal, her hometown of Imperial Missouri cheered. And when Ray Armstead helped win the 4 by 400 meter relay, St. Louis was proud of its native son. 
   Gail, Wendy, Nikki and Ray won through sheer talent, toil and sweat. They pursued Olympic fame with honor and integrity, competed fairly, and won with dignity. Their athletic grace on the world stage helped spark dreams of future Olympic glory in young people today. 
   But now the Olympic torch has been dimmed, and the five Olympic rings have been tarnished by bribes and graft given to secure victory at any price. The victory pursued with moneyed vengeance was not in athletic competition. In this scandal, the Olympic athletes are the innocents, yet the scandal tarnishes their achievement. The villains at ground zero are those who decided where the games were to be played and those who hosted or will host the games. Such irony: Scandal torches the competition to host the world's most competitive and honorable games. 
   The facts are bleak--in their attempts to land the 2002 Olympics, leaders of the Salt Lake City Olympic Committee spent $4 million on gifts, scholarships, cash payments and other inducements for International Olympic Committee members; allegations by senior Olympic officials have raised questions about payments that may have been made to influence the selection of other Olympic cities; the Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into payments by Salt Lake City Olympic Officials; an independent investigation conducted by former Senator George Mitchell and former White House Chief of Staff Ken Duberstein concluded that receipt of ``valuables'' by International Olympic Committee members has become ``widespread, notorious, continuous, unchecked and ingrained in the way Olympic business is done.''; and the International Olympic Committee has expelled six of its members for corruption. 
   Now that these problems have been exposed to the world, the question is what should be done to stop this bribery from destroying the Olympic movement. 
   Today, Senator MCCAIN took a step in the right direction by convening a hearing in the Senate Commerce Committee. I regret the decision by the President of the International Olympic Committee, Juan Antonio Samaranch, to not attend that hearing. And I take exception with the comments of one of the IOC witnesses who told the Associated Press, and I quote, ``What I'm afraid is that they're doing it for political advantage and not for the benefit of anybody except for themselves. They just get on a soap box and preach their righteousness.'' 
   Well, it is crystal clear to me that Congress should, for our Olympic athletes and the hometowns they represent, use soap and scrubbing and scrutiny to clean up this mess. 
   Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that is a vital step in restoring integrity to the IOC host city bidding process. The International Olympic Committee Integrity Act will expand the coverage of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to include the IOC. The FCPA prohibits U.S. businesses from offering bribes or kickbacks to foreign officials. The U.S. Olympic Committee has asked President Clinton to issue an executive order to cover the IOC under the FCPA. To date, the President has not done so. My bill accomplishes what the U.S. Olympic Committee has requested and that is to outlaw the gifts and payments such as those that have been made in the past to International Olympic Committee officials. 
   In addition, I am keeping open the option of removing the federal tax deduction that federal tax law provides for contributions made to the International Olympic Committee. I will review the testimony of IOC witnesses from today's Commerce Committee hearing before making a final decision. 
   In closing, Mr. President, we should give credit where it is due. When faced with a serious mistake that has been made, a test of character is whether you do the next right thing. Once the Salt Lake City problem was discovered, officials at the U.S. Olympic Committee responded quickly. The USOC asked for the Mitchell-Duberstein investigation I mentioned earlier. The USOC has implemented a series of internal and external reforms of procedures used to apply for hosting the Olympic Games. The USOC has strengthened ethics rules, and created a compliance officer to monitor U.S. bid cities. And, in the future, all honoraria received by committee members must be forfeited to the group's chief financial officer. 
   We have much more to do in order to restore confidence and dignity to the Olympics. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the International Olympic Committee Integrity Act. We owe it to Gail Devers, Wendy Williams, Nikki Ziegelmeyer, Ray Armstead and all future Olympic athletes.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, this amendment relates to the education funding included in this budget proposal. I have joined with other Republican Senators in calling for an increase in Federal spending for education and urging that those additional dollars go directly to the classroom. This is a proposed sense-of-the-Senate amendment, and I am offering this measure with Senator GORTON. It is a measure which already is at the desk. 
   Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, this budget is very generous in terms of education, providing additional resources for the purpose of enhancing the capacity of our students to perform. 
   This budget provides, for instance, for my own State--I think if the money were to be divided equally between the States, Missouri would get $56 million next year, more than it gets now. Over the next 5 years, it would get about $660 million more. So that is a substantial increase in the resource. 
   I have joined with Senator GORTON of Washington to say that when we have that kind of resource flowing to the States, it is important for us that this increased resource in Federal education dollars be directed to the States and local schools out of the Federal budget and not to the Federal bureaucracy. 
   You see, our intention with this resource is to elevate the capacity of students to perform, not to elevate the capacity or the propensity of the bureaucracy to intermeddle in directing, and sometimes misdirecting, the resources that would otherwise be best directed at the local level. 
   Our hope is that this additional resource will give States and local communities, will give teachers and principals, and will give people at the classroom level--places where decisions can be made effectively about allocation of the resources--the maximum flexibility to design and run education programs that will literally elevate performance of our students. 
   One of our Nation's highest priorities is that every child would have the opportunity to receive the kind of challenging, rigorous education that would prepare them for not only success personally, but would also prepare them as team members of Team U.S.A. to keep America where it ought to be--leading the world. 
   Congress should develop and support Federal policy that will best promote education practices that succeed in our States and schools. Sometimes those practices are different in one State than they would be in other States. So we really want to invite the States, the school boards, the parents, and the teachers, those whose children are in the schools, to participate in developing the right deployment of these resources--spending the money wisely in ways that will help the students. 
   Successful school systems are characterized by parental involvement, where parents really care, where parents get involved with the school system, where they energize their children, where they assign a high value to achievement in education. That is where our children soar. We should have Federal policy that gives the parents, the schools, the school boards, the school districts, the local governments, and the States the right to tailor the expenditure of resources so as to meet the needs of our children. 
   Successful schools are also characterized by fundamental skills, excellent teachers, dollars spent in the classroom, and not dollars wasted in the bureaucracy. So many of our current Federal educational resources are misspent. They drive a demand for paperwork. They don't drive a demand for performance. They don't contain elements that further our goal of giving our children a world-class education. A number of our Federal education programs contain these mountainous paperwork burdens--regulations and restrictions that hinder States' and local schools' ability to design programs. 
   Here are a couple of examples about the bureaucracy. Listen to these numbers. They are almost mind staggering. 
   In Florida, 374 employees administer $8 billion in State funds. So it takes 374 to administer the $8 billion in State funds. However, there are 297 State employees needed to oversee only $1 billion in Federal funds, six times as many employees, six times as much bureaucracy, six times as much administration per dollar of funds spent in Federal dollars as there are for State dollars. 
   I think if we want to avoid that kind of overlay of inefficiency, if we want to avoid the weight of paper that is weighing down the educational system that keeps teachers writing reports to bureaucrats instead of teaching our students, we ought to be working for this amendment which says that resources should go to State and local efforts; they should be tailored to meet the needs of the schools and to elevate student performance. The enhanced resources in this bill should not be devoted to the Federal bureaucracy where we have that 6-to-1 ratio demonstrated in the Florida experience where there are six times as many administrators for federal dollars as there are for State dollars. 
   The Federal Department of Education requires over 48.6 million hours of paperwork each year just to receive the Federal dollars. That translates into the equivalent of 25,000 full-time employees every year just doing the paperwork. This bureaucratic maze for Federal education bureaucracy takes up to 35 percent of Federal education dollars. 
   If I were to hand my son $1 and before it got from my hand to his it changed from $1 to 65 cents, I would hear about it. I would hear about it with justification--``You say you are giving me a dollar. You are only giving me 65 cents.'' That is what has been happening with Federal education dollars. 
   The Governors of the country know about it. That is why they were so adamant in unanimously supporting the Ed-Flex bill which we passed in the Senate. Flexibility is important. That is what we would be providing to support student achievement if we are able to support this amendment. 
   A recent example of inflexible Federal funding is the $1.2 billion earmarked exclusively for classroom size reduction for early elementary grades. It may have been a noble aspiration, but it may not be what some schools need. 
   Listen to what Gov. Gray Davis, a Democratic Governor of California, recently said. He said it this way. His State had already achieved smaller classroom sizes in the early grades and needed to use the new Federal funds for reducing class size in 10th grade math and English classes. But no. The Federal bureaucrats and we, in conjunction with them, said no; this is only to be used in another specific arena. 
   Let's give the flexibility to a school district, to the Governors, to teachers, to principals, to people at the local level. Let's give them the flexibility to meet student needs instead of to satisfy the bureaucratic demand. Why should we handcuff States and local schools from using money in the way they best see fit? 
   According to the 1998 National Assessment of Educational Progress Reading Report Card, nearly 40 percent of our fourth grade students cannot even read at a basic level. United States 12th graders outperformed only 2 out of 21 nations in mathematics on a recent Third International Math and Science Study Test. 
   The Brookings Institution has reported that public institutions of higher education have to spend $1 billion each year on remedial education for students who want to go to college. They have to have remedial work because it didn't happen at the elementary and secondary level. 
   Let's not continue to spend money, Federal funds, in the old way of running it through the bureaucracy, first shrinking it and then allowing it to go from the bureaucracy forward in ways that aren't serving students. We should direct any new and existing Federal education resources to States and local schools to design and implement education programs that work, and that they know can work, because they are working with the program. And they also know what programs they need for their students. 
   When Governor Gray Davis said he didn't need the money for smaller class sizes in early grades, he wasn't saying the program wouldn't work. He is just saying we already did that; we need to use the resource for something else. 
   We cannot afford to keep spending our dollars in the same way that we have been doing for years. A profound friend of mine said, ``Your system is perfectly designed to give you what you are getting. If you do not like what you are getting, you had better change your system.'' 
   We can't do it the same way. It has been giving us the wrong results. Let's let States and local communities decide how to spend dollars to improve performance--not give us the same result but give us an elevated outcome. 
   I think we should give States and local schools the kind of flexibility they need to spend Federal dollars on programs that are needed at the local level rather than programs that are mandated from the bureaucracy. I think we need programs that boost student achievement, and that somehow foster academic excellence, giving local individuals the right to deploy the resources to do that. 
   Under this approach, schools will be able to deploy resources to hire new teachers and to raise teachers' salaries. They could buy textbooks, or new computers, enhance the library, or even build--do all kinds of things, whatever they believe is most important in order to achieve that fundamental goal that we will all agree we want to pursue: that is, elevated student performance. 
   That is what education is for--not for the bureaucracy in Washington. It is not really even for the bureaucracies at the State level, or the school boards, or even for the teachers. Our education effort is designed to elevate the performance and capacity to build the future of the United States by enhancing the future of individual students. 
   In conclusion, parents, teachers, school boards, and administrators are in the best position to say what is needed. You wouldn't think of going to a doctor who is 1,000 miles away who is prescribing only one thing for all the people in the country regardless of their symptoms. We would say that is the most foolish thing of all. Yet we go to the bureaucracy in Washington, have them prescribe what we are going to do with our educational resources, no matter what the situation is in the State, or the school, or the local school area, or in the classroom. We need the capacity to say, here is what is wrong. Let's make the diagnosis at the local level, and then let's get at the problem at the local level. 
   We can provide those resources. The resources in this budget should be devoted to that. Senator GORTON of Washington has been a champion of this idea. Several years ago, really in a breakthrough in the Senate, we voted for this concept, and it was on his motion that we did so. I am pleased to join with him in this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. 
   I ask unanimous consent to add Senator SESSIONS as a cosponsor of this amendment. There may be others as well.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Senator DOMENICI, first let me reiterate my admiration for the remarkable budget you have produced. You have produced a budget that, in the first decade of the new millennium, balances the entire federal budget, protects Social Security, increases funding for education by 40%, seeks to protect the Social Security surplus from paying for other government operations, reduces federal debt, provides funds requested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to strengthen our national defense, and provides an $800 billion tax cut. This is a strong budget that I will support. 
   As you know, I intended to offer an amendment that would eliminate a $2.9 billion deficit currently projected for FY 2000. It appears likely, however, that when the final budget resolution is written and we have the latest budget and economic forecasts, that this deficit will be eliminated and, in fact, the budget will be in surplus. As I understand, the budget resolution, as reported by the committee, provides that any FY 2000 surplus should be devoted to tax cuts.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to pose a question to my colleague, Mr. BAUCUS. I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. BAUCUS for working with me on our amendment concerning Korea's compliance with their trade agreements. For our beef and pork producers, this couldn't come at more pressing time. Particularly since the South Korean Government reportedly has been subsidizing its pork exports to Japan and these subsidies are hindering U.S. pork producers from capturing their full potential in the Japanese market. 
   However, I would like to take a moment to pose a question to Mr. BAUCUS in order to clarify paragraph (4). My question is what kind of report do we intend to request? And how shall we define what ``resources'' shall be reported upon?

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act of 1999. I want to thank all of the Senators who have cosponsored this bill. This bill is a bipartisan effort and the diverse group of Senators who support the bill reflects a serious effort to solve a serious problem, not an effort to gain partisan advantage. I particularly want to thank Senator DODD for his assistance on this bill and Senator HATCH for his leadership in introducing similar legislation in the last Congress. 
   I am introducing this bill and I support this bill for a simple reason--it makes sense. The problems caused by the manufacture and use of asbestos are well-documented. Although some companies initially denied responsibility and resisted suits to recover for asbestos-related injuries in court, the injuries associated with asbestos and the liability of manufacturers for those injuries are now well-established. 
   The courts--both state and federal--have done an admirable job of establishing the facts and legal rules concerning asbestos. That is a job the courts do well. However, now that the basic facts and liability rules have been established, the courts are being asked simply to process claims. That is not a job the courts do particularly well. The rules governing court actions give parties rights to dispute facts that have been conclusively established in other proceedings. All the while the meter is running for the lawyers on both sides. Dollars that could go to compensate deserving victims, instead go to lawyers and court costs. 
   In the asbestos context, these problems are exacerbated by the finite resources available to compensate victims. What is more, the legal rules concerning both punitive damages and what constitutes a sufficient injury to bring suit make for jury awards that do not correspond to the seriousness of the injury. Someone filing suit because of a preliminary manifestation of a minor injury, such as pleural thickening, that may never lead to more severe symptoms may receive more compensation than another person with more serious asbestos-related injuries. None of this is to suggest that it is somehow wrong for plaintiffs with a minor injury to file suit. To the contrary, some state rules concerning when injury occurs obligate plaintiffs to file suits or risk having their suit dismissed as time-barred. What is more, in light of the finite number of remaining solvent asbestos defendants, potential plaintiffs have every incentive to file suit as soon as legally permissible. 
   The Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act of 1999 attempts to address these problems by establishing an administrative claims systems that aims to compensate victims of asbestos rationally and efficiently. The Act accomplishes this goal by classifying claimants according to the severity of their injuries, ensuring that those with more serious injuries receive greater awards, securing a compensation fund so that victims whose conditions are not yet manifest can recover in the future, and eliminating the statute of limitations and injury rules that force plaintiffs into court prematurely. Although I wish I could claim some pride of authorship in these mechanisms, these basic features were all part of a proposed global asbestos settlement agreement worked out by representatives of both plaintiffs and defendants. 
   The Supreme Court rejected the proposed global asbestos settlement in Amchem Products versus Windsor. The District Court had certified a settlement class under Rule 23 that included extensive medical and compensation criteria that both plaintiffs and defendants had accepted. The Supreme Court ruled that this type of global, nationwide settlement of tort claims brought under fifty different state laws could not be sustained under Rule 23. The Court recognized that such a global settlement would conserve judicial resources and likely would promote the public interest. Nonetheless, the Court concluded that Rule 23 was too thin a reed to support this massive settlement, and that if the parties desired a nationwide settlement they needed to direct their attention to the Congress, rather than the Courts. 
   I believe the Supreme Court was right on both counts--the proposed settlement criteria were in the public interest, but the proposed class simply could not be sustained under Rule 23. The Rules Enabling Act and the inherent limits on the power of federal courts preclude an interpretation of Rule 23 that would result in a federal court overriding or homogenizing varying state laws. However, as the Supreme Court pointed out, Congress has the power to do directly what the courts lack the power to do through a strained interpretation of Rule 23. 
   This bill takes up the challenge of the Supreme Court and addresses the tragic problem of asbestos. The bill incorporates the medical and compensation 
   criteria agreed to by the parties in the Amchem settlement and employs them as the basis for a legislative settlement. In the simplest terms, the legislation proposes an administrative claims process to compensate individuals injured by asbestos as a substitute for the tort system (although individuals retain an ability to opt-in to the tort system after using the administrative claims system to narrow the issues in dispute). The net effect of this legislation should be to funnel a greater percentage of the pool of limited resources to injured plaintiffs, rather than to lawyers for plaintiffs and defendants.  
   I want to be clear, however, that I am not here to suggest that this is a perfect bill. This bill represents a complex solution to a complex problem. A number of groups will be affected by this legislation, and it may be necessary to make changes to ensure that no one is unfairly disadvantaged by this legislation. But that said, I am confident that we can make the needed changes. We have a bipartisan group of Senators who have agreed to cosponsor this legislation, and the bill represents a sufficient improvement in efficiency over the existing litigation quagmire that there should be ample room to work out any differences. 
   Finally, let me also note that this bill also plays a minor but important role in preserving a proper balance in the separation of powers. I have been a strong and consistent critic of judicial activism. Judges who make legal rules out of whole cloth in the absence of constitutional or statutory text damage the standing of the judiciary and our constitutional structure. On the other hand, when judges issue opinions in which they recognize that a particular outcome might well be in the public interest, but nonetheless is not supported by the existing law, they reinforce the proper, limited role of the judiciary. Too often, federal judges are tempted to reach the result they favor as a policy matter without regard to the law. When judges succumb to that temptation, they are justly criticized. But when they resist that temptation, their self-restraint should be recognized and applauded. The Court in Amchem rightly recognized a problem that the judiciary acting alone could not solve. By offering a legislative solution to that problem the bill provides the proper incentives for courts to be restrained and reinforces the proper roles of Congress and the Judiciary. 
   In short, this bill provides a proper legislative solution to the asbestos litigation problem. It ensures that, in an area in which extensive litigation has already established facts and assigned responsibility, scarce dollars compensate victims, not lawyers. I want to thank my co-sponsors for their work on the bill. I look forward to working with them to ensure final passage of this legislation. The courts have completed their proper role in ascertaining facts and liability. It is time for Congress to step in to provide a better mechanism to direct scarce resources to deserving victims.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Minnesota. 
   I rise in support of the resolution offered by Senator ABRAHAM that has been called the Abraham-Domenici-Ashcroft Social Security amendment. That protects our strong support for saving Social Security. 
   It expresses our strong support for protecting Social Security. I am grateful for the opportunity to cosponsor this amendment, which will put the Senate on record in favor of protecting the Social Security surplus and not invading it for spending for other Governmental programs. 
   The Senator from Minnesota is absolutely correct. The President's budget over the next 5 years would spend $158 billion of the Social Security surplus--not the general Governmental surplus but the Social Security surplus. Social Security is a national, cultural and, I might add, legal obligation. Social Security is our most important social program, a contract between the Government and its citizens. Americans, including 1 million Missourians, depend on this commitment. This is more than just a Governmental commitment. We have a responsibility as a culture to care for the recipients of Social Security--the elderly and other individuals in regard to Social Security who are its beneficiaries. Social Security is the only retirement income for most of the seniors in this country. It is our obligation, passed down from generation to generation, to provide retirement security for every American. 
   As individuals, all of us care about Social Security because we know the benefits it pays to our mothers and fathers, relatives and friends. And we think of the Social Security taxes we and our children pay--up to 12.4 percent of our income. We pay these taxes with the understanding that they help our parents and their friends, and we hope that our taxes will somehow, someday make it possible to help pay for our own retirements. 
   In my case, thinking of Social Security brings to mind friends and constituents such as Lenus Hill of Bolivar, Missouri, who relies on her Social Security to meet living expenses. Billy Yarberry lives on a farm near Springfield and depends on Social Security. And there is Reverend Walter Keisker of Cape Girardeau, who will be 100 years old next July and lives on Social Security. The faces of these friends make Social Security have a special, personal meaning to me. 
   Whenever I meet with folks in Missouri, I am asked, ``Senator, you won't let them use my Social Security taxes to pay for the United Nations, will you?'' Or, ``Why can't I get my full benefits if I work after 65?'' Or, ``You know I need my Social Security, don't you?'' 
   And then there are the letters on Social Security I get every day. 
   Ed and Beverly Shelton of Independence, Missouri, write:  
   Aren't the budget surpluses the result of Social Security taxes generating more revenue than is needed to fund current benefits? Therefore, the Social Security surplus is the surplus! ..... Yes, we are senior citizens and receive a very limited amount of Social Security. We are children who survived the  Great Depression and World War II so we know how to stretch a dollar and rationed goods--just [listen to this] wish Congress were as careful with spending our money as we are!  
   These concerns are why I am cosponsoring this amendment, which will express the Senate's view that we must put an end to 
   the practice of using surpluses in the Social Security trust funds to finance deficits in the rest of the Federal budget. 
   This resolution--the Abraham-Domenici-Ashcroft resolution--puts the Senate on record as supporting legislation that would accomplish the following:

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the amendment which I have sent to the desk is a simple one. It is an amendment forbidding the Government to invest Social Security trust funds in the stock market. 
   We have talked a lot about Social Security in relation to the budget and that it is important that we not invade the Social Security trust fund to undertake spending to cover deficits in other areas, and that is really a way to protect the trust fund. This amendment is another way to protect the trust fund and to protect the retirement security of Americans from the risks of the stock market. 
   So this amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the Federal Government should not invest the Social Security trust fund in the stock market. Having the Government invest the trust fund in the stock market is a gamble. It is a gamble Congress should be unwilling to make on behalf of the millions who receive and depend on Social Security to meet their retirement needs. 
   First, let me say that there is no more worthy Government obligation than ensuring that those who paid a lifetime of Social Security taxes will receive their full Social Security benefits. Social Security is our most important social program, and I believe it is a contract, an agreement between the citizens and their Government. Americans, including 1 million Missourians, depend on this commitment. And I am determined to ensure that Social Security meets that commitment. 
   The President has suggested, and for the first time in history, that the Government should invest as much as $700 billion worth of Social Security surpluses in the stock market. In my view, and in the view of many Missourians who depend on Social Security, this would unnecessarily gamble with the Social Security trust funds. 
   For more than 60 years, Social Security law has forbidden the trust funds from being invested in the stock market. The pending amendment will express our support for that law, making explicit what is now implicit, that this kind of governmental meddling into private markets should not be allowed to happen. 
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan says that investing Social Security funds in the market is bad for Social Security and, he says, bad for the economy. Now, when Alan Greenspan talks, virtually everyone listens. And Congress ought to listen. 
   Chairman Greenspan has said this plan ``will create a lower rate of return for Social Security recipients,'' and he ``does not believe that it is politically feasible to insulate such huge funds from a governmental direction.'' 
   I think what he is saying is it is not time to let some bureaucrat play broker-for-a-day with the Social Security trust fund. The last thing we need in America is the Federal Government directing the investment of Social Security trust funds based on some trendy politically driven notion of which industries or which countries or which policies are in political favor at the moment. 
   Of course, Alan Greenspan is not the only Government official entrusted with and ensuring our economic well-being who is gravely concerned or who has expressed grave concerns about this proposal. Arthur Levitt, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the country's top investment official, has said,  
   We have an obligation to think long and hard about the implications of Social Security reform. Investing Social Security in the stock market, by its very nature involves heightened obligations, difficult questions and new challenges.  
   Chairman Levitt is worried about the ``large-scale market effect.'' In other words, what does this proposal do to the market, including whether the Government would ``have an even greater incentive, if not the market itself.'' We know that America has prospered because of free markets, not Government-directed markets. The prospect of the market trying to control market fluctuations is disturbing. 
   In this scenario, the Government could subsidize companies that were losing market value, regulate companies that pursued risky or innovative strategies, and pursue policies based on which companies would benefit. If the Federal Government tried to pick market winners and losers, all of us, companies and citizens alike, Social Security recipients, and those paying the taxes would end up as losers. 
   When officials of the stature of Chairman Greenspan and Levitt, officials who are responsible for the health  of the Nation's economy and of the stock market, warn us when they speak, we ought to tread very carefully. 
   In addition to the concerns of the experts, I am listening to the concerns of individual Missourians. I recently received a letter from Todd Lawrence of Greenwood, MO, who wrote,  
   It has been suggested that the government would invest in the stock market with my Social Security money. No offense, but there is not much that the government touches that works well. Why would making my investment decisions for me be any different. Looking at it from a business perspective, would the owner of a corporation feel comfortable if the government were the primary shareholder?  
   Todd Lawrence understands what President Clinton apparently does not. No corporation would want the Government as a shareholder, and no investor would want the Government handling their investment. 
   Even if the Government were able to invest without adding new levels of inefficiency to the process, the Government putting Social Security taxes in the stock market adds an unacceptable level of risk to retirement. This risk is a gamble I am unwilling to make for the one million Missourians who are the recipients of Social Security. This amendment puts Congress on record that Government will not gamble Social Security in the stock market. 
   While I understand the impulse to attempt to harness the great potential of the stock market, significant Government involvement in the stock market could tend toward economic nationalization, excess Government involvement in private financial markets, and short-term, politically motivated investment decisions that could diminish Social Security's potential rate of return. 
   It is hard to overestimate how dangerous this scheme really is. Imagine, if you will, what would happen if the Government had $2.7 trillion in the market on Black Monday, October 19, 
   1987, when the stock market lost 22 percent of its value. The trust fund's owners, America's current and future retirees, would have lost a collective total of $633 billion that day alone. Imagine seniors who depend on Social Security watching television, watching the news of the stock market collapse, wondering, even fearing, their Social Security would be in danger. 
   While individuals properly manage their financial portfolios to control risk, the Government has no business taking these gambles with the people's money. 
   Even President Clinton has expressed skepticism with this idea. In Albuquerque last year, the President said the following,  
   I think most people just think if there is going to be a risk taken, I'd rather take it than have the government take it for me.  
   He was right then and he is wrong now. While Americans as individuals should invest as much as they can, as much as they can afford in their private equities to plan for their own retirements, the Government should stay out of the stock market. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment. 
   I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, Daniel Webster argued to the Supreme Court in McCulloch v. Maryland that the power to tax involves the power to destroy. Chief Justice Marshall was so taken with Webster's argument that he made it the central premise of his landmark opinion for the Court. Fully cognizant of the potential for abuse inherent in the power to tax, the framers carefully circumscribed this power. The Constitution limits the tax power to the Congress and requires revenue bills to originate in the House of Representatives, the body most responsive to the people. The notion that unelected bureaucrats could levy taxes absent any congressional authority would have been a complete anathema to the framers. It is a long way from ``no taxation without representation'' to taxation without notice, representation or even participation from the Congress. 
   Unfortunately, the National Science Foundation appears to have forgotten that the power to tax belongs to the Congress and to Congress alone. Since 1992, the National Science Foundation has employed a private sector firm to registering second-level domain names, which are the unique identifiers that precede ``.com'' or ``.org.'' In 1995, the National Science Foundation amended its agreement with the firm to allow it to charge a $100 registration fee, and a $50 renewal fee. If those fees had been designed simply to allow the private firm to cover its costs and make a modest profit they would be unproblematic. However, that is not what happened here. The National Science Foundation, without any congressional authority, required the private firm to set aside 30 percent of the total fees collected and turn them over to the National Science Foundation's Intellectual Infrastructure Fund. In short, without any congressional authorization, the National Science Foundation levied a substantial tax (at greater than a 42-percent rate) on a necessary item for doing business on the Internet. 
   Allowing this agency action to go unremedied would set a terrible precedent. Why should any agency suffer through the vagaries of the appropriations process if it can just impose its own taxes? As long as the agency has a monopoly over a necessary permit or license, it can set just about any tax rate it pleases. The agency could then use these tax revenues to fund its activities without too much concern for the appropriators and authorizers in Congress. 
   The potential for abuse in such unauthorized and unconstitutional taxes was not lost on the Federal District Court that heard a challenge to the National Science Foundation's actions. The Court correctly determined that the National Science Foundation's actions amounted to an unconstitutional tax. Remarkably, Congress, rather than taking the National Science Foundation to task for its arrogation of taxing authority, actually ratified the Foundation's actions in a provision in last year's supplemental appropriations bill. The message this sends to federal agencies is intolerable. It creates a perverse and unconstitutional incentive for agencies to impose unauthorized taxes with every reason to believe that a Congress that has never seen a revenue source it did not like will ratify its misbehavior. 
   What is more, the National Science Foundation's actions and Congress' ratification of those actions are inconsistent with the spirit of the Internet Tax Moratorium Act we passed last year. At the same time that we are telling States and localities that they cannot impose discriminatory taxes on the Internet, Congress is ratifying a 42% tax on the registration of domain names. Congress must be consistent with respect to Internet taxation. We must act to repeal the ratification of this unconstitutional tax. The bill I introduce today, the Home Page Tax Repeal Act of 1999 does just that. It sends a clear message that Congress will not tolerate taxation of the Internet and will not allow federal bureaucrats to wield the power of taxation. 
   Finally, let me be clear that my criticism of the National Science Foundation's actions in levying this tax should not be mistaken for criticism of the policies they have pursued or of the uses to which they have put the revenues. I am fully supportive of efforts to ensure that we study the growth of the Internet and that the infrastructure supporting the Internet keeps up with rapid growth of this incredible medium. Indeed, spending for these purposes is so clearly justified that I have every confidence that sufficient funds will be appropriated through the normal appropriations process. But that is the process that should be followed. Allowing an agency to short-circuit that process and impose unconstitutional taxes--even with the best of motives--is simply unacceptable. The power to tax is indeed the power to destroy. The power to tax is oppressive enough in the hands of elected officials who must face the voters. That same power in the hands of unelected bureaucrats is intolerable. On behalf of the people we represent, Congress should reclaim its  proper constitutional authority and reject--not ratify--this unconstitutional tax.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask that two letters be printed in the RECORD. Senator BOND and I worked on an amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill that would help the plight of the hog farmers in the state of Missouri and across the nation. 
   The Missouri Farm Bureau, the Missouri Pork Producers, the American Farm Bureau, and National Pork Producers Council requested our assistance, and we have responded by working with the Appropriations Committee to get an amendment included in the supplemental appropriations bill that makes $250 million available for farmers struggling to survive the severe drop in pork prices. Under the amendment, the U.S. Department of Agriculture would be provided with $150 million new funds and would be given the authority to use another $100 million, that the USDA already has, to help hog farmers. 
   It is the understanding of those of us that have offered this amendment today that the majority of the funds available to the Secretary of Agriculture will be used on behalf of our nation's pork farmers. Last year, all of the major commodity groups received disaster assistance, but the hog farmers received nothing. 
   The letters from the Missouri Farm Bureau, the American Farm Bureau, and the National Pork Producers Council define further the farmers' interest in our amendment.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the possible deployment of United States troops to Kosovo demands the Senate's full attention and debate. I applaud the House of Representatives for addressing this issue in a timely manner, even though I do not support the House resolution authorizing the deployment of United States troops to Kosovo. 
   The pending deployment of United States troops to Kosovo is particularly ill-advised in light of the challenges and difficulties associated with our current mission in Bosnia. Now 2 years past the original deadline with no end in sight, the Bosnia operation has cost the United States over $8 billion in real dollars since 1992. Administration officials cannot identify an end-date for the Bosnia mission and have not been able to transfer the operation to our European allies. Progress in Bosnia has been painfully slow. In many ways the country remains just as divided as it was when the Dayton Accords were signed. Although Bosnia should be a poignant reminder of the limits of nation-building, the administration is considering another open-ended commitment of United States ground forces to the Balkans. 
   The violence and instability that has plagued the Balkans troubles me as it does every other Member of this body. Every Member of the Senate would like to see an end to the violence in Kosovo and a sustainable peace in Bosnia. But in addressing these difficult issues, the President and the Congress owe it to the American people to define a consistent policy for when their sons and daughters will be placed in harm's way. We have to define the American interests important enough to justify risking American lives. Unfortunately, the President has not done so in this case. 
   United States military deployments in the Balkans are not being driven by vital security interests, but humanitarian concerns that have not been defined clearly. As Henry Kissinger states, ``The proposed deployment in Kosovo does not deal with any threat to United States security as this concept has traditionally been conceived.'' 
   U.S. humanitarian interests are important elements of America's foreign policy, but should not be considered alone as the basis for risking the lives of American soldiers. The violence in Kosovo is atrocious, but half a dozen other civil conflicts around the world offer more compelling humanitarian reasons for United States intervention. If United States troops are deployed to Kosovo where 2,000 people have died, why not to Sudan where a civil war has claimed 2 million casualties? Why not to Afghanistan or Rwanda or Angola where hundreds of thousands of people have died in civil wars that continue to this day? 
   Such questions underscore the need for a consistent policy which links the 
   deployment of American troops to the defense of vital national security interests. The United States can and should provide indispensable diplomatic leadership to help resolve foreign crises, but we have to recognize the purposes and limits of American military power. The blood and treasure of this country could be spent many times over in fruitless efforts to reconstruct shattered nation states. 
   From Somalia to Haiti to Bosnia and now to Kosovo, I cannot discern a consistent policy for the deployment of United States troops. In a world full of civil war and humanitarian suffering, will American ground forces be deployed only to those conflicts that get the most media attention? The media cycle is no basis for a consistent foreign policy. The American people deserve better leadership from Washington for the prudent and effective use of U.S. military power. 
   The administration has not provided that leadership. The U.S. Armed Forces have been deployed repeatedly to compensate for a lack of foresight and discipline in our foreign policy. United States policy in the Balkans, for example, has dealt with symptoms of instability rather than the root of the problem. The administration has deployed peacekeeping forces to suppress ethnic conflict inflamed by President Milosevic but has missed opportunities to undermine Milosevic himself. A lack of diligence and resolve also can be seen in United States policy toward Iraq. Saddam is stronger today than at the end of the gulf war because the administration has not seized opportunities to undermine his regime. 
   The ill-defined deployment of United States troops to Kosovo only reinforces  my concerns about the misuse of American military resources. We have been asking our military personnel to do more with less, and the strain is showing in troubling recruiting, retention, and readiness statistics. The dramatic increase in the pace of military activity has been accompanied--not with an increase in defense funding--but with a 27-percent cut in real terms since 1990. In this decade, operational missions increased 300 percent while the force structure for the Army and Air Force was reduced by 45 percent each, the Navy by approximately 40 percent, and the Marines by over 10 percent. Contingency operations during this administration have exacted a heavy cost (in real terms): $8.1 billion in Bosnia; $1.1 billion in Haiti; $6.1 billion in Iraq. 
   The Kosovo agreement pursued by the administration is laying the groundwork for another open-ended United States military presence in the Balkans. The administration's strategy for resolving the conflict in Kosovo could very well lead to the worst-case scenario of a broader regional conflict now being used to justify United States intervention. The Kovoso Albanians see the proposed settlement as a 3-year waiting period leading to an eventual referendum for independence. The Serbians strongly oppose such a step. That will guarantee United States troops will be in Kosovo for at least 3 years and most likely much longer when the inevitable fighting resumes over the question of Kosovo's status. 
   Mr. President, the credibility of the United States is on the line when we commit our military personnel overseas. When United States soldiers were killed in Somalia, the President could not justify the mission to the American people. The hasty U.S. withdrawal from that African nation cost America dearly in terms of international stature. As we consider a possible deployment to Kosovo, the lessons learned 6 years ago in Somalia should not be forgotten. The American people will not support a Kosovo deployment that costs American lives when America's vital security interests are not at stake. Yet American casualties are a very real prospect in Kosovo, as potentially both the Kosovo revels and Serbians will be firing on United States military personnel. 
   Not only is United States credibility at risk in Kosovo, the credibility of the NATO Alliance is in jeopardy as well. NATOs success in the past has been based on the clearly defined mission of the NATO Treaty: collective defense of a carefully defined territory. Now, the administration is transforming the alliance into a downsized United Nations with a standing army for peacekeeping operations. NATO's membership has been expanded this year, but the real expansion has occurred in the alliance mission to include operations never envisioned in the NATO Treaty. 
   Managing Europe's ethnic conflicts was not the reason NATO was established and not a basis on which it can remain a vital organization in the future. The American people have not understood our commitment to NATO--a military alliance for fighting wars--to be another arm of the United Nations for peacekeeping operations. Ill-defined missions for NATO will lead to more misguided U.S. military deployments, the erosion of U.S. support for NATO, and the speedy demise of the alliance itself.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to join the senior senator from Missouri, Senator BOND, in offering an amendment to help the plight of the hog farmers in the state of Missouri. Hog farmers in our home state, and across the nation, are experiencing a disaster outside of their control, much like a flood, drought, or disease. It was projected that 25 to 40 percent of Missouri's pork producers would lose their family farms if we do not take immediate and substantial action. That is why we have offered this amendment. 
   The statistics are devastating. Since June 1998, pork farmers experienced a roughly 70 percent decline in pork prices, from $40 per hundredweight to $9 per hundredweight. The 1998 average price was an astounding 30 percent below the average price in 1932. In 1933, market hogs brought $3.53 a hundredweight, which is $47.29 in today's dollars. 
   There was a $2.6 billion equity meltdown on hog farms across America, and Economist Glen Grimes, at the University of Missouri, projects that hog farmers will suffer another one billion loss in 1999. 
   Some hog farmers have told me that they would have been better off financially if their hogs had simply been destroyed by a natural disaster. At one point, the feed the hogs were eating was worth more than the hogs themselves. And not long ago, consumers were paying more for a canned ham than the 260-pound hog it came from. 
   To address this disaster on hog farms across America, the Administration committed $50 million to their plight. While this amount sends a message of support to hog farmers, it is inadequate in light of the severity of the crisis to our family farms. 
   The Missouri Farm Bureau and the Missouri Pork Producers requested our assistance, and we have responded. Today, Senator BOND and I are offering this amendment, which makes $250 million available for farmers struggling to survive the severe drop in pork prices. Under the amendment, the U.S. Department of Agriculture would be provided with $150 million new funds and would be given the authority to use another $100 million, that the USDA already has, to help hog farmers. 
   The amendment sends a clear and resounding message of support to Missouri's hog farmers. In my recent trips to Missouri, I met with numerous hog farmers and was alarmed to hear them say that many of them would have to sell the family farm if we do not act expediently. This situation demands action, and I have taken immediate action at the request of Missouri's family farmers. 
   It is the understanding of those of us that have offered this amendment today that the majority of the funds available to the Secretary of Agriculture will be used on behalf of our nation's pork farmers. Last year, all of the major commodity groups received disaster assistance, but the hog farmers received nothing. 
   In current law (Section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935) the Department of Agriculture has broad authority to re-establish farmers' purchasing power by making payments, to encourage 
   domestic consumption by diverting surpluses to low-income groups, and to encourage the export of farm products through producer payments or other means. However, the amount devoted to any one commodity shall not exceed 25 percent of the Section 32 funds. Most recently, the USDA recently used its Section 32 authority to make a $50 million direct cash payment to pork producers. 
   Our amendment adds $150 million to the USDA Section 32 Fund, to be used for hog farmers, and it waives the 25 percent cap on the USDA Section 32 Fund for the remainder of fiscal year 1999. These funds would be made available to help the current emergency situation in the pork industry. 
   In addition to today's amendment, I would also like to mention some of the initiatives that I have worked on with the Missouri Farm Bureau and the Missouri Pork Producers in order to address the pork crisis:  
   Initiated a request, with Senator BOB KERREY (D-NE), to U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky successfully urging her to add European Union pork to the U.S. trade retaliation list against the EU's unfair trade practices. 
   Requested that the U.S. Government buy excess hogs from farmers and ship U.S. pork as emergency assistance to Central America. 
   Wrote to the Prime Minister of Canada urging him to resolve work stoppage in the Ontario pork packers plant so that Canada can slaughter its hogs instead of flooding our slaughter houses with Canadian hogs. 
   Wrote to the President and the Secretary of Agriculture requesting that they use all their authority to ensure that no unfair competition or antitrust practices exist in domestic pork markets. It concerns me that farmer's prices for hogs at the farm gate have plummeted while prices at the cash register have not dropped equally for the consumer. 
   Requested of the Administration an immediate moratorium on burdensome new federal regulations affecting hog producers, and wrote to the President to ease paperwork requirements placed on farmers and banks so that the money can quickly get to those who need it. 
   Introduced a congressional resolution (S. Con. Res. 4) with Senator MAX BAUCUS which demands that South Korea end its unfair trade practices and subsidies that hurt American pork producers. The resolution also urges the U.S. Trade Representative, the Secretary of Treasury, and the Secretary of Agriculture to take immediate action against such harmful Korean subsidies.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the proposed amendment to the United States Constitution to prevent desecration of our great national symbol. I want to thank Chairman HATCH for his continuing dedication to this issue, and I want to applaud him for reintroducing the flag amendment today. I believe that our nation's symbol is a unique and important part of our heritage and culture, and worthy of respect and protection. In 1995, I was an original co-sponsor of an amendment to the Constitution designed to protect the symbol of our nation and its ideals. When that resolution was defeated narrowly, we vowed that this issue would not go away and it has not. I stand here, again, today to declare the necessity of protecting the Flag of the United States of America and what it represents. 
   Throughout our history, the Flag has held a special place in the hearts and minds of Americans. As the appearance of the Flag has changed with the addition of stars as the nation has grown, its core meaning to the American people has remained constant. It symbolizes an ideal, not just for Americans, but for all those who honor the great American experiment. It represents a shared ideal of freedom, sacrifice, morality, history, unity, patriotism, loved ones lost, the American way of life and even America itself. The Flag stands in this chamber and in our court rooms; it is draped over our honored dead; it flies at half-mast to mourn those we wish to respect; and it is the subject of our National Anthem, our National March and our Pledge of Allegiance. America's inability to demand a modicum of respect for the flag leads not only to the desecration of our nation's symbol, but of the important values upon which this nation was founded. As the Chief Justice noted in his dissent in Texas versus Johnson (1989), ``[t]he American flag, then, throughout more than 200 years of our history, has come to be the visible symbol embodying our nation. ..... Millions and millions of Americans regard it with an almost mystical reverence regardless of what sort of social, political, or philosophical beliefs they may have.'' 
   There can be little doubt that the people of this country fully support preserving and protecting the American Flag. During a recent hearing that I chaired on ``The Tradition and Importance of Protecting the United States Flag'' 
   held by the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Federalism, and Property Rights, the witnesses noted that an unprecedented 80% of the American people supported a constitutional amendment to protect the flag. The people's elected representatives reflected that vast public support by enacting Flag protection statues at both the State and Federal levels. In fact, 49 State Legislatures have passed resolutions asking Congress to send a constitutional amendment to the States for ratification. Regrettably, the Supreme Court thwarted the people's will--and discarded the judgment of state legislatures and the Congress that protecting the Flag is fully consistent with our Constitution--by holding that, as far as the Constitution is concerned, the American Flag is just another piece of cloth for which no minimum of respect may be demanded. As a consequence, that which represents the struggles of those who came before us, our current ideals, and our hopes for years to come, cannot be recognized for what it truly is--a national treasure in need of protection. 
   Further, the question must be asked, what is the legacy we are leaving our children? At a time when our nation's virtues are too rarely extolled by our national leaders, and national pride is dismissed by many as arrogance, America needs, more than ever, something to celebrate. At a time when our political leaders labor under the taint of scandal, we need a national symbol  that is beyond reproach. America needs its Flag unblemished, representing more than any person or any partisan interest, but this extraordinary nation. The Flag, and the freedom for which it stands, has a unique ability to unite us as Americans. Whatever our disagreements, we are united in our respect for the Flag. We are in need of healing. We should not allow the healing and unifying power of the Flag to become a source of divisiveness. 
   The protection that the people seek for the Flag does not threaten the sacred rights afforded by the First Amendment. I sincerely doubt that the Framers intended the First Amendment of the Constitution to prevent state legislatures and Congress from protecting the Flag of the nation for which they shed their blood. At the time of the Supreme Court's decision, the tradition of protecting the Flag was too firmly established to suggest that such laws are inconsistent with our constitutional traditions. Many of the state laws were based on the Uniform Flag Act of 1917. No one at that time, or for 70 years afterwards, felt that these laws ran afoul of the First Amendment. Indeed, the Supreme Court itself upheld a Nebraska statute preventing commercial use of the Flag in 1907 in Halter versus Nebraska. As the Chief Justice stated in his dissent, ``I cannot agree that the First Amendment invalidates the Act of Congress, and the laws of 48 of the 50 States which make criminal the public burning of the flag.'' 
   Nor do I accept the notion that amending the Constitution to overrule the Supreme Court's decisions in the specific context of desecration of the Flag will somehow undermine the First Amendment as it is applied in other contexts. This amendment does not create a slippery slope which will lead to the erosion of Americans' right to free speech. The Flag is wholly unique. It has not rightful counterpart. An amendment protecting the Flag from desecration will provide no aid or comfort in any future campaigns to restrict speech. Moreover, an amendment banning the desecration of the Flag does not limit the content of any true speech. As Justice Stevens noted in his dissent in Johnson versus Texas, ``[t]he concept of `desecration' does not turn on the substance of the message the actor intends to convey, but rather on whether those who view the act will take serious offense.'' Likewise, the act of desecrating the Flag does not have any content in and of itself. The act takes meaning and expresses conduct only in the context of the true speech which accompanies the act. And that speech remains unregulated. As the Chief Justice noted, ``flag burning is the equivalent of an inarticulate grunt or roar that, it seems fair to say, is most likely to be indulged in not to express any particular idea, but to antagonize others.'' 
   In sum, there is no principal or fear that should stand as an obstacle to our protection of the Flag. Unfortunately, at no other time in history has our country so needed such a symbol of sacrifice, honor, unity and freedom. It is my earnest hope that by amending the Constitution to prohibit its desecration, this body will protect the heritage, sacrifice, ideals, freedom and honor that the Flag uniquely represents.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 257, the  National Missile Defense Act of 1999. I commend the two principal sponsors of the bill, Senator COCHRAN and Senator INOUYE, for their commitment to this legislation and for their dedication to the national security of our country. 
   The fact that we are having a debate on this bill at all, in the sense of trying to overcome opposition to this legislation, is somewhat troubling to me. The foreign missile threat has come to our very door in the last 6 years, and yet the administration and many of my Democratic colleagues continue to oppose this legislation, which simply says we will defend the American people as soon as we can. 
   A recent poll shows that more than 85 percent of Americans favor the deployment of a missile defense system and that three out of every four Americans were surprised to learn that the United States cannot destroy an incoming ballistic missile. The American people would be even more surprised to learn that they remain defenseless today, not so much due to the cost or technological hurdles of missile defense as to a lack of political leadership here in Washington. 
   The administration's record on missile defense has been plagued with the same inconsistency and lack of foresight that is characteristic of our more general foreign policy over the last 6 years. In each of the critical areas that we are facing today in deploying a missile defense system--modifications of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, program management and budgeting, and the assessment of the missile threat--the administration is having to reverse astoundingly shortsighted policies adopted only a few years ago. 
   Secretary Albright has encountered firm resistance from Russia in modifying the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, but Russia eagerly discussed possible modifications to the treaty in the Ross-Mamedov talks in 1992. To Russia's great surprise, one of the first things President Clinton did after coming to office was suspend this dialogue on modifying the ABM Treaty. Now, 6 years later, with a greatly altered diplomatic landscape, the window of opportunity for active Russian cooperation on modifying the treaty may be permanently closed. Regardless of one's views on the ABM Treaty, squandering opportunities such as the Ross-Mamedov dialogue is serious negligence. 
   The lack of foresight in program management and budgeting for missile defense also has undermined the development and deployment of an effective system. When President Clinton entered office in 1993, promising missile defense initiatives fostered under the Bush administration were limited or curtailed. Ambassador Hank Cooper, President Bush's Director of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, had a procurement program in place in 1992 for the first site of a ground-based missile defense system which potentially could have been deployed by the year 2000. This effort was suspended, and the budget for the national missile defense system was slashed by an astounding 71 percent in the first year of the Clinton administration. 
   Here is a chart which shows our commitment to missile defense. During the Reagan and Bush years, we saw a consistent and strong commitment to missile defense. In the years when the budgeting was under the control of this administration, we saw an astounding drop, a 71-percent drop in the funding to develop a national missile defense system. 
   Now, after 4 years of undermining the National Missile Defense Program, the administration is rushing to increase the funding levels because the threat can no longer be ignored or denied. 
   The administration has used faulty intelligence estimates of the foreign missile threat to justify a missile defense policy of delay and obfuscation. Based in part on a National Intelligence Estimate in 1995 that said the Continental United States would not face a new ballistic missile threat until 2010, the President vetoed the FY 1996 defense authorization bill because of language which called for the deployment of a missile defense system by the year 2003. 
   Now, 3 years after the President's veto, with North Korea and Iran developing ballistic missiles to strike the United States, with China modernizing its nuclear weapons, possibly with U.S. technology, and with the threat of accidental missile launch from Russia rising, 2003 is, if anything, too late to deploy a national missile defense system. 
   The administration has relied on faulty intelligence to our collective peril. North Korea's test of the Taepo Dong 1 in August of 1998 was the last nail in the coffin of the National Intelligence Estimate and a strong indictment of the administration's complacency in preparing for an imminent foreign missile threat. But the Taepo Dong test was a result of proliferation trends that have been detectable and discernible for over a decade. 
   We could see the threat coming as proliferation accelerated in the 1980s. We saw the threat arrive when the largest single loss of life of U.S. soldiers in the Gulf War occurred when an Iraqi ballistic missile killed 28 of our soldiers and wounded 89 more on February 25, 1991. 
   The threat was apparent by 1991, at the latest, and that is why the Senate passed the National Missile Defense Act that year as part of the Defense Authorization bill. The National Missile Defense Act was a strong piece of legislation calling for modifications to the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and calling for deployment of an effective missile defense system by a date certain, that date to be 1996. 
   Yet now, 8 years after passage of the National Missile Defense Act, 8 years in which two terrorist governments, Iran and North Korea, have come to the threshold of acquiring ICBM capability, this administration and many of my Democratic colleagues continue to oppose legislation which simply states that it is United States policy to defend the American people as soon as we can. 
   Winston Churchill once said, ``Occasionally you must take the enemy into consideration.'' This administration would be well advised to heed Mr. Churchill's words and to grasp the seriousness of the multiple missile threats posed to the United States. 
   At least 25 countries have or are pursuing weapons of mass destruction programs that could threaten not only their neighbors but the stability of this globe, and nearly all of those countries also have ballistic missiles of one kind or another. The technology is out there and is being proliferated at an alarming rate. 
   In spite of these rising missile threats to the United States, the administration continues to speak of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty as the cornerstone of strategic stability. Although the legal status of the treaty is in doubt after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the accord continues to guide administration policies that have undermined the entire missile defense effort. 
   As William Graham, former science adviser to President Reagan, stated before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee:  
   Not only has the ABM Treaty prohibited the deployment of national missile defenses, it has led to the prohibition of funding for the research and development on systems which might, if deployed, conflict with the ABM Treaty. Moreover, it has made Defense Department program managers unwilling even to propose missile defense systems and programs that might.....be viewed as conflicting with the largely ambiguous details of the ABM Treaty.......  
   Mr. Graham's point is simply this: that the ABM Treaty has kept people in the administration from even exploring alternatives that might well defend the people of this country. 
   This administration's commitment to the ABM Treaty has precluded our best space-based options for national missile defense and limited the more advanced capabilities of our theater missile defense programs. 
   A host of critical missile defense initiatives under the Bush administration were derailed or downsized in 1993. Brilliant Eyes, now known as SBIRS Low, a satellite program to provide essential tracking capabilities for national missile defense, has seen its deployment delayed by as much as a decade. 
   Brilliant Pebbles, a system of hit-to-kill vehicles in low Earth orbit and still potentially the best national missile defense option, was canceled as a result of this administration's policies. 
   A space-based national missile defense system could best defend the American people. So why isn't it being pursued? Even President Clinton's current Director of the Ballistic Missile  Defense Organization, General Lester Lyles, stated before the Armed Services Committee last month:  
   I think all of us recognize that the optimum way to do missile defense, particularly in a robust manner in the future, is from space.  
   This is President Clinton's Director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization. 
   Space-based national missile defense systems have been shelved for one simple reason: this administration's commitment to the outdated and dangerous Antiballistic Missile Treaty. 
   If the administration is so concerned about the cost of missile defense, why is it expending precious missile defense dollars on the least effective systems, rather than the most effective ones acknowledged by the administration's own Director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization? 
   If the administration is so concerned about deploying a technologically sound missile defense system, why is a ground-based system that has the highest technological challenges the administration's only near-term missile defense initiative? As Ambassador Cooper testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in September 1996, ground-based systems are the most expensive, least effective defense that will take the longest to build. The administration has cut the national missile defense budget and diverted those scarce funds into the least effective national missile defense programs. 
   All of this, because the administration refuses to relinquish its tight grip on the ABM Treaty. 
   Finally, the ABM Treaty is undermining the robustness of theater missile defense programs. For example, limiting the use of additional off-site radars for theater missile defense programs out of concerns for the ABM Treaty increases the cost of missile defense exponentially. Bill Graham, former science adviser to Presidents Reagan and Bush, states:  
   .....the area that a surface-based interceptor system can defend using only its.....radar is one-tenth the area that the same interceptor can defend using space-based sensing. Therefore, to defend the same area without space-based sensing, 10 times as many missile/radar systems would have to be deployed at a cost that would be approximately 10 times as much......  
   So this persistent, dogged determination to honor an outdated treaty, the ABM Treaty, increases the cost of our theater missile defense systems ten-fold, just to cover the same territory. 
   In almost every theater missile defense program we have, serious constraints have been imposed to try to limit the ICBM intercept capability of regional theater missile defense systems. Software and radar of the Navy Aegis cruisers have been constrained to limit their ability to track ballistic missiles. Software for THAAD has been constrained to limit its intercept capability. The ballistic missile intercept capability of the Patriot system was restrained until the urgency of the gulf war. 
   Ambassador Cooper stated before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee:  
   .....the 28 military personnel killed when an Iraqi Scud hit their barracks during the Gulf War might have been spared if Patriot had not been dumbed-down and delayed because of ABM Treaty concerns.  
   It seems like the loss of life and the injury to dozens and dozens of others in that particular incident should have sounded a wakeup call sufficiently urgent to at least startle this administration into pursuing a course of action which would not be guided by an unwarranted commitment to the ABM Treaty. 
   In spite of the restrictions the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty imposes on U.S. missile defense efforts, the administration continues to view the accord as the cornerstone of strategic stability and essential for future arms control efforts. Although the past 27 years have demonstrated that the treaty probably accelerated the arms race rather than curtailed it, this administration remains committed to the idea that reductions in nuclear weapons cannot occur unless the American people are completely vulnerable to missile attack. 
   I want to say that again. This administration remains committed to the idea that reductions in nuclear weapons cannot occur unless the American people are completely vulnerable to missile attack. My view is that we deter aggression through strength, not through increasing our own vulnerability. To continue to risk American lives for thoroughly invalidated arms control policies is a serious abnegation of our duty to protect and defend the United States. 
   Administration officials seem mortified by the prospect that Russia will reject the START II treaty if the United States builds an effective missile defense. The administration seems to have forgotten however that the size of Russia's nuclear stockpile will continue to decline with or without another arms control agreement. The size of Russia's nuclear arsenal is in freefall thanks in large part to one American President who returned America to the tried and true principle that strength deters aggression. 
   Ronald Reagan knew that ``Nations do not mistrust each other because they are armed; they are armed because they mistrust each other.'' He confronted and deterred aggression, and although this administration would like the forget it, Ronald Reagan used ballistic missile defense to hasten the demise of the Soviet Union. 
   This particular graph shows the level of nuclear warheads maintained by the United States and the Soviet Union, later Russia, over the last several decades. The ABM Treaty was negotiated in 1972, and shortly after the ABM Treaty came into force, we see the levels of Soviet nuclear warheads begin to increase dramatically. This graph illustrates that America's weaknesses under the ABM Treaty was one factor behind the Soviet arms buildup, while Reagan's resolve to confront Soviet aggression, in part through the Strategic Defense Initiative--hastened the collapse of the Soviet Union. President Reagan used missile defense to deter Soviet aggression, and the dissolution of the Soviet empire led to the reductions in arms that always proved elusive to advocates of appeasement. 
   Reagan's success in confronting and undermining Soviet tyranny was one of the greatest contributions to freedom in modern history. As part of that broader policy, Reagan's commitment to missile defense is at once a telling indictment on the failed policies of the more recent past and a shining example of the courage needed to chart a course for the revitalized defense of the American people. 
   The legislation we are considering today simply says this: We will defend the American people against missile attack as soon as possible. How could there be opposition to this bill when every conflict we have fought in the past has proven that weakness and vulnerability invite aggression? We do not get a reduction in our vulnerability by remaining vulnerable. We get a reduction in our vulnerability by showing strength. 
   How could there be opposition to this bill when missiles from 
   North Korea and Iran pose an imminent threat to the United States? How can there be opposition to this bill when China points the majority of its nuclear weapons at the United States and has implicitly threatened Los Angeles if American forces defend Taiwan? 
   Mr. President, the sad truth is that the United States is completely defenseless against a ballistic missile strike. George Washington once said, ``If we desire to avoid insult, we must be able to repel it.....'' Why are North Korea and Iran pursuing advanced missile technology at breakneck speed? These terrorist governments are seeking the tools of aggression because they know that we cannot repel their attacks. 
   Our ambivalence and complacency in providing an effective missile defense for American citizens and for American interests is an unconscionable act of negligence. We should not shrink from or shirk the burden of eternal vigilance in the defense of freedom because the cost of missile defense is high or the technology is complicated or there will be difficulties to overcome in the development of a system. 
   As Franklin Roosevelt said in September 1941, ``Let us not ask ourselves whether the Americas should begin to defend themselves after the first attack, or the fifth attack, or the tenth attack, or the twentieth attack. The time for active defense is now.'' 
   Mr. President, those words ring as true today as they did before World War II and reflect the commitment of the American people to safeguard the blessings of liberty. The defeatist policies which would leave America vulnerable to nuclear, chemical or biological  warheads have been followed for too long, to the great detriment of our country. We must return to the sound policies of an active defense system before a missile strike on U.S. soil eclipses the catastrophe of Pearl Harbor. We do not have another 6 years to waste, Mr. President. I applaud Senator COCHRAN and Senator INOUYE for their leadership on ballistic missile defense and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass this legislation.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, there is no more worthy government obligation than ensuring that those who paid a lifetime of Social Security taxes will receive their full Social Security benefits. Social Security is our most important social program, a contract between the government and its citizens. Americans, including one million Missourians, depend on this commitment. 
   Unfortunately, as you know, the Social Security system is facing some long-term difficulties. While the Trust Funds are currently building up healthy surpluses--$127 billion in FY 99--by 2013 these surpluses will disappear, and by 2032 the system is facing bankruptcy. 
   With this impeding crisis in mind, I have embarked on a serious examination of the Social Security system. I have spent many hours in the last few months, analyzing the history and workings of this important program, in order to figure out how we can make this program work better. 
   The result of this effort has been a package of important reforms designed to protect Social Security. This package is designed to protect Social Security but, more importantly, it is designed to protect the American people--from debt, from risky, unwise investments, from policies that unfairly deny Social Security to some seniors who choose to work after retirement, and from attempts to use our retirement dollars on spending purposes other than Social Security. The Social Security system has some imperfections that now make our long-term situation worse than it should be, and my package is designed to improve the system in the near term, so that we can begin the important work of reforming Social Security for the long term. 
   One of the points I have already introduced. Last week, I introduced the Protect Social Security Benefits Act. This legislation will prevent surpluses in the Social Security Trust Funds from financing deficits in the rest of the federal budget. Social Security should not finance irresponsible spending or tax cuts that are not otherwise paid for. No rules now stop deficit budgets from being considered. That must end. 
   In addition to the problem of the misdirection of Social Security's surpluses, I also want to improve the way the funds are handled. There is no getting around the fact that a key to the long-term solvency of Social Security is how the current mushrooming Social Security Trust Funds Management Act, which focuses on how the current Social Security surplus is invested and managed.  
   The bill requires the Secretary of the Treasury, the Managing Trustee of Social Security, to consult with the Social Security Commissioner before decisions are made about investing the Social Security trust funds. This additional step will preserve the independence of Social Security and make sure investment decisions are based on the best interest of paying current and future benefits. Currently, the Secretary of the Treasury, who is by law the Managing Trustee, has the sole authority to invest Social Security surpluses, although the law limits that authority to two types of government debt. Nowhere in current law is the Managing Trustee or the Board of Trustees or the Social Security Commissioner directed to make investment decisions on the basis of protecting current and future benefits. Making sure that we can pay benefits now and in the future should be the highest priority. My bill adds this important change to the law. 
   The Social Security Trust Funds Management Act explicitly forbids Social Security Trust Funds from being invested in the stock market. Chairman Alan Greenspan says that investing Social Security funds in the market is bad for Social Security and bad for our economy. When Alan Greenspan talks, Congress ought to listen. The federal government should not own corporate stocks and bonds. The government must not have undue influence over the market. In addition, having the government put Social Security taxes in the stock market adds risk to retirement, and that is a gamble I am unwilling to make for the one million Missourians who now rely on Social Security. The Social Security Trust Funds Management Act legislates that government will not gamble with Social Security in the stock market. 
   In addition, the bill requires Social Security to provide upon request--and, as soon as secure enough to ensure confidentiality, over the Internet--more detailed information about individuals' contribution levels and rates of return. 
   Let me explain the reasons for these three provisions. 
   In order to understand the investment of the Social Security Trust Funds, we must first answer the question, Where is the Social Security surplus? This question helps us understand what the Social Security surplus is, and is not. In truth, the Trust Funds have no money, only interest-bearing notes. It would be foolish to have money in the trust fund that earned no interest or had no return. In return for the Social Security notes, Social Security taxes are sent to the U.S. Treasury and mingled with other government revenues, where the entire pool of cash pays the government's day-to-day expenses. While the Trust Funds records now show a total of $857 billion in the fund, these assets exist only in the form of government securities, or debt. According to the Washington Post, ``The entire Social Security Trust Fund, all [$857] billion or so of it, fits readily in four ordinary brown, accordion-style folders that one can easily hold in both hands. The 174 certificates reside in a plain combination-lock filing cabinet on the third floor of the bureau's office building.'' 
   The placement of all of these funds into nonmarketable government securities raises some 
   questions about the law that governs the management of Social Security money. Under current law, Social Security is now an independent agency. Its Board of Trustees oversees the financial operations of Social Security. This Board is composed of six members: The Secretaries of Treasury, Labor, Health and Human Services, the Commissioner of Social Security and two members of the public nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. This Board reports annually to Congress on the financial status of the Trust Funds. The Secretary of Treasury is the Managing Trustee. The Managing Trustee has sole authority to invest the surplus trust funds not needed to pay current benefits. As for the investment of the fund, while the Managing Trustee is responsible for the investment, his investment options are limited by law to two types of Federal Government debt securities. 
   The law directs the Managing Trustee to invest the surplus in ``special issue non-marketable'' federal debt obligations, except where he determines that the purchase of ``marketable securities is ``in the public interest,'' not Social Security's interest. Sadly, it is all too easy to think of times when an administration strapped for funds might use this power to act in the public interest, and not in the interest of Social Security. It`s even happened recently. In 1995, the Clinton Administration used Federal employee pension funds to prevent the government from breaching the debt limit during the two week Government shutdown. 
   Right now, about 99% of the securities in the trust funds are special issue non-marketable securities, and about 1% are marketable securities. These two types of bonds are similar in that they both represent government debt. They differ in that non-marketable securities are available only to the trust funds and not to the public and they pay a rate of interest that is calculated and set in law. Marketable securities, in contrast, are sold to the public at auction and pay the prevailing yield as determined by the marketplace. 
   This review of current law highlights three important points. 
   First, nowhere in current law is the Managing Trustee or the Board of Trustees or the Social Security Commissioner directed to make investment decisions on the basis of how to best protect payment of current and future benefits, taking risk into account. This is unacceptable. The Social Security Trust Funds Management Act changes this. This change is consistent with the legal concept that a trustee owes a fiduciary duty to act on behalf of the intended beneficiary, and exercises a heightened standard of care in management decisions and actions. 
   Second, although Social Security is an independent agency, the Secretary of Treasury retains sole authority to invest Social Security surpluses. There is a conflict of responsibilities held by the Secretary of Treasury in his dual capacity as Managing Trustee of Social Security. Presumably, the Trustee is to invest those funds as securely as possible, but also with the highest possible rate of return. The role of the Secretary of the Treasury is to manage the finances of the United States Government, minimizing, to the extent possible, the interest charges that the government has to pay in the long run. The problem is that the interest received by the trust fund is also interest that must be paid by the Treasury. If the Managing Trustee is maximizing Social Security's returns, he may not be minimizing the Treasury's interest obligations. And if he is minimizing the Treasury's interest obligations, he may not be maximizing the returns for the Social Security Trust Funds. 
   The Social Security Trust Funds Management Act is designed to resolve this inherent conflict, and still be consistent with the principle that Social Security is distinct from the Federal Government generally. The Act requires the Secretary of the Treasury to consult with the Social Security Commissioner before investment decisions are made. If the Social Security Commissioner disagrees with investment decisions made by the Secretary, he or she must notify the President and Congress immediately in writing. 
   Some experts believe that in some years and in certain market conditions it is preferable for the Trust Funds to buy marketable securities rather than non-market securities. A leading Missouri investment firm, Edward Jones, says the following:  
   Edward Jones believes that this idea has merit because it provides additional flexibility to the management of the federal debt. The use of marketable securities would not only increase liquidity, but also would make bond swaps possible (the exchange of one bond issue for another) which could better facilitate management of the debt. It also could reduce interest payments by targeting specific securities when market conditions dictate.  
   Under the Social Security Trust Funds Management Act, the Commissioner of Social Security could so advise the Treasury Secretary. If the Treasury Secretary does not accept the recommendation of the Social Security Commissioner, the Commissioner has the duty to inform both the President and to Congress. 
   These investment issues take on greater importance in the context of the President's proposal to allow, for the first time in the history of Social Security, as much as $700 billion in Social Security funds to be invested in the stock market by the Government. 
   The legislation I am proposing reaffirms current law, making explicit  what is now implicit that this kind of governmental meddling into private markets is forbidden. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says this idea is bad for Social Security and bad for our economy. As I said before, when Chairman Greenspan talks, Congress ought to listen. Chairman Greenspan has said this plan ``will create a lower rate of return for Social Security recipients,'' and he ``does not believe that it is politically feasible to insulate such huge funds from a governmental direction.'' The last thing this country needs is the Federal Government directing the investment of Social Security funds based on some trendy politically-driven notion of which industries or which countries are in political favor at the moment. 
   The Government's putting Social Security taxes in the stock market adds risk to retirement and is a gamble I am unwilling to make for one million Missourians who get Social Security. This legislation puts Congress on record that Government will not gamble Social 
   Security in the stock market. While I understand the impulse to harness the great potential of the stock market, significant government involvement in the stock market could tend toward economic nationalization, excess government involvement in private financial markets, and short-term, politically motivated investment decisions that could diminish Social Security's potential rate of return. 
   This scheme is dangerous. Imagine, if you will, what would happen if the government had $2.7 billion in the market on Black Monday, October 19, 1987, when the stock market lost 22% of its value. The trust fund's owners--America's current and future retirees--would have lost a collective total of $633 billion. Imagine seniors who depend on Social Security watching TV news of the stock market collapse, wondering, even fearing, if their Social Security was in danger. While individuals properly manage their financial portfolios to control risk, the government has no business taking these gambles with the people's money. 
   Even President Clinton has expressed skepticism with this idea. In Albuquerque last year, the President said the following: ``I think most people just think if there is going to be a risk taken, I'd rather take it than have the government take it for me.'' He was right then, and he is wrong now. While Americans should invest as much as they can afford in private equities to plan for their own retirements, the government should stay out of the stock market. 
   I recently received a letter from Todd Lawrence of Greenwood, Missouri, who wrote: ``It has been suggested that the government would invest in the stock market with my Social Security money. No offense, but there is not much that the Government touches that works well. Why would making MY investment decisions for me be any different. Looking at it from a business perspective, would the owner of a corporation feel comfortable if the government were the primary shareholder?'' Todd Lawrence understands what President Clinton does not. No corporation would want the government as a shareholder, and no investor should want the government handling their investment. 
   The last provision of my bill gives Americans more information about how much they can expect to receive from the Social Security system. While the Social Security Administration already provides helpful and comprehensive information about future benefits, it does not provide much information about its costs or its rate of return. While the Social Security's current practice of providing benefit information is useful, it is not enough. 
   It is not fair to ask Americans to plan for retirement and not tell them the actual cost or the opportunity costs of those benefits. As the American people consider that further steps are necessary to reform Social Security, they are entitled to accurate information about how well their Social Security investments are doing. 
   This legislation would address this problem by requiring the Social Security Administration, upon request, to provide individuals' own rate of return information, and to make such information available over the Internet as soon as it is sufficiently secure to ensure beneficiary confidentiality. Americans need to know the rate of return on Social Security. This information is vital for Americans in order for them to make the right decisions about their own financial futures, as well as the future of the Social Security program. 
   The Social Security Trust Funds Management Act is designed to protect the Social Security Trust Funds. More importantly, it is designed to protect the American people--from conflicts of interest, from bad investments, from misinformation, and from attempts to place the Trust Funds in risky and inappropriate investments. While I value the Social Security system, I value the American people, people like Todd Lawrence and the four million other Missourians who either pay into the Social Security system or receive Social Security benefits, more. My primary responsibility is to them. My plan to protect the Social Security system will protect the American people first, and I will work to make sure that this package becomes law.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of this resolution, and I yield myself as much time as I might consume. 
   Mr. President, I have had the opportunity, over the last 30 years, to visit Israel on a number of occasions, and I have had a personal awareness of the difficult responsibilities that are involved in maintaining the security of one of our best friends in the international community. As the ranking majority member of the Subcommittee on Near East Affairs for the Foreign Relations Committee, I have a few comments that I would like to make in regard to this matter and in support of this resolution, of which, as I said, I am a cosponsor. 
   Yasser Arafat and other senior Palestinian leaders have threatened repeatedly to declare a Palestinian state on May 4. That was the original deadline for the completion of the Oslo peace process. It is important to note that there are many commitments that have not been fulfilled by the Palestinian Authority, many deadlines that have not been met. 
   Mr. Arafat s ultimate objective is the creation of a Palestinian state, but he seems to be overlooking a number of obligations in the peace process which have not been met by the Palestinian Authority. Mr. Arafat is essentially saying that regardless of the fact that prior commitments have not been honored, he will declare an independent state. 
   Along with other difficult issues such as the status of Jerusalem, refugees, and water rights, the issue of a Palestinian state should be determined in the final status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. And that was clearly called for, I believe, in the Oslo agreement. 
   Recognizing the security threat posed to Israel from a self-contained Palestinian entity, President Reagan wisely enunciated the U.S. policy of opposing the creation of a Palestinian state. Behind President Reagan's policy on Palestinian statehood was his correct understanding that Israel, in order to ensure its own security, needed to be a central participant in determining how and in what form a Palestinian state would come into existence. The Reagan policy has endured since 1982 and has served the interests of the United States, of Israel, and of all other earnest supporters of peace in the Middle East. But the winds of change have been blowing in the past year. 
   The First Lady of our country was quoted in the New York Times in May of 1998 as stating, ``It will be in the long-term interests of the Middle East for Palestine to be a state.'' President Clinton's trip to Gaza last December added a great deal of momentum to Palestinian statehood. 
   In other parts of the world, implicit policy shifts and diplomatic overtures may pass without much notice. But we have to remember that Israel is in one of the most dangerous and unstable regions of the world. 
   Since the beginning of the Oslo process, for example, in 1993, Israel has lost more than 280 of its citizens to terrorist violence. That is a proportion of the Israeli population that would equal 15,000 Americans losing their lives. It is not an inconsequential number, but a very serious number. Those Israeli casualties have come through over 1,000 terrorist attacks, and the death toll in the five years since Oslo is greater than in the 15 years before the Oslo process was initiated. So it is important for us to note that this is not an inconsequential matter. It is, as a matter of fact, a very serious situation that demands our attention. 
   As Israel faces these threats, it must determine finally what steps in the peace process preserve and enhance its security and what steps do not. American policy has been most successful in the region when it has respected the role of Israel in this process. 
   The role of Israel as a respected, necessary component of the process is at odds with the idea of a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state, and such a declaration would undoubtedly upset future peace talks and introduce a destabilizing element into Middle Eastern politics. 
   The administration has said that it opposes unilateral acts by either side in the peace process. But neutral statements are not good enough when it comes to supporting a friend like Israel in this dangerous region of the world. 
   Our leadership must be more consistent and forthright in opposition to the unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state. As a result, I believe that the U.S. Senate should go on record as saying that it is improper and inappropriate to declare a Palestinian state unilaterally. This resolution should be a signal that this country will not recognize a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state. 
   This is a matter of great concern to us as a Nation for our own national interests. It is a matter of grave concern to us because we appreciate freedom-loving people around the world, and we understand the very serious threat to the security of Israel that an inappropriate determination of this issue could represent. When countries decide to try to reach agreements as a result of understandings similar to those presented in the Oslo accords, we have to make sure that they are simply not a cover for what would otherwise be a unilateral assertion of the rights of one individual or one individual group against another. 
   It is with that in mind, in reviewing my own experience and the history of Israel, acknowledging the difficult task of security Israel faces, that I have cosponsored this resolution. 
   Rather than eradicate terrorist infrastructure in Palestinian territory, the Palestinian Authority apparently has maintained its revolving door policy in detaining terrorists. Over 20 prominent terrorists have been released since President Clinton's visit to Gaza in December 1998. The Israeli Government reports that at least 12 wanted fugitives, including several who have killed American and Israeli citizens, are known to be serving in the Palestinian police. 
   At times, Mr. Arafat has threatened to cross out the peace accords and unleash a new uprising against Israel. He has described the peace accords as a temporary truce. The Palestinian Authority's official media arm, the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation, consistently broadcasts incitement against Israel, including a children's program where martyrdom as ``suicide warriors'' is glorified. Mr. Arafat has not been helpful in resolving Israeli MIA cases, including the case of Zachary Baumel, missing since 1982. 
   This in not behavior of a responsible partner in the search for peace. The United States should be demanding full accountability for these violations of the Oslo Accord. 
   Too often, we have been seen as pressuring our friends and rewarding those who undermine the peace process, both in our dealings with the Palestinian Authority and our diplomacy throughout the Middle East. 
   Palestinian violations of the Wye Accord: In spite of Palestinian violations of the Wye Accord, the latest agreement in the peace process, State Department spokesman James Rubin said Palestinian leaders had ``worked hard'' to fulfill their commitments. Rubin then emphasized ``It is the Israelis who have not fulfilled any of their Phase  Two obligations by failing to pull back the further redeployment as required by Phase Two'' (January 6, 1999). 
   Iran poses a military and terrorist threat to Israel: Iran's ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction programs are a direct threat to Israel. The Senate passed the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act (H.R. 2709) to sanction missile proliferation to Iran by a 90-4 vote last year, but the President vetoed the legislation. Iran supports terrorist groups which have killed Americans and Israelis, yet the Administration waived sanctions last year under the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act designed to restrict billions of dollars in foreign investment in Iran's oil and gas fields--dollars which will fund Iran's support of the enemies of peace in the Middle East. 
   Lack of United States leadership in Iraq: Saddam Hussein is the chief terrorist of a terrorist government committed to the destruction of Israel. The Iraqi president has provided nothing but provocation for over a year and international support for the sanctions regime is eroding. An inconsistent administration policy on Iraq over the last five years has undermined our efforts to bring about a change of government in Baghdad. 
   Syria continues to harbor Hezbollah terrorists: Syria provides safe haven to Hezbollah terrorists which wage an almost constant low-grade war with Israel. Hezbollah killed four Israelis in southern Lebanon on February 28, including a brigadier general, the highest ranking Israeli officer to be killed in Lebanon in 17 years. I have sponsored legislation to sanction the Syrian Government for its support of terrorism, but the administration has opposed the bill for the past 2 years. 
   I urge its passage in the U.S. Senate. 
   Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes, that is correct. I am proposing this provision in response to specific concerns I have heard from Missourians. 
   Mr. President, a message that I am hearing from parents and teachers and students is the issue of school discipline. For the past few months my staff and I have been looking into this issue to see if there are changes that can and should be made to the Individuals with Disabilities Act Reauthorization legislation, in order to give local schools the flexibility they need to apply disciplinary measures in a fair, uniform, and logical manner. I will have more to say on this issue when the Senate takes up the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   But one issue has come to my attention that I believe Congress should address right now, and it involves the issue of a school's ability to discipline IDEA students who carry or possess weapons to or at schools. 
   Mr. President, I have proposed a provision within Amendment No. 68 which makes an important addition to a provision in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The revision I propose will ensure that the IDEA legislation accurately reflects the intent of Congress that schools should have the ability to place a child with a disability in an alternative setting for discipline situations involving weapons. 
   Specifically, this provision revises the law to explicitly allow a school to place a child with a disability in an appropriate interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 days if the child carries a weapon to or possesses a weapon at school, on school premises, or to or at a school function. Currently, the law says that a school could take such action only if the child carries a weapon to school or to a school function. 
   The problem with the current statutory language is that it creates an unintended loophole which could prevent a school from placing a child in an alternative placement if the child at question is in possession of a weapon. 
   Some school boards in my state have expressed concerns about the language in the IDEA reauthorization allowing a 45 day change in placement of a child who ``carries'' a weapon to school. Schools want to know whether that language means they can change the placement of a child whom they found to be in ``possession'' of a weapon, as well as a child found to be simply ``carrying'' the weapon to school. They are afraid that the language of the statute sets up a distinction that is going to create a big loophole which kids can jump through to avoid the 45 day change in placement. 
   Right now, there is a situation in a school district in my state involving two students, both with individualized education programs (IEPs). I have been asked not to name the specific school district at issue because proceedings are still pending on this matter. But here are the facts: Student A carried a weapon into the school and gave it to Student B, who then put the weapon into his (Student B's) locker. The school knew that it could put Student A into an alternative placement, since Student A literally ``carried `` the weapon into school. But could the school also change Student B's placement, since technically he didn't ``carry'' the weapon into school, but instead was simply ``possessing'' it? 
   The school went ahead and also placed Student B in an alternative placement as well. However, the school is now worried that at the pending proceeding, Student B will raise the issue of ``carrying'' as opposed to ``possessing'' the weapon. The school says that it doesn't know how it will be able to get around an argument from the child or his parent that the child did not literally carry the weapon to school. 
   Surely Congress did not intend to set up such a situation in the 1997 IDEA reauthorization. Surely we intended that schools have the ability to place a child in an alternative setting for up to 45 days if the child possessed a weapon on school premises, as well as carried a weapon to the school. And this is why we should pass this amendment: to ensure that schools have the ability to take the appropriate measures against students when weapons are involved. 
   I would like to point out that even the Department of Education has acknowledged that the current statutory language ``carries a weapon to school or to a school function'' is ambiguous, and that it was the clear intent of Congress to cover instances in which the child is found to be in possession of a weapon at school. 
   Now this amendment, if passed, would not apply to the school district in Missouri that is facing this dilemma, since that is a pending case. But we would be addressing this problem for any future situations, providing the clarity that schools, parents, and children need. 
   Mr. President, schools, teachers, principals, and administrators want and need to be able to treat all students on a uniform basis when weapons are involved. We need to be sure that our laws allow a school to remove any student from the regular classroom if that student is found with a weapon at school. We need to close up any loopholes in the law that would prevent a school from taking this immediate action to maintain a safe learning environment for our students. 
   Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will join with me in making this vital addition to the IDEA law, so that schools will be able to exercise the authority we intended to give them to maintain a safe school environment for all our children.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the time for mixed messages in our war against drugs has passed. There was a time when our message on illegal drugs was crystal clear. ``Just say no.'' The results of that simple message were also clear: The decade of the 1980's saw substantial and persistent decreases in the level of drug use, and in the level of teenage drug use in particular. Sadly, however, the current Administration has offered America and its children a mixed message on drugs. 
   The President himself has shifted the message from ``just say no'' to ``just don't inhale.'' Even the head of the Drug Enforcement Agency candidly has admitted that in the current climate we lack the will to win the war against drugs. This is intolerable. We must return to a clear message in the war against drugs--a message of zero tolerance for those who would attempt to ruin our children's lives through the scourge of illegal drugs. The government must speak clearly and unequivocally. Trafficking in illegal drugs will not be tolerated. 
   However, we will not succeed in convincing either drug dealers or our children that we are serious about the war on drugs if we send them mixed messages. One mixed message sent by current law is that convicted drug dealers remain eligible for federal government benefits. We need to change that practice. 
   Mr. President, the bill I introduce today, the ``No Federal Benefits for Drug Traffickers Act'' requires the suspension of federal benefits to convicted drug traffickers. This bill will send a clear message that we mean what we say in the war against drugs. Current federal law provides for the denial of federal benefits (excluding certain programs like food stamps, aid to families with dependent children, and approved drug treatment programs) for individuals convicted of drug trafficking offenses. Unfortunately, however, the law gives judges unlimited discretion to decide whether or not to suspend a convicted drug trafficker's federal benefits. For example, under current law a repeat offender could retain his full federal benefits. 
   The ``No Federal Benefits for Drug Traffickers Act'' addresses this loophole in the current law by mandating the suspension of a convicted drug trafficker's federal benefits for at least a minimum period of time. Specifically, the bill requires the suspension of a convicted drug offender's federal benefits for a minimum of one year. The bill also mandates suspension of benefits for at least three years upon a second conviction. 
   In addition, the bill closes a loophole that allowed drug trafficker who were supposed to be barred from receiving federal benefits for life because of three separate drug trafficking convictions to regain their eligibility for federal benefits. Once again we need to make our message clear and unmistakable. Under the bill I introduce today, life means life and it is truly three strikes and you're out. 
   This is what we need in the war against drugs--a clear message. Those who choose to traffic in drugs have no legitimate claim to federal benefits. This is common sense. There is no need for exceptions or discretion. There is a need for clarity, and this bill provides that clarity.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mr. John Q. Hammons of Springfield, Missouri, who celebrated his 80th birthday on February 24, 1999. John is truly a remarkable individual. He has witnessed many events that have shaped Springfield. In fact, John has contributed significantly to the growth and spirit of  Springfield through his donations to construct and improve such places as schools, hospitals, and theaters. His generosity and personal participation in the life of the community have benefitted us all. 
   Mr. Hammons' celebration of 80 years of life is a testament to me and all Missourians. His achievements are significant and deserve to be recognized on this special occasion. I would like to join his many friends and relatives in wishing him good health and happiness in the future.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Tennessee for his hard work and the good work he has done on the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. This has been a task of assembling the right components that were acceptable to a broad range of interests and reflecting the capacity of States and local communities to make good decisions. I think the Senator has done an outstanding job. I am pleased to have the privilege of being a cosponsor of this bill. 
   Under this legislation, the State of Missouri, my own State, as well as every other State in the Nation, will no longer have to come to Washington on a piecemeal, case-by-case basis to ask for relief from a myriad of Federal education statutes and regulations. Instead, Missouri will have the authority to waive regulations that hinder our schools from providing an excellent education for our students. 
   Now, I know that the occupant of the Chair is a former Governor and had a lot of involvement with individuals in the education effort which is focused at the State level. I remember those days well from my time as Governor. It is most satisfying to try to do something to advance the performance of students. We understand that when students perform well and have great skills, it elevates the potential they enjoy for the rest of their lives. 
   It was always a tremendous matter of concern to me--and I am sure to the occupant of the Chair--how Federal administrative burdens impeded the efforts of States rather than accelerated their capacity to help students perform. I think most Governors and former Governors we talked to would agree that Federal mandates and requirements associated with Federal programs can hinder a State's flexibility and, as a result, they cut into the dollars that could be spent on students. They end up being spent on bureaucracy--not just bureaucracy here in Washington, but a corresponding bureaucracy to deal with the Washington bureaucracy that has to be established and maintained in the States. 
   In response to the question of whether we should impose Federal education standards from Washington, Governor Whitman of New Jersey said, and I think she said it well,  
   What you see now is a huge waste of money on bureaucracy. The more government strings that are on these dollars, the more difficult it becomes to deliver education. If the money that the Federal Government now puts out is too finite and it says you can only spend it for this or for that, that money won't go toward helping students learn, and that's what we want.  
   I agree with the entirety of the statement--``helping students learn, and that's what we want''--and the last line should be the motivation for every one of us not only in the Senate but across America. I simply couldn't agree with Governor Whitman more. 
   States and local schools need more flexibility in how to spend education dollars, to spend them in ways that will help students learn. They are in the best position to make decisions about the education of students. I have to believe that being on site adds value to one's capacity to make an accurate diagnosis or assessment of what is needed. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to speak regarding the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999, which will provide States and local schools with the kind of flexibility they need to improve education and to elevate student performance. 
   One of our Nation's highest priorities is to ensure that our children receive the kind of challenging and rigorous education that will prepare them for success. By building a strong educational foundation that focuses on the concept of high academic excellence, we will prepare students to make important career decisions and to become lifelong learners. The habit of education should extend beyond school. As a result, their lives will be enriched. 
   We in Congress should develop and support Federal policies that will promote the best education practices in  our States and local schools. We have learned from reports and studies that successful schools and successful school systems are characterized by parental involvement in the education of their children. They are characterized by parental involvement and local control, and they emphasize basic academics and make resources available to the classroom. These are the ingredients needed to elevate educational performance. 
   It is with this in mind that we should stop and ask ourselves whether the current Federal education laws contain the elements that further our goal of giving our kids a world-class education. The unfortunate answer to that question is, our current laws don't do that; the answer is no. A number of our Federal education programs contain a plethora of regulations and restrictions that hinder States and local schools, hinder their ability to tailor and design what is needed in the local circumstance to advance the opportunity for students to learn. Whenever they hinder and obstruct that opportunity to tailor and design the right system, they waste the education dollars. 
   Frequently, education dollars that Washington directs in terms of how to spend them are wasted because the how-to doesn't meet the need of the students and the school district. 
   While the Federal Government has played an important but limited role in providing funding for education, it has also played a conflicting role by attaching so many conditions and strings to Federal dollars that it costs States and local schools a lot of time and resources to comply with all the rules and regulations. 
   We have heard much about the paperwork burdens created by the Federal education rules and regulations. The Federal Department of Education requires States and school districts to complete over 48.6 million hours worth of paperwork to receive federal dollars. This is a statistic that is mind boggling. That translates into the equivalent of 25,000 employees working full time just to do the paperwork for States to get their own money back to educate the students, which the State cares enough about to work hard to make sure that they are trying to elevate the students' performance. 
   We heard that in Florida it takes 374 employees to administer $8 billion in State funds, while it takes 297 State employees to oversee $1 billion in Federal funds--6 times as many per dollar. So that to do the paperwork and create the paper trail and all the paper involvement, to be a recipient of Federal funds, it takes six times as many employees as it does to follow a dollar of State funding in Florida. 
   We know it takes a school nearly 20 weeks, 216 steps, to complete a discretionary grant process within the Department of Education. The Department has boasted that it has streamlined the process, because it used to take 26 weeks and 487 steps from start to finish; now it is only 216 steps in the bureaucratic jungle. With this bureaucratic maze, it is no wonder we lose about 35 cents out of every Federal education dollar before it reaches the classroom. 
   If I were to give my children a dollar and, before I got it from my hand to their hand, I took 35 cents out of the dollar, they would know the difference. We tell ourselves that we are doing great things for education, but before the dollar reaches the student, 35 cents is taken out of the dollar. They know the difference. The difference is felt. And then sometimes we are telling them it has to be spent in a way that doesn't elevate student performance. 
   Current Federal laws, of course, can also be inflexible, requiring the Federal education dollar to be spent only for a narrow purpose, to the exclusion of all others. This type of inflexibility hurts schools that have needs other than the ones prescribed by the Federal Government. A recent example was the $1.2 billion earmarked exclusively for classroom size reduction for the early elementary grades. What a noble aspiration. But it wasn't what a number of schools needed. Governor Gray Davis of California recently described how the inflexibility of this initiative is hindering his State's ability to direct Federal funds to areas where they are most needed. Governor Davis said:  
   We need to have the flexibility to apply those resources where we think they could best be used.  
   He went on to say:  
   For example, I was just with Secretary Riley, our U.S. Secretary of Education, for 2 days last week in California. And Secretary Riley was telling me about the $1.2 billion that was appropriated to reduce class size to 18 in the first 3 grades. Now, in California, we are already down to 20 students per class size in K through four. So that money, which is supposed to be earmarked to the area where we have pretty much achieved the goal, would best serve our needs by reducing class size in math and English at the tenth grade level, because we have just started to use a high school graduation exam.  
   Here is a State wanting to elevate the performance of students, with a massive Federal program directed at an area where they have already addressed the problem, but it is ineligible to be used in an area where they need help. We should really understand this. That is why we are proposing in this Ed-Flex program a massive new capacity on the part of States to use money where it is needed, to use money to help get the dollar all the way to the student, and not take 35 cents out of the dollar when it is on its way from the folks in Washington to the classroom where the student studies. 
   Another example is found in title I, which authorizes aid for the education of disadvantaged children. Some of the rigid 
   standards in this program can result in a school losing its ability to provide intensive services to students on a schoolwide basis because it fails by 1 percentage point to have the requisite number of children below a certain income level. Such policies fly in the face of one ingredient for educational success, one vital ingredient: local control. 
   Fortunately, there is a current Federal policy that has helped provide more flexibility and relieve States of regulatory burdens that are associated with otherwise inflexible education dollars. Under the Education Flexibility Partnership Demonstration Program, the Department of Education has delegated its authority to 12 participating States to grant individual school districts waivers from certain Federal requirements that hinder States and schools in their efforts to improve their education programs. Under Ed-Flex--this proposal, not just for the 12 States, but for all 50 States--school districts do not have to march up to Washington each time they want to ask for a waiver. Instead, they can get the waiver from their own State. 
   The Ed-Flex program, as it is called, has reduced paperwork burdens. That sounds good, to reduce paperwork, but when you take the expensive paperwork out of the equation, more of the resource reaches the classroom. Sure, it is good to reduce paperwork, but it is even better to deliver the resource to the site of learning, where students learn. 
   For example, in response to a perceived need, Texas schools have been able to direct some of their Federal funds from the title II Eisenhower Professional Development Program, which is targeted primarily for science and mathematics, to reading, English language, arts, and social studies. If you need help in English and the arts and social studies, why not be able to focus the attention there? 
   In Howard County, MD, Ed-Flex authority has allowed schools to provide additional instruction time in reading and math to better meet the needs of their students. Well, you mean a program that serves the needs of the students instead of serving the plan of the bureaucracy? What a good program. 
   These are all States that have been allowed, in the 12-State pilot program, to have this kind of flexibility--it is interesting that they are moving resources to help students. Oregon used its waiver authority to simplify its planning and application process so that its school districts can develop a single plan that consolidates the application for Federal funds. Well, that is great. Instead of spending more money on paperwork, we are making resources available to the classrooms where students study and achieve. 
   In Vermont, they have reported that the greatest advantage of having Ed-Flex is the ability of schools and districts to gain waivers without having to go directly to the Department of Education. The fact that the State can grant waivers with a minimum of redtape encourages schools and districts to ask for waivers they might not otherwise have asked for. You see, the intimidation factor of Federal regulation  is one that is hard to assess. But here is the State of Vermont basically saying they were lacking creativity in their schools and people didn't bother to try to ask for the waiver. They went ahead and did what Washington said, in spite of the fact that it may not have been best for students, because they had been intimidated. The process was too complex. The desire to get a waiver may never have been really strong enough to get them past the Federal bureaucracy. But the schools are now doing things, trying things, delivering help to students, meeting needs at the site of learning, rather than meeting the appetite of the bureaucracy. 
   Other Ed-Flex States have used the waiver authority to include all school improvement resources in a single 34-page plan rather than 8 separate plans totaling 200 pages. Can you imagine that? If you can move the paperwork down in the direction of sort of manual operations from 200 pages to 34 pages, you will cut out that kind of paperwork and you are cutting out a wasted resource, and when you stop wasting, you can start delivering. 
   I am sure this next item is of special interest to the occupant of the Chair, who served as the chief executive of Ohio. Reports indicate that Ohio used its Ed-Flex authority to significantly reduce paperwork in the schools. 
   The education agency of the State also reduced its paperwork. This is great news to hear. Ohio is the State that reported at one time that 52 percent of all the paperwork--I think that is right; the Chair might correct me--required of their school districts was related to participation in Federal programs while the Federal dollars were about 5 percent of the State's total education budget. That means we are costing people a lot in terms of paperwork to get a very small amount of the resource. It is time we freed the system from the burden of paperwork so it can get moving forward to the task of helping students. 
   States are finding that flexibility and regulatory relief they have gotten under the Ed-Flex program has caused increased student performance. Texas has found that its schools with Ed-Flex waivers made gains that match--and in many instances exceed--those as a whole in the State. And frequently those schools with the waivers were ones that were especially challenged. 
   Because of the success of the Ed-Flexibility Partnership Demonstration Program, we need to expand this concept to every State in America. In my home State of Missouri, we don't currently have broad authority, the kind of authority we need to waive the Federal regulations that keep our schools from improving education programs. In the past few years, my State, as well as local districts in Missouri, have had to come to Washington on a number of occasions and ask for waivers of certain Federal education statutes so they could administer their programs in such a way that they can better serve their students. It doesn't make any sense for a State or a school district to keep coming to Washington time after time to beg for permission to help their students. It seems like we could agree that we would allow States to help their students. 
   That is why I support the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999, because it gives the States the authority on their own to grant to schools waivers of Federal statutes and regulations for many Federal education programs. States will also be expected to grant waivers of their own regulations which schools believe are barriers to improving education programs. This is a design--a conspicuous and conscious design--to deliver resources to classrooms where students learn and improve their performance. 
   Around the Nation, Governors of both political parties have called for quick passage of this legislation as it will allow educators to design and to deliver federally funded education dollars in ways that meet the needs of students. As a former Governor, I know how important it is for a State and its local school districts to have decisionmaking authority over educational matters. The closer the decisionmaking is to the local level, I feel, the better. 
   States and local schools are in a better position to know what programs work in their community and elicit the necessary enthusiasm and response from their families which are being served. 
   I also know that States want to show that their education reforms will actually improve quality of education. When I was Governor of Missouri, I also served as chairman of the Education Commission of the States--all 50 States, legislators, governors, school board officials--the Education Commission of the States. During that time I emphasized a point. And it was this: We must insist that our reform programs create a current of educational improvement. We must show that reforms actually help our children learn more. 
   Mr. President, I believe that Ed-Flex boosts educational achievement by allowing States to direct resources where they will get to the classroom and help students learn. 
   So today I want to voice my strong support for the Educational Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. Under this legislation, Missouri schools and schools across America no longer have to come to Washington to seek education waivers one at a time. But they will have more flexibility to administer federally funded education programs in ways that boost student achievement, and ultimately have as a result more capable students. 
   States and local schools want more flexibility because they have the best ideas of what will work in their communities. And they want the ability to take that good news to the students of their schools. Important education groups in my State such as the Missouri State Teachers Association and the Missouri School Board Association have said that flexibility and local control are important goals in Federal education policy. 
   The Ed-Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 helps to accomplish these goals. This bill, Ed-Flex, will ultimately help to improve educational opportunities for the children in my State and all over the country by reducing the Federal redtape involved currently with trying to comply with Federal rules and regulations related to educational programs.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to address a serious national problem--the increasingly violent nature of juvenile crime. It seems that nearly every day we hear encouraging news about the progress we are making in the fight against crime. There is no doubt that this is good news. But reports about reductions in the crime rate obscure two unfortunate realities: First, although the rate of crime has dropped over the past few yeas, the level of crime remains far too high. Second, whatever progress has been made in the reduction of overall crime rates, we are still confronted with a serious problem with violent juvenile crime. 
   Statistics about crime rates are useful, but what really matters is the level of violent crime. Yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average went down over twenty points. If we were focus on that fact alone, it would appear that the stock market was down, when in fact the Dow is near its all time record high. The same is true of crime, especially juvenile crime. Although the most recent data show some drops in the crime rate, the overall level of crime, especially juvenile crime is unacceptably high. There are about as many violent crimes committed today as in 1987. The number of violent juvenile crimes is at roughly the 1992 level and at 150% of the 1987 level. I do not think anyone thought they were safe or secure enough in 1987 or in 1992. 
   Statistics about crime rates also mask the increasingly violent nature of juvenile crimes. Seventeen percent of all forcible rapes, fifty percent of all arsons and thirty-seven percent of all burglaries are committed by juveniles. The juvenile justice system is no longer being asked to deal with juveniles who have committed a youthful indiscretion. The system is being asked to deal with juveniles who become hardened criminals before they turn eighteen. 
   Finally, the recent dip in crime rates is cold comfort for victims of violent crimes. My constituents in Missouri continually identify violent juvenile crime as a paramount concern, and you only have to read the newspaper to understand why. When parents read in the newspaper about a 16-year old who raped four young girls in St. Charles County, they understand the importance of targeting violent juvenile crime. When parents in Hazelwood read about a 13-year old convicted of murder for fracturing his victim's skull with the butt of a sawed-off shotgun, they understand the importance of targeting violent juvenile crime. And when people in Poplar Bluff read about a 16-year old, encouraged by his 20-year old accomplice, who held a pizza delivery man at the point of a shotgun to steal $32, they understand the importance of targeting violent juvenile crime. 
   Mr. President, that is precisely what the bill I am introducing today does--it targets violent juvenile crime. This bill, the Protect Children from Violent Act, will update our current juvenile justice laws to reflect the new vicious nature of today's teen criminals. It treats the most violent juvenile offenders as adults and punishes those adults who would exploit or endanger our children. 
   The Act has several components. First and foremost, it would require federal prosecutors and States, in order to qualify for $750 million in new incentive grants, to try as adults those juveniles fourteen and older who commit serious violent offenses, such as rape or murder. There is nothing juvenile about these crimes, and the perpetrators must be treated and tried as adults. 
   Some of the laws on the books inadvertently pervert the direction of the law enforcement system, offering more protections to the perpetrators, than to the public. This must cease. Strengthening our juvenile justice laws is the first line of defense in protecting the public and providing greater protection for innocent children than for violent criminals. 
   In order to do this, we also must ensure that our law enforcement officials, courts and schools have clear lines of communication and access to the records of violent juvenile offenders. This bill accomplishes this goal by requiring the fingerprinting and photographing of juveniles found guilty of crimes that would be felonies if committed by an adult. The bill also would ensure that those records are made available to federal and state law enforcement officials and school officials, so thy will know who they are dealing with when they confront a dangerous juvenile offender. 
   Typically, state statutes seal juvenile criminal records and expunge those records when the juvenile reaches age 18. Today's young criminal predators understand that when they reach their eighteenth birthday, they can begin their second career as adult criminals with an unblemished record. The time has come to discard the anachronistic idea that crimes committed by juveniles must be kept confidential, no matter how heinous the crime. 
   Our law enforcement agencies, courts, and school officials need improved access to juvenile records so that they have the tools to deal with the exponential increase in the severity and frequency of juvenile crimes. 
   The current state of juvenile record keeping is simply unacceptable. As part of the message that juvenile crime is something less than real crime, many jurisdictions have kept inadequate juvenile records or kept records sealed and inaccessible. What is more, whatever juvenile records they did keep were expunged when the juvenile turned eighteen. A judge sentencing a fresh-faced nineteen-year-old would sentence him like a first-time offender, blissfully ignorant of his prior record of similar incidents. These problems are made worse by the absence of any system to provide for the nationwide sharing of juvenile records. This is not a problem that any one State can solve alone. Even if a State treats juvenile criminal records like any other criminal record, it is still vulnerable to violent juveniles who move into the State. The problem we face is that although juveniles frequently cross state lines, their records do not follow them. 
   For too long, law enforcement officers have operated in the dark. Our police departments need to have access to the prior juvenile criminal records of individuals to assist them in criminal investigations and apprehension. 
   According to Police Chief David G. Walchak, who is past president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, law enforcement officials are in desperate need of access to juvenile criminal records. The police chief has said, ``Current juvenile records (both arrest and adjudication) are inconsistent across the States, and are usually unavailable to the various programs' staff who work with youthful offenders.'' 
   Chief Walchak also notes that ``If we [in law enforcement] don't know who  the youthful offenders are, we can't appropriately intervene.'' 
   Chief Walchak is not the only one saying this. Law enforcement officers in my home State have told me that when they arrest juveniles they have no idea who they are dealing with because the records are kept confidential. 
   School officials, as well as courts and law enforcement officials, need access to juvenile criminal records to assist them in providing for the best interests of all students and preventing more tragedies. 
   The decline in school safety across the country can be attributed to a significant degree to laws that put the protection of dangerous students ahead of protecting the innocent--those who go to school to learn, not to maim or murder. 
   While visiting with school officials in Sikeston, Missouri, a teacher told me how one of her students came to school wearing an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet. Can you imagine being that teacher and having to turn around--back to 
   the class--to write on the chalk board not knowing whether that student was a rapist, or even a murderer? 
   The proposed bill solves these problems by providing a nationwide system of record sharing. What is more, the bill provides block grants to the States for the purpose of establishing improved juvenile record keeping. To qualify for these block grants, States must keep records for juveniles that are equivalent to those they keep for adult criminals. The States must then make those records available to the FBI, law enforcement officers, school officials and sentencing courts. These provisions allow those who have to deal with these violent juveniles to do so based on full information. That is the only basis on which those decision should be made. 
   In addition to requiring that federal and state prosecutors try violent juvenile offenders as adults and increasing record keeping and sharing capabilities, this bill enhances the federal criminal penalties for those adults who seek to lure juveniles into criminal activity or drug use. 
   For example, any adult who distributes drugs to a minor, traffics in drugs in or near a school, or uses minors to distribute drugs would face a minimum three year jail sentence (as compared to the 1 year minimum under current law). 
   This bill also doubles the maximum jail time and fines for adults who use minors in crimes of violence. The second time the adult hides behind the juvenile status of a child by using him to commit a crime, the adult faces a tripling of the maximum sentence and fine. 
   The fact that our current system treats juvenile crime lightly has not been lost on young people. Not has it been lost on hardened adult criminals. If the system is going to let young people off with a slap on the wrist and then give them a clean slate when they turn eighteen, why should any adult criminal risk serious jail time by committing a crime themselves. Why not, instead, just use a juvenile and have the youth commit the crime for them. This use of juveniles is deplorable. But, sadly, our current treatment of juveniles gives adults an incentive to exploit children in this way. If a store sold candy for $5 to adults, but for $1 to children, there would be a lot of adults sending a kid in to buy them a candy bar. So too, with the criminal justice system. Our light treatment of juveniles has led adults to corrupt children in order to escape the penalties imposed by the adult system. It is no wonder that a 20-year old in Poplar Bluff has her 16-year old accomplice take the lead in the armed robbery. We cannot continue to encourage this intolerable behavior. Those who would corrupt our children should received our stiffest and swiftest sanction. To this end, my bill imposes enhanced penalties on adults who use juveniles to commit violent offenses, and also will encourage the States to adopt similar provisions. 
   Furthermore, the Protect Children from Violence Act elevates to a federal crime the recruiting of minors to participate in gang activity. Under this legislation, those gangsters who lure our children into gangs will face a federal prosecutor and a federal penitentiary. 
   A 1993 survey reported an estimated 4,881 gangs with 249,324 gang members in the United States. Those figures are disturbing enough. But a second study, conducted just two years later, found that the number of gangs had increased more than four-fold, with 23,388 gangs claiming over 650,000 members. We need legislation to stem this rising tide. 
   Let me quickly recap the highlights of this legislation. In order to qualify for incentive grants, States would be required to try juveniles as adults if they commit certain violent crimes such as rape and murder. States also would have to fingerprint and keep records on juveniles who commit crimes that would be felonies if committed by adults, and States mut allow public access to juvenile criminal records of repeat juvenile offenders. These same provisions would apply to federal law enforcement officials. To protect our children from adults who prey on the, this bill doubles and triples the jail time for those convicted of using a juvenile to commit a violent crime or to distribute drugs. Anyone caught dealing drugs to minors or near a school will face three times the penalty under current law. 
   This bill is a reasonable and prudent response to the threat that violent youth, and the adults that lead them into a life of crime, pose to our children. the monies authorized will be used to deter and incarcerate violent juvenile criminals, not just to provide for more midnight basketball and prevention programs--the situation, and our future, demands more than that. We need to take into account the needs of the innocent children--not sacrifice their protection in the name of privacy for violent juvenile perpetrators. 
   For too long now we have treated juvenile crime as something less than real crime. Even the language we use--referring to adult crimes, but to acts of juvenile delinquency--suggests that juvenile crime is not real crime. But we are not talking about throwing spit-balls or juvenile horseplay. We are talking about murder and assault and rape. And I assure you that for the victims of these crimes, the crimes are all too real--no less so because the perpetrator was under eighteen. The time has come to take juvenile crime seriously and protect our children from violence.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I want to take an opportunity to congratulate the senior Senator from my home State for introducing and reporting the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act. This is an important bill that I am happy to co-sponsor and support. The bill represents an important step in Congress' ongoing efforts to limit the scope and impact of the Year 2000 problem before it is too late. Last year, we passed the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act, which was an important first step in removing any legal barriers that could prevent individuals and companies from doing everything possible to eliminate Year 2000 problems before they happen. I was particularly gratified that I was able to work with Senators HATCH and LEAHY to include the provisions of my temporary antitrust immunity bill, S. 2384, in last year's act. However, as I said at the time, the Disclosure Act must be understood as only the first step in our efforts to deal with this problem. Senator BOND'S bill, along with the liability bills working their way through the Commerce and Judiciary Committees, on which I sit, are the next logical steps in this ongoing effort. 
   Countless computer engineers and experts are busy right now trying to solve or minimize the Year 2000 and related date failure problems. Part of what makes this problem so difficult to address is that there is no one Year 2000 problem. There are countless distinct date failure problems, and no one silver bullet will solve them all. The absence of any readily-available one-size-fits-all solution poses particularly serious challenges for small business. 
   The Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act addresses this problem by providing loan guarantees to small businesses to remedy their year 2000 problems. The act provides the necessary resources so that small businesses can nip this problem in the bud, so that the Year 2000 problem does not become the Year 2000 disaster. 
   The act is narrowly targeted at enabling small business to remedy Year 2000 issues before they lead to costly damages and even more costly litigation. Like the antitrust exemption I authored in the last Congress, this provision automatically sunsets once the window of opportunity for avoiding Year 2000 problems closes. 
   Finally, let me say, that like Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act we enacted last year, this law does not offer a complete solution to the Year 2000 problem. There are many aspects to this problem--both domestic and international--and there may be limits to what government can do to solve this problem. These loan guarantees are one constructive step Congress can take. Another constructive step is to remove government-imposed obstacles that limit the ability of the private sector to solve this problem. For example, Congress needs to address the liability rules that govern litigation over potential Year 2000 problems. That process is ongoing in both the Commerce and Judiciary Committees, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on both committees to reach an acceptable approach that can be enacted quickly. 
   The remaining issues are difficult, but we cannot shrink from tackling the tough issues. Many have talked about the unprecedented prosperity generated by our new, high-tech economy.  I want to make sure that the next century is driven by these high-tech engines of growth and is stamped made in America. But we will not make the next century an American Century by dodging the tough issues and hoping the Year 2000 problem will just go away. We need to keep working toward a solution. 
   Resources to address the Year 2000 problem, particularly time, are finite. They must be focused as fully as possible on remediation, rather than on unproductive litigation. This issue is all about time, and we have precious little left before the Year 2000 problem is upon us. I hope we can continue to work together on legislation like this to free up talented individuals to address this serious threat. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 4, The Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' (SSAM) Bill of Rights Act of 1999. This bill addresses critical personnel and retention issues in our nation's armed forces and hopefully will arrest the accelerating decline in military readiness. I commend the distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER, and the Committee as a whole for reporting this legislation. 
   I have been concerned for quite some time with declining defense budgets and increased deployments overseas. Those who defend the United States often are the first casualties of budget cuts here at home, even as they have been deployed overseas more frequently than ever before. Declining morale in our armed forces and diminished military readiness are national security legacies this Administration is leaving, legacies I hope the Senate will begin reversing with the passage of S. 4. 
   Our military is hemorrhaging due to poor morale, plentiful private sector opportunities in a robust economy, and burdensome deployment schedules. The pay and benefit provisions in S. 4 will be critical to arrest declining morale and diminished readiness. As General Hugh Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, stated before the Senate Armed Services Committee last September, ``......we must act soon to send a clear signal to the backbone of our military, our mid-grade commissioned and noncommissioned officers, that their leadership and this Congress recognize the value of their service and their sacrifices and that we have not lost sight of our commitment to the success of the all-volunteer force.'' 
   Mr. President, the Administration has taken too long to address the morale and retention problems undermining the readiness of our armed forces. Senior Pentagon officials downplayed evidence of growing personnel and readiness problems for months, but finally began addressing these issues squarely before the Senate Armed Services Committee last September. General Shelton stated that ``......our forces are showing increasing signs of serious wear. Anecdotal initially, and now measurable, evidence indicates that our readiness is fraying and that the long-term health of the total force is in jeopardy.'' 
   A cursory survey of declining defense budgets and increased operations around the world certainly provides the factual background to support General Shelton's statement. For many leaving the forces today, military compensation and benefits simply do not justify extended deployments away from home. 
   Our military is doing more with less. Defense spending has declined in real terms by 27 percent since 1990. Military procurement spending has declined by a staggering 54 percent during that same time period. In the midst of this dramatic downsizing, the pace of operations abroad has risen dramatically. In the 1990s, operational missions increased 300 percent while the force structure for the Army and Air Force  was reduced by 45 percent each, the Navy by approximately 40 percent, and the Marines by over 10 percent. President Reagan deployed U.S. forces 17 times during his eight year term. During his four-year term, President Bush deployed U.S. forces 14 times. During the six year tenure of President Clinton, however, the U.S. armed forces have been deployed over 46 times. Contingency operations during this Administration have exacted a heavy cost (in real terms): $8.1 billion in Bosnia; $1.1 billion in Haiti; $6.1 billion in Iraq. 
   Diminished resources, inadequate benefits, and increased deployments are taking a serious toll on the health of our armed forces. Our Air Force pilots defeat Iraq's forces soundly on the battlefield, but Saddam is winning a war of attrition when it comes to pilot retention. The Air Force has experienced a 14 percent decline in readiness since 1996 and ended 1998 with a 700 pilot shortfall that could grow to 2,000 pilots by 2002. Air Force second-term reenlistment rates have dropped 13% in the last 5 years. 
   The Navy was 7,000 recruits short in 1998 and reports diminished deployed readiness due to personnel shortages, such as a 9% shortfall in junior Surface Warfare Officers. The non-deployed readiness of carrier air wings is at its lowest level in a decade. 
   Retention rates for critical personnel in all services is suffering. Declines in retention of critical personnel since 1995 are very troubling: Air Force enlisted aircrew with 7 years service declined from 83 to 55 percent; Air Force AWAC personnel with 5-8 years service declined from 56 to 35 percent; Army aircraft armament personnel with 8 years service declined from 72 to 47 percent; Army chemical operations specialists with 5-8 years service declined from 69 to 51 percent; Marine aircraft avionics technicians with 9-12 years service declined from 76 to 63 percent; and Navy electronic technicians with 9-12 years service declined from 77 to 63 percent. 
   The Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' (SSAM) Bill of Rights Act of 1999 addresses these problems on several fronts. The legislation contains important provisions to address immediate needs and establishes longer-term mechanisms to improve retention of military personnel. The bill provides for an across the board pay increase of 4.8 percent. The pay table is reformed to benefit critical mid-career personnel the most. Retirement system reform gives military personnel with 15 years of service the option of remaining in the Redux retirement plan and taking a $30,000 cash bonus or returning to a pre-Redux system with retirement at 50 percent of base pay and no COLA caps. 
   Retirement opportunities also are enhanced by allowing military personnel to contribute 5 percent of their base pay tax-free to a Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). A special retention initiative is also provided where the Secretary of Defense can choose to offer 5 percent matching TSP contributions to critical personnel for six years in return for a six year commitment. Finally, there is a special subsistence allowance to address the intolerable condition of 12,000 military personnel on food stamps. In the U.S. military, the finest fighting force in the world, there should never be families who are so poorly provided for as to need food stamps. The monthly subsistence allowance in this legislation, in addition to other pay reforms, will help end this disgraceful treatment of thousands of military personnel. 
   The need for this legislation cannot be more obvious. Our troops maintain a constant presence in the Persian Gulf, East Asia, and Europe. Now in Bosnia two years past the original deadline, American soldiers could face yet another prolonged nation-building exercise in Kosovo if this Administration has its way. These troops have been asked to achieve more missions with fewer resources and less manpower, and the signs of fraying readiness and declining morale are mounting. 
   In addressing current readiness and funding problems, Administration officials repeatedly have said personnel issues were their first priority. General Shelton testified last September: ``......if I had to choose the area of greatest concern to me, I would say that we need to put additional dollars into taking care of our most important resource, the uniformed members of the armed forces.'' 
   General Shelton is right to place the highest priority on our military personnel. The defense of this country, in the final analysis, is essentially a personnel issue. Admiral Chester Nimitz stated in 1950: ``Our armaments must be adequate to the needs, but our faith is not primarily in these machines of defense but in ourselves.'' General Shelton seems to concur with that statement when he says: ``The best tanks, the best planes, the best ships in the world are not what makes our military the superb force that it is today ..... Advanced technology and modern weapons are important ..... But even the finest high-tech equipment will never be the determining factor on the battlefield. The most critical factor for both current and future readiness are our men and women ..... in uniform today.'' 
   Our military personnel are our greatest resource, and our failure to take care of them our greatest oversight. No soldier should have to worry about feeding his family as he defends his country. No military family should be repeatedly divided by constant deployments. 
   We entrust our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines with the responsibility given to our nation as a whole: the defense of liberty. How we provide for those men and women in uniform reflects on how seriously we take that mission, on how seriously we safeguard the blessings of liberty. I urge passage of this legislation to improve much-needed benefits for those who defend the United States and the cause of freedom abroad.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, we live in a time of unparalleled prosperity. The stock market continually hits new highs, while unemployment and gasoline plunge to record lows. This prosperity brings many blessings, chief among them material comfort. But sometimes prosperity can mask problems as well as solve them. As Francis Bacon said, ``Prosperity is not without many fears and distastes; and adversity is not without comforts and hopes.'' Prosperity can breed apathy and complacency, weakening a society's ability to respond to the challenges facing it. And as for adversity, it is only when people realize the true extent of their challenges that they can overcome them. 
   One of the greatest challenges we face is drugs, especially the recent rise in the production and use of methamphetamines. Despite the continued challenge drugs present, we have not heard enough about this problem recently. This administration has chosen not to make it a priority. A few years ago, Democrat Representative CHARLES RANGEL lamented this administration's inaction on the drug war: ``I've been in Congress over two decades, and I have never, never, never found any administration that's been so silent on this great challenge to the American people.'' Former Drug Czar William Bennett agrees, having testified before our colleagues in the House of Representatives that: ``The Clinton Administration has been AWOL in the war on drugs.'' We have gone from an era of ``just say no'' to an era of ``I didn't inhale,'' and the numbers concerning youth drug use show that these contrasting messages make a difference. 
   While the financial numbers continue to move in the right direction, the numbers concerning youth direction have gone in the wrong direction. In 1998, the percentage of 12th graders who had tried illegal drugs was a shocking 54%--133% of the level in 1992. This figure, which had decreased during the 1980s, increased in the 1990s. Similarly, in 1998, the reported illicit drug use by 12th graders in the last 30 days was more than 177% of the level seven years earlier. 
   What is particularly alarming is the drastic increase in the use of heavy drugs by teenagers. In 1998, the percentage of 12th graders who used cocaine in the last 30 days was 178% of the level in 1992. Moreover, the percentage of heroin use was 250% of the 1992 level. The plain facts are that drug use among our nation's youth is far too common and becoming more so. Our nation appears to be sliding backward from the strides we made in the 1980s. 
   The increases in drug use among our children are alarming. Our children are our greatest asset and they are at great risk from drugs. They are the most vulnerable members of our society. And, more than any other group, young people face the highest risk of being lost to drugs forever. 
   The more than half of the nation's high school seniors who have already tried drugs run much greater risks of future drug use than their peers. According to the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, those who do not try drugs by their mid-twenties are unlikely ever to use drugs. Protecting our children from drugs is the best way to stop adults from using drugs. 
   The challenge before us--protecting our children from drugs--becomes ever more difficult in a society plagued by divorce, single-parent households, diffuse communities, and the never-ending beat of ``live for today'' messages coming from our culture. Every one of these factors makes it harder to impart the right messages to the next generation and to keep our children off drugs. 
   Protecting our children from drugs is more difficult than ever. In the last few years, a new enemy has emerged to join the other, more familiar, threats of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana. That new threat is methamphetamine or ``meth,'' a dangerous, addictive substance that is ruining lives and weakening communities across this great land. Meth is to the 1990s what cocaine was to the 1980s and heroin was to the 1970s. And the problem is growing exponentially, in both Missouri and the nation at large. In 1992, DEA agents seized 2 clandestine meth labs in the State of Missouri. By 1994, there were 14 seizures. That was serious enough. However, in 1997, they seized 421 labs. 
   Meth ensnares our children, endangers us all, and causes users to commit other crimes. In 1998, the percentage of 12th graders who used meth was double the 1992 level. Meth-related emergency room incidents are up 63 percent over that same period. The 
   National Institute of Justice released a report just a couple of months ago that showed meth use among adult arrestees and detainees has risen to alarming levels across the country. 
   Meth is one of the most serious drug problems in our nation--and, in states like Missouri--it remains the most serious problem. Just ask the McClelland family in Kansas City. Their 11-year-old daughter was bludgeoned to death by a family friend who was high on meth. Her murderer admitted to beating her in the head repeatedly with a claw hammer after she resisted his sexual advances. 
   This is not an isolated incident. Meth kills. Law enforcement officers in Missouri refer to it as a triple threat. It can kill the user; it can make the user kill and, in many cases, even its production can kill. 
   Meth labs have been called toxic time bombs because volatile chemicals are mixed in the manufacturing process. There have been dozens of lab explosions. There are also numerous cases of meth abusers booby-trapping their abandoned labs, resulting in serious injuries to law enforcement agents. Even when not booby trapped, abandoned labs are like toxic waste dumps. Clean up is both dangerous and expensive. 
   Meth production poses a unique challenge to law enforcement because of the difficulties in effective interdiction. Although some meth comes in the United States from Mexico, much of it is home produced from readily-available materials. It can be manufactured in clandestine labs and even in the kitchen of a moving RV--a literal moving target for law enforcement. Meth also can be manufactured in batches large or small. Law enforcement officials in Missouri have told me that as we have poured more resources into the fight against meth, some meth cooks have resorted to smaller and smaller batches to reduce the chances of detection. Other law enforcement officers report meth operations that contract out the various steps in the manufacturing process to different sites to reduce the chances of detection. 
   Meth also has some unique attributes which appeal to users. Smoking meth produces a high that lasts 8 to 24 hours. Cocaine, in contrast, produces a high that lasts for 20 to 30 minutes. Meth appeals not only to those looking for an extended high. It appeals to vanity as well. Meth suppresses appetite and is enticing to young adults trying to lose weight. 
   While meth is different from other drugs in some ways--more dangerous, more difficult to police--at its core, it is the same as other narcotics in that it imposes costs. According to Bill Bennett, the use of drugs ``makes every other social problem much worse.'' 
   Meth contributes to a host of societal ills--violence, unemployment, homelessness, family breakup. I have heard too many stories of neglected children all but abandoned in a home turned into a meth lab. There are enough threats to our children that we do not need meth adding to our burden.  
   I want to fight the scourge of meth because of the violence it causes. I want to fight meth because of the costs it imposes, on society and on families, on taxpayers and on communities. But there is another factor that motivates my opposition to meth: I want to fight meth because its use and production is wrong. And too few people are willing to stand up these days and call drugs wrong. 
   This laissez faire attitude leads to too much permissiveness on the subject of drugs. And permissiveness on drugs imposes terrible moral and psychic costs on America's youth. 
   In fact, much of our current predicament stems for the permissive attitudes that emerged from the 1960s. The decay of enforcement that began in the 1960s helped to cause the problems of the succeeding decades. 
   Make no mistake. Enforcement is an extremely effective tool in diminishing drug use. During the 1960s and 1970s, the period coinciding with the dawn of this country's second great drug crisis, incarceration rates plummeted from 90 per 1,000 arrests in 1960 to only 19 per 1,000 arrests by 1980. Laws are what protects society from anarchy. And when we choose not to enforce our laws, our laws lose their effectiveness, and the bulwark against anarchy withers. 
   While our society too often tends towards laxness, we also have a history of responding to challenges. America has never faced a problem that has proven too great for us to meet or too big for us to tackle. The meth challenge, while daunting, is no exception. If we make a determined and full engagement in our war against meth, we will win. We will defeat meth. 
   In my four years in the United States Senate, I have fought the growth of meth trafficking. In the last Congress, I introduced the ``Trafficking Penalties Enhancement Act'' to provide more severe penalties for manufacturing, trafficking, or importing meth. That legislation, which was signed into law last fall, increases prison terms for meth possession to a 10-year minimum for possession of 50 grams of meth or more, and a 5-year minimum for 5 grams or more. That law also made more meth crimes eligible for the death penalty in situations in which a murder is committed in conjunction with the meth offense. In light of the triple threat nature of meth, the availability of the death penalty is particularly relevant and appropriate. 
   In order to protect residents of public housing, I worked with my colleague from Missouri, Senator BOND, to place a ``one strike and your out,'' lifetime ban from public housing premises for individuals who manufacture or produce methamphetamine. 
   I also worked to set up a regional High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (or HIDTA) that covers Missouri. More recently, I organized a bipartisan effort by the Missouri congressional delegation that led to increased funding for anti-meth initiatives, including resources for law enforcement and lab cleanup. These steps are all important. When I talked 
   with representatives of Missouri law enforcement earlier this week, they underscored that these programs are having a positive effect in the fight against meth. But winning the battle against meth once and for all will take continued hard work and effort. 
   Mr. President, today I rise to take the next step in the fight against meth, the Determined and Full Engagement Against the Threat of Meth Act, or the ``DeFEAT Meth Act'' for short. 
   My anti-methamphetamine legislation will have five main components. 
   First, the bill directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to adjust its guidelines to increase penalties for meth crimes. In the last Congress we were able to raise the mandatory minimum sentences for meth trafficking crimes involving over 5 grams. This provision complements last year's legislation by increasing penalties for meth crimes that do not come under the mandatory minimums, and adding a special sentencing enhancement for meth crimes that endanger human life. This provision completes the process of imposing appropriate and severe penalties on those who wish to tear apart the very fabric of our society by distributing meth. 
   Second, my legislation will provide law enforcement officers with more resources for combating meth. Specifically, it is time to authorize more funding for the Drug Enforcement Administration's meth initiative. This funding is essential. In order to stop the spread of meth, the DEA needs to hire more agents, and provide additional training for state and local law enforcement officers. These agents will participate in the DEA's comprehensive plan for targeting and investigating meth trafficking, production and abuse. The DEA also needs to provide additional support for local law enforcement. When law enforcement busts a meth lab, they are taking over the equivalent of a toxic waste dump. The serious and unique problems cleanup problems created by meth demand a serious and unique response. 
   Third, we need to educate our children about the dangers of meth. While DEA interdiction is vital, we also need to educate parents, teachers, and children--who may not yet be familiar with the dangers of meth--about the size of the threat. We should authorize new funding for programs to educate parents and teachers of the dangers of methamphetamine. Missouri law enforcement officers estimate that as many as 10% of high-school students know the recipe for meth. We must make sure that 100% of them know that meth is a recipe for disaster. 
   Fourth, we need to recognize that, more than any other narcotic, meth can be made all too easily, in home grown laboratories, with readily-available chemicals. To counteract this problem, we must ensure that the list of banned precursor chemicals used to make meth is kept up to date. It seems that when a precursor chemical is added to the list, meth cooks figure out how to manufacture meth with a new unlisted chemical. We must remain vigilant in the battle against meth. After consulting with people on the front line--in the crime labs in Missouri--we have proposed adding two new precursor chemicals: red phosphorous and sodium dichromate. 
   Finally, the bill amends the federal drug paraphernalia statute to cover meth. The current law covers paraphernalia used to ingest a number of specific drugs including marijuana and cocaine. It does not cover meth. There is no basis for this differential treatment, and the bill adds meth to the statute. 
   This comprehensive plan is an essential step in the war against meth. While no plan will not stop the spread of meth overnight, we must continue the long process of stopping this onslaught. Defeating meth will be a struggle that takes place in schools, in communities, in churches, within families. We must teach the next generation the danger of drugs and give them alternatives to the easy short term answers that drugs provide. 
   Meth presents us with a formidable challenge. We have overcome other challenges in the past and we can conquer this one as well. In fact, the history of America is one of meeting challenges and surpassing people's highest expectations. Meth is no exception. All we need to succeed is to marshal our will and channel the great indomitable American spirit. The experience of the past few years demonstrates that you cannot win the war on drugs with a half-hearted effort. However, experience also shows that we can win if we commit to a determined and full engagement against the threat of drugs. This bill provides full engagement. With it, we will meet the meth challenge and we will defeat it.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Pastor Jack and Anna Hayford as they celebrate 30 years of service to The Church On The Way in Van Nuys, California. It is with great honor and distinction that I commend the Hayfords for their long and outstanding service to their congregation and people of faith throughout this nation and literally around the world. 
   Pastor Jack and Anna have been faithful teachers of God's Word, inspiring millions in their relationship with God. Their personal sacrifices over the past 30 years of service are exemplified by their relentless pursuit to minister to others. Pastor Jack has helped bring pastors and church leaders together at new levels of unity. His tireless and selfless pursuit to build bridges within the Body of Christ across racial divisions is to be commended. 
   Anna Hayford, a wife and mother, serves as a role-model to women in ministry on how to balance the duties of home and church and the demands of marriage and family. She is a faithful source of strength and encouragement to many through her teaching and counseling ministry. 
   Over the past 30 years, the Hayfords have been on a mission to bring understanding, repentance, and healing to the pain that has separated black and white churches in America. As our nation looks increasingly for guidance in this period of moral decay, the Hayfords provide a spiritual path for others to follow. 
   I wish Pastor Jack and Anna Hayford a memorable celebration of their commitment to the redemptive mission of Christ. May God bless them and protect them in their future endeavors.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the debate we will be having in the Senate is on whether to suspend the rules of the Senate to consider a resolution censuring the President's conduct. 
   A motion will be made to indefinitely postpone the motion to suspend the rules. These votes will occur before Senators have the opportunity to amend the resolution censuring the President's conduct. 
   I take the floor of the Senate to make clear that I am opposed to a censure resolution of President Clinton. 
   The Impeachment Trial of President William Jefferson Clinton is over. The Senate has faithfully discharged its constitutional obligation by serving as impartial jurors of the Articles of Impeachment approved by a bipartisan majority of the U.S. House of Representatives. 
   The Senate has rendered its verdict, and has found the President not guilty as charged. The consequence of this action by the Senate is to keep the President in office where he is to fully and faithfully discharge the constitutional duties of his office. 
   The trial is over. It is time for the Senate to focus on the national legislative agenda. 
   On this last point, I chose my words carefully. I did not say it is time for the Senate to turn to the people's business. 
   Some have said we should not have had the trial or should have adjourned the trial much earlier so that we could turn to the people's business. 
   I reject that notion. I firmly believe that conducting the trial was doing the people's business. 
   But the truth is the trial is over. I do not see any place for the pending resolution censuring the President. It is not the business of the Senate to punish President Clinton. 
   As Senator BYRD has concluded censure, unlike impeachment, is ``extra-constitutional.'' The Constitution empowers the Senate to try a President impeached by the House and remove him if 67 Senators agree. 
   The Constitution does not empower the Senate to punish a President, in the absence of 67 votes to remove. The impeachment trial is over. 
   The Senate should move on and leave President Clinton alone. 
   The Constitution recognizes that if a President cannot be removed through impeachment, he should not be weakened by censure. Although the Senate passes sense of the Senate resolutions on many subjects, censure is different because the Constitution requires a 2/3 vote before the Senate can discipline the President and requires removal upon conviction for impeachable offenses. Censure is an effort to end-run these constitutional requirements. 
   One final problem is that any censure resolution will have to be weak. Even proponents of censure concede that a censure resolution that actually punished the President would be an unconstitutional bill of attainder. Any censure that is consistent with the Bill of Attainder Clause is too weak to be worth doing. 
   The highest form of censure the Constitution allows is impeachment by the House. The failure to convict the President will not erase that action by the House. It is time for the Senate to move on. 
   If the effort to suspend the rules passes, and the text of the censure resolution is before the Senate, and is amendable, I will seek recognition to offer the following substitute, and I quote: 
   After the word ``Resolved'' strike everything and insert the following:  
   ``That the United States Senate at the earliest opportunity will consider and have final votes on legislation favorably reported by its committees that--

   Mr. ASHCROFT. When the impeachment trial began on January 7th, I took an oath to render ``impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws: So help me God.'' This oath distinguishes impeachment from all my other responsibilities in the Senate. Although the Constitution requires Senators to take an oath of office and gives the Senate numerous powers and responsibilities, only the obligation to try impeachments demands the swearing of a special, separate oath. While many commentators have sought to mark this trial as a political event, the oath leaves room only for impartial justice. I interpret this oath as requiring that I decide this case based on the evidence in the record, the arguments of the parties, and the applicable law--and on no other basis. 
   If I were to look beyond the evidence in the case, to public opinion polls, then a path to a decision would be clear. A large majority of Americans, for example, believe that the President committed perjury, but do not think that he should be removed from office. I am sure that those surveyed considered a variety of factors and did not limit themselves to the Senate record. More than anything else, these poll results reflect the American people's capacity for forgiveness. I share this desire to forgive the President for his admitted mistakes. However, the forgiveness we grant in our capacity as individuals must be distinguished from the government's responsibility to remedy wrongdoing. We routinely ask jurors to sentence defendants in accordance with the law, even though they may forgive the defendant. That is the same responsibility that the Constitution and my oath impose on me in this proceeding. 
   On the other hand, if I were simply to vote my conscience as to whether I believe the President's continued service is good for our country and our culture, that is a clear path as well. From the very outset, I have stated consistently that if the allegations were true concerning the President's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, then the President has disgraced himself and his office, and should resign. In my view, the confessed facts of the President's conduct in the Oval Office make his continued presence an obstacle to the healing our culture. The honorable course would be for the President to resign, to allow the nation to heal from the wounds he has inflicted. 
   My oath, however, forecloses either of these paths, and instead forces me to undertake the far more difficult task of sifting through the record, weighing evidence, determining credibility and reaching a final, impartial judgment on the articles of impeachment. As a result, I cannot explain my judgment by resort to any grand principles or by broad statements about my opinion of the President as a leader. I can only explain my vote through a detailed examination of the articles of impeachment, the evidence presented and the relevant law.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today, I am introducing, with Senators BROWNBACK, BAUCUS, and KERREY, the Food and Medicine for the World Act of 1999. It's a bill that will help America's farmers, ranchers, and related industries, keep on selling their food and medicine to the world. 
   For over 200 years, farmers and ranchers have been vital to the growth and economic prosperity of the United States--always responding to the challenges of our competitive free-market system with efficient production methods. The agricultural industry is one of the nation's largest employers. Missouri is the nation's second leading state in its number of farms. Clearly, the agricultural industry is a backbone to Missouri's economy, accounting for more than $4 billion annually. 
   The United States has the best farmers in the world--first class in their production, storage, transportation, processing, and marketing. We can produce more food than any other country, yet the United States only accounts for five percent of the world's consuming population. That leaves 95 percent of the world's consumers outside of our borders. And because of our farmers' efficiency and ability to meet U.S. domestic demand, they rely increasingly on their ability to sell products in foreign markets. 
   Exports now account for 30 percent of gross cash receipts for America's farmers, and nearly 40 percent of all U.S. agricultural production is exported. Therefore, it is imperative that we ensure that our farmers have ample export opportunities. 
   Our farmers and ranchers need our help in opening markets abroad and  keeping those markets open. Once farmers jump through all the hoops of foreign trade barriers and red tape to establish trusted relationships with foreign buyers, the U.S. government should be extremely cautious about sanctioning their sales and forcing them to lose their markets. Many farmers' livelihood depends on sales overseas. In 1997, more than one-fourth of Missouri's farm marketing came from sales overseas. 
   We know that sanctions hurt America's farmers and ranchers. And we know that sanctions against agriculture and medicine are detrimental to the world's poor that have to live under the rule of tyrants. That is why I am introducing the Food and Medicine for the World Act. This bill tries to ensure that farmers don't get sanctioned for the bad acts of foreign governments, and the health and welfare of the world's poor are not damaged further by their leader's indiscretions. 
   Under the Food and Medicine for the World Act, whenever any new unilateral sanction is announced by the President, the sanctions he imposes will not affect agriculture or medicine unless he tells Congress why it is necessary to sanction these products and unless Congress approves the sanction. If the Food and Medicine for the World Act is passed, there will not be any more sanctions against U.S. agricultural exports without agreement between the Administration and Congress and without serious deliberation about the effects on America's farmers and ranchers. Our farms should not be sanctioned without the consent of Congress. 
   The Food and Medicine for the World Act sends a message to customers overseas that U.S. farmers and ranchers will be reliable. People around the world depend on our farm products and on U.S. produced medical supplies. When tyrants challenge U.S. foreign policy, we must not respond by cutting off the supply of food and medicine to their poor. The health and welfare needs of those abroad will be best served if we ensure that our farmers and producers are a continuous source of food and medical supplies. 
   The Food and Medicine for the World Act also sends a message to U.S. farmers and ranchers that their livelihood will not be used as a foreign policy tool without due deliberation and involvement of both the President and Congress. 
   Farmers and ranchers are twice as reliant on foreign trade as the U.S. economy as a whole. It is time for us to enact policy that reflects our support for their efforts to reach their competitive potential internationally.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, on two separate occasions this year I have made statements about the importance of education to our Nation and to this Congress. I've talked about what our parents want for their children, how to provide a good education, and how many of our current federal policies have failed to achieve what we want for our children. 
   Today, as the Senator from Arkansas introduces his ``Dollars to the Classroom Act,'' which incorporates ingredients for educational success into our federal policy, I want to join in cosponsoring his bill as it will empower states and local school districts to spend federal resources in the best way they see fit. I also want to take this opportunity to emphasize the importance of education.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is an honor and privilege to rise today to acknowledge and honor the nearly 400 Missouri volunteers of my home state who have donated countless hours and resources to the 1999 Miss USA pageant being held in Branson, Missouri, in February. 
   The volunteer corps is made up of many talented people who have worked in food services, secretarial and administrative positions, provided transportation, medical and emergency services, salon services, and entertainment. The ``behind the scenes'' efforts of these volunteers have done much to make this pageant a great success. 
   The people of Branson and the surrounding area have come together with their many diverse talents and abilities to assure the success of the 1999 Miss USA Pageant. Millions of people around the world will focus their eyes on Branson and Missouri on Friday, February 5, 1999 when the new Miss USA is crowned. 
   The people of Branson have made a significant contribution to the pageant, and deserve recognition and gratitude for their efforts. These volunteers embody the best of the American spirit. Mr. President, I ask that members of the Senate join me in recognizing and honoring the great work of these volunteers.

    Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator FRIST and others today to introduce the ``Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999.'' I commend the Senator from Tennessee for his leadership on this proposal, which will allow states to waive various federal education regulations and give them more flexibility and authority over their use of federal resources to educate their students. 
   Mr. President, we all want our nation's children to get a first-class education that boosts student achievement and elevates them to excellence. Our role at the federal level should be to help states and local school districts provide the best education possible for their students. 
   Unfortunately, many of our federal education programs, while well-intentioned, are steeped in so many rules and regulations that states and local schools consume precious time and resources to stay in compliance with the federal programs. As a former governor, I have experienced first-hand the frustration of having to jump through a lot of federal hoops to obtain and keep federal dollars designated for various programs. I have also heard of examples around the country demonstrating this same problem I experienced. 
   For example, a 1990 study found that 52% of the paperwork required of an Ohio school district was related to participation in federal programs, while federal dollars provided less than 5% of total education funding in Ohio. In Florida, 374 employees administer $8 billion in state funds. However, 297 state employees are needed to oversee only $1 billion in federal funds--six times as many per dollar. 
   The Federal Department of Education requires over 48.6 million hours worth of paperwork to receive federal dollars. This bureaucratic maze takes up to 35% of every federal education dollar. Clearly, states and local school districts need relief from excessive federal regulations, which take away precious dollars and teacher time from our children. 
   The Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 will help to relieve administrative burdens and save federal resources by providing states with more flexibility to operate their education programs through the waiver of certain federal and state regulations. The bill expands to all states the highly successful Education Flexibility Partnership Demonstration Program that is currently operating in 12 states and is producing great results. This legislation will help to reduce excessive bureaucratic oversight over education and return more control to the state and local levels. 
   Again, I appreciate Senator FRIST's dedication to providing greater flexibility to the states and I look forward to working with him to pass the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. We in Congress should support proposals--such as this one--that return decision-making authority back to state and local decision-makers, where parents, teachers, and school boards have the greatest opportunity to participate in determining priorities, developing curriculum, and making other important education-related decisions.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Senior Senator from Missouri for his introduction of the ``Direct Check for Education'' bill. It is with great pleasure that I add my name as a cosponsor of this important legislation, which will improve the educational opportunities for our nation's school children by sending federal resources directly to local school districts to use in the way they know will benefit students most effectively. 
   Mr. President, when we talk about education, we should start by asking: ``What do our parents want for their children? We know that parents want their children to get a first-class education that boosts student achievement and elevates them to excellence. Parents want schools that are safe, classes that are small, and principals and teachers to have authority to make the right decisions in all areas of learning, school discipline and after-school activities. Parents want teachers who care for students and know the subjects they teach. Parents do not want Washington in control of classrooms. 
   The next question we should ask is: How can we attain what parents want? How can our children achieve academic excellence? The House Committee on Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations answered this question in a report released in July of 1998, called ``Education at a Crossroads: What Works and What's Wasted in Education Today.'' The Subcommittee found that successful schools and school systems were not the product of federal funding and directives, but instead were characterized by: parental involvement in the education of their children, local control, emphasis on basic academics, and dollars spent in the classroom, not on distant bureaucracy and ineffective programs. These are the ingredients we must have to elevate educational performance. 
   Knowing the ingredients of educational success for our children, we must next ask whether our current federal education programs contain these ingredients. 
   First, we should observe that in a sense, the federal government has played conflicting roles in education, providing resources with one hand, while creating obstacles with the other. We have spent over $12 billion on major education programs in the last two years, and this year, we are slated to spend nearly $15 billion. Yet, if current trends continue, only about 65% of federal education dollars will be spent this year on educating our children, due to the excessive bureaucracy in our federal programs. 
   And we should remember that federal funding accounts for only about 7% of the total amount spent on education, while the lion's share comes from state and local taxes. However, that 7% of the funding pie consumes a disproportionate share of the time states and local school districts need to administer education programs. Unfortunately, most federal education programs often do not contain the basic ingredients for educational success, but rather contain components that can actually stifle the ingredients for success. 
   In the last 35 years, the federal government has continued to take away parental involvement, local control, flexibility, and teacher and community input by spinning a complex web of federal elementary and secondary education programs, each of which contain their own set of rules that consume the time and resources of states and school districts. 
   A 1990 study found that 52% of the paperwork required of an Ohio school district was related to participation in federal programs, while federal dollars provided less than 5% of total education funding in Ohio. In Florida, 374 employees administer $8 billion in state funds. However, 297 state employees are needed to oversee only $1 billion in federal funds--six times as many per dollar. The Federal Department of Education requires over 48.6 million hours worth of paperwork to receive federal dollars. This bureaucratic maze takes up to 35% of every federal education dollar. 
   Many federal programs have taken away precious dollars and teacher time. Rather than being able to spend time on classroom preparation, teachers instead have to spend hours filling out federal forms to comply with federal rules. 
   Another problem with a number of our federal education programs is that many of our children and school districts never get to see the federal tax dollars that their parents pay for education. This is because a great deal of federal educational funding is awarded on a competitive basis. In essence, local schools must come to Washington and beg for the money taxpayers sent to the federal treasury. As a result, smaller and poorer schools, who don't have the time and money to wade through thick grant applications or hire a grant writer, cannot share in the money their parents sent to the federal government. 
   To make matters worse, once a school district is successful in obtaining a competitive grant after a harrowing application process, it must spend countless hours and resources complying with the leviathan of regulations and rules attached to the grant. 
   Competitive funding, along with the vast number of federal education programs, has led to a cottage industry in selling information on education program descriptions, filing instructions, and application deadlines for each of these programs. The ``Education at a Crossroads'' report I mentioned earlier describes this cottage industry:  
   ``The Education Funding Research Council identifies potential sources of funds for local school districts, and sells for nearly $400 the Guide to Federal Funding for Education. The company promises to steer its subscribers to  ``a wide range of Federal programs,'' and offers these subscribers timely updates on ``500 education programs.'' More recently, the Aid for Education Report published by CD Publications advertised that ``huge sums are available.....in the federal government alone, there are nearly 800 different education programs that receive authorization totaling almost a hundred billion dollars.''  
   It's a shame that a school district has to pay $400 for a catalog to learn how to get back the money that its community has sent to Washington to educate its children. But sadly, this is often the case. 
   A third problem we can identify with many current federal education programs is that federal dollars are often earmarked for one particular use, and cannot be used for any other purpose. This inflexible funding hurts schools that have other needs than the ones prescribed by the federal government. A recent example of this is the $1.2 billion earmarked last year for classroom size reduction. While more teachers and class size reduction are noble endeavors, some schools don't need more teachers, but instead need more computers. However, the only use of this $1.2 billion can be for hiring more teachers. Such a policy flies in the face of one ingredient for educational success, local control. 
   So, we know we have created a lot of federal education programs and we have dedicated a great deal of resources for these programs. What results are we getting? The National Center for Education Statistics' NAEP 1994 Reading Report Card for the Nation and the States reveals that 40 percent of fourth graders do not read at a basic level. The same report also indicates that half of the students from urban school districts fail to graduate on time, if at all. And the NAEP Report Card also shows that United States 12th graders only outperformed two out of 21 nations in mathematics. The Brookings Institution released a study in April of 1998 indicating that public institutions of higher education have to spend $1 billion each year on remedial education for students. 
   Knowing these disastrous results, we cannot afford to keep spending our federal education dollars in the same way we have been doing for years if it's not stimulating academic success. Parents, teachers, school boards, and members of our community won't stand for this kind of failure. They want and need opportunities to be more involved in deciding how to spend the federal education dollar, because they know what works. We must spend our federal resources for elementary and secondary education in ways that embrace the ingredients of success. 
   Rather than fund the patchwork of federal elementary and secondary education programs that Washington wants, Congress should send that money directly to local school districts. Parents and teachers need the financing, flexibility and freedom to fund programs they know will improve their children's education. 
   Senator BOND's ``Direct Check for Education'' proposal does just this. He takes some of the Department of Education's largest competitive grant programs and returns the money in the form of a ``direct check'' to the local school districts based on the number of students in each district. Schools may use the funds in ways they believe will be most effective in elevating student achievement. 
   Under the ``Direct Check'' proposal, no longer would school districts have to come to Washington and beg for the money they sent to Washington to educate their children. No longer would teachers and administrators have to spend countless and wasted hours filling out federal grant application and compliance forms. No longer would schools be forced to earmark federal dollars for programs that have no relevance to their students' needs. Rather, school districts with the input of teachers, school boards, administrators, and of course, parents, would have the authority and flexibility to use federal dollars for what they best see fit. 
   For example, local schools could deploy resources to hire new teachers, raise teacher salaries, buy new textbooks or new computers--whatever the schools deem most important to the educational success of their students. The Direct Check to Education proposals gives schools more time, flexibility, and money to spend on what's most important: providing classroom instruction to our nation's children. 
   With the flexible, equitable distribution of federal funding under Senator BOND's proposal comes accountability. Local school districts will be penalized for knowingly submitting false information regarding the number of students in their districts. Moreover, the Secretary of Education may audit local educational agency expenditures to ensure that funds are used in accordance with the Direct Check in Education Act. And most importantly, parents, school boards, and members of the community will be able to give direct input into funding decisions, since those decisions will be made right in the community, rather than hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of miles away in Washington, D.C. Local decision making allows for local accountability. 
   Mr. President, we have learned from experience that our many of our current federal education programs and dollars are not producing what we expect for our students. We know that successful education programs occur when crucial decisions are made by local communities, teachers, school boards, and parents. This is why I support Senator BOND's ``Direct Check for Education'' proposal. His plan embraces the ingredients of educational success, as it gives parents, teachers and school boards the authority and flexibility to direct funds to programs they know work for their children. 
   As I said earlier, Senator BOND's proposal consolidates a number of the Department of Education's federal programs for elementary and secondary education. I believe we should explore whether other federal education programs--both within and outside the Department of Education--should also be taken and put into a ``direct check'' to our local school districts. We must continue to look for ways to direct our federal resources in ways that reflect the ingredients of success and educational excellence for our children.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill with the Democratic Minority Leader, Senator DASCHLE, that would ensure that our nation's farmers and ranchers have a permanent trade ambassador. Our farmers need a representative in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative that will focus solely on opening foreign markets and ensuring a level playing field for U.S. agricultural products and services. 
   In September 1998, American farmers and ranchers faced the first-ever monthly trade deficit for U.S. farm and food products since the United States began tracking trade data in 1941. This sounds the alarm for a state like Missouri that receives over one-fourth of its farm income from agricultural exports. 
   When I'm thinking about what is good for the nation's agricultural policy, I ask, ``What is good for Missouri?'' That's because Missouri is a leader in farming. Missouri is the No. 2 State in the number of farms we have--second only to Texas. We have just about every crop imaginable, and Missourians are the nation's top producers in many of these crops. Missouri is the second leading state for beef cows. Missouri is second in hay production. Missouri is one of the top five pork producing states. And Missouri is among the top ten states for production of rice, cotton, corn, winter wheat, milk, and watermelon. 
   With 26 percent of their income coming from exports, Missouri farmers need to know that their ability to export will expand over time, rather than become subject to foreign protectionist policies that choke them out of their market share. During the 1966 farm bill debate, in exchange for decreased government payments, our farmers were promised more export opportunities. It is time for us to deliver on this promise. 
   America's farmers and ranchers need a permanent Ambassador who will represent their interests worldwide, especially as we face more negotiations in the World Trade Organization and regional negotiations with Central and South America. There are a lot of opportunities that could be opened up to our farmers and ranchers in the coming years. 
   Currently, Mr. Peter Scher serves as a Special Negotiator for Agriculture, and he has already been very helpful in taking strong stands for our farmers and ranchers. I want to thank him for his work most recently on getting pork added to the United States' retaliation list against the European Union. Senator KERREY and I, and 40 other senators, initiated a broad, bipartisan effort to make the needs of our pork farmers a priority, and we appreciated the fact that we could work closely with someone whose mission is to serve the interests of our nation's farmers. However, while Ambassador Scher may serve our Nation's farmers and ranchers until the end of the current administration, his position has not been made a permanent position through legislation. Therefore, we are introducing this legislation today because we want to ensure that the Agriculture Ambassador position will transcend administrations. 
   The Agricultural Ambassador (the Chief Agricultural Negotiator) will be responsible for conducting trade negotiations and enforcing trade agreements relating to U.S. agricultural products and services. Also, under the bill the Chief's Agricultural Negotiator would be a vigorous advocate on behalf of U.S. agricultural interests. It is imperative that U.S. interests always have a strong, clear voice at international negotiations. 
   Foreign countries will always have agriculture trade barriers--so farmers must always have an ambassador representing their interests. We need to send the message to foreign governments that we are serious about breaking down barriers in their markets--now and in the future. 
   Our farmers and ranchers need to know that their interests will always have a sure seat at the table for trade negotiations. Canada and Mexico have already concluded free trade arrangements with Chile. Farmers in Canada can send their agricultural products to Chile and, in most instances, face a zero percent tariff level, while U.S. farmers are confronted with an average tariff rate of 11 percent in the same market. 
   The EU is negotiating a trade deal with Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Thus, these countries will give European farmers lower tariffs and more access to their markets at U.S. farmers' and ranchers' expense. America must lead, not follow--in our back yard and around the world. 
   The Agriculture Ambassador bill we are introducing today is supported by more than 80 agricultural trade associations. Additionally, State branches of these national associations, such as the Missouri Farm Bureau Federation and the Missouri Pork Producers Council, are weighing in their strong support. 
   We need to utilize every opportunity we have to help our farmers and ranchers. Making permanent the position of a U.S. Trade Representative for Agriculture will guarantee that the interests of American farmers and ranchers will always have a prominent seat at the negotiating table and will ensure that our agreements are more aggressively enforced.

   Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is a great honor and privilege to extend congratulations to the Reverend Peter (Yee Chung) Chei as he celebrates the granting of his United States citizenship on Friday, October 16th, 1998. Reverend Peter Chei has served our nation admirably during the thirty-three years he has made his home on our shores, and now, as a United States citizen, his continuing commitment to this nation has been sealed with the words of the Oath of Allegiance. The United States has thereby greatly profited. 
   The Reverend Peter Chei has long been held in my highest regard. His dedication to the redemptive mission of Christ has been an inspiration for many people across the state of Missouri, this country, and the world. 
   It was my good fortune to meet Reverend Chei when he was still living in Hong Kong. His father had escaped with the Chei family to Hong Kong after the communists took over the Chinese mainland in 1950. The trials faced by the Chei family as they were uprooted from Peter's birthplace parallel the trials faced by many of America's first adopted citizens escaping religious persecution. Peter Chei's decision to move to the United States in 1965 and his decision to become a United States citizen are made all the more meaningful by this stark comparison. 
   Having arrived in this country, Reverend Chei determined to serve God and his adopted country through a life of evangelism. His long history of ministerial and community service demonstrates his commitment. Reverend Chei has volunteered as Head Start Policy Council President, Head Start Parents Association President, Coordinator for the American Bible Society, Coordinator for the National Day of Prayer, Coordinator for the International Year of Bible Reading, Coordinator for the 1999 Year of the Bible, and as a member of the Crosswalk Teen Center. The Reverend Peter Chei founded Missouri Head Start Parents' Association, Singles and Families Educational Seminar, Christians Together in the City of Nevada, His Hope House, the Christian Artist Series, Hope for America, and Missionary to America. He has taken on all of these extra responsibilities while serving faithfully as a minister of music and as a pastor. 
   I consider it a great blessing to be counted among Reverend Chei's friends and it is my distinct honor to salute this patriot on the occasion of his swearing in as a citizen of our great country.
