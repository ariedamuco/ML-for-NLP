   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, before the Senator from Pennsylvania leaves the floor, if that is his intention, I thank him for the exceptional job he has done in ensuring that we do have funding increases for critical programs such as those at the National Institutes of Health. 
   I heard the Senator from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the subcommittee, describe it as the crown jewel of the Federal Government, and I totally agree with his comments. He has also been an advocate for more education funding, combined with more flexibility. I wish we had followed his advice earlier this year and sent the appropriations bill down to the White House, completing his work in a very timely fashion back in July, I believe it was. 
   I commend the Senator for being an outstanding chairman. I am a great admirer of his and appreciate all of his hard work.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the importance of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program known as LIHEAP in helping low-income Maine families cope with the high cost of our long Maine winters. 
   As Callie Parker from Little Deer Isle, Maine, so eloquently testified before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee earlier this year, heating your home during a Maine winter is a matter of life and death. When the cold reaches into the very marrow of one's bones, when a glass of water you left on a night stand freezes during the night should your furnace go out, you simply cannot get by without heat. 
   Unfortunately, not everyone has enough money to buy the fuel necessary to heat their home. Far too many Maine families have had to choose whether to buy groceries or to pay their rent or mortgage or to keep warm. These are choices that no one should be forced to make, but unless we increase funding for energy assistance now, these choices will become increasingly common. 
   Winter has not even officially begun, although you would not know that in the area of the country from which the Presiding Officer and I come. The high price of fuel and cold temperatures have already driven a record number of households in Maine to seek home heating assistance. Already the Community Action Program agencies in Maine have identified 28,000 households in need of LIHEAP funds to get through this winter. That compares to only 10,000 applicants at this time last year; 
   in other words, it has more than doubled the amount of households seeking this kind of assistance. Another 19,000 families are waiting to be reviewed by the CAP agencies.  
   The problem is, there is simply not sufficient money. As this chart shows, a Maine winter exacts a steep toll. Today, in Maine, a gallon of home heating oil, on average, costs $1.56. Last year at this time, home heating oil in Maine went for $1.03 a gallon--and we thought that was very high. That number is high because just two years ago the average price of home heating oil in Maine was just 78 cents a gallon. In short, home heating oil prices have increased by 100 percent in just two years. For the 75 percent of Mainers who rely on home heating oil to keep their homes warm, this is a steep price to pay indeed. Those heating their homes with natural gas also are facing difficulties. Consumer prices for natural gas have shot up over 50 percent compared to last year. 
   As the second column on this chart shows, last year Maine's CAP agencies distributed an average of $488 to each household. That was the average LIHEAP benefit. Despite the rising costs of fuel, this year the Maine CAP agencies are able to distribute an average benefit of only $350. 
   So you see the situation we have, Mr. President, and see why it is such a problem. We have the price of home heating oil far higher than last year, and more than double what it was two years ago. The high cost of fuel has put more strain on more families, and as a result many more households need assistance. That has caused the average LIHEAP benefit to be cut significantly. 
   What does this mean? When the price of oil is 50 percent higher than last year, and the LIHEAP benefit is $138 less than last year, it means that people are not able to buy very many gallons of oil to heat their homes. Last year's LIHEAP benefit purchased 474 gallons of home heating oil. This year's benefit will purchase less than half that amount--a mere 224 gallons of oil. 
   So we have the worst of all situations. We have the price of home heating oil at record highs; we have the benefit amount having to be cut to less than last year's; and the result is that low-income families are able to purchase far less home heating oil. 
   And this year's winter is already shaping up to be colder than last year's. Mainers will need more oil to keep warm this winter, not less. When the furnace remains silent no matter how far you turn the thermostat dial, we need to be there to put oil in the tank. 
   The bottom line is we need to provide more assistance to more families. 
   The legislation before us today will provide an extra $300 million in LIHEAP assistance to be used this winter. And that is very helpful. It is almost a 30-percent increase above last year's funding level. I know how hard Senator SPECTER and Senator STEVENS have fought for this significant increase. I thank them for their efforts on behalf of the thousands of Maine residents who will benefit greatly from these much needed funding increases. Yet it simply is not enough. With the price of fuel 50 percent higher this year than last, and with almost three times as many families in need of LIHEAP assistance this year compared to just 1 year ago, even a 30-percent increase will only go so far. It is certainly needed, and we are grateful for it, but we are still going to have a shortfall. 
   I am also concerned and disappointed that by placing the year 2002 funding for LIHEAP on the chopping block, the Clinton administration lacked the foresight to realize the obvious: This is not our Nation's last winter. There will be another winter next year; I can guarantee it. We must lay the groundwork now to allow the planning to occur that will ensure that people stay warm next year, too. 
   By eliminating the ``advance appropriation'' for LIHEAP for the next fiscal year, this appropriations bill has not laid any of the necessary groundwork for next year's winter. That will contribute to a supply crunch next fall, I fear. 
   I call on the President and the congressional leadership to make LIHEAP a top priority, not only this year but next year as well. I am pleased to see and applaud the language that was included in the managers' statement pledging to fund LIHEAP in the next fiscal year at this year's level or at a greater level. I would have preferred to see a commitment for advance funding, but I know the conferees will keep the commitment they have made. 
   Finally, I pledge my personal efforts to ensure that low-income families in Maine and throughout the Nation stay warm through our long winters. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, seeing no one seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Ms. COLLINS. I rise in support of the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act which we are considering as part of this omnibus package and which provides over $30 billion in much needed financial relief to our nation's beleaguered hospitals, home health agencies, hospices and other Medicare providers over the next five years. 
   In 1997, Congress and the White House faced a large and seemingly intractable federal budget deficit and projection that the Medicare Trust Fund would be bankrupt by 2002 unless Congress acted. The rapid growth in Medicare spending and pending insolvency of the trust fund understandably prompted the Congress and the Administration, as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, to initiate changes that were intended to allow the spending growth and make Medicare more cost-effective and efficient. 
   These measures, however, have inadvertently produced cuts in Medicare spending far beyond what Congress intended. In 1997, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the BBA would cut Medicare spending by $116 billion from 1998 to 2002. It now appears that the five-year impact of the BBA for hospitals, home health agencies and other Medicare providers is closer to $227 billion--almost twice the original estimates. 
   These deeper than expected cuts in Medicare spending, coupled with onerous regulatory requirements imposed by the Clinton Administration, are inhibiting the ability of hospitals, home health agencies, and other providers to deliver much-needed care, particularly to chronically-ill patients with complex care needs. While the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 did provide some relief, I believe that it is imperative that we do more. As we approach the end of the 106th Congress, we should have no higher priority. 
   I am particularly pleased that the package we are considering today provides overdue relief for our nation's rural hospitals. Small, rural hospitals in Maine and elsehwere face unique challenges in the delivery of health care services. Shortages of physicians, nurses and other health professionals make it difficult to ensure that rural residents have access to all of the care that they need. Moreover, Medicare reimbursement policies tend to favor urban areas and often fail to take the special needs of rural providers into account. 
   One relatively simple, but nevertheless important step we can take is to enable more small, rural hospitals in Maine and elsewhere to qualify for enhanced Medicare payments under the Medicare Dependent, Small Rural Hospital Program. I am therefore pleased that this bill includes legislation that I introduced, the Small Rural Hospital Program Improvement Act, to update the antiquated and arbitrary classification requirements that prevent otherwise-qualified hospitals from receiving assistance under this program. 
   Despite the fact that most of the small rural hospitals in Maine treat a disproportionate share of Medicare beneficiaries, none of them currently qualifies for this program. Not a single one. If updated in the way that this bill proposes, as many as nine Maine hospitals will be eligible for the program, which will qualify them to receive over $9 million in additional Medicare dollars each year. 
   The bill also includes legislation introduced by the senior Senator from Maine, Senator SNOWE, to correct a drafting error that precluded some of 
   Maine's sole community hospitals from benefiting from the rebasing provisions in the Balancing Budget Refinement Act. This provision will bring an additional $2.8 million in Medicare reimbursements to Maine's hospitals each year. 
   In addition, the legislation corrects the current inequity in the Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital program that discriminates against rural hospitals that care for proportionately greater numbers of low-income patients. By treating rural hospitals the same as urban hospitals, as this bill would do, we will increase Medicare disproportionate share payments to at least 18 of Maine's hospitals by more than $8 million a year. 
   And finally, the legislation will provide increased Medicare payments to all Maine hospitals by providing them with a full 3.4 percent inflation increase in FY 2001, up from the 2.3 percent they would receive under current law. 
   Increasing Medicare payments rates is critically important to the hospitals in Maine. For the past several years, Maine has ranked 49th or 50th in the nation in terms of Medicare reimbursement-to-cost ratios. While hospitals in some states receive more than it costs them to provide care to older and disabled patients, Maine's hospitals are only reimbursed about 80 cents for every $1.00 they actually spend caring for Medicare beneficiaries. 
   As a consequence, Maine's hospitals have experienced a serious Medicare shortfall in recent years. The Maine Hospital Association anticipates a $174 million Medicare shortfall in 2002, which will force Maine's hospitals to shift costs on to other payers in the form of higher hospital charges. This Medicare shortfall is one of the reasons that Maine has among the highest insurance premiums in the nation. These provisions will not solve all of Maine's Medicare shortfall problems, but they will help to close the gap. 
   I am also pleased that this bill extends and increases funding for two diabetes research programs created by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, one focused on juvenile diabetes and the other focused on diabetes in Native Americans. These two programs are currently only funded through 2002. The Medicare, Medicaid and S-CHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act would extend funding for these two programs for one year and increase their funding levels from $30 million a year to $100 million a year. 
   As the founder and Co-Chair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I have learned a great deal about this serious disease and the difficulties and heartbreak that it causes for so many Americans and their families as they await a cure. We were all encouraged by the news earlier this year that twelve individuals from Canada appear to have been cured of their diabetes through an experimental treatment involving the transplantation of islet cells, and I believe that it is becoming increasingly clear that diabetes is a disease that can be cured, and will be cured in the near future, if sufficient funding is made available. 
   Last year, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, held an oversight hearing to determine if the funding levels for diabetes research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are sufficient. At the hearing, the Committee heard testimony from the Diabetes Research Working Group (DRWG), an expert panel that studied the status of diabetes research at the NIH and across the country. The study revealed that diabetes research has been seriously underfunded. According to the DRWG, diabetes research represents only about 3 percent of the NIH research budget, which is clearly too small an investment for a disease that affects 16 million Americans and accounts for more than 10 percent of all health care dollars and nearly a quarter of all Medicare expenditures. Moreover, the DRWG report found that ``many scientific opportunities are not being pursued due to insufficient funding,'' and that the current ``funding level is far short of what is required to make progress on this complex and difficult problem.'' According to the DRWG, the funding levels for diabetes at the NIH are roughly $300 million short of what is necessary to ensure that the promising scientific opportunities in diabetes research are realized. 
   The legislation we are considering today will help to close that gap and will make an enormous difference to the millions of Americans whose lives are affected every day by diabetes. By extending and increasing the funding for these two important research programs, we are providing the additional resources necessary to take advantage of the unprecedented opportunities for medical advances that should lead to better treatments, a means of prevention, and eventually a cure for this devastating disease. 
   Finally, I am pleased that the bill we are considering today does provide a small measure of relief to our nation's struggling home health agencies, and in particular to those agencies that serve patients in rural areas. I am,  however, disappointed that it does not do more. I will therefore continue to push not just for a delay--as this measure proposes--but for a full repeal of the automatic 15 percent reduction in home health payments that is currently scheduled to go into effect on October 1, 2001. 
   The Medicare home health benefit has already been cut far more deeply and abruptly than any other benefit in the history of the Medicare program. An additional 15 percent cut in Medicare home health payments would ring the death knell for those low-cost agencies that are struggling to hang on and would further reduce our senior's access to critical home health services. 
   Moreover, the savings goals set for home health in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have not only been met, but far surpassed. The CBO projects that the post-BBA reductions in home health will be about $69 billion between fiscal years 1998 and 2002. This is over four times the $16 billion that Congress expected to save when it passed the 1997 law. Further cuts clearly are not necessary and the 15 percent cut should be repealed. To simply delay the cut for an additional year is to leave this ``sword of Damocles'' hanging over the head of our nation's home health agencies. 
   I have also been disappointed that the process under which we are considering this critical piece of legislation has not allowed for any amendments. The Home Health Payment Fairness Act, which I introduced with my colleague from Missouri, Senator BOND, to repeal the 15 percent cut currently has 55 Senate cosponsors. If I had been allowed to offer my bill as an amendment, as I had planned, it almost certainly would have passed. 
   Thank you, Mr. President, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this important legislation.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as you know, natural disasters exact a tremendous toll on our nation. In just two decades (1975-1994), 24,000 individuals nationwide lost their lives to natural disasters. An additional 100,000 were injured, and the resulting property damage reached a staggering $500 billion. 
   Hurricanes are responsible for 80 percent of these $500 billion in damages. The continued rapid building of homes and commercial facilities along our coastlines increases the potential for even higher natural disaster costs in the future. Since Congress often responds to these disasters with emergency supplemental appropriations, it makes sense to also support the development of technologies and building techniques to mitigate damage resulting from hurricanes and other natural disasters.

   Ms. COLLINS. They certainly do. And one of the most exciting technologies involve wood composites. The fact is, most natural disasters directly affect wood construction, which is used for 99 percent of houses constructed nationally. The University of Maine Advanced Engineered Wood Composites Center (AEWC) has developed new technologies to reinforce wood construction materials with fiberglass material. These fiberglass-reinforced wood composites are two to three times stronger, more impact resistant and more ductile than their unreinforced counterparts. Homes and buildings constructed with these advanced materials should greatly enhance occupant protection from hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadic missiles, and other natural threats. In addition to their benefits in new construction, these technologies can be used to retrofit and strengthen existing wood buildings. The University of Maine and its industry partners require $4 million in fiscal year 2001 funds to complete material and wood panel testing on these technologies, and to start developing building code provisions to transition the new disaster resistant panels into residential and commercial construction. 
   I commend my good friends, Chairman GREGG and the subcommittee's ranking member, Senator HOLLINGS, for their efforts thus far to allocate additional funds to the National Institute of Standards Scientific and Technical Research Services programs. I am particularly pleased with the additional funds that have been allocated to the NIST Building and Fire Research Laboratory, which is ideally suited to develop improved building technologies resistant to natural disaster. 
   I would strongly encourage the NIST Building and Fire Research Lab to support development work on advanced wood composites, demonstrate the performance of reinforced-wood composites under simulated hurricane wind conditions, and introduce the new construction materials into national building codes and standards.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Appalachian National Scenic Trail is a treasure that thousands of Americans enjoy every year. From day hikers to adventures making the 2,167 mile trip from Georgia to Maine, all who travel the footpath enjoy a remarkable wilderness experience. 
   The National Trails System Act of 1968 designated the Appalachian Trail as one of our nation's first scenic trails and authorized the Secretary of Interior to protect the trail through the acquisition of land along the trail or by other means. Over the years, Congress has supported this important effort through appropriations that have enabled the National Park Service to acquire more than 3000 parcels of land, protecting ninety-nine percent of the trail for future generations. 
   Despite the success of the last thirty years, more work needs to be done to ensure that the trail is preserved in its entirety. The longest remaining unprotected segment of the Appalachian Trail crosses Saddleback Mountain, in the Rangeley Region of western Maine. The 3.1 miles that traverse the Saddleback Mountain range is one of the trail's highest stretches, offering hikers an alpine wilderness trek and extraordinary vistas. The mountain is also home to Saddleback Ski Area, which draws skiers to an area of Maine where many are employed in the tourism industry. 
   For nearly twenty years, the National Park Service and the owners of the ski area have sought an agreement that balances the preservation of the trail experience as it exists today and development opportunities at the mountain that would draw additional skiers to the resort and the region. Some have been inclined to suggest that skiers and hikers cannot share Saddleback Mountain, but I have always maintained that with careful planning, preservation and economic development can coexist. Consequently, I have long urged both sides to work together to find a resolution that satisfies the interests of those who cherish the Appalachian Trail, as well as those who live and work in the Rangeley Region. 
   Mr. President, the impasse between the National Park Service and the owners of Saddleback Mountain is drawing to a close. The agreement so many have labored to achieve has been all but finalized, and with the passage of the bill before us today, Congress will establish the framework by which this matter can be resolved. Included in the bill is a provision proposed by me and Senator SNOWE directing the Secretary of Interior to acquire the land necessary to protect the Appalachian Trail as agreed to by both the Department and the owners of Saddleback Mountain. The language also directs the Secretary to convey the land to the State of Maine. 
   I would like to express my appreciation to Appropriations Committee Chairman STEVENS and Subcommittee Chairman SPECTER for working with Senator SNOWE and I on this matter of importance to our State. I would also like to thank Interior Subcommittee Chairman GORTON for including the Saddleback acquisition in the list of projects approved for Title VIII funds in the FY 2001 Interior Appropriations bill. Their support, along with the dedication of many others who have been involved in the negotiations, will ensure that skiers and hikers can share in the enjoyment of the natural beauty and wonders of Saddleback Mountain for generation to come.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will today give final approval to legislation I introduced to curb the availability of false identification via the Internet. 
   Let me thank my many colleagues in both the House and Senate for their hard work in moving this measure quickly through the legislative process. In particular, I appreciate the support and assistance of Chairman HENRY HYDE of the House Judiciary Committee, as well as the work of Congressman HOWARD COBLE, Congressman HOWARD BERMAN, Congressman JOHN CONYERS, and Congressman BILL MCCOLLUM. In addition to their efforts, I want to praise the strong support of Congressman MARK GREEN, who introduced a similar bill in the House. Enactment of this bill would not have been possible without the consistent support of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, as well as the assistance of Senators KYL, LEAHY, FEINSTEIN, and DURBIN. 
   The bill before the Senate today will make important improvements in our laws against the distribution and use of false identification. As I found during a lengthy investigation of the availability of false identification on the Internet, our current laws have done little to stop a growing Internet market in every imaginable type of false identification. Whether via e-mail or from a Web site with a name such as thefakeidshop.com, everything from birth certificates, to Social Security cards, to driver's licenses, are being sold or traded through the ease of cyberspace. 
   Testimony before the Subcommittee on Investigations demonstrated that the availability of false identification documents from the Internet is a growing problem. Special Agent David Myers, Identification Fraud Coordinator of the State of Florida's Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, testified that two years ago only one percent of false identification documents came from the Internet. Last year, he testified, a little less than five percent came from the Internet. Now he estimates that about 30 percent of the false identification documents he seizes comes from the Internet. He predicts that by next year his unit will find at least 60 to 70 percent of the false identification documents they seize will come from the Internet.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am delighted today to join my colleagues in paying tribute to a truly outstanding United States Senator, and that is SLADE GORTON. 
   During SLADE's recent campaign, I had the privilege of going to Seattle to speak at a luncheon organized for him by women who had once worked for him in the Senate and in his capacity as attorney general. I was not at all surprised to see so many women who felt so strongly about Slade's reelection. He is, and always has been, an oasis of inclusion, encouragement, and support for women in the workplace. He is one of those people who know how to encourage, how to mentor, and how to help women and men reach their full potential. 
   That certainly has been true in my own case. Even before I was sworn in as a new Senator some 4 years ago, SLADE took me under his wing with advice on everything from choosing my committee assignments, to selecting my office space, to hiring my staff. He has continued to give me invaluable advice on a host of issues ranging from what our policy should be in Colombia and Kosovo, to how to take a different approach to education spending, to how to succeed in a tricky procedural situation. 
   SLADE has always been someone to whom I could turn for advice, for answers, for good counsel. It has also been my pleasure to work with SLADE GORTON on a host of issues such as education, children's health care, and the cost of prescription drugs. What I admire most about SLADE is his intellectually rigorous, challenging, and creative approach to public policy. He simply does not go along with the conventional wisdom; he challenges it, constantly seeking new ideas and innovative approaches to solve thorny problems. 
   A perfect example of SLADE's innovative style was his development of an entirely new approach to Federal education policy, one that recognized that local school boards, parents, and teachers know best what their children need. 
   As the architect of the Straight A's bill, SLADE has been a leader in education in the Senate. I was very proud to cosponsor his innovative effort to bring academic achievement and accountability to our public schools. 
   SLADE realized that when the Federal Government gives money to local schools, it should not come with dictates from D.C. on how it should be spent. He understood that it should, however, come with an expectation of results, and that is why he worked so hard to give local school boards, parents, teachers, and administrators, the freedom to decide how best to spend Federal money in exchange for holding them accountable for improving their schools. He changed the entire focus of Federal education policy from being focused on paperwork and process, to instead being focused on how much our students were learning, to a focus on student achievement and results. 
   SLADE has also been an advocate for children's health. Not only was he an early supporter of the Children's Health Insurance Program, the S-CHIP program, but he has also worked for years to increase Federal research dollars toward autism. That hard work is about to pay off because his autism bill was included this year in the omnibus children's health bill which was signed into law last month. It will direct more  Federal dollars toward finding a cure and treatment for autism.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is with great disappointment that I rise today to comment on the decision announced yesterday by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service to list as endangered Atlantic salmon in Maine. The decision represents an opportunity lost and reflects a process gone badly astray. It also raises serious questions about the mechanics of the Endangered Species Act, a law that I support, and how the Services have chosen to interpret and follow its dictates. 
   I rise also out of deep concern for the Atlantic salmon. The rivers of Maine once played host to magnificent runs of Atlantic salmon. Scores of fish returned each year to the streams where they were born after two- or three-year journeys out to sea, venturing thousands of miles off the coast of Maine, as far away as Newfoundland. The question is, ``What is the best way to protect and restore these extraordinary fish?'' 
   Yesterday's announcement is no small matter to my home State. It has serious implications for the aquaculture, blueberry, cranberry, and forest product industries that form the backbone of the economy in the most economically challenged area of Maine. The cruel irony underlying the decision is that Maine believed it had laid the issue to rest some three years ago when the Services withdrew a proposed listing and joined with the State in pursuing the Maine Salmon Conservation Plan. On December 15, 1997, the Services announced they were withdrawing their proposed listing of Atlantic salmon to pursue a ``cooperative recovery effort spearheaded by the State of Maine.'' At that time Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt announced:  
   We are unlocking the full potential of rivers in Maine and opening a new chapter in conservation history. The governor showed great leadership in forging this collaboration, which will enhance the ecology and economy of the state for years to come. The seven rivers will continue to attract more anglers, boaters and other sportsmen who will help grow and sustain new jobs and revenue as the rivers continue to stand as a model for the nation.  
   At the same time, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and NOAA Deputy Administrator Terry Garcia praised Maine's salmon conservation plan with these words:  
   This plan, which was developed by a state-appointed task force with input and advice from federal fisheries scientists, is an innovative effort to resolve the real world conflicts that occur when preserving a species clearly means rethinking traditional uses of a river. Our decision to protect salmon through this plan rather than through a listing under the Endangered Species Act highlights the ESA's flexibility and our willingness to consider state-designed plans.  
   Bruce Babbitt's and Terry Garcia's statements purported to highlight the ESA's flexibility and the Services' willingness to consider state-designed conservation plans. But the decision to list Atlantic salmon exposes the statements as hollow rhetoric and reflects a policy of inflexibility and of rejecting potentially effective state plans as alternatives to listing. In the end, Secretary Babbitt and Mr. Garcia reneged on their commitment to 
   work with the state, within the framework of the state plan. 
   The Services have taken the implicit position that they are under no legally-binding obligation to abide by their earlier commitments to work with the state through the Maine Salmon Conservation Plan. In proposing the salmon listing, they abandoned the Plan, which the Services relied on to withdraw their 1995 proposal to list Atlantic salmon as threatened. Indeed, in withdrawing the proposed listing three years ago, the Services referred to the Plan as ``a comprehensive collection of measures and protective actions that offer[s] a positive benefit to the species'' and as a substitute for listing. Moreover, at the time, the Services signed a statement of cooperation with the State of Maine to support the Plan as the means toward restoring Atlantic salmon in the seven identified rivers.  In short, the Services gave every indication that they were committing to the Plan as an alternative to listing the salmon under the Endangered Species Act.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is now considering legislation I introduced to stem the proliferation of websites that distribute counterfeit identification documents and credentials over the Internet. I appreciate the timely action on this legislation by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, as well as the support and assistance of Senators KYL, LEAHY, and FEINSTEIN. The substitute amendment proposed by Senator FEINSTEIN and me improves the bill while retaining all of its key features. 
   After this measure becomes law, Internet commerce in computer discs, files, and templates designed for use in the production of false identification documents will be illegal. The bill will also outlaw the practice of producing false identification containing easily removable disclaimers, a method currently used to avoid prosecution. Finally, the legislation will establish a coordinating committee to concentrate resources of several federal agencies on investigating and prosecuting the creation of false identification. I authored this legislation after the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, held hearings on a disturbing new trend--the use of the Internet to manufacture and market counterfeit identification documents and credentials. Our hearing and investigation revealed the widespread availability on the Internet of a variety of fake identification documents and computer templates that allow individuals to manufacture authentic-looking IDs in the seclusion of their own homes. The Internet False Identification Prevention Act of 2000 will strengthen current law to prevent the distribution of false identification documents over the Internet and make it easier to prosecute this criminal activity. 
   Mr. President, the high quality of the counterfeit identification documents that can be obtained through the Internet is astounding. With little difficulty, my staff was able to use Internet materials to manufacture convincing IDs that would allow me to pass as a member of our Armed Forces, a reporter, a student at Boston University, or a licensed driver in Florida, Michigan, or Wyoming, to name just a few of the identities I could assume. For instance, using the Internet my staff created a counterfeit Connecticut driver's license that is virtually identical to an authentic license issued by the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles. Just like the real Connecticut license, this fake with my picture includes a signature written over the picture and an adjacent ``shadow picture'' of the license holder. The State of Connecticut added both of these sophisticated security features to the license in order to reduce counterfeiting. Unfortunately, some websites offer to sell fake IDs complete with State seals, holograms, and bar codes to replicate a license virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. Thus, technology now allows website operators to copy authentic identification documents with an extraordinary level  of sophistication and then mass produce those fraudulent documents for their customers. The websites investigated by the subcommittee offer a vast and varied product line, ranging from driver's licenses to military identification cards to federal agency credentials, including those of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Other sites offer to produce Social Security cards, birth certificates, diplomas, and press credentials. 
   Testimony before the subcommittee demonstrated that the availability of false identification documents from the Internet is a growing problem. Special Agent David Myers, Identification Fraud Coordinator of the State of Florida's Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, testified that 2 years ago only 1 percent of false identification documents came from the Internet. Last year, he testified, a little less than 5 percent came from the Internet. Now he estimates that about 30 percent of the false identification 
   documents he seizes comes from the Internet. He predicts that by next year his unit will find at least 60 to 70 percent of the false identification documents they seize will come from the Internet. The General Accounting Office (GAO) and the FBI have both confirmed the findings of the subcommittee's investigation. Earlier this year the GAO used counterfeit credentials and badges, readily available for purchase on the Internet, to breach the security at 19 federal buildings and two commercial airports. GAO's findings demonstrate that, in addition to the poor security measures at federal facilities, the Internet and computer technology allow nearly anyone to create convincing identification cards and credentials. The FBI has also focused on the potential for misuse of official identification, and recently executed search warrants at the homes of several individuals who had been selling federal law enforcement badges over the Internet. 
   In response to these findings, the House has passed legislation that will complement the provisions in the bill we currently have under consideration. H.R. 4827, the Enhanced Federal Security Act of 2000, was introduced by Congressman STEVE HORN, and would make it a crime to enter federal property under false pretenses or for an unauthorized individual to traffic in genuine or counterfeit police badges. The House bill, supported by Congressman MCCOLLUM, chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, provides an additional measure to curb the use of false identification, and I hope that the Senate will approve it along with S. 2924. 
   Mr. President, the Internet is a revolutionary tool of commerce and communication that benefits us all. But many of the Internet's greatest attributes also further its use for criminal purposes. While the manufacture of false identification documents by criminals is nothing new, the Internet allows those specializing in the sale of counterfeit identification to reach a broader market of potential buyers than they ever could by standing on a street corner in a shady part of town. They can sell their products with virtual anonymity through the use of e-mail services and free Web hosting services, and by providing false information when registering their domain names. Similarly, the Internet allows criminals to obtain fake IDs in the privacy of their own homes, substantially diminishing the risk of apprehension that attends purchasing counterfeit documents on the street. Because this is a relatively new phenomenon, there are no good data on the size of the false identification industry or the growth it has experienced as a result of the Internet. The subcommittee's investigation, however, found that some Web site operators apparently have made hundreds of thousands of dollars through the sale of phony identification documents. One website operator that we investigated told a state law enforcement official that he sold approximately 1,000 fake IDs every month and generated about $600,000 in annual sales. 
   Identity theft is a growing problem that these Internet sites encourage. Recent testimony by the Federal Trade Commission noted that the number of calls to their ID theft hotline had doubled between March and July of this year, that the agency was receiving between 800 and 850 calls a week, and that their phone counselors had handled more than 20,000 calls in an 8-month period earlier this year. Fake IDs, however, facilitate a broader array of criminal conduct. The subcommittee's investigation found that some Internet sites were used to obtain counterfeit identification documents for the purpose of committing other crimes, ranging from very serious offenses such as bank fraud to the more common problem of underage teenagers buying alcohol or gaining access to bars. The legislation under consideration today is designed to address the problem of counterfeit identification documents in several ways. The central features of the bill are provisions that modernize existing law to address the widespread availability of false identification documents on the Internet. 
   First, the legislation strengthens federal law against false identification to ensure that it is suited to the Internet age and the technology associated 
   with it. The primary law prohibiting the use and distribution of false identification documents was enacted in 1982. Advances in computer technology and the use of the Internet may have rendered the law inadequate to encompass the technology of the present day. This bill will clarify that current law prohibits the sale or distribution of false identification documents through computer files and templates, which our investigation found are the vehicles of choice for manufacturing fake IDs in the Internet age. 
   Second, the legislation will make it easier to prosecute those criminals who manufacturer, distribute or sell counterfeit identification documents by ending the practice of using easily removable disclaimers as part of an attempt to shield the illegal conduct from prosecution through a bogus claim of ``novelty.'' No longer will it be acceptable to provide computer templates of government-issued identification containing an easily removable layer saying it is not a government document. 
   For instance, the subcommittee staff purchased a fake Oklahoma driver's license as part of an undercover operation conducted during our investigation. The fake license appears to bear the disclaimer, ``Not a Government Document,'' which is required by federal law. We found, however, that with one simple snip of the scissors, the fake ID could be removed from his laminated pouch, effectively discarding the disclaimer. It will no longer be acceptable under my bill to sell a false identification document in this fashion. 
   Finally, my legislation seeks to encourage more aggressive enforcement by dedicating investigative and prosecutorial resources to this emerging problem. The bill establishes a multi-agency coordinating committee that will concentrate the investigative and prosecutorial resources of several agencies with responsibility for enforcing laws that criminalize the manufacture, sale, and distribution of counterfeit identification documents. While the new provisions are intended to cover any individual or entity using a computer disc, file, template, or the Internet to produce, transfer or make available false identification documents or document-making implements, the substitute bill makes clear that the new offense does not cover companies providing interactive computer services, such as Internet service providers, communications facilities, or electronic mail services, who are innocent conduits of false identification documents. Just as the counterfeiting laws do not cover an unknowing provider of a device or service used to manufacture or transmit counterfeit money, the provisions in this legislation are not meant to apply to unknowing parties whose devices or services are used in the production or transfer of false identification documents. This exception is inapplicable, however, and ordinary common law doctrines of criminal lability will apply in cases of conspiracy between the interactive computer service and the user; knowledge of and specific intent of an officer, director, partner or controlling shareholder that the server or system be used for this criminal purposes; or when the material available through a service consists primarily of material that is covered by the new offense in this legislation. 
   This bill is one in a line of bills that have been considered by Congress in recent years that address the issue of  service provider liability relevant to the unlawful conduct of third parties. These have ranged from bills dealing with the liability of service providers in cases of defamation suits, to copyright infringement actions, to criminal prosecutions for online drug trafficking, Internet gambling, and in this case, online distribution of false identification document-making implements. Through these bills, Congress has had to consider the complexities of the particular area of law at hand, the application of common law doctrines, such as respondant superior and theories of contributory and vicarious liability, and the nature of liability with respect to specific violations in both civil and criminal contexts. In short, I believe that my bill, while addressing a number of these issues, does not necessarily set a standard for Congress to follow when considering the issue of service provider liability in future bills, in future contexts. 
   Mr. President, our investigation established that federal law enforcement officials have failed to devote the necessary resources and attention to this serious problem. By striking at the purveyors of false identification materials, I believe we can reduce the end-use crime that often depends upon the availability of counterfeit identification. For instance, the convicted felon who testified at the subcommittee's hearing said that he would not have been able to commit bank fraud had he not been able to easily and quickly obtain high quality, fraudulent identification documents over the Internet. I am confident that, if federal law enforcement officials prosecute the most blatant violators of the law, the false ID industry on the Internet will wither in short order. By strengthening the law and by focusing our prosecution efforts, I believe that we can curb the widespread availability of false identification documents that the Internet encourages. The Director of the United States Secret Services testified at our hearing that the use of fraudulent identification documents and credentials almost always accompanies the serious financial crimes that they investigate. Thus, I believe that a stronger law against making false identification documents will deter criminal activity in other areas as well. I urge my colleagues to support S. 2924. 
   I ask unanimous consent to have print in the RECORD a brief section-by-section summary of the substitute for S. 2924.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on November 11th, people across the United States will celebrate Veterans' Day--a day in which we pause to remember and to honor the brave men and women who served their country in our armed forces. 
   November 11th also marks the anniversary of the armistice that ended World War I, a conflict that promised to be the ``war to end all wars.'' Unfortunately, the peace that followed World War I was short-lived. The world soon was plunged into the cauldron of World War II, followed by the terror of the Cold War--played out on so many fronts, most tragically in Korea and Vietnam. Today we face continued threats to our liberty, with outlaw leaders of rogue states waging extremist campaigns against freedom and democracy, as well as the persistent danger of terrorist attacks--which we have seen all too recently with the USS Cole tragedy. 
   Indeed, the world is still a dangerous place, and World War I's promise of a lasting, worldwide peace has yet to be realized. The conflicts of the last century remind us that freedom constantly requires great sacrifices and often the lives of those who defend it. It is these patriots, the men and women of our armed forces, who answered the call of service and protected the freedoms we cherish. Although we can never fully repay the debt we owe these courageous Americans, we can and must continue to recognize the price they paid. 
   This year, Veterans' Day falls just four days after Election Day. I find this particularly fitting, as there is no greater symbol of American liberty than our ability to participate in free and fair elections. Above all else, we owe this freedom to our veterans. Time and again, our democracy has been preserved by these brave men and women. 
   This Veterans' Day marks another special occasion; the groundbreaking ceremony for the World War II Memorial, to be located on the National Mall in our nation's capital. This monument will stand in recognition of a generation of Americans who served their country so ably in resisting the forces of Nazism and oppression. This was a defining moment in our nation's history, and one to which almost every American feels some connection. My own father is a World War II veteran, and Purple Heart recipient. 
   Unlike my father, however, many Americans did not return home from this noble campaign. They were the duty-bound sons and daughters of our nation, who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country and for freedom. In the words of President LINCOLN, they ``gave the last full measure of devotion,'' and we must uphold the memory of their heroism with respect, with reverence, and with our heartfelt admiration. 
   This is the purpose of Veterans' Day. Although mere words do not pay adequate tribute to the sacrifices our veterans have laid upon the altar of freedom, the knowledge of their noble deeds lives in the hearts and minds of those who are free--and shall not be forgotten.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is considering S. 2528, the Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act of 2000, which I introduced with my friend from Wisconsin, Senator Russ FEINGOLD. Our bill is intended to improve access to automated external defibrillators in small communities and rural areas to boost the survival rates of individuals in those communities who suffer cardiac arrest. Joining us as cosponsors of the bill are Senators JEFFORDS, MURRAY, ABRAHAM, WELLSTONE, HUTCHINSON, DORGAN, GRAMS, BINGAMAN, CHAFEE, ENZI, SNOWE, GRASSLEY, BIDEN, LEAHY, ROBB, KERRY,and DURBIN. I particularly want to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Senator JEFFORDS, for all of his assistance in helping us to expedite action on this important measure. 
   Heart disease is the leading cause of death both in the state of Maine and in the United States. According to the American Heart Association, an estimated 250,000 Americans die each year from cardiac arrest. Many of these deaths could be prevented if automated external defibrillators--or AEDs--were more accessible. AEDs are computerized devices that can shock a heart back into normal rhythm and restore life to a cardiac arrest victim. They must, however, be used promptly. For every minute that passes before a victim's normal heart rhythm is restored, his or her chance of survival falls by as much as 10 percent. 
   We have a number of new and improved technologies in our arsenal of weapons to fight heart disease, including a new generation of small, easy-to-use AEDs that can strengthen the chain of survival for cardiac arrest victims. These new devices make it possible for not only emergency medical personnel, but also trained lay rescuers, to deliver defibrillation safely and effectively. The new AEDs are safe, effective, lightweight, low maintenance, and relatively inexpensive. Moreover, they are specifically designed so that they can be used by non-medical personnel such as police, fire fighters, security guards and other lay rescuers, providing they have been properly trained. According to the American Heart Association, making AEDs standard equipment in police cars, fire trucks, ambulances and other emergency vehicles and getting these devices into more public places could save more than 50,000 lives a year. 
   Last December, the Bangor Mall installed an AED that is one of the first of these devices in Maine to be placed in a public setting outside the direct control of emergency medical personnel and hospital staff. Both the AED and an oxygen tank are kept inside a customer service booth, which is in an area of the mall where there is a high concentration of traffic and where heart emergencies might occur. Mall personnel have also received special training and, during mall hours, there is always at least one person who has been certified in both CPR and defibrillator use. 
   For at least one Bangor woman, this has been a lifesaver. On January 12th, just weeks after the AED was installed, two shoppers at the Mall collapsed in a single day. One was given oxygen and quickly revived. But the other shopper was unconscious and had stopped breathing. The trained mall staff--Maintenance Supervisor Larry Lee, Security Chief Dusty Rhodes, and General Manager Roy Daigle-- were only able to detect a faint pulse. They quickly commenced CPR and attached the AED. 
   It is important to note that defibrillation is intended to supplement, not replace standard CPR. These devices, which are almost completely automated, run frequent self-diagnostics and will not allow the administration of shock unless the victim's recorded 
   heart pattern requires it. When the AED is attached, it automatically analyzes the victim's vital signs. One of two commands will then be voiced and displayed by the unit: ``Shock advised--charging''; or ``Shock not advised--continue CPR.'' 
   In the Bangor Mall case, the shock was not advised, so CPR was continued until the emergency medical personnel arrived. The EMT's told Mr. Daigle, the General Manager of the mall, that the woman--who had had a heart attack and subsequently required triple by-pass surgery--simply would not have survived if they had not been so prepared. As Mr. Daigle observed, ``Twelve to fifteen minutes is just too long to wait for the emergency services to arrive.'' 
   Cities across America have begun to recognize the value of fast access to AEDs and are making them available to emergency responders. In many small and rural communities, however, limited budgets and the fact that so many rely on volunteer organizations for emergency services can make acquisition and appropriate training in the use of these life-saving devices problematic. 
   The legislation we are considering today is intended to increase access to AEDs and trained local responders for smaller towns and rural areas in Maine and elsewhere where those first on the scene may not be paramedics or others who would normally have AEDs. Our bill provides $25 million over three years to be given as grants to community partnerships consisting of local emergency responders, police and fire departments, hospitals, and other community organizations. This money could then be used to help purchase AEDs and train potential responders in their use, as well as in basic CPR and first aid. 
   The Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act has been endorsed by both the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross as a means of expanding access to these lifesaving devices across rural America, and I urge all of our colleagues to join us in supporting this important measure.

   Ms. COLLINS. I want to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee for his invaluable help in securing funding for vital, time-sensitive, on-the-ground Atlantic salmon conservation and restoration programs in Maine on an emergency basis. Due to your efforts, $5.0 million in emergency appropriations were included in the Interior Appropriations conference report for this purpose. It is critical that these funds be on the ground this year in order to demonstrate a federal financial commitment to salmon in my State, and that a listing under the Endangered Species Act is not necessary to conserve and restore Maine's Atlantic salmon.

   Ms. COLLINS. The emergency appropriation included in the Interior Appropriations conference report will make a substantial contribution to salmon conservation and restoration efforts in the State. The funds will be made available to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (or ``NFWF''), which has made a commitment to me to allocate the monies to worthwhile projects as soon as possible. The conference report provides $5.0 million to NFWF, of which $2.0 million will be made available to the Atlantic Salmon Commission and $500,000 will be made available to the National Academy of Sciences. The remaining $2.5 million will be administered by NFWF to carry out a grant program that will fund on-the-ground projects to further Atlantic salmon conservation or restoration efforts in coordination with the State of Maine and the Maine Atlantic Salmon Conservation Plan. 
   The conference report contains language indicating that funds administered by NFWF will be subject to cost sharing. Is it your understanding, Mr. Chairman, that this language means the $2.5 million administered by NFWF to carry out a grant program must be matched, in the aggregate, by at least $2.5 million in non-federal funds?

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act, legislation intended to stimulate private investment in the entrepreneurs who drive our economy. I am very pleased to be joined today by my good friend, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. CLELAND, and by the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, in introducing this important legislation. Senators CLELAND and ROTH both understand the importance of small businesses to our economy and have been tireless advocates on their behalf. 
   The bill we are introducing today will encourage long-term investment in small and emerging businesses by rewarding individuals who risk investment in such firms. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, small firms account for three-quarters of the Nation's employment growth and almost all of our net new jobs. 
   Small businesses employ more than 50 percent of all private workers, provide 51 percent of our private sector output, and are responsible for a disproportionate share of innovations. Moreover, small businesses are avenues of opportunity for women and minorities, younger and older workers, and those making the transition from welfare to work. 
   At the same time, small businesses face unique financing challenges. I know this from my experience serving as the New England Administrator for the Small Business Administration. There are so many small entrepreneurs who have a wonderful idea for an innovative product but simply have great difficulty in getting the financing they need to get that idea off the ground. 
   Simply put, entrepreneurs need access to more capital to start and expand their businesses. Small businesses that cannot deliver ``dot-com'' rates of return are particularly having trouble raising needed funds. As the Small Business Administration noted earlier this year, ``Adequate financing for rapidly growing firms will be America's greatest economic policy challenge of the new century.'' 
   A recent report by the National Commission on Entrepreneurship presented findings of 18 focus groups with more than 250 entrepreneurs from across the country. According to the report, these entrepreneurs were ``nearly unanimous in identifying difficulties in obtaining seed capital investments.'' That is the early stage financing that helps get a business off the ground. 
   Moreover, minority-owned small businesses and research-intensive businesses that may take many years to develop a product find raising sufficient capital to be particularly difficult. Consider that it takes, on average, 14 years for a biotechnology company to develop a new pharmaceutical. This promising and growing sector of our economy requires patient capital--and lots of it.  
   Cheryl Timberlake, the executive director of the Biotechnology Association in my State, recently wrote to endorse the legislation I am introducing today and to reinforce the need to stimulate more investment in biotech firms. Cheryl wrote that:  
   Many of the Maine biotech companies are still in the research stage and rely on venture capital to fund their innovative drug development. Most research-stage biotech companies do not yet have products on the market. Without a source of revenue, there are no profits to fund their business. These companies are dependent on private investors for most or all of their financial support. [Therefore, the Biotechnology Association of Maine] believes that the changes in ..... the Internal Revenue Code [such as you propose] will enable more small business investment in our member companies.  
   I think Cheryl summed up the problem well in Maine. We have a growing and diverse biotechnology sector, but they are having difficulty in finding the kind of financial support that they need to grow. 
   I also received recently a letter of support from the executive director of the National Commission on Entrepreneurship. He noted that startup companies are ``struggling to find access to equity investments [particularly in the range] between $100,000 and $3 million.'' 
   His letter continues:  
   So the question becomes: how can we motivate more individuals with investment capital, who may not have previous experience with entrepreneurial companies, to invest in such companies at the ``seed'' or ``early-stage'' level? The Encouraging investment in Small Business Act, by increasing the incentives provided by Section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code, may well provide one important part of the answer to this question.  
   Similarly, the National Federation of Independent Business, our Nation's largest small business group, has also written in support of the legislation that the Senator from Georgia and I are introducing today. 
   Dan Danner wrote:  
   Unfortunately, while our nation's current prosperity has brought unprecedented funds to certain sectors of our economy, small business entrepreneurs still lack access to valuable capital needed to start and expand their businesses.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if we want to remain the world's most entrepreneurial country, which is certainly the strength of this Nation, where small businesses generate the ideas and create the jobs that fuel our economy, we must continue to create an environment that nurtures and supports entrepreneurs. Our bill would help to create such an environment, not by establishing a new Federal program or adding a complicated new section to our Tax Code but, rather, by simplifying and improving a provision that is already there. 
   By way of background, section 1202 was added to the Internal Revenue Code in 1993 in order to encourage investment in small business. The bill that created this section was introduced by senator Dale Bumpers and enjoyed widespread bipartisan support. Similarly, the legislation we introduce today will improve upon the 1993 legislation. 
   In brief, section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code permits noncorporate taxpayers to exclude from gross income 50 percent of the gain from the sale or exchange of qualified small business stock, known as QSB stock, held for more than 5 years. The concept is a sound one. In practice, however, this section has proven to be cumbersome to use and less advantageous than originally intended. 
   As an article in the December 1998 edition of the Tax Adviser noted:  
   Section 1202 places numerous and complex requirements on both the qualified small business and the shareholder.  
   The article went on to note that the provision ``is no longer the deal it seemed to be.'' 
   The Encouraging investment in Small Business Act would amend section 1202 to eliminate unnecessary complexity and to make it a more robust engine of capital formation for small business. As it stands now, that engine needs some fine-tuning. Given the reductions in capital gains rates subsequent to section 1202's enactment and the fact that more and more taxpayers are now subject to the alternative minimum tax, section 1202 is no longer a viable option in many circumstances. Moreover, its impact will continue to be diluted by a scheduled decrease in long-term capital gains rates applicable to most stock purchased after the year 2000, as well as the probability that still more taxpayers will be subject to the AMT. 
   The Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act makes a number of improvements to this section of the code. First, the bill increases the amount of qualified small business stock gain that an individual can exclude from gross income from 50 percent to 75 percent. Second, the legislation strikes the section of the Tax Code that makes a portion of the section 1202 exclusion a preference item under the alternative minimum tax. These two changes rejuvenate the section and make it the potent generator of small business capital that it was intended to be. 
   Currently, an individual who invested in QSB stock, sold it, and found her or himself subject to the AMT, would face an effective capital gains rate of 19.9 percent or just .1 percent less than the existing rate on long-term capital gains. When we consider that the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT is predicted to triple over the next 5 years, it becomes crystal clear that a fix is needed now. The legislation would take additional steps to make section 1202 more attractive to small businesses and investors. 
   The legislation may sound complicated and, indeed, revising 
   tax law is always a challenge, but the bottom line is that our legislation makes a number of common sense changes that are all designed to encourage more investment in small businesses, the engine of our economy. 
   These changes have been endorsed by the leading small business organizations. They are changes recommended by a recent Securities and Exchange Commission forum on small business capital formation, and they are the changes needed to accommodate and, indeed, to foster the capital-raising needs of small business, the foundation of our national economy. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues, the chair and ranking member of the Public Health Subcommittee of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, for all of their efforts in bringing the Children's Health Act of 2000 to the Senate floor. This omnibus bill is the result of months of bipartisan collaboration and discussion between Members of both the House and the Senate in an effort to address important children's health issues in this Congress. 
   As the co-chair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I am particularly pleased that the Pediatric Diabetes Research and Prevention Act, which I introduced earlier this year with Senators BREAUX, ABRAHAM, CRAIG, and BUNNING, has been included in this bill. Our legislation--which was also cosponsored by Senators GRASSLEY,  BINGAMAN, CHAFEE, ROTH, HOLLINGS, and SCHUMER--will help us to reduce the tremendous toll that diabetes takes on our nation's children and young people, and I want to thank my colleagues for including it in the omnibus bill. 
   As noted in the recent cover story in Newsweek, diabetes is a devastating, lifelong condition that affects people of every age, race, and nationality. Sixteen million Americans suffer from diabetes and about 800,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. It is one of our nation's most costly diseases in both human and economic terms. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, blindness in adults, and amputations not related to injury. It is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke and shortens life expectancy up to 15 years. Moreover, diabetes costs our nation more than $105 billion a year in health-related expenditures. More than one out of every ten health care dollars and about one out of four Medicare dollars are spent on people with diabetes. 
   Unfortunately, there currently is no method to prevent or cure diabetes and available treatments have only limited success in controlling its devastating consequences. The burden of diabetes is particularly heavy for children and young adults with type I, also known as juvenile diabetes. Juvenile diabetes is the second most common chronic disease affecting children. Moreover, it is one that they never outgrow. 
   As the founder of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I have met many children with diabetes who face a daily struggle to keep their blood glucose levels under control: kids like nine-year-old Nathan Reynolds, an active young boy from North Yarmouth, who was Maine's delegate to the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation's Children's Congress last year. Nathan was diagnosed with diabetes in December of 1997, which forced him to change both his life and his family's life. He has learned how to take his blood--something his four-year-old brother reminds him to do before every meal--check his blood sugar level, and give himself an insulin shot on his own, sometimes with the help of his parents or his school nurse. Nathan told me that his greatest wish was that, just once, he could take a ``day off'' from his diabetes. 
   The sad fact is that children like Nathan with diabetes can never take a day off from their disease. There is no holiday from dealing with their diabetes. They face a lifetime of multiple daily finger pricks to check their blood sugar levels and daily insulin shots. Moreover, insulin is not a cure for diabetes, and it does not prevent the onset of serious complications. As a consequence, children like Nathan also face the possibility of lifelong disabling complications, such as kidney failure and blindness. 
   Reducing the health and human burden of diabetes and its enormous economic impact depends upon identifying the factors responsible for the disease and developing new methods for prevention, better treatment, and ultimately a cure. The provisions of the Pediatric Diabetes Research and Prevention Act that have been included in the Children's Health Act of 2000 will do just that. 
   One of the most important actions we can take is to establish a type I diabetes monitoring system. Currently there is no way to track the incidence of type I diabetes across the country. As a consequence, the estimates for the number of people with type I diabetes from the American Diabetes Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health vary enormously from 123,000 to over 1.5 million, a 13-fold variation. One of the best ways to define the prevalence and incidence of a disease, as well as to characterize and study populations, is to establish a national database specific to that disease, which our legislation would do. 
   Obesity and inadequate physical activity--both major problems in the United States today--are important risk factors for type 2, or non-insulin dependent diabetes. Unfortunately, obesity is a significant and growing problem among children in the United States, which has led to a disturbing increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes among young people. This is particularly alarming since type 2 diabetes has long been considered an ``adult'' disease. Nearly all of the documented cases of type 2 diabetes in young people have occurred in obese children, who are also at increased risk for the complications associated with the disease. Moreover, these complications will likely develop at an earlier age than if these children had developed type 2 diabetes as adults. Our legislation therefore calls for the implemention of a national public health effort to address the increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes in children and young people. 
   In addition, the legislation calls for long-term studies of persons with type 1 diabetes at the National Institutes of Health where these individuals will be followed for 10 years or more. This long-term analysis of type 1 diabetes will provide an invaluable basis for the investigation and identification of the causes and characteristics of diabetes and its complications and it will also help to identify a potential study population for clinical trials. The legislation also directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to support regional clinical research centers for the prevention, detection, treatment and cure of type 1 diabetes. And finally, the legislation directs the Secretary of HHS to provide for a national program to prevent type 1 diabetes, including efforts to develop a vaccine. 
   Mr. President, these provisions will help us to better understand and ultimately conquer diabetes, which has had such a devastating impact on millions of American children and their families. It is therefore most appropriate that they be included in the Children's Health Act of 2000, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Senate Republicans are committed to enacting legislation to preserve, strengthen, and save Medicare for current and future generations. It is also critical that Congress take action this year to address some of the unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which has been exacerbated by a host of ill-conceived regulatory requirements imposed by the Clinton administration. The combination of regulatory overkill and budget cuts is jeopardizing access to critical home health care services for millions of our Nation's seniors. 
   If one thinks about it, health care has really come full circle. Patients are spending less time in the hospital, more and more procedures are being done on an outpatient basis, and recovery and care for patients with chronic diseases and conditions increasingly takes place at home. Moreover, the number of older Americans who are chronically ill or disabled in some way continues to grow each year. 
   As a consequence, home health care has been an increasingly important part of our health care system, and I know the Senator from Kansas has been a very strong supporter of ensuring that these vital services are provided for our senior citizens. The kind of highly skilled and often technically complex services our Nation's home health care agencies provide have enabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable older citizens to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and receive care right where they want to be--in the comfort and security of their own homes. 
   In 1996, however, home health care was the fastest growing component of Medicare spending. This understandably prompted 
   consideration of some changes as part of the Balanced Budget Act that were intended to slow the growth in spending to make the program more cost-effective and efficient.

   Ms. COLLINS. The Senator, as always, is entirely correct. I know how concerned he has been that inadequate reimbursements under Medicare, plus regulatory overkill by HCFA, are really jeopardizing the provision of care in our rural hospitals and our home health care agencies. 
   In fact, we know the Balanced Budget Act is already producing--or expected to produce--four times the savings that we intended when the 1997 Balanced Budget Act was passed. Moreover--and I know the Senator from Kansas shares my deep concern about this--looming on the horizon, believe it or not, is an additional 15-percent cutback in home health care reimbursements. That will put our already struggling home health agencies at risk. I know the Senator from Kansas shares my belief that it would, if allowed to go into effect, seriously jeopardize access to care for millions of our Nation's seniors. 
   The effects of these home health care cuts have been particularly devastating to the State of Maine. In Maine, I would inform my colleague from Kansas, nearly 7,500 Maine seniors have lost access to home health care due to the cutbacks and the regulatory overkill by HCFA. 
   Those 7,500 seniors did not get well. That is not why they lost their access to home health care. In fact, what has happened is some of them have been forced prematurely into nursing homes or they are at risk of increased hospitalization, which ironically costs the Medicare trust fund more money than if they were still receiving home health care. Some of them--and this is most tragic of all--are going without care altogether. 
   Cuts of this magnitude, particularly for the home health agencies in your section of the country and mine, which were historically low cost to begin with, cannot be sustained without ultimately adversely affecting patient care.

   Ms. COLLINS. The Senator has, as always, summarized the situation exactly right. The real losers are the sickest seniors because what is happening is, because they are more expensive to treat, our home health agencies are turning away some of the more expensive patients because they simply cannot afford to provide them care. 
   I met recently with a group of very dedicated and highly skilled, compassionate home health nurses from the Visiting Nurse Service in Saco, ME. That is southern Maine's largest 
   independent, not-for-profit home health agency. It performs more than 250,000 home visits per year. 
   During my discussions with these nurses, I heard absolutely hard-breaking stories of how recent cutbacks and regulatory restrictions have affected both the quality and the availability of home health services. 
   Let me tell my colleague of just one example the nurses related to me. Consider this case. It involves an elderly Maine woman who suffered from advanced Alzheimer's disease, pneumonia, and hypertension, among many other illnesses. She was bedbound, verbally nonresponsive, and had a series of serious health issues, including serious infections. 
   This woman had been receiving home health care for approximately 2 years, and that had allowed her condition to stabilize through the care and coordination of a skilled nurse. Unfortunately, the care provided to this patient abruptly came to an end when HCFA'S intermediary sent out a notice denying further home health care for this woman. 
   That is an example of the kinds of regulatory problems that the Senator was talking about. 
   Let's look at what happened in this case. 
   The fact is, it produced a tragedy. Less than 3 months later, this woman died. She died as a result of a wound on her foot that went untreated. Undoubtedly, the home health nurse would have caught that problem before it got out of control. 
   That is just one of the heart-wrenching stories that I have heard not only during that visit but in discussions with patients and health care providers throughout my State.

   Ms. COLLINS. The Senator is entirely correct. I could not agree with his point more. 
   What I heard from the home health nurses is not only do all these excessive regulatory requirements and paperwork cost a lot of money to the agency, but they detract from the time that otherwise would be spent caring for patients. Instead of focusing on patients, they have to complete paperwork. Indeed, at that visit in Saco, ME, that I mentioned, the nurses--to illustrate the OASIS paperwork which the distinguished Senator from Kansas has  just talked about--put it up all over the room. It covered the walls of the entire room. That was just one OASIS questionnaire. 
   Last year, I chaired a subcommittee hearing of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. We heard about the problems that excessive regulation was imposing. We heard about the cash-flow problems that agencies across the country are experiencing. 
   One nurse from Maine, who runs a home health agency, terms HCFA's approach as being one of ``implement and suspend.'' In other words, HCFA requires these agencies to go through all these regulatory hoops to fill out all this paperwork and then says: Never mind. This really isn't what we meant. 
   Meanwhile, tremendous cost and energy has gone into complying with these burdensome regulations.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this is one of the problems. The Senator from Kansas has put his finger right on it. OASIS collects information not only about the patient's medical condition or history, but about living arrangements, medications, sensory status--I am not even sure what that means--and emotional status as well. That raises a host of problems.

   Ms. COLLINS. That has been the experience of the nurses in Maine, that the patients believe this is unnecessarily intrusive. We are not talking about patients, in these cases, who are receiving home health because of emotional problems. Obviously, those questions might be appropriate in some cases, but they are clearly not in these cases. 
   What the nurses explained to me is that the patients say: What does this have to do with what you are treating me for? The nurses expressed concern that this ``exercise of Olympian endurance'' inevitably elicits a negative response from their patients. That is a problem because that patient-nurse relationship is very important. It is a relationship that respects the confidentiality and the privacy of patients, or it should. 
   Unfortunately, the OASIS information mandated by HCFA immediately erects a barrier that is often difficult to overcome. There is one example I want to share with my colleague from Kansas, one 76-year-old Medicare patient about whom I was told was being treated for a wound to his left shoulder. The wound care and teaching provided by the home health nurse took approximately 30 minutes. Completing the OASIS form took an hour and a half. The patient understandably asked: What does all this have to do with my shoulder? A very common response.

   Ms. COLLINS. As the Senator's rhetorical question implies, these are not necessary. The fact is that it now appears the savings goals set for home health have not only been met but far exceeded. 
   According to CBO, spending for home health care fell by 35 percent in 1999, and CBO cites the larger-than-anticipated drop in the use of home health services as the primary reason that total Medicare spending actually dropped, overall Medicare spending, by 1 percent last year. The CBO now projects that the post Balanced Budget Act reductions in home health care will be approximately $69 billion. That is over four times the $16 billion Congress expected to save. It is a clear indication that the cutbacks have been far deeper and far more wide reaching than Congress ever intended.

   Ms. COLLINS. A further 15-percent cut would be devastating. It would sound the death knell for those low-cost, nonprofit agencies in our States, which are currently struggling to hang on. It would further reduce our seniors' access to critical home care services. As we have discussed, we don't need to do it. We already have more than achieved the savings goals that were put forth in 1997.

The Senator from Kansas has been a strong supporter along with my colleagues, Senators BOND and ASHCROFT from Missouri, as well as many colleagues, in cosponsoring legislation introduced to eliminate the automatic 15-percent reduction in Medicare payments that would otherwise occur. It would provide a measure of financial relief for those home health agencies that already are cost-efficient and doing a good job. That is what we need to do--to pass that legislation before we adjourn.

It has 55 Senate cosponsors, including 32 Republicans and 23 Democrats, showing that this is a nationwide problem. It also has strong backing of many consumer and patient groups, including the American Diabetes Association, American Nurses Association, National Council on Aging, and the American Hospital Association. All of these groups have come together because they know that an additional 15-percent cutback would be absolutely devastating to American seniors and people with disabilities. 
   So if we allow this to go into effect, any of our other efforts to strengthen Medicare and home health, to help improve that benefit will really be meaningless.

   I also want to recognize that there have been many other Senators who have been involved in this fight. I am going to put a list of the cosponsors to the legislation that I have introduced into the RECORD.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, health care has come full circle. Patients are spending less time in the hospital. More and more procedures are being done on an outpatient basis, and recovery and care for patients with chronic diseases and conditions has increasingly been taking place in the home. Moreover, the number of older Americans who are chronically ill or disabled in some way continues to grow each year. Concerns about how to care for these individuals will only multiply as our population ages and is at greater risk of chronic disease and disability. 
   As a consequence, home health has become an increasingly important part of our health care system. The kinds of highly skilled--and often technically complex--services that our nation's home health agencies provide have enabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable older persons to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just where they want to be--in the comfort and security of their own homes. 
   By the late 1990s, home health was the fastest growing component of Medicare spending. The program grew at an average annual rate of more than 25 percent from 1990 to 1997. The number of home health beneficiaries more than doubled, and Medicare home health spending soared from $2.5 billion in 1989 to $17.8 billion in 1997. 
   This rapid growth in home health spending understandably prompted the Congress and the Administration, as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, to initiate changes that were intended to slow this growth in spending and make the program more cost-effective and efficient. These measures, however, have unfortunately produced cuts in home health spending far beyond what Congress intended. Home health spending dropped to $9.7 billion in FY 1999--just about half the 1997 amount. And on the horizon is an additional 15 percent cut that would put our already struggling home health agencies at risk and would seriously jeopardize access to critical home health services for millions of our nation's seniors. 
   Last year, I chaired a hearing of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations where we heard about the financial distress and cash-flow problems that home health agencies across the country are experiencing. Indeed, over 2,500 agencies, about one-quarter of all home health agencies nationwide, have either closed or stopped serving Medicare patients. Others have laid off staff or declined to accept new patients with more serious health problems. Moreover, the financial problems of home health agencies have been exacerbated by a number of burdensome new regulatory requirements imposed by the Health Care Financing Administration. 
   One witness, who is a CEO of a visiting nurse service in Saco, ME, termed HCFA's regulatory policy as that of being ``implement and suspend.'' No longer had the agency spent all this money and time and effort in complying with a new regulatory requirement, then the Federal Government decided: never mind; we really didn't mean it; we weren't ready to implement this. 
   We also heard numerous complaints about OASIS, a system of data collection containing data on the physical, mental, and functional status of patients receiving care from home health agencies. Not only has this been a very expensive and burdensome paperwork process, but the process of collecting information invades the personal privacy of many patients, which they understandably are concerned about. 
   I recently met with home health nurses in southern Maine and I heard complaints about the administrative burdens and paperwork requirements associated with OASIS and its effect on patient care. I also heard what the real impact of the budget cutbacks has meant for many of the people in the State of Maine. 
   I call attention to a chart that shows the impact that we are already experiencing in the State of Maine. As shown in the chart, nearly 7,500 Maine citizens have lost access to home health services altogether. What has happened to those 7,500 senior citizens? Believe me, I know from my discussions with dedicated nurses who were providing home health services to them, it is not that they have recovered; it is not that they have gotten well. Rather, the loss of home health services has forced many of them into nursing homes prematurely or has put them at risk of increased hospitalization. 
   Ironically, the Medicare trust fund pays far more for nursing home care or for hospitalization than it would continuing to provide home health care services to these individuals. The chart shows the financial burden in Maine in a year's time has suffered a 26-percent decrease in reimbursements for a 30-percent cut in visits. Again, it is our most vulnerable, frail, ill, elderly citizens who are bearing the brunt of these cutbacks. 
   I heard very sad stories about the impact. Consider the case of one elderly woman who suffered from advanced Alzheimer's disease, pneumonia, and hypertension, among other illnesses. She was bed bound, verbally nonresponsive, and had a number of other serious health issues, including infections and weight loss. This woman had been receiving home health services for 2 years. That allowed her to continue to stabilize through the care and the coordination of a compassionate and skilled home health nurse. Unfortunately, the agency received a denial notice, terminating home health care for this woman. 
   A true tragedy happened in this case. Less than 3 months later, after her home health care had been terminated, this 
   woman died as a result of a wound on her foot that went untreated, a serious wound that undoubtedly her home health nurse would have recognized. 
   This is only one of the heart-wrenching stories that I heard during that visit. It is only one of the countless testimonials that I have heard from both patients and home health providers across the State. 
   It is now clear that the savings goals set forth for home health in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have not only been met but far surpassed. According to a recent study by the Congressional Budget Office, spending for home health care has fallen by more than 35 percent in the last year. In fact, CBO cites this larger than anticipated reduction in home health care spending as the reason why overall Medicare spending fell last year for the first time. 
   The CBO now projects that the post-Balanced Budget Act reductions in home health will be about $69 billion between fiscal years 1998 and 2002. This is over four times the $16 billion that Congress expected to save as a result of the 1997 act. It is a clear indication, particularly when combined with the regulatory overkill of this administration, that the Medicare home health cutbacks have been far deeper and far wider reaching than Congress ever intended. 
   I have introduced legislation which is cosponsored by the Senator from Wisconsin who, as I said, has been a leader in this area, with my colleague from Missouri, Senator BOND. In fact, both Senator BOND and Senator ASHCROFT, as well as many of my other colleagues, are cosponsors of legislation that eliminates the further 15-percent reduction in Medicare payments to home health agencies that is currently scheduled to go into effect on October 1 of next year. If we do not act to eliminate this 15-percent cut that is looming on the horizon, it will sound the death knell for thousands of home health agencies. And ultimately the people, the true victims, will be those senior citizens who will no longer receive the care they need. I know the Presiding Officer has also been very concerned about the impact in his State; all Members who have rural States know the importance of home health care. 
   As Congress prepares for action on Medicare, we should give top priority to providing much needed relief to our Nation's beleaguered home health agencies. The legislation I have introduced currently has 55 Senate cosponsors--32 Republicans and 23 Democrats.  It has the strong backing of patient and consumer groups, ranging from the American Diabetes Association, the National Council on Aging, Easter Seals, the American Nurses Association, and the National Family Caregivers Association, as well as the two major industry groups representing home health care agencies with whom we have worked very closely. 
   It is imperative we solve this problem before we adjourn this year. I appreciate the opportunity to address this issue. 
   The remainder of the time will be reserved for the Senator from Wisconsin, with whom it has been a real pleasure to work on this issue.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, international treaties and trade agreements are among the most complex issues to come before this body. Their complexity is increased by an order of magnitude when the country in question has a value system and history that are so unlike our own. 
   Despite the fact that China is a country old enough that its history is counted by centuries rather than by decades, I believe that there is still much that we do not understand about that nation--and that lack of understanding appears to run both ways. For instance, I simply cannot understand the attitude of the Chinese leaders on issues that we consider to be basic human rights--like religious freedom. Nor can I understand their previous reluctance to comply with the terms of international trade agreements. 
   As a result, I have found the decision on whether to vote to establish permanent normal trade relations with China to be one of the more difficult decisions I have made as a Senator. Ultimately, after much deliberation, I have decided that the opportunities afforded our nation by expanding the global marketplace and by supporting China's membership in the World Trade Organization make PNTR in the best interests of our nation. For the first time, this agreement will help ensure that China reduces trade barriers, opens its markets to American goods and services, and follows the rules of international trade. 
   Nevertheless, this is a close call. I remain deeply concerned about China's record on human rights and its involvement in creating instability in the world through the proliferation of weapons technology. Consequently, I supported numerous amendments such as Senator WELLSTONE's amendment on religious freedom and Senator HELMS' amendment relating to human rights. I was also proud to be a cosponsor and debate on behalf of Senator THOMPSON's nonproliferation amendment. Regrettably, the Senate did not adopt these amendments, but I hope that the lengthy and impassioned debate sent a message to China that we have not forgotten its record on human rights and nuclear proliferation. 
   I have also been concerned about the impact that granting PNTR would have on American jobs, particularly those in my home state of Maine. I have considered very carefully the concerns of those who have suggested that granting PNTR for China would have an adverse effect on some of our domestic manufacturers. In fact, I wrote to U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky to express these concerns and to inquire about the import surge protections included in the U.S.-China bilateral agreement. Ambassador Barshefsky's reply, which I will enter into the RECORD, discusses the measures in the bilateral agreement that will provide vulnerable U.S. industries with protection from surges in Chinese imports. Were it not for these protections, which are stronger than those in place with other WTO members, I would likely have opposed passage of this legislation. 
   The agreement contains a textile-specific safeguard that provides protection from disruptive imports for our domestic producers three years beyond the expiration of all textile quotas in 2005 under the WTO Agreement on Textile and Clothing. I would also point out that, were we not to pass PNTR for China, our existing import quotas on Chinese textiles will expire at the end of the year with no hope of renewal through future negotiations with China. 
   Those on both sides of this issue have published reports that attempt to project the impact on jobs of granting China PNTR. Given the vast and completely conflicting findings, it was particularly difficult to judge the validity of these reports. An Economic Policy Institute analysis suggests that Maine would lose 20,687 jobs by 2010 were Congress to approve PNTR for China. Closer inspection of the EPI projections for Maine, however, reveal fatal flaws in the analysis, as the University of Southern Maine's respected economist Charles Colgan has pointed out. For example, the EPI numbers for Maine, when broken down by industry, project that Maine will lose 18,091 jobs in the shoe industry over the next ten years. Yet, according to Maine Department of Labor figures, Maine has only 5,800 jobs in the entire industry. This one 
   discrepancy alone reduces by more than 12,000 the projected number of Maine jobs affected, an inaccuracy that calls into question the validity of the entire EPI analysis. 
   Conversely, the administration and industry groups have suggested that substantial export and job growth opportunities will accompany passage of PNTR. While these projections may be overly generous, I believe that PNTR represents, on balance, a net gain for my State. According to the International Trade Administration, Maine's exports to China increased by 58 percent from 1993 to 1998. Moreover, small and medium-sized businesses account for 63 percent of all firms exporting from Maine to China. 
   Maine Governor Angus King put it well when he said, ``The potential for increasing Maine's already dynamic export growth--and creating more and better jobs here at home--will only increase if we can gain greater access to the Chinese market.'' 
   Maine's best known export may be our world-renowned lobster, but the lobster industry is but one of many natural resource-based industries that will benefit from China's agreement to lower tariffs and reduce non-tariff barriers to its market. The paper industry, which employs thousands of people in my State, supports PNTR because the agreement would result in a reduction in the current average Chinese tariffs on paper and paper products from 14.2 percent to 5.5 percent. The concessions made by China regarding trading rights and distribution also will provide new market access to products manufactured in the paper mills of Maine. 
   The potato industry, a mainstay of the northern Maine economy, is another example of a natural resource-  based industry that stands to gain from improved access to China's market. More and more, the potato farmers of Maine are delivering their products not only to grocery stores, but also to processing plants that produce items such as french fries and potato chips. Tariffs on these products are now a prohibitive 25 percent, but will be reduced under the agreement by about 10 percent. The Maine Potato Board has endorsed PNTR and expects to see a significant expansion in the global french fry market as a result of these tariff reductions. 
   The opening of China's markets also will benefit many of Maine's manufacturers. Companies such as National Semiconductor and Fairchild Semiconductor will benefit from the elimination of tariffs on information technology products and agreements to remove non-tariff barriers to the Chinese market. Pratt and Whitney, which manufactures jet engines in North Berwick, ME, is already a major exporter to China and considers PNTR a critical component for the future growth of its business. Moreover, enactment of PNTR will ensure that Pratt and Whitney can compete on equal footing with its European competitors to supply engines and parts for the 1000 commercial aircraft China will purchase by 2017. 
   My support for PNTR reflects my belief that Maine workers will excel in an increasingly global economy. In Bangor, for instance, the community is developing the Maine Business Enterprise Park. The park is projected to create 2,500 new jobs in technology-intensive industries by providing new and expanding companies with the space and trained workforce needed for success and growth. Undoubtedly, the Chinese market will be a destination for some of the technology products and will help support Maine's transition into the new economy. 
   Extending PNTR to China advances the cause of free trade, opens China and its market to international scrutiny, and binds it economically to the rules governing international trade. Ultimately, I believe we need to take advantage of the economic opportunities that PNTR represents for our Nation. Therefore, I will vote to grant PNTR to China.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the Resolution Commemorating the 25th Anniversary of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. This law has had a very positive impact on the lives of millions of disabled Americans. In fact, since its enactment, the number of children with disabilities who complete high school has grown significantly, and the number who enroll in college has more than tripled. Academic achievement is increasing, along with  the nation's expectations about the abilities of children with disabilities. Our commitment to a quality education for everybody now extends to America's six million students with disabilities. 
   We know that special education is not a ``place'' or a ``label,'' but a set of services that allow children to succeed in school, go on to lead productive lives, and enter the world of work. This is something that matters to me because it means so much to the people in Maine who have been able to lead productive lives because the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act afforded them the quality education they deserved. 
   This is why we need to increase consistently the Federal financial support for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--so that the Federal Government does, in fact, pay each school in America 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure for every special education student enrolled. Washington made that promise to our local communities when it passed IDEA. 
   For example, this year in Maine, local schools will receive only $702 per special education student under IDEA--$1698 per student less than the $2400 it would receive if the Federal Government paid its share. In total, Maine will receive $60 million less than it was promised. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the unmet amount stands at an astounding $11 billion nationally. We cannot continue to shift this burden to our local communities. We must meet the Federal commitment to help pay for special education costs. 
   Let us take the 25th anniversary of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to recognize the positive impact this law has on every community in the United States, but let us not forget our Federal commitment of 40 percent to help our schools and communities implement the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, I thank my friend and colleague from Minnesota for his usual graciousness in allowing me to respond to the comments made by my friend from Massachusetts, Senator KENNEDY. 
   Let's look at the facts. My colleagues on this side of the aisle have repeatedly said that the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is our top priority. We produced a very good bill from the HELP Committee on which the Presiding Officer serves so ably. We produced a bill that provides a substantial increase in Federal funding for education to help improve education and the lives of children all over this Nation. 
   We also adopted an important, innovative, new approach, one that recognizes that Washington is not the fount of all wisdom when it comes to educational policy. We recognize that schools have different needs, that some need new computers. Others need to hire new math teachers. Still others need to concentrate on providing more programs for gifted and talented students. Schools have different needs. They want to tailor their policies to the needs of the local community. 
   That is what our bill would do. It would give schools more flexibility in spending Federal dollars while holding them accountable for what counts; that is, results, improved student achievement. We want to get away from the Washington-knows-best approach and let local school boards, teachers, and parents make the decisions about what their children best need. 
   Unfortunately, our efforts were derailed by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who insisted on weighing down the education bill with issues completely unrelated to education. The majority leader, Senator LOTT, has tried repeatedly to get a unanimous consent agreement that would allow us to return to the education bill that both sides agree is so important. Unfortunately, the latest effort was once again met with demands for unrelated, nongermane amendments that would sink our ability to produce this important legislation this year. 
   Those are the facts. Our side stands ready to return to the ESEA bill. We believe that is an extremely important priority. We are very proud of the bill we have produced. We believe it would make a real difference in the lives of American children. We would like to go forward. Unfortunately, we have been met with obstacle after obstacle from our colleagues on Senator KENNEDY's side of the aisle. 
   That is unfortunate. But the American people deserve to know why we have been unable to complete our work in this very important arena. 
   I yield the floor and again thank my colleague from Minnesota for his graciousness.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to join the Presiding Officer and several of my colleagues in discussing an issue of critical importance to our national security. That issue is the continued proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and whether we are willing to take action, at this time, to stem this dangerous trend. I rise today in enthusiastic support of the amendment offered by the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. THOMPSON, who has worked so hard to present a reasoned and reasonable response to this threat to world peace. Senator THOMPSON's amendment imposes sanctions on key suppliers of weapons of mass destruction. 
   Let me start by stating that while this is not a new problem, it does represent a growing threat. The United States has long been concerned about transfers of technology by the People's Republic of China that contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In the past few years, however, some of our worst fears have been realized. Let's just look at China's record: In June of 1997, the Director of Central Intelligence submitted a report to Congress stating that from July through December of 1996, ``China was the most significant supplier of weapons of mass destruction and technology to foreign countries.'' 
   In July of 1998, the Rumsfeld Commission reported: ``China poses a threat to the United States as a significant proliferator of ballistic missiles, weapons of mass destruction, and enabling technologies.'' 
   In January 1998, the bipartisan Cox report stated bluntly: ``China stole and used classified design information on the neutron bomb, and concluded that China stole design information on our most advanced nuclear weapons, including every nuclear warhead the United States currently has deployed.'' 
   In July of 1999, yet another year goes by, but the same problem persists. The Deutch Commission concluded that ``weapons of mass destruction pose a grave threat to U.S. citizens and our military forces, to our allies, and to our vital interests in many regions of the world.'' 
   Once again, in January of this year, the Director of Central Intelligence named China, Russia, and North Korea as ``key suppliers'' of such technology. And just last month, the CIA's latest report again lists China as the key supplier of weapons of mass destruction and missile technologies to rogue states. 
   We need no further proof. The record is crystal clear. The time has come to act. We should not continue to turn a blind eye to this grave threat to our national security and to world peace. The fact is, we know China is selling missile and chemical technology to Pakistan. We know China has also assisted Syria, Iran, North Korea, and Libya by transferring critical technology. In fact, the CIA's January 2000 report states that China is perhaps the most significant supplier of weapons of mass destruction and missile technology in the world. Let me repeat that: China is the worst proliferator of weapons of mass destruction and related technologies in the world. 
   We all know there is no easy panacea to this problem, no single answer. Senator THOMPSON's amendment provides reasonable and effective responses to proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, missile technologies, and advanced conventional weapons. This legislation is a step in the right direction to ensure that the United States no longer tolerates China's role in continuing to be the world's No. 1 proliferator of weapons of mass destruction. 
   This legislation has been revised to address legitimate concerns raised by the business community, our farmers, and the Administration. The amendment has been broadened to apply not only to China, but to other countries identified by the Director of Central Intelligence as other key suppliers of weapons--that list currently includes Russia and North Korea. This legislation ensures that appropriate action will finally be taken against these 
   proliferators, that we will no longer ignore these serious transgressions, that we will no longer turn a blind eye to what is happening. 
   This amendment is well crafted. It provides for discretionary, not mandatory, sanctions against countries that supply proliferating technologies. Frankly, I think a case could be made for mandatory sanctions. But the author of this amendment has bent over backwards to make sure it is a reasonable, well-crafted response. 
   Another change was in the evidentiary standard. It has been raised for imposing mandatory sanctions for companies identified as proliferators to give the President more discretion. 
   My hope is we will pass this amendment by a strong vote tomorrow, that we will send a strong signal to China and to other countries engaged in proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, that we will tell them there will be consequences, there will be penalties in response to spreading weapons of mass destruction. 
   Now is the time for us to act. Let us enact these reasonable, well-crafted changes to our foreign and national security policies. 
   I thank the Presiding Officer for his leadership on this very important issue, and I also thank him for taking the chair so I could deliver my statement. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, earlier this year I joined many of my colleagues in signing a letter supporting increased funding for renewable energy. I am pleased today to see that the subcommittee on Energy and Water Appropriations has honored our request with an $82 million increase in renewable energy funding, raising the total from $362 million to $444 million. That this substantial 23 percent increase occurred under severe budgetary pressures makes it all the more commendable. I thank Chairman DOMENICI and Senator REID for their efforts in producing this bill. 
   At no time has investment in renewable energy research and development been more important. As we have seen over and over again, even a slight imbalance between supply and demand can lead to rapidly escalating energy prices. Last winter, disruptions in oil supply caused great hardship to Mainers who depend on home heating oil. Mainers are also suffering at the pumps from gasoline and diesel prices that hit their highest levels in decades. People across the nation are further suffering from more and more frequent spikes in the price of natural gas and electricity. 
   Unless we act to diversify our energy supply, this volatility is only likely to grow worse. For example, United States currently imports slightly over half of its oil. In less than 20 years, this number is expected to grow to 70 percent. Unless we are content to live under the perpetual threat of energy disruptions from Middle East energy barons or other forces beyond our control, we must diversify our energy supply. While renewable energy will not provide the whole answer, it holds the potential to help stabilize energy prices and to provide us with an increased level of energy security. By investing in renewable energy research and development, we enhance fuel and technology diversity and help provide the United States with insulation from future energy shocks. 
   Investments in renewable energy have many other benefits as well. These investments increase the U.S. market share of the growing domestic and international markets for energy-supply products and permit the expansion of high technology jobs within the U.S. economy. Research in biomass and biofuels helps farmers and foresters by creating valuable new uses for agricultural products. Renewable energy has important military applications and is currently used on many remote military bases. The funds contained in this bill will also lead to improvements in distributed generation, energy storage, and reliability of the electric grid. Finally, renewable are bringing extra income to many farmers and local communities across the Nation. 
   My home State of Maine is a leader in renewable energy production and technology. In fact nearly 30 percent of our electricity comes from renewable energy generated in Maine. Central Maine Power is selling renewable energy from biomass to green markets in other states. And just next month, Endless Energy will be putting in a brand new wind turbine at a blueberry farm in Orland. This turbine was made possible in part by the renewable energy investments that I supported last year. 
   I again thank Senators DOMENICI and REID for providing the increase in renewable energy investments that I and many of my colleagues in the U.S. Senate had asked for. This is a down-payment on future energy diversity and a sound economy.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I first want to thank the managers of this bill, Senator DOMENICI and Senator REID, for bringing this appropriations bill to the floor in a bipartisan fashion and for making this time available to us tonight. 
   I am very pleased to join with my good friend and colleague from the State of New York, Senator SCHUMER, in offering this important amendment to the Energy and Water Appropriations bill. As my colleague has explained, this amendment is straightforward. It would establish a Presidential commission to help us develop a comprehensive, sustainable energy policy. The time is long overdue for this Nation to have an energy policy. Unfortunately, the current administration has failed to develop one. 
   Last year when the home heating oil crisis gripped the Northeast, the Energy Secretary, Bill Richardson, was very forthright. He admitted that the Federal Government had been caught napping and said that we simply were not prepared. 
   Due largely to OPEC's anticompetitive manipulation of our oil markets, we have been experiencing dramatic price increases that have rippled throughout the four corners of this Nation. This year consumers have paid 47 percent more for gasoline. Truckers have paid 46 percent more for diesel fuel. And Northeasterners have paid 81 percent more for home heating oil than they did just one year earlier. 
   In my home State of Maine, this problem is reaching crisis proportions. Seventy-five percent of all Maine households use home heating oil, consuming an average of 800 gallons per year. Last year, the average Maine household spent $320 more than it did the previous year simply to heat with oil. Of course, heating with natural gas provided little relief as natural gas prices have also soared. And the outlook for this year is even worse. 
   Meanwhile, although OPEC countries sold 5 percent less oil in 1999, their profits were up by 38 percent. 
   Today, as a year ago, we find ourselves turning the corner toward cooler weather and another looming home heating oil price crisis. All signs indicate that this one will be even worse than last year's. Consider that crude oil closed Friday at $33 per barrel, up from $22 a year ago. Last week heating oil futures hit their highest level since October of 1990. At the same time, as my colleague has pointed out, home heating oil and natural gas inventories are down. Indeed, distillate stocks are roughly 10 million barrels lower than the administration predicted just last month. In fact, stocks of crude oil, gasoline and heating oil in the United States have not been at levels this low since the mid-1970s, when our economy was thrown into turmoil due in large measure to a volatile oil market. Compounding the problem, the demand for distillate fuel is predicted to increase significantly this winter. 
   In short, the fast approaching winter looks bleak. And judging from the most recent comments of OPEC officials, it is clear that we cannot expect any real relief from the cartel. 
   As my colleague has pointed out, there is no consensus in the Congress or in the administration about what approach we should take in developing a national energy policy. Policymakers differ on what can be done to provide relief to American consumers. 
   My friend from New York and I have been advocating for some time that the administration implement a responsible plan to swap oil from our well-stocked Strategic Petroleum Reserve to satisfy market demand and provide some price relief to American consumers. Others in this Chamber advocate different approaches. But I believe we can all find common ground with the notion that, in the long term, we need to conduct a comprehensive study of our oil and natural gas industries in order to develop a strategy to stabilize fuel prices, to explore alternative energy sources, and to reduce our reliance on foreign oil supplies. Our amendment would take an important first step in accomplishing these goals through the creation of a bipartisan energy commission. 
   I very much appreciate the fact that the managers have been working with us on this legislation, which I hope they will accept. With that, I yield the floor.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, the Access to Affordable Health Care Act, that is designed to make health insurance more affordable both for individuals and for small businesses that provide health care coverage for their employees. 
   In the past few years, Congress has taken some major steps to expand access to affordable health coverage for all Americans. In 1996, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act--also known as Kassebaum-Kennedy--was signed into law which assures that American workers and their families will not lose their health care coverage if they change jobs, lose their jobs, or become ill. 
   One of the first bills I sponsored on coming to the Senate was legislation to establish the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which was enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act. States have enthusiastically responded to this program, which now provides affordable health insurance coverage to over two million children nationwide, including 9,365 in Maine's expanded Medicaid and CubCare programs. 
   Despite these efforts, the number of uninsured Americans continues to rise. At a time when unemployment is low and our nation's economy is thriving, more than 44 million Americans--including 200,000 Mainers--do not have health insurance. Clearly, we must make health insurance more available and more affordable. 
   Most Americans under the age of 65 get their health coverage through the workplace. It is therefore a common assumption that people without health insurance are unemployed. The fact is, however, that most uninsured Americans are members of families with at least one full-time worker. According to the Health Insurance Association of America, almost seven out of ten uninsured Americans live in a family whose head of household works full-time. 
   In my state of Maine, small business is not just a segment of the economy--it is the economy. I am, therefore, particularly concerned that uninsured, working Americans are most often employees of small businesses. Nearly half of the uninsured workers nationwide are in businesses with fewer than 25 employees. 
   According to a recent National Federation of Independent Businesses survey of over 4,000 of its members, the cost of health insurance is the number one problem facing small businesses. And it has been since 1986. It is time for us to listen and to lend a hand to these small businesses. 
   Small employers generally face higher costs for health insurance than larger firms, which makes them less likely to offer coverage. Premiums are generally higher for small businesses because they do not have as much purchasing power as large companies, which limits their ability to bargain for lower rates. They also have higher administrative costs because they have fewer employees among whom to spread the fixed costs of a health benefits plan. Moreover, they are not as able to spread risks of medical claims over as many employees as can large firms. 
   As a consequence, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), only 42 percent of small businesses with fewer than 50 employees offer health insurance to their employees. By way of contrast, more than 95 percent of businesses with 100 or more employees 
   offer insurance. 
   Moreover, the smaller the business, the less likely it is to offer health insurance to its employees. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI), only 27 percent of workers in firms with fewer than 10 employees received health insurance from their employers in their own name, compared with 66 percent of workers in firms with 1,000 or more employees. Small businesses want to provide health insurance for their employees, but the cost is often prohibitive. 
   Simply put, the biggest obstacle to health care coverage in the United States today is cost. While American employers everywhere--from giant multinational corporations to the small corner store--are facing huge hikes in their health insurance costs, these rising costs are particularly problematic for small businesses and their employees. Many small employers are facing premium increases of 20 percent or more, causing them either to drop their health benefits or pass the additional costs on to their employees through increased deductibles, higher copays or premium hikes. This, too, is troubling and will likely add to the ranks of the uninsured since it will cause some employees--particularly lower-wage workers who are disproportionately affected by increased costs--to drop or turn down coverage when it is offered to them. 
   The legislation I am introducing today, the Access to Affordable Health Care Act, would help small employers cope with these rising costs. My bill would provide new tax credits for small businesses to help make health insurance more affordable. It would encourage those small businesses that do not currently offer health insurance to do so and would help businesses that do offer insurance to continue coverage even in the face of rising costs. 
   Under my proposal, employers with fewer than ten employees would receive a tax credit of 50 percent of the employer contribution to the cost of employee health insurance. Employers with ten to 25 employees would receive a 30 percent credit. Under my bill, the credit would be based on an employer's yearly qualified health insurance expenses of up to $2,000 for individual coverage and $4,000 for family coverage. 
   The legislation I am introducing today would also make health insurance more affordable for individuals and families who must purchase health insurance on their own. The Access to Affordable Health Care Act would provide an above-the-line tax deduction for individuals who pay at least 50 percent of the cost of their health and long-term care insurance. Regardless of whether an individual takes the standard deduction or itemizes, he or she would be provided relief by the new above-the-line deduction. 
   My bill also would allow self-employed Americans to deduct the full amount of their health care premiums. Some 25 million Americans are in families headed by a self-employed individual--of these, five million are uninsured. Establishing parity in the tax treatment of health insurance costs between the self-employed and those working for large businesses is not just a matter of equity. It will also help to reduce the number of uninsured, but working Americans. My bill will make health insurance more affordable for the 82,000 people in Maine who are self-employed. They include our lobstermen, our hairdressers, our electricians, our plumbers, and the many owners of mom-and-pop stores that dot communities throughout the state.  
   Mr. President, the Access to Affordable Health Care Act would help small businesses afford health insurance for their employees, and it would also make coverage more affordable for working Americans who must purchase it on their own. I urge my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of this important legislation.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, along with my colleague from Illinois, Senator DURBIN, I am introducing legislation to stem the proliferation of web sites that distribute counterfeit identification documents and credentials over the Internet. 
   In May, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, held hearings on a disturbing new trend--the use of the Internet to manufacture and market counterfeit identification documents and credentials. Our investigation revealed the widespread availability on the Internet of a variety of fake ID documents or computer templates that allow individuals to manufacture authentic looking IDs in the seclusion of their own homes. 
   The Internet False Identification Prevention Act of 2000 will strengthen current law to prevent the distribution of false identification documents over the Internet and make it easier for Federal officials to prosecute this criminal activity. 
   The high quality of the counterfeit identification documents that can be obtained via the Internet is simply astounding. With very little difficulty, my staff was able to use Internet materials to manufacture convincing IDs that would allow me to pass as a member of our Armed Forces, as a reporter, as a student at Boston University, or as a licensed driver in Florida, Michigan, and Wyoming--to name just a few of the identities that I could assume, using these phony IDs. We found it was very easy to manufacture IDs that were indistinguishable from the real documents. 
   For example, using the Internet, my staff created this counterfeit Connecticut driver's license, which is virtually identical to an authentic license issued by the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles. Just like the real Connecticut license, this fake with my picture on it, includes a signature written over the picture--which is supposed to be a security feature. It includes an adjacent ``shadow picture,'' and it includes the bar code and the State seal for the State of Connecticut. 
   Each of these sophisticated features was added to the license by the State of Connecticut in order to make it more difficult to counterfeit. Yet the Internet scam artists have been able to keep up with the technology, and every time a State adds another security feature it has been easily duplicated. 
   Unfortunately, some web sites sell fake IDs complete with State seals, holograms, and bar codes to replicate a license virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. Thus, technology now allows web site operators to copy authentic IDs with an extraordinary level of sophistication and then distribute and mass produce these fraudulent documents for their customers. 
   The web sites investigated by my subcommittee offered a vast and varied product line, ranging from the driver's licenses that I already showed to military identification cards to Federal agency credentials, including those of the FBI and the CIA. 
   Other sites offered to produce Social Security cards, birth certificates, diplomas, and press credentials. In short, one can find almost any kind of identification document that one wants on the Internet. 
   The General Accounting Office and the FBI have both confirmed the findings of the subcommittee's investigation of this dangerous new trend. The GAO used counterfeit credentials and badges readily available for purchase via the Internet to breach the security at 19 Federal buildings and two commercial airports. GAO's success in doing so demonstrates that the Internet and computer technology allow  nearly anyone to create convincing identification cards and credentials. 
   The FBI has also focused on the potential of misuse of official identification, and just last month executive search warrants at the homes of several individuals who had been selling Federal law enforcement badges over the Internet. 
   Obviously, this is very serious. It allows someone to use a law enforcement badge to gain access to secure areas and perhaps to commit harm. For example, the FBI is investigating a very disturbing incident where someone allegedly displayed phony FBI credentials to gain access to an individual's hotel room and then allegedly later kidnaped and murdered that individual. 
   The Internet is a revolutionary tool of commerce and communications that benefits us all, but many of the Internet's greatest attributes also further its use for criminal purposes. While the manufacture of false IDs by criminals is certainly nothing new, the Internet allows those specializing in the sale of counterfeit IDs to reach a far broader market of potential buyers than they ever could by standing on the street corner in a shady part of town. They can sell their products with virtual anonymity through the use of e-mail services and free web hosting services and by providing false information when registering their domain names. Similarly, the Internet allows criminals to obtain fake IDs in the privacy of their own homes, substantially diminishing the risk of apprehension that attends purchasing counterfeit documents on the street. 
   Because this is a relatively new phenomenon, there are no good data on the size of the false ID industry or the growth it has experienced as a result of the Internet, but the testimony at our hearing indicates that the Internet is increasingly becoming the source of choice for criminals to obtain false IDs. 
   The subcommittee's investigation found that some web site operators apparently have made hundreds of thousands of dollars through the sale of phony identification documents. One web site operator told a State law enforcement official that he sold approximately 1,000 fake IDs each month and generated about $600,000 in annual sales. 
   Identify theft is a growing problem that these Internet sites facilitate. Fake IDs, however, also facilitate a broad array of criminal conduct. We found that some Internet sites were used to obtain counterfeit identification documents for the purpose of committing other crimes, ranging from very serious offenses, such as identify theft and bank fraud, ranging to the more common problem of teenagers using phony IDs to buy alcohol. 
   The legislation which Senator DURBIN and I are introducing today is designed to address the problem of counterfeit IDs in several ways. The central features of our legislation are provisions that modernize existing law to address the widespread availability of false identification documents on the Internet. 
   First, the legislation supplements current Federal law against false identification to modernize it for the Internet age. The primary law prohibiting the use and distribution of false identification documents was enacted in 1982. Advances in computer technology and the use of the Internet have rendered that law inadequate. This bill will clarify that the current law prohibits the sale or distribution of false identification documents through computer files and templates which our investigation found are the vehicles of choice for manufacturing false IDs in the Internet age. 
   Second, the legislation will make it easier to prosecute those criminals who manufacture, distribute, or sell counterfeit identification documents by ending the practices of easily removable disclaimers as part of an attempt to shield the illegal conduct from prosecution through a bogus claim of novelty. 
   What we found is that a lot of these web sites have these disclaimers, in an attempt to get around the law, saying that these can only be used for entertainment or novelty purposes. No longer will it be acceptable to provide computer templates of government-issued identification cards containing an easily removable layer saying it is not a government document. 
   I will give an example. this is a driver's license from Oklahoma. It is a fake ID which my staff obtained via the Internet. It is enclosed in a plastic pouch that says ``Not a Government Document'' in red print across it, but it was very easily removed. All one had to do, with a snip of the scissors, was cut the pouch, and then the ID is easily removed and the disclaimer is gone. That is the kind of technique that a lot of times these web site operators use to get around the letter of the law. Under my bill, it will no longer be acceptable to sell a false identification document in this fashion. 
   Finally, my legislation seeks to encourage more aggressive law enforcement by dedicating investigative and prosecutorial resources to this emerging problem. The bill establishes a multiagency task force that will concentrate the investigative and prosecutorial resources of several agencies with responsibility for enforcing laws that criminalize the manufacture, sale, and distribution of counterfeit identification documents. 
   Our investigation established that Federal law enforcement officials have not devoted the necessary resources and attention to this serious problem. by prosecuting the purveyors of false identification materials, I believe that ultimately we can reduce end-use crime that often depends on the availability of counterfeit identification. For example, the convicted felon who testified at our hearings said that he would not have been able to commit bank fraud had he not been able to easily and quickly obtain high-quality fraudulent identification documents via the Internet. I am confident that if Federal law enforcement officials prosecute the most blatant violation of the law, the false ID industry on the Internet will wither in short order. 
   By strengthening the law and by focusing our prosecutorial efforts, I believe we can curb the widespread availability of false IDs that the Internet facilitates. The Director of the U.S. Secret Service testified at our hearing that the use of such fraudulent documents and credentials almost always accompanies the serious financial crimes they investigate. Thus, my hope is that the legislation we are introducing today will produce a stronger law that will help deter and prevent criminal activity, not only in the manufacture of false IDs but in other areas as well.

   Ms. COLLINS. Senator Paul Coverdell was a rare and wonderful man--and a spectacular Senator. Anyone who had the good fortune to work with him left more hopeful, more committed, more convinced we could all make a difference. 
   Much is being said about his extraordinary ability to get things done; I would like to talk about how he was able to accomplish so much. Senator Coverdell had many talents, but perhaps the secret to his success was high ability to bring people together. In times of friction, fractiousness, and pressure, he was always the one who remained focused and calm in the eye of the legislative storm. 
   It was a common for him to hold meetings in his office where conservatives and moderates, strategists and ideologues, listened to each other, shared ideas and figured out not just ways of accomplishing diverse goals, but also what those goals really should be. And his energy and willingness to take on the most difficult task with little public recognition or thanks was legendary. 
   Senator Coverdell was a man who listened. He listened to Senators and staff and policy experts. He listened to those he agreed with and those he didn't--and merged it all into a comprehensive, concise and workable plan. He respected all individuals with an honesty and sincerity that set the tone for working together. 
   Most of all, and through it all, Senator Coverdell was kind and gracious in his dealings with everyone. The country, his state, and all of us who have been privileged to know him will miss him terribly. We join in praying for his family as they suffer his loss. We have all lost a very good friend.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my good friend Senator LEVIN in offering an amendment to provide much needed relief for apple and potato producers across America. Senator LEVIN and I share a deep concern for these farmers, who have endured such unexpected hardship over the past year. I am grateful for having the opportunity to work with my friend from Michigan on this critical matter. 
   Over the past three years, America's apple growers have lost more than $760 million according to U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics. Market conditions, beyond the control of our farmers, and unfair trade practices have contributed significantly to these loses. There has been a reduction in demand for U.S. apples in much of the world because of poor economic conditions in foreign markets. The domestic demand for apples has been affected by conditions abroad as well. With dimished demand oversees, we have seen an increase in the foreign supply of apples in our domestic markets. The U.S. Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission recently found that our producers have been victimized by unfairly priced imports of Chinese apple juice concentrate. 
   Unusual weather also has hurt our potato and apple producers. The Maine Pomological Society, a group that primarily represents apple producers in my State, reports that a summer-long drought, coupled with the heavy winds and rains of Hurricane Floyd in the fall, had a disastrous impact on the quality of apples produced in Maine last year. On average, only 49% of Maine's 1999 apple crop could be sold at the ``fancy grade'' quality. To provide my colleagues with a sense of what this means, I would note that in 1998, 78% of the apples produced in Maine were labeled as fancy grade. 
   Maine potato farmers also found themselves victims of weather-related disasters in 1999. In Maine, some potato farmers found their fields covered in as much as 15 inches of water following the drenching that accompanied Hurricane Floyd last fall. Because many of Maine's farmers leave their crop in storage over the winter, we did not realize the full extent of the damage 
   caused by Floyd's rains until this spring. Mr. President, potato farmers pour their hearts and souls into their fields. It is profoundly disheartening to hear from a farmer who has lost an entire crop that took many months of hard work to cultivate. 
   The amendment Senator LEVIN and I offer today provides much-needed assistance to both potato and apple producers. Under our proposal, the Secretary of Agriculture would allocate $100 million in market loss assistance payments to our nation's apple producers. The market loss payments authorized by our amendment will help thousands of apple growers from Washington State to Michigan to Maine survive the losses they have endured due to conditions beyond their control. This amendment directs a modest amount of funds to producers who have received very little of the nearly $15 billion in emergency agriculture spending that we have passed this fiscal year. 
   Our amendment also directs the Secretary of Agriculture to provide $15 million in quality loss payments to apple and potato producers who suffered losses as a result of a hurricane or other weather-related disaster. This assistance will be important to those farmers who were unable to produce their finest product because of adverse weather conditions. 
   Mr. President, the provisions of our amendment are similar to language in the House-passed version of the FY 2001 Agriculture Appropriations bill. The provisions recognize that potato and apple producers, like other farmers across the country, are subject to the vagaries of international markets and the weather. I ask my colleagues to join us in providing assistance to our apple and potato producers in their time of need. 
   If anyone questions the emergency nature of this request, I would refer them to a news story that ran on the evening news in Maine this past Tuesday. The segment focused on a long-time apple grower from Alfred, Maine. The grower, with much regret, has come to the conclusion that after thirty-five years this will have to be his family's last crop. The dwindling profits are not enough incentive for the next generation of the family to contend with the government regulations and uncertainty that comes with running an apple orchard. I encourage my colleagues who missed this broadcast from Maine to read the story in Tuesday's New York Times about the hardships being endured by apple growers in New York who watched hail storms this spring wipe out much of their crops. This amendment and the aid it represents is certainly an emergency to these producers. 
   Mr. President, the federal government must be a partner in our farmer's efforts to feed America and much of the world. The Levin-Collins amendment ensures that our apple and potato producers get the help they need to overcome the difficulties of the past year and continue to produce a quality product. I urge my colleagues to support our amendment, and I yield the floor.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the year 2004 will mark the 400th anniversary of a small French settlement on Saint Croix Island, located in the Saint Croix River, which forms the boundary between the State of Maine and Canada. The 1604 settlement was the initial site of the first permanent settlement in the New World, predating the English settlement of 1607 at Jamestown, Virginia. Many view the expedition that settled on the Island as the beginning of the Acadian culture in North America.

   Ms. COLLINS. I want to thank you for your invaluable support of efforts to commemorate the Saint Croix Island site. Last year's Interior Appropriations bill included my sense-of-the-Senate language that the National Park Service should take what steps are necessary to ensure that appropriate exhibits are completed by 2004. This year's Appropriations Committee mark includes $200,000 in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service construction budget to assist with the Downeast Heritage Center. The Center, which we will make every effort to complete in time for the 2004 celebration, will allow state and federal agencies and other partners in the project to interpret the French settlement efforts at Saint Croix Island and other historical, recreational, and cultural aspects of Downeast Maine.

   Ms. COLLINS. A major, international celebration is expected to commemorate the Saint Croix Island settlement's 400th anniversary. Pursuant to a memorandum of understanding signed by the U.S. Department of the Interior and the Canadian Department of the Environment, Parks Canada has worked diligently to prepare for the event. I am concerned that we have not been as enterprising and now face the very real possibility of being less than fully prepared for the 2004 celebration. Indeed, the National Park Service has informed me that it requires planning money in fiscal year 2001 in order to ensure that the Downeast Heritage Center will be completed in time. I have introduced authorizing legislation, S..2485, that would permit the National Park Service to join with other public and private entities to construct the Center. That bill has been reported out of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. I have every hope that the bill will become law this year. Mr. Chairman, as the FY 2001 Interior Appropriations bill goes to conference, I would ask that you do what you can to add $340,000 to the National Park Service construction budget so that it can assist this year in the planning of the Downeast Heritage Center with an eye to its completion by 2004.

   Ms. COLLINS. The Senior Senator for Maine is correct, Mr. Chairman. This tremendous turnover calls into question whether the traditional use of these lands for forestry and for outdoor recreational activities will continue. We are fortunate that the present owners of these valuable lands are offering an opportunity to secure their lasting protection and productivity. I, along with Senator SNOWE, support these efforts through funding from the Forest Legacy Program and the Forest Service's land acquisition program and hope we can work together during this appropriations process to take advantage of the opportunity afforded us at this time.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, on behalf of myself, Senator BREAUX, and Senator ABRAHAM, I am pleased to introduce the Pediatric Diabetes Research and Prevention Act. Both Senator BREAUX and Senator ABRAHAM have been leaders in the fight against diabetes. 
   Our legislation will help us reduce the tremendous toll that diabetes takes on our Nation's children and young people. Diabetes is a devastating, lifelong condition that affects people of every age, race, and nationality. 
   Sixteen million Americans suffer from diabetes, and about 800,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. It is one of our nation's most costly diseases in both human and economic terms. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, blindness in adults, and amputations not related to injury. It is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke and shortens life expectancy up to 15 years. Moreover, diabetes costs our nation more than $105 billion a year in health-related expenditures. More than one out of every ten health care dollars and about one out of four Medicare dollars are spent on people with diabetes. 
   Unfortunately, there is no method to prevent or cure diabetes, and available treatments have only limited success in controlling its devastating consequences. The burden of diabetes is particularly heavy for children and young adults with type I, or insulin dependent diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes. In type I diabetes, the immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cell in the pancreas and destroys them. As a consequence, the pancreas produces little or no insulin. Juvenile diabetes is the second most common chronic disease affecting children. Moreover, it is one that they never outgrow. 
   As the founder of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I have met many children with diabetes who face a daily struggle to keep their blood glucose levels under control: kids like nine-year-old Nathan Reynolds, an active young boy from North Yarmouth who was Maine's delegate to the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation's Children's Congress last year. Nathan was diagnosed with diabetes in December of 1997, which forced him to change both his life and his family's life. He has learned how to take his blood--something his four-year-old brother reminds him to do before every meal--check his blood sugar level, and give himself an insulin shot on his own, sometimes with the help of his parents or his school nurse. Nathan told me that his greatest wish was that, just once, he could take a ``day off'' from his diabetes. 
   The sad fact is that children like Nathan with diabetes can never take a day off from their disease. There is no holiday from dealing with their diabetes. They face a lifetime of multiple daily finger pricks to check their blood sugar levels and daily insulin shots. Moreover, insulin is not a cure for diabetes, and it does not prevent the onset of serious complications. As a consequence, children like Nathan also face the possibility of lifelong disabling complications, such as kidney failure and blindness. 
   Reducing the health and human burden of diabetes as well as its enormous economic impact depends upon identifying the factors responsible for the disease and developing new methods for prevention, better treatment, and ultimately a cure. The Pediatric Diabetes Research and Prevention Act, which I am introducing today, will do just that. 
   One of the most important actions we can take is to establish a type I diabetes monitoring system. Currently, there is no way to track the incidence of type I diabetes across the country. As a consequence, the estimates for the number of people with type I diabetes from the American Diabetes Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health vary enormously--from 123,000 to over 1.5 million, a 13-fold variation. 
   According to noted epidemiologist Alex Languimer, ``Good monitoring does not necessarily ensure the making of right decisions, but it does reduce the risk of wrong ones.'' One of the best ways to define the prevalence and incidence of a disease, as well as to characterize and study populations, is to establish a registry specific to that disease. The bill I am introducing today directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to create a National Registry on Juvenile Diabetes so that we can develop a national database on type I diabetes, including information about incidence and prevalence. The Secretary would also be directed to establish an advisory board of epidemiologists, clinicians, ethicists, patients and others to help guide this effort. 
   Obesity and inadequate physical activity--both major problems in the United States today--are important risk factors for type 2, or non-insulin dependent diabetes. Unfortunately, obesity is a significant and growing 
   problem among children in the United States, which has led to a disturbing increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes among young people. This is particularly alarming since type 2 diabetes has long been considered an ``adult'' disease. Nearly all of the documented cases of type 2 diabetes in young people have occurred in obese children, who are also at increased risk for the complications associated with the disease. Moreover, these complications will likely develop at an earlier age than if these children had developed type 2 diabetes as adults. 
   The Pediatric Diabetes Research and Prevention Act will direct the Secretary of HHS to implement a national public health effort to address type 2 diabetes among children, including: 1) enhanced surveillance systems and expanded research to better assess the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in young people and determine the extent to which type 2 diabetes is incorrectly diagnosed as type 1 diabetes among children; 2) assistance to States to establish coordinated school health programs and physical activity and nutrition demonstration projects to control  weight and to increase physical activity among school children; and 3) development and improvement of laboratory methods to assist in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diabetes. 
   In addition, the Collins, Breaux, Abraham legislation calls for long-term studies of persons with type 1 diabetes at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) where these individuals will be followed for 10 years or more. These long-term studies will examine disease manifestations, medical histories, environmental factors, development of complications, and other factors. This long-term analysis of type 1 diabetes will provide an invaluable basis for the identification of potential environmental triggers thought to precipitate the disease. It will also provide for the delineation of clinical characteristics or lab measures associated with the complications of diabetes as well as help to identify a potential study population for clinical trials. 
   Type 1 diabetes is considered an autoimmune disease, which results when the body's system for fighting infection turns against a part of the body. A variety of promising new approaches to treatment and prevention of autoimmune responses are currently under development. For the most part, however, these studies are conducted in adult populations. Moreover, at present, there is an insufficient infrastructure to conduct the clinical trials necessary to take advantage of new therapeutic approaches. 
   The Pediatric Diabetes Research and Prevention Act directs the Secretary of HHS, acting through the Director of the NIH, to support regional clinical centers for the cure of type 1 diabetes and through these centers, provides for: (1) a population of children appropriate for study; (2) well-trained clinical scientists able to conduct such trials; (3) appropriate clinical settings to house these studies; and (4) appropriate statistical capability, data, safety and other monitoring capacity. 
   And finally, the legislation directs the Secretary of HHS to provide for a national effort to develop a vaccine for type 1 diabetes. Animal studies suggest great promise for the development of a new vaccine to prevent type 1 diabetes in humans. The Pediatric Diabetes Research and Prevention Act provides for a combination of increased efforts in research and development of candidate vaccines, coupled with an enhanced ability to conduct large clinical trials in children. 
   The Pediatric Diabetes Research and Prevention Act will help us to better understand and ultimately conquer this disease which has had such a devastating impact on millions of American children and their families. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important legislation.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me begin by complimenting the Senator from Washington and the Senator from West Virginia for crafting an excellent bipartisan appropriations bill for these very important programs that matter so much to each of us in all our States. They have worked very well together and brought to the Senate for its consideration a bill that deserves support. I commend their efforts in that regard. 
   The amendment I am offering on behalf of myself and the senior Senator from Maine, Ms. SNOWE, concerns an issue of tremendous importance and urgency to the State of Maine. The issue involves the Federal Government's proposal to list the Atlantic salmon in the State of Maine under the Endangered Species Act. More specifically, the issue before us is whether the Federal Government will support the efforts of the State of Maine and other organizations to restore and conserve the Atlantic salmon in our State. Our amendment would appropriate $5 million in emergency funds for this very purpose. 
   I will give all of my colleagues an idea of just how critical it is for these funds to be invested in our State this year. This situation is truly an emergency. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service have proposed to list certain Atlantic salmon in Maine as an endangered species. Under an agreement reached last month between the services and the two organizations that filed suit in Federal court seeking emergency listing of the salmon, the services have agreed to make a final decision on whether or not to list the Atlantic salmon as endangered by November 17 of this year. 
   I emphasize this point: The services have already given up their statutory and--what is usually a matter of course--routine ability to seek an extension of time in which to make a determination of whether or not to list the Atlantic salmon in our State under the ESA. In short, the time is now to demonstrate a Federal financial commitment to salmon in our State and that a listing under the Endangered Species Act is not necessary to conserve and restore Maine's magnificent Atlantic salmon. 
   The stakes are decidedly high and the services' rush to judgment unfortunate. A decision to list the Atlantic salmon under the ESA could threaten the livelihood of thousands of Mainers, particularly in the eastern part of the State of Maine. This is one of the most beautiful sections of our State; unfortunately, it is one of the most challenged economically. 
   At risk is a $68-million-a-year agriculture industry employing 1,500 Mainers, a $100-million-a-year blueberry industry supporting 8,000 jobs, a developing cranberry industry into which more than $500 million has been invested already, and a forest products industry that is the linchpin of Maine's economy. As Maine's independent Governor, Angus King, put it, a listing would be ``a devastating economic blow to a region of the State least able to endure it.'' 
   The $5 million we are seeking would make a substantial contribution to salmon conservation and restoration  efforts in our State. The funds would be made available to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, which has made a commitment to us to work very closely with the State of Maine to ensure that every single dollar is spent effectively. The funds would be used to assist in land acquisition and conservation easements to benefit Atlantic salmon, to develop irrigation and water use management measures, to minimize any adverse effects on salmon habitat, to develop and phase in enhanced agriculture cages to minimize the risk of escape, 
   to install and upgrade weirs and fish collection facilities, and to conduct risk assessments, fish marking, and salmon genetics studies and testing. 
   The need for these emergency funds is right now. As noted, a listing decision is expected to be made early in the next fiscal year. The $5 million we are requesting needs to be appropriated prior to the Federal Government making its decision on whether or not to list the species, if it is to make a difference. We strongly believe that vigorous and effective salmon conservation and restoration efforts are needed in the State of Maine, but that listing the salmon as an endangered species is simply not the way to go. If these emergency funds are not appropriated this year, we will have missed an opportunity to convince the services that listing Atlantic salmon as endangered is not warranted. And we will have missed an opportunity of great importance to the people of Downeast Maine. 
   I thank the distinguished chairman and the ranking member of the subcommittee for their invaluable assistance on this critical matter. Senators GORTON, BYRD, and STEVENS have worked very hard to help us get to this point, and I have confidence that they will see this crucial amendment through to its enactment. 
   Mr. President, I understand that the amendment is acceptable to both managers of the bill, and I will urge its adoption following the remarks by the senior Senator from Maine.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is disappointing to hear the rhetoric from some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, implying that if we give our family farmers and our family business owners much needed relief from confiscatory death taxes that we will somehow not be able to afford prescription drug coverage for our senior citizens, or education for our children. That is simply not true. It is disheartening to hear these distortions from some of my colleagues. 
   I rise today as a longtime supporter of death tax relief for family-owned businesses and farms. In fact, the very first bill I introduced as a Senator in 1997 was to provide targeted estate tax relief for our family-owned businesses. I was very pleased when key elements of my legislation were incorporated into the 1997 tax reform bill. 
   I first became interested in this issue in my role as director of the Center for Family Business at Husson College in Bangor, ME, where I served prior to coming to the Senate. The center sponsored a seminar on how a family business should plan to pass a business on from generation to generation. It soon became very clear to me that a major obstacle to this goal, and a significant reason why so few family businesses survive to the second, third, or fourth generation, is the onerous estate tax. 
   To illustrate this fact, let me share with my colleagues the story of Judy Vallee of Portland, ME. Ms. Vallee's father started a restaurant in Portland, ME. He worked very hard. The whole family worked hard. Eventually he was able to build his business from one restaurant in Portland, ME, to a chain of 25 restaurants up and down the east coast. 
   Unfortunately, he died. The family was hit with a whopping estate tax bill of about $1 million--a bill they simply did not have the cash to pay because their assets were tied up in these restaurants. The result was the dismantling of this business, this very successful family business, which Mr. Vallee had labored a lifetime to build. 
   The ultimate result was that the family was forced to sell off all the restaurants but the one they started with in Portland. That is simply wrong. It is unfair when our tax policy forces a family to dismantle a lifetime of work. It is unfair that a parent cannot pass on to the next generation the fruits of that hard work. 
   The need for death tax relief is something that small businesses and farmers tell me about every time I am back home in Maine. And that is every weekend. I recently talked with auto dealers from all over the State, including an auto dealer in Bangor, ME, who has built a successful business that he very much wants to leave to his sons. 
   I have also talked with funeral directors, with bakery owners, with lumber dealers--with a host of businesses of all sizes and kinds throughout the State--who simply have the goal of working hard, creating jobs, building their businesses, and being able to leave those businesses to the next generation. Many of these businesses are capital intensive but cash poor. That is why they are hit so hard when the owner dies and they are subjected to onerous estate tax rates. 
   In many small towns throughout the State of Maine, these family businesses are the heart and the soul of the community. They are the businesses that support the United Way, sponsor the 
   Little League team, and contribute generously to other local community-based charities. They are the businesses that are always there to help because they employ their friends, their neighbors, and their family members. They are so closely linked to the economy of the small towns in which they exist. 
   I know that small business owners across the State of Maine were so pleased to see the House of Representatives approve H.R. 8 last month with  such a strong bipartisan vote. I stress, the vote was, indeed, broad based and bipartisan. A total of 65 House Democrats--both moderate and liberal Members--constituting more than 30 percent of the entire House Democratic caucus, joined Republicans in voting for the bill. 
   Here in the Senate there is also broad bipartisan support for the death tax relief bill introduced by my friend and colleague, Senator JON KYL, who has been such a leader in this effort. 
   As a matter of sound, long-term tax policy, H.R. 8 seeks to make a very fundamental and noteworthy change to the Tax Code. It recognizes that it is the sale of the asset, not the death of the owner, that should trigger a Federal tax. H.R. 8 would establish the principle that if family members inherit assets or property--a family business or a farm, for example--the Federal Government would tax those assets when they are sold by the heirs by imposing a capital gains tax. 
   Furthermore, the legislation before us would allow the Government to use the decedent's basis for determining the taxable amount of the inherited assets. So if a family businessperson dies and leaves the assets and property of their business to his or her children, they can continue running the business if they choose to do so without having to worry about the Federal Government's death tax bill forcing them to break up the business or sell the farm. This change would represent a giant step forward for many small businesses and family farms throughout Maine and the country. 
   There are two other points that I want to make about the impact of the death tax. The first is that it has a very unfortunate impact on jobs. The National Association of Women Business Owners, a group I was pleased to work with in my time with the Small Business Administration, has written a letter endorsing passage of this legislation. This organization surveyed many of its members and found that, on average, 39 jobs per business, or 11,000 jobs of those businesses surveyed, have already been lost due to the planning and the payment of the death tax. You can multiply that death tax time and again to see the deleterious impact of the death tax on job creation. 
   I know a bag manufacturer in northern Maine who told me that he spends tens of thousands of dollars each year on life insurance in order to be prepared in case he dies so that his family would not be hit by the estate tax. That is money he would like to invest right back into his business in order to hire more people or to buy new equipment or to expand his company. But instead, he is having to divert this money into planning for the estate tax. That is a point that is missed by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
   They claim that only 2 percent of the people are affected by the estate tax. In fact, it is so many more than that because of businesses that spend tens of thousands of dollars each year on life insurance or estate tax planning in order to avoid the imposition of the death tax. 
   The second point that I want to make is the impact of the death tax on the concentration of economic power in this country. I think this is an issue that has been largely overlooked in this debate. 
   When a small business is sold because the children cannot afford to pay the death tax, it is usually sold to a large out-of-State corporation which is not subject to the death tax. When that happens, it generally results in layoffs for local employees, diminished commitment to the community, and a greater concentration of economic power. Surely, we should not want that to be the result of our Federal tax policy. 
   The time has come for Congress to act this year to provide overdue death tax relief to our Nation's small businesses and family farms. 
   In doing so, we will take a giant step forward in making our tax policy far fairer. No longer will it be the death of an owner that triggers the imposition of tax but, rather, the sale of the asset when income is realized. That makes so much more sense as a matter of tax policy. We will also be telling people who have worked so hard over a lifetime to build their business that we, too, believe in the American dream. 
   I yield back any time I may have remaining, and I yield the floor.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Collins-Reed amendment to the Labor HHS Appropriations bill which will increase the availability of funds to provide substance abuse treatment services for our Nation's homeless men and women. 
   I would like to extend my thanks to Senator JACK REED who has joined as a cosponsor of this amendment and who has made increased funding for services to benefit the homeless one of his highest priorities. I would also like to extend my thanks to Senators DOMENICI, FEINSTEIN, MIKULSKI, SARBANES, JEFFORDS, KENNEDY, BINGAMAN, WELLSTONE, LINCOLN CHAFEE, DODD, LEAHY, DURBIN, SNOWE, EDWARDS and MOYNIHAN, all of whom cosigned a letter to appropriators which I and Senator REED sent earlier this year calling for an increase in funding for mental health and substance abuse treatment for the homeless. 
   Like all Americans, homeless men and women need decent shelter, but in many cases, homeless people also need treatment to address the underlying problem which has kept them on the street. An estimated 25 percent to 40 percent of homeless people need programs to help them recover from drug and alcohol abuse illnesses. Despite the prevalence of these illnesses among our nation's homeless, very limited funds are available to serve their specific treatment needs. 
   For a variety of reasons, addicted homeless people often have difficulty accessing mainstream treatment services. For example, many substance abuse service providers are not equipped to handle the complex social and health issues that homeless persons present, and may reject them or provide ineffective care. In addition, the reality of life on the street may significantly complicate the receipt of effective treatment. For example, homeless men and women may have difficulty in adhering to treatment schedules or may lack transportation to and from outpatient services. 
   Comprehensive programs which link treatment to other health, housing, social and maintenance services often provide the best opportunity for the homeless to adhere to treatment programs and ultimately achieve stability in their lives. The funding addressed in my amendment will provide grants which will assist communities in providing treatment services tailored to best serve the needs of their own homeless population. 
   I thank the Chairman of the Committee, who has been tireless in his efforts to increase substance abuse treatment services for all Americans in need, and who has been so receptive to this amendment and the needs of our Nation's homeless men and women. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased that the managers have accepted the amendment that I introduced with my colleague from Wisconsin. I thank the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee for their assistance and support. Our amendment will improve access to automated external defibrillators, or AEDs, in rural areas, where they are sorely needed to increase the chance that individuals in these communities who suffer cardiac arrest will survive. Joining us in cosponsoring this amendment are Senators JEFFORDS, BIDEN, ENZI, MURRAY, ABRAHAM, WELLSTONE, BINGAMAN, ROBB, KERRY and REED. 
   Heart disease is the leading cause of death both in the State of Maine and the United States. According to the American Heart Association, an estimated 250,000 Americans die each year from cardiac arrest. Many of these deaths could be prevented if automated external defibrillators were more accessible. AEDs are computerized devices that can shock a heart back into normal rhythm and restore life to a cardiac arrest victim. They must, however, be used promptly. For every minute that passes before a victim's normal heart rhythm is restored, his or her chance of survival falls by as much as 10 percent. 
   According to the American Heart Association, making AEDs standard equipment in police cars, fire trucks, ambulances and other emergency vehicles and getting these devices into more public places could save more than 50,000 lives a year. Cities across America have begun to recognize the value of fast access to AEDs and are making them available to emergency responders. In many small rural communities, however, limited budgets and the fact that so many rely on volunteer organizations for emergency services can make acquisition and appropriate training in the use of these life-saving devices problematic. Our amendment will increase access to AEDs and trained local responders for smaller towns and rural areas in Maine and elsewhere where those first on the scene may not be paramedics or others who would normally have AEDs. 
   I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from Wisconsin who has led this effort to increase access to AEDs in rural areas.

   Ms. COLLINS. These grants will be awarded on a competitive basis by the Health Resources and Services Administration to community partnerships in rural areas that are composed of local emergency response entities, such as community training facilities, local emergency responders, fire and rescue departments, police, community hospitals, and local non-profit entities and for-profit entities concerned about cardiac arrest survival rates. Our amendment will provide $4 million through the Health Resources and Services Administration for the awarding of grants to community partnerships in rural areas to purchase automated external defibrillators and to train individuals in basic cardiac life support. These rural partnerships will also be required to evaluate the local community emergency response times to assess whether they meet the standards established by national public health organizations such as the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross. They must also submit to the Secretary of Health and Human Services an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may require. I would like to ask my colleague from Wisconsin if he would like to add any additional comments.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Texas for her extraordinary leadership on this issue. She has been an advocate for girls and women in so many different ways, and she truly is committed to ensuring that young girls growing up get the very best education they deserve, and that they have every opportunity available to them. The amendment that she has proposed, which I am proud to cosponsor, is in keeping with that commitment. 
   I commend her for her leadership on this very important issue. 
   I first became very interested in the issue of having same-gender classrooms because of an experience of a high school all-girls math class in northern Maine. This math class, which is an advanced math class taught at Presque Isle High School, has been proven to be of enormous benefit to the young women who are enrolled in it. They do very advanced math. It has been shown that their SAT scores soared. 
   Moreover, it gives them the confidence that they can handle advanced math and science and other subjects that unfortunately women sometimes have felt uneasy about, even though obviously girls and women have every ability in the world to handle such subjects. This class has been an enormous success for the girls at Presque Isle High School. 
   Unfortunately, a few years ago, the Department of Education objected to this class despite the fact that it was showing such enormous results for the young women who were enrolled in it. They were taught by a very gifted teacher, Donna Lisnik, who has subsequently gone on to be the principal of a school in Aroostook County. But she was the one who originated this course. 
   The Department of Education objected because it was a same-sex class. They have been able to get around that. But that shouldn't require a waiver or a circumvention of the law. 
   The amendment of the Senator from Texas would cure this situation. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small Rural Hospital Program Improvement Act, which is intended to make critically important changes to Medicare payment policies for rural hospitals. 
   Mr. President, most hospitals in rural America serve a large number of Medicare patients. Medicare payments to these hospitals, however, are not always adequate to cover the cost of the services they provide. The legislation I am introducing today will increase Medicare payments to small, rural hospitals in Maine and elsewhere by enabling more of them to qualify for enhanced reimbursements under the Medicare Dependent, Small Rural Hospital Program. 
   Rural hospitals are the anchors of small towns and communities across America. Not only are they the mainstay of the local health care delivery system, but they are also often the major employers in their communities. Rural communities have unique characteristics and special needs, and their hospitals face tremendous challenges every day as they work to provide the highest quality health care to their patients in the face of sometimes discouraging odds. 
   Rural communities tend to have higher concentrations of elderly persons and higher levels of poverty. Rural residents also tend to have higher rates of certain health problems than people living in urban areas. For example, deaths and disabilities resulting from injury are more common, and rural residents also tend to experience higher rates of chronic disease and disability. Rural providers also face unique challenges in the delivery of health care services, given the great distances and extreme weather conditions that often prevail, particularly in states like Maine. Shortages of physicians, nurses and other health professionals make it difficult to ensure that rural residents have access to all of the care that they need. And finally, Medicare reimbursement policies tend to favor urban areas and fail to take the special needs of rural providers into account. 
   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 has posed additional challenges for rural areas. Deep Medicare payment reductions and mounting regulatory requirements have damaged our fragile rural health care delivery system, and, in particular, our rural hospitals and home health agencies. While the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 did provide some much-needed relief, we should take further steps to ensure that these rural providers receive more equitable Medicare payments. 
   One relatively simple, but nevertheless important step we can take is to update the antiquated and arbitrary classification requirements that prevent otherwise-qualified hospitals from receiving assistance under the Medicare Dependent, Small Rural Hospital program. Under this program, small rural hospitals that treat relatively high proportions of Medicare patients qualify for enhanced Medicare reimbursements. To qualify as a Medicare Dependent Hospital, a hospital must be located in a rural area, not be a sole community hospital, have 100 or fewer beds, and have been dependent on Medicare for at least 60 percent of its inpatient days or discharges in 1987. 
   The requirement that the hospital must have had at least 60 percent of its hospital discharges or patient days attributable to Medicare beneficiaries in 1987 is what creates the problem. Using 1987 as a base year erects an arbitrary barrier that prevents many small rural hospitals that otherwise 
   meet the criteria from participating in this program. As an example, despite the fact that most of the small rural hospitals in Maine treat a disproportionate share of Medicare beneficiaries, none of them currently qualifies for this program. Not a single one. 
   The legislation I am introducing today modifies and updates the 60 percent requirement and bases eligibility for the Medicare Dependent, Small Rural Hospital program on Medicare discharges or patient days during any of the three most recently audited cost report periods rather than fiscal year 1987. In addition, the bill would make the program, which currently is only authorized through FY 2006, permanent. According to the Maine Hospital Association, if updated in this way, nine Maine hospitals will be eligible for the program, which would make them eligible for over $9 million additional Medicare dollars. 
   Increasing Medicare payment rates is critically important to the hospitals in Maine. For the past several years, Maine has ranked 49th or 50th in the nation in terms of Medicare reimbursement-to-cost ratios. For example, while hospitals in some states received more from Medicare in 1996 than it cost them to provide care to older and disabled Medicare patients, Maine's hospitals were only reimbursed 80 cents for every $1.00 they actually spent caring for Medicare beneficiaries. 
   As a consequence, Maine's hospitals have experienced a serious Medicare shortfall in recent years. The Maine Hospital Association anticipates a $174 million Medicare shortfall in 2002, which will force Maine's hospitals to shift costs on to other payers in the form of higher hospital charges. This Medicare shortfall is one of the reasons that Maine has among the highest insurance premiums in the nation. 
   Maine's poor Medicare margin is not due to high hospital costs. In fact, the current system tends to penalize Maine hospitals for their efficiency. For example, at $5,232, Maine's cost per discharge is slightly under the national average of $5,241, and is well below the Northeast average of $5,517. 
   The legislation I am introducing today will not solve Maine's Medicare shortfall problem, but it will help to close the gap. It will also enable many more small rural hospitals across the country to benefit from this program, which will help to ensure continued access to high quality hospital care for all rural Americans.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my distinguished colleague from New York, Senator SCHUMER, to offer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that addresses  perhaps what is the most pressing transportation problem facing America today; that is, the outrageously high cost of gasoline. 
   Retail gasoline prices have skyrocketed over the past months to a nationwide average of $1.63 per gallon. In my hometown of Caribou, ME, a gallon of regular unleaded gas costs $1.68. And that's if you pump your own. In the Midwest, gasoline prices have exceeded $2 a gallon. Yesterday, gasoline futures hit a 9 1/2 -year high on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Yet, just last year, gasoline prices averaged only 99 cents per gallon. What a difference a year can make. 
   This past March, Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson assured the nation that we would enjoy declining gasoline prices over the spring and summer and promised that we would not see gasoline prices at $2 per gallon. Unfortunately, $2 is exactly what many Americans now pay for a gallon of gas. 
   These high prices are the result of steadily increasing crude oil prices which, in turn, have been caused by OPEC's anticompetitive activity. Since the second quarter of 1999, OPEC has cut production by over 3 million barrels per day in a deliberate attempt to raise prices. Well, the strategy has worked. Although OPEC countries sold 5 percent less oil in 1999, their profits were up 38 percent. And the profits keep rolling in. 
   Early last fall, Senator SCHUMER and I began warning the Clinton administration that OPEC's production squeeze would have far-reaching, detrimental impacts on our economy. At that time, oil prices already were beginning to rise, and U.S. inventories were falling. Throughout the winter, Mainers and all Americans who heat with oil suffered from the highest distillate prices in a decade. 
   The administration's lack of a response has been as perplexing as it is disappointing. Last winter, Secretary Richardson admitted that the ``Federal Government was not prepared. We were caught napping.'' This is an astonishing explanation for the administration's lack of leadership. And now it's time for the administration to wake up. 
   The administration's ``energy diplomacy'' policy has proven to be a failure. 
   On March 27, the OPEC nations agreed to increase production, but at a level that still falls well short of world demand. At the time, Secretary Richardson proclaimed that the administration's policy of ``quiet diplomacy'' had worked and forecast price declines of 11 to 18 cents per gallon by mid-summer. Thus far, exactly the opposite has occurred. Gasoline prices are up some 12 cents per gallon since the OPEC announcement. Now predictions are not so rosy. As the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration candidly noted in its June 2000 short-term energy outlook, ``we now recognize that hopes for an early peak in pump prices this year have given way to expectations of some continued increases in June and possibly July.'' 
   Moreover, the EIA's June report warns that OPEC's anticompetitive scheme could place us next winter once again in the midst of another diesel fuel and home heating oil crisis. The report predicts that world oil consumption will continue to outpace production throughout this year resulting in, and I quote, ``extremely low inventories by the end of the year, leaving almost no flexibility in the world oil system to react to a cutoff in oil supplies somewhere or an extreme cold snap during next winter.'' 
   It is past time for this administration to shift gears from quiet diplomacy to active engagement. The oil crisis we have faced for over a year underscores the fact that this administration has no energy policy, much less one designed to address the needs of America in the 21st century. Americans deserve a long-term, sustainable, cogent energy policy. But, in the short term, they also deserve some price relief. The amendment Senator SCHUMER and I have offered would do just that. 
   The amendment is straightforward. It addresses the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of Energy should use his authority to release some oil from our massive Strategic Petroleum Reserve through time exchanges, or ``swaps.'' The immediate commencement of a swaps policy would bring oil prices down while providing a buffer against OPEC's supply manipulations. Moreover, a well-executed swaps plan could, over time increase our reserve from its current level of 570 million barrels, at no cost to taxpayers. 
   Mr. President, the swaps approach advocated by our amendment would also give the administration leverage it has refused to bring to bear on the OPEC cartel. Quiet diplomacy has not worked. OPEC already has broken a commitment it gave to Secretary Richardson to increase production further if crude oil prices hit the levels they have reached over the past month. OPEC is scheduled to meet again on June 21 in Vienna. We need to show OPEC that we will not sit idly by as the cartel manipulates our markets and gouges us at the pump. The amendment Senator SCHUMER and I have offered is designed to send a strong signal to OPEC nations and to provide relief to the American consumer. 
   Mr. President, I am aware this amendment is subject to a procedural point of order, and therefore, 
   Senator SCHUMER and I will be withdrawing it. Nevertheless, it is a very important issue. 
   I commend the Senator from New York for his leadership in working on this issue for so many months. We will continue our efforts. We are writing, once again, to the President, to urge him to immediately implement a swap plan as proposed by our amendment. 
   For the sake of all Americans who have felt the squeeze of skyrocketing oil and gas prices, we sincerely hope that the time has finally come for the administration to heed our call.

   Ms. COLLINS. I would like to take a moment to discuss with the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations the potential needs of the Army National Guard and the Special Forces Groups, in particular the 10th and the 20th Special Forces Groups, for a short take-off and landing, fixed wing aircraft to meet their training and mission requirements. Special Forces units, in particular, require such aircraft to get in and out of ``hot spots'' and other situations and areas where no landing field exists.

   Ms. COLLINS. I am concerned that the Special Forces Groups and the Army National Guard do not have sufficient aircraft available to meet their needs. In fact, I have been informed that, between October of 1998 and September of 1999, the 10th and the 20th Special Forces Groups could not support 23 missions because of the lack of aviation support available. As such, I would ask that the Army National Guard and the Special Forces Groups assess their needs for a short take-off and landing fixed wing aircraft and, in particular, the C-212 STOL fixed wing aircraft. I ask further that the Army National Guard and the Special Forces Groups report to Congress on the results of their assessments within six months so that we can determine whether funds should be appropriated in fiscal year 2002 for the purchase of such aircraft. Mr. Chairman, do you support such an assessment and report to Congress?

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss with the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee the provision of the FY 2001 Defense appropriations bill that defers full funding for two LPD 17 class vessels. The Landing Platform Dock (LPD) 17, San Antonio class, is the latest class of amphibious force ship for the United States Navy. This ship shoulders the critical mission of transporting marines, helicopters, and air-cushioned landing craft to trouble spots around the world. Moreover, the LPD 17 is a model of acquisition reform. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am very concerned about the deferral of funds that would have been used to procure two LPD 17 class ships in fiscal year 2001. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, what is the nature of your commitment to this program?

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. Chairman, shipbuilders in my home State and others have stressed the criticality of the LPD 17 Program to their workforce over the next six to eight years as they strive to transition successfully between maturing programs and the construction of the next generation of ships. I am concerned that any delay in the LPD 17 schedule may, in fact, affect the rates and costs of the various Navy shipbuilding programs and cause workers to lose their jobs. How have you addressed these concerns in this bill?

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, breast cancer is second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer-related deaths among American women. This year, an estimated 182,800 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed and 40,800 women will die of this terrible disease. In addition, an estimated 12,800 new cases of cervical cancer will be diagnosed this year, and 4,600 American women will die of this disease. Many of these deaths could be avoided by making sure that cancer detection and treatment services are readily available to all women at risk. 
   Early detection is currently the best way to combat breast and cervical cancer. If women age 50 and over obtain regular screening for breast cancer, up to 30 percent of breast cancer deaths could be prevented. Moreover, virtually all cervical cancer deaths could be prevented through regular screening. 
   In recognition of the value of screening and early detection, Congress passed the Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act of 1990, which established the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. This important program has provided over two million screening tests to low-income and underserved women in all 50 States since its inception, and over 6,000 cases of breast cancer and over 500 cases of invasive cervical cancer have been diagnosed. In Maine, more than 8,300 women have been screened and 28 cases of breast cancer and 12 cases of cervical cancer have been detected through this program. 
   As one Maine woman observed:  
   This screening program was an answered prayer. I had been concerned about having to skip checkups lately, but there was no way to come up with the money anytime soon. I will gladly tell all of my friends about this and will gladly return for follow-up.  
   The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program has provided cancer screening services to more than one million low-income American women who, like the woman from Maine, otherwise might not have been able to have these critically important tests. Unfortunately, however, the program does not currently pay for treatment services for women with abnormal screening results. Since the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program is targeted to low-income women, many do not have health insurance and many more are underinsured. While States participating in the program have been diligent and creative in finding treatment services for these women, a study done for CDC found that, while treatment was eventually found for almost all of the women screened, some women did not get treated at all, some refused treatment, and some experienced delay. 
   Screening must be coupled with treatment if it is to save lives. As we approach the 10th anniversary of the enactment of the Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Act, it is time for Congress to complete what it started by enacting legislation to ensure that women diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer through the screening program will have coverage for their treatment. That is why I am pleased to be a cosponsor of S. 662, the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act, which would give States the option of providing Medicaid coverage for the duration of breast and cervical cancer treatment to eligible women who were screened and diagnosed through the CDC program. This legislation is not a mandate for States. It simply lets States know that, if they do decide to provide treatment services for these women, the Federal Government will be there to help with an enhanced Federal Medicaid match for these services. 
   Mr. President, S. 662 has strong bipartisan support with 66 Senate cosponsors. Moreover, last month the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed similar legislation. I want to commend the Senate Finance Committee chairman and the Senate majority leader for making a commitment to move this legislation this year, and I urge them to schedule committee action and Senate floor time soon so that S. 662 can be signed into law this summer. There would be no better way to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program in August than by enacting this important bill to provide the treatment necessary to save the lives of the women who are screened and diagnosed with cancer through this program.

   Ms. COLLINS. I yield 6 minutes off of the manager's time. Mr. President, I will start by commending the conferees on this legislation for their tremendous hard work. They have worked very hard to resolve many of the issues involved in this very complex bill, and they have made tremendous progress. I find it incredible that we are not allowing the conference time to complete its work when they have, indeed, made such progress. 
   The Senate-passed bill accomplishes three major goals: First, it would protect patients' rights and hold HMOs accountable for providing the care they promise. As Senator FRIST says, our legislation would get people the care they need when they need it. You should not have to hire a lawyer and file a lawsuit and wait years in order to get the health care you need. Instead, our bill has a quick appeals process to help people get the care they need when they need it, without resorting to an expensive lawsuit. 
   Second, our legislation would improve health care quality and outcomes. 
   Third--and this is the critical difference between the two approaches being discussed today--our legislation would expand, not contract, access to health care. The fact is that costs matter. We cannot respond to the concerns about managed care in a way that resorts to unduly burdensome Federal controls and excessive lawsuits that drive up the cost of insurance so that we cause people to lose access to health care altogether. That is the crux of this debate. 
   We have a growing number of uninsured Americans in this country. There are 44 million uninsured Americans--the 
   highest number in a decade. In my home State of Maine, 200,000 Mainers are without insurance. I have met with so many employers who have told me that if the Kennedy legislation passes, they will drop their health care plans. They simply cannot afford to be exposed to endless costly lawsuits in return for providing a health care benefit. 
   Just yesterday, I met with a manufacturer from Maine who has 130 employees. He is a good employer. He provides an excellent health care plan. But he told me that if he is going to be exposed to endless liability and endless lawsuits, then he will no longer provide that health insurance to his employees. Many other employers will respond the same way. 
   So the problem is, if we pass the Kennedy bill, we will drive up the cost of health insurance that will make it further out of reach for those uninsured  Americans who already can't afford health insurance, and we will add to the number of uninsured Americans because of employers being forced to drop coverage. I can't imagine that that is a result we want. We should be seeking ways to expand access to health insurance, not imposing additional costs and new burdens that make it even more difficult for employers--particularly small businesses--to provide this important benefit. 
   Mr. President, let me also comment on the scope of this bill. Time and time again, I have heard our colleagues on the other side of the aisle say, oh, this bill doesn't protect millions of Americans. The fact is that every single American who is under an employer plan, under our legislation, would have the right to an appeals process as set forth in this bill. And that applies whether or not the plan is under a State regulation or in a State self-funded plan. That appeals right--which is the heart of our legislation, the single most important reform to ensure that people get the care they need when they need it--applies across the board. 
   Where the legislation differs is on the question of whether we should preempt--just wipe out--the good work that State governments have done in the area of patient protection. States have acted to provide specific consumer protections without any prod or mandate from Congress. In fact, 47 States have already passed legislation prohibiting gag clauses from being included in health insurance plans. 
   Why do we need to preempt that good work? We should recognize that it isn't a one-size-fits-all approach, that, indeed, a health insurance mandate in one State may not be appropriate in another. For example, the State of Florida, which has a high rate of skin cancer, provides for direct access to a dermatologist. That isn't a big problem in my State. Yet we have other needs. Each State has been able to tailor its health insurance plan. 
   Indeed, it has been States that have been responsible for the regulation of insurance for over 50 years. I daresay they have done a far better job in protecting the consumers of their States than we would have if we turned over the regulation of insurance to the Health Care Finance Administration. Do we really want to have Washington regulating health insurance in each of the 50 States? That is what the Kennedy bill would do. 
   There is a better way. We should enact a Patients' Protection Bill of Rights this year. We should protect a bill that is like the Senate bill. I am confident that, given time, the conferees will accomplish that goal. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

    Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I recently had the honor to serve as national co-chair, along with Senator Byron Dorgan, of the National Selection Committee for the Prudential Spirit of Community Awards. This wonderful program, sponsored in partnership by The Prudential Insurance Company of America and the National Association of Secondary School Principals, recognizes outstanding young volunteers at the state and national level. Two state winners, one high school student and one middle school student, receive a $1,000 scholarship, a silver medallion, and a 4-day all expense paid trip to Washington, D.C. for themselves and their parents. 
   Chairing the National Selection Committee was both an eye-opening and a heart-warming experience. Reading about these young people's volunteer efforts, the remarkable sacrifices they made for the benefit of their communities, and the lessons they learned reaffirmed my faith in the generosity of the American spirit and in our future. I would like to commend Maine's two Spirit of Community award winners, Desirae Plourde of Fort Kent and Zachary Growe of Hampden, for being real American heroes. 
   Desirae, a senior at Fort Kent Community High School, has spent over 1,500 hours serving as a sign language interpreter for a hearing-impaired classmate who plays on her school's basketball, baseball, and soccer teams. Desirae, the only other student who knows sign language, attended a game one day and noticed how her friend struggled to understand her coach and fellow players, and how frustrated the team became when trying to communicate. She offered to interpret for him so that he could continue to play sports, and the school could benefit from his athletic talent. ``I was inspired to help because I saw my friend was in need and how much he loved playing the game,'' Desirae said. ``I share in his joy when he makes a great play and when the team wins.'' 
   Zachary, an eighth grader at Reeds Brook Middle School in Hampden, helped coordinate a campaign that collected 800 used books for needy children. Zach says he enjoys reading so much that he can't imagine not owning a book. When his class decided to plan a service project, he pushed for a book drive. Zach and his fellow students wrote a plan and a time line, contacted school officials, designed promotional signs, and decorated book drop boxes. In the end, the drive yielded more than four times its original goal of 200 books. Zach and the group delivered the books to many area organizations including a local pediatric ward, and the local chapter of United Cerebral Palsy. 
   I am very proud of Maine's two honorees, Desirae and Zach, and congratulate them for answering the call of service and making a real difference in their communities.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 4489, the ``Immigration and Naturalization Service Data Management Improvement Act of 2000.'' Passage of this legislation will repeal Section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and prevent it from ever being implemented. 
   Section 110 of the 1996 Immigration law was intended to track individuals who overstay their legally permissible visit in the U.S. However, to accomplish that well-intentioned goal, this law required all foreign travelers or U.S. permanent residents to be individually recorded at ports of entry. In practical effect, the provisions would bring traffic to a halt on the Canadian border for miles. 
   Those of us who represent states along the Canadian border are well-aware of the close bonds between the U.S. and Canada. The U.S.-Canadian border is the longest continuous open border in the free world and Canadians come into our country freely and easily under current U.S. policy. In Maine, our ties with Canada are particularly deep because many Mainers' extended families live across the border in Canada. Our current border-crossing policy allows these family members to quickly and easily cross the border every day in order to be with a husband, wife, a brother, a sister, cousin or even in-laws as the case may be. 
   Canada is not only our friend and ally, but our largest trading partner--it is important to maintain and foster our relationship with our neighbor to the North by promoting U.S.-Canadian friendship and trade. The ill-thought out provisions passed as part of the 1996 immigration law would grossly delay  all those crossing the Northern border from Canada, and injure the Northern economy as critical trade and travel routes are slowed. In my State of Maine, this new border policy would have the most immediate impact on border communities such as Calais, Houlton, Madawaska, Fort Kent, and Jackman. Businesses in these communities rely on Canadians to cross the border each and every day in order to buy their goods and services. In addition, the impact on critical Maine trade, including lumber and tourism, would extend beyond these communities and reverberate across my State. 
   The bill we consider today, H.R. 4489, the Immigration and Naturalization Service Data Management Improvement Act of 2000, repeals Section 110 of the Immigration law. In its place, the bill directs the Immigration and Naturalization Service to amass data already collected at entrance and departure points in an electronically searchable manner. The legislation explicitly states no new documentary requirements or data collection can be directed as a result of the passage of this bill, ensuring that INS new database will rely on already available data. 
   Those of us who represent the northern regions of our country have been working for over four years now to repeal Section 110. With the support of Senate colleagues, the deadline for implementation of the entry/exit control system for land and sea points of entry has been postponed until March 31, 2001. But until now, we have been unable to break the impasse that left Section 110 in place. I salute all the efforts which have yielded this ground breaking agreement today, particularly the hard work of Senator ABRAHAM who has worked tirelessly on this issue. I look forward to passage of H.R. 4489, and a final end to the threat to the economy posed by Section 110 of the 1996 Immigration law. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself, Senator DODD, Senator HUTCHINSON, Senator WELLSTONE, Senator MURKOWSKI, Senator TORRICELLI, Senator DORGAN, Senator LIEBERMAN and Senator MOYNIHAN, to introduce the Organ Procurement Organization Certification Act of 2000 to improve the performance evaluation and certification process that the Health Care Financing Administration currently uses for organ procurement organizations. 
   Our nation's 60 organ procurement organizations (OPOs) play a critical role in procuring and placing organs and are therefore key to our efforts to increase the number and quality of organs available for transplant. They provide all of the services necessary in a particular geographic region for coordinating the identification of potential donors, requests for donation and recovery and transport of organs. The professionals in the OPOs evaluate potential donors, discuss donation with family members, and arrange for the surgical removal of donated organs. They are also responsible for preserving the organs and making arrangements for their distribution according to national organ sharing policies. Finally, the OPOs provide information and education to medical professionals and the general public to encourage organ and tissue donation to increase the availability of organs for transplantation. 
   According to the Institute of Medicine's (IOM's) 1999 report on organ procurement and transplantation, a major impediment to greater accountability and improved performance on the part of OPOs is the current lack of a reliable and valid method for assessing donor potential and OPO performance. 
   The current certification process for OPOs sets an arbitrary, population-based performance standard for certifying OPOs based on donors per million of population in their service areas. It sets a standard for acceptable performance based on five criteria: donors recovered per million, kidneys recovered per million, kidneys transplanted per million, extrarenal organs (heart, liver, pancreas and lungs) recovered per million, and extrarenal organs transplanted per million. The HCFA assesses the OPOs' adherence to these standards every two years. Each OPO must meet at least 75 percent of the national mean for four of these five categories to be recertified as the OPO for a particular area and to receive Medicare and Medicaid payments. Without HCFA certification, an OPO cannot continue to operate. 
   The GAO, the IOM, the Harvard School of Public Health and others all have criticized HCFA's use of this population-based standard to measure OPO performance. According to the GAO, ``HCFA's current performance standard does not accurately assess OPOs' ability to meet the goal of acquiring all usable organs because it is based on the total population, not the number of potential donors, within the OPO's service areas.'' 
   OPO service areas vary widely in the distribution of deaths by cause, underlying health conditions, age, and race. These variations can pose significant advantages or disadvantages to an OPO's ability to procure organs, and a major problem with HCFA's current performance assessment is that it does not account for these variations. An extremely effective OPO that is getting a high yield of organs from the potential donors in its service area may appear to be performing poorly because it has a disproportionate share of elderly people or a high rate of people infected with HIV or AIDS, which eliminates them for consideration as an organ donor. At the same time, an ineffective OPO may appear to be performing well because it is operating in a service area  with a high proportion of potential donors. 
   For example, organ donors typically die from head trauma and accidental injuries, and these rates can vary dramatically from region to region. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 1991, the number of drivers fatally injured in traffic accidents in Maine was 15.54 per 100,000 population. In Mississippi, however, it was 30.56, giving the OPO serving that state a tremendous advantage over the New England Organ Bank, which serves Maine. 
   Use of this population-based method to evaluate OPO performance may well result in the decertification of OPOs that are actually excellent performers. Moreover, unlike other HCFA certification programs, the certification process for OPOs lacks a clearly defined due process component for resolving conflicts--an OPO that has been decertified has no opportunity for appeal to the Secretary of HHS on either substantive or procedural grounds. The current system therefore forces OPOs to compete on the basis of an imperfect grading system, with no guarantee of an opportunity for fair hearing based on their actual performance. This situation pressures many OPOs to focus on the certification process itself rather than on activities and methods to increase donation, undermining what should be the overriding goal of the program. Moreover, the current two-year cycle--which is shorter than other certification programs administered by HCFA--provides little opportunity to examine trends and even less incentive for OPOs to mount long-term interventions. 
   The legislation we are introducing today has four major objectives. First, it imposes a moratorium on the current recertification process for OPOs and on the use of population-based performance measurements. Under our bill, the certification of qualified OPOs will remain in place through January 1, 2002, for those OPOs that have been certified as of January 1, 2000, and that meet other qualification requirements apart from the current performance standards. Second, the bill requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate new rules governing OPO recertification by January 1, 2002. These new rules are to rely on outcome and process performance measures based on evidence of organ donor potential and other relevant factors, and recertification for OPOs shall not be required until they are promulgated. Third, the bill provides an opportunity for an OPO to appeal a decertification to the Secretary on substantive and procedural grounds, and fourth the bill extends the current two-year certification cycle to four years. 
   Mr. PRESIDENT, the bill we are introducing today makes much needed improvements in the flawed process that HCFA currently uses to certify and assess OPO performance, and I urge all of our colleagues to join us in supporting it.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation designed to help commercial fishermen navigate the often choppy waters of the Internal Revenue Code. 
   The legislation I am introducing would make two commonsense changes to our tax laws. First, my legislation would extend a $1,500 tax credit to commercial fishermen to assist them in the purchase of important safety equipment. 
   Commercial fishermen engage in one of the most dangerous professions in America. They have a higher fatality rate than even firefighters, police officers, truck or taxi drivers. From 1994 to 1998, 396 commercial fishermen lost their lives while fishing. Last year, in the wake of catastrophic events that killed 11 fishermen over the course of only 1 month, the Coast Guard Fishing Vessel Casualty Task Force was convened. The task force issued a report that draws several conclusions about current fishing vessel safety. Despite the grim safety statistics surrounding the profession of fishing, the report concludes that most fishing deaths are preventable. One significant way to prevent these tragic deaths is to make safety equipment on commercial fishing vessels more widely available. 
   As those of us who represent States with commercial fishing industries may recall, in 1988, Congress passed the Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Safety Act. This act required lifesaving and firefighting equipment to be placed on board all fishing boats. Unfortunately, the cost of some of the safety equipment has proven to be a serious practical impediment for many commercial fishermen. The margin of profit for some commercial fishermen is simply too narrow and they simply lack the funds required to purchase the expensive safety equipment they require. 
   Moreover, as the fishing industry has come under increasingly heavy Federal regulation, fishermen have often felt compelled to greatly increase their productivity on those days when they are permitted to fish. As a result, too many take dangerous risks in order to earn a living. 
   Just this last January, in my home State of Maine, a terrible and tragic incident highlighted the critical importance of safety equipment. Two very experienced fishermen tragically drowned off Cape Neddick when their commercial fishing vessel capsized during a storm. The sole survivor of this tragedy was the fisherman who was able to correctly put on an immersion suit, a safety suit that the Coast Guard has required on cold water commercial fishing boats since the early 1990s. 
   In fact, immersion suits, liferafts, and emergency locater devices have been credited with saving more than 200 lives since 1993. By providing a $1,500 tax credit for fishermen to purchase safety equipment, my legislation would encourage the wider availability and use of safety equipment on our Nation's commercial fishing boats. We should take this sensible step to help ensure that fishermen do not set off without essential safety gear. 
   The second provision of my bill would eliminate some of the perils that the Tax Code has that particularly affect commercial fishermen. I propose to allow fishermen to use income-averaging tax provisions that are now available to our Nation's farmers. For tax purposes, income averaging allows individuals to carry back income from a boom year to a prior less prosperous year. This tax treatment assists individuals who must adapt to wide fluctuations in their income from year to year by preventing 
   them from being pushed into higher tax brackets in random good years. 
   Until 1986, both farmers and fishermen were covered under the Tax Code's income-averaging provisions. However, income averaging disappeared as part of the tax restructuring undertaken in 1986. In 1997, income-averaging provisions were again reintroduced into our Tax Code, but unfortunately, under the changes in the 1997 law, only farmers were permitted to benefit from this tax relief. The Tax and Trade Relief Extension Act of 1998 permanently extended this tax relief provision, but again only for our farmers. 
   Although I am very pleased that Congress has restored income averaging for our Nation's farmers, I do not believe our fishermen should be left out in the  cold and excluded from using income averaging. The legislation that I introduce today would restore fairness by extending income averaging to our fishermen as well as our farmers. 
   Parallel tax treatment for fishermen and farmers is appropriate for many reasons. Currently, unlike farmers, fishermen's sole tax protection to handle fluctuations in income are found in the Tax Code's net operating loss provisions. These provisions do not provide the tax benefits of income averaging and are so complex in their computation that it often defies the ability of any individual without a CPA after his or her name. 
   Most importantly, both farm and fishing income can fluctuate widely from year to year due to a wide range of uncontrollable circumstances, including market prices, the weather and, in the case of fishing, Government restrictions. 
   I urge my colleagues to help our fishermen cope with the fluctuations in their income by restoring this important tax provision and by extending a safety tax credit to help protect them from the hazards that their fishing profession entails.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my friend from Wisconsin, Senator FEINGOLD, in introducing the Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act of 2000, which is intended to improve access to automated external defibrillators in small communities to boost the survival rates of individuals who suffer cardiac arrest. 
   We are very pleased to be joined in introducing this legislation by the following cosponsors: Senators MURRAY, ABRAHAM, WELLSTONE, HUTCHINSON, DORGAN, GRAMS, BINGAMAN, CHAFEE and ENZI. 
   Heart disease is the leading cause of death both in the State of Maine and nationwide. According to the American Heart Association, an estimated 250,000 Americans die each year from cardiac arrest. Many of these deaths could be prevented if AEDs were more accessible. AEDs are computerized devices that can shock a heart back into the normal rhythm and restore life to a cardiac arrest victim. They must, however, be used promptly. For every minute that passes before a victim's normal heart rhythm is restored, his or her chance of survival falls by as much as 10 percent. 
   We have a number of new and improved technologies in our arsenal of weapons to fight heart disease, including a new generation of small, easy-to-use AEDs that can strengthen the chances of survival. These new devices make it possible not only for emergency medical personnel, but also trained lay rescuers, to deliver defibrillation safely and effectively. The new AEDs are safe, effective, lightweight, low maintenance, and relatively inexpensive. Moreover, they are specifically designed so they can be used by nonmedical personnel, such as police, firefighters, security guards, and other lay rescuers, providing they have been trained properly. 
   According to the American Heart Association, making AEDs standard equipment in police cars, firetrucks--as I know the Presiding Officer has done in his hometown--ambulances, and other emergency vehicles, and getting these devices into more public places could save more than 50,000 lives a year. 
   Last December, the Bangor Mall installed an AED that is one of the first of these devices in Maine to be placed in a public setting outside the direct control of emergency medical personnel and hospital staff. Both the AED and an oxygen tank are kept inside a customer service booth, which is in an area of the mall where there is a high concentration of traffic and where heart emergencies might occur. Mall personnel have also received special training and, during mall hours, there is always at least one person who has been certified in both CPR and defibrillator use. 
   For at least one Bangor woman, this has been a lifesaver. On January 12th, just weeks after the AED was installed, two shoppers at the Mall collapsed in a single day. One was given oxygen and quickly revived. But the other shopper was unconscious and had stopped breathing. The trained mall staff--Maintenance Supervisor Larry Lee, Security Chief Dusty Rhodes, and General Manager Roy Daigle--were only able to detect a faint pulse. They quickly commenced CPR and attached the AED. 
   It is important to note that defibrillation is intended to supplement, not replace standard CPR. These devices, which are almost completely automated, run frequent self-diagnostics and will not allow the administration of shock unless the victim's recorded heart pattern requires it. When the AED is attached, it automatically analyzes the victim's vital signs. One of two commands will then be voiced and displayed by the unit: ``Shock advised--charging''; or ``Shock not advised--continue CPR.'' 
   In the Bangor Mall case, the shock was not advised, so CPR was continued until the emergency medical personnel arrived. The EMT's told Mr. Daigle, the General Manager of the mall, that the woman--who had had a heart attack and subsequently required triple by-pass surgery--simply would not have survived if they had not been so prepared. As Mr. Daigle observed, ``Twelve to fifteen minutes is just too long to wait for the emergency services to arrive.'' 
   Cities across America have begun to recognize the value of fast access to AEDs and are making them available to emergency responders. In many small and rural communities, however, limited budgets and the fact that so many rely on volunteer organizations for emergency services can make acquisition and appropriate training in the use of these life-saving devices problematic. 
   The legislation that Senator FEINGOLD and I are introducing today is intended to increase access to AEDs and trained local responders for smaller towns and rural areas in Maine and elsewhere where those first on the scene may not be paramedics or others who would normally have AEDs. Our bill provides $25 million over three years, to be given as grants to community partnerships consisting of local emergency responders, police and fire departments, hospitals, and other community organizations. This money could then be used to help purchase AEDs and train potential responders in their use, as well as in basic CPR and first aid. 
   I commend the leadership of the Senator from Wisconsin for coming forth with this idea. I am very pleased to join him in introducing this important legislation. 
   The Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act has been endorsed by both the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross as a means of expanding access to these lifesaving devices across rural America. I urge all of our colleagues to join us as cosponsors of the bill.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida. I rise to commend the Senator from Connecticut, the Senator from Florida, the Senator from Arkansas, the Senator from Louisiana, and all of those who have been involved in putting together the Lieberman amendment, for their efforts. It is a typical approach taken by the Senator from Connecticut to so many legislative issues, in that he is looking for a responsible and responsive approach that is innovative and attempts to bridge the partisan gap. 
   I don't support all of the provisions of the Lieberman amendment, but I commend the Senator and his cosponsors for recognizing that we do need to take a new approach, that we need to focus on whether or not our students are learning, rather than focusing on whether paperwork and regulations are complied with. 
   I commend the authors of this legislation for their efforts to focus the debate on giving States and local school boards more flexibility in using Federal funds to meet the greatest need in their communities. I also commend them for focusing on accountability, for making sure our Federal education efforts bear the fruit of increased student achievement, and help to narrow the gap that troubles all of us in the learning of poor children versus those from more affluent communities and affluent families. 
   One of the reasons we need more flexibility in using Federal funds can be found in Maine's experience under two Federal programs. Maine is fortunate in having small classes. In the classes in Maine, on average, the ratio is only 15 to 1. 
   So our problem and challenge is not class size. Yet Maine had to get a waiver to use the Federal class size reduction moneys for professional development which is, in many schools in Maine, a far greater need than the reduction of class size. One school board chair, from a small town in eastern Maine, wrote to me that they have received $6,000 under the Federal Class Size Reduction Program. Clearly, that is not enough to hire a teacher. They did receive permission from the Federal Government to use that effectively for professional development. 
   But my point is, why should this school system, or the State of Maine, have to get permission from the Federal Government to use those funds for the vital need of professional development? 
   The second example I have discussed previously, and it has to do with Maine's effort to narrow the achievement gap between poor and more wealthy students in high schools. Maine has done an outstanding job--and I am proud of this--in narrowing the achievement gap between disadvantaged and more advantaged children in the elementary schools. In fact, it has virtually disappeared. So that is not the need under title I funds for the State of Maine right now. We still, however, have a considerable gap when those title I children get to high school. 
   Maine came up with a very promising approach that was put out by the Maine Commission on Secondary Education that set forth a plan for narrowing the achievement gap among high school students. But, here again, it required a waiver from Federal regulations for Maine to use its funding for this purpose. 
   So, again, I do think we need more flexibility and accountability. I commend my friends on the other side of the aisle for their steps in that direction. I hope we can continue to work and see if it is possible for us to come up with a bipartisan package we could support that would help bridge the partisan gap and make a real difference in the futures of our students. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me express my very sincere appreciation to the chairman of the committee and the ranking minority member for their cooperation in accommodating my amendment this evening. I am very grateful for their efforts. 
   My amendment is very straightforward. It simply removes the Perkins Act from the programs listed under the Straight A's proposal that is in this legislation. 
   I am a strong supporter of the Straight A's approach, but the Perkins Act simply does not belong in Straight A's, and I believe it was probably included as an oversight. There are three  reasons why the Perkins Act should be separated from Straight A's. 
   First of all, the Perkins Act, which funds vocational education, is simply not part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It is not part of the programs that we are reauthorizing. In Maine, and in many other States, secondary vocational education is operated on a parallel, independent system. In Maine, there are even restrictions on the ability of an academic high school to offer vocational education. Moreover, the Perkins Act and the ESEA have very different specific objectives, and they are not easily merged together. 
   The second reason is the Perkins Act authorizes programs at both the secondary and the postsecondary levels. Each State decides how to allocate its Perkins grant. In fact, 56 percent of Perkins funds go for postsecondary education, and in at least one State, all of the Perkins funds are used for postsecondary education. 
   In my State, the funds are allocated equally to secondary and postsecondary education, with the requirement that vocational high schools and technical colleges allocate 30 percent of their funding to training programs operated by the Maine adult education system. 
   The third reason is the Perkins Act was written to be part of the national workforce development efforts and is designed to coordinate it with provisions of the Workforce Investment Act, which the Senate successfully passed in 1998. If we pull out the Perkins Act funding, we will allow the intentions of Congress in redesigning the Workforce Investment Act to go forward. 
   In short, the Perkins Act does not belong in this legislation. It makes sense for us to take out the Perkins Act from the list of programs under Straight A's. It is not part of the ESEA, and as it is used, at least 56 percent of the funds under the Perkins Act do not go to secondary schools but, rather, to postsecondary schools. 
   I thank the chairman and ranking minority member for their cooperation in this effort and particularly for accommodating this amendment this evening. 
   I yield the floor.

I think it is very important to the future of vocational education, which, as the Senator from Massachusetts points out, is so important to so many students and so many adults in this country, and particularly in our section of the country, in New England. 
   With that, I yield the remainder of my time and I urge the adoption of the amendment.

   Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator for yielding for a question. 
   I thank the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from Washington State for their terrific, truly extraordinary leadership on this entire bill. 
   As the Senator from New Hampshire knows, the issue of whether or not Straight A's authorizes Federal funds for private school vouchers was most important to me. I have worked with him and with the Senator from Washington. Indeed, I am the author of the provisions in the Gorton amendment which makes it crystal clear that Federal funds could not be used for vouchers under the Straight A's proposal. 
   Will the Senator from New Hampshire agree with me that while there is nothing in this legislation that prohibits a State from using also its own funds for some sort of voucher proposal, that the Gorton amendment now makes clear that Federal funds under the Straight A's proposal could not be used for private school vouchers?

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the one thing that is certain is that every Member of this Chamber is committed to improving public education in America. In America, we differ on how to accomplish that goal. 
   Over the years, we have enacted Federal program after Federal program. There are dozens of Federal programs on the books, all in the hope of narrowing the gap in achievement between low-income students and high-income students. All of us want to narrow that achievement gap. 
   Each and every person here is committed to providing an equal educational opportunity to every child in America. But we have to look at the record. We have to look at the facts. When we evaluate in what direction we should go, we have to look at from where we have come. 
   The fact is that after 35 years and $120 billion spent on Federal education programs aimed at the disadvantaged, we have not achieved the goal of ensuring that children in high-poverty schools receive a good education. We know that children from poor families have just as many brains as children from wealthier families. We know that they have all the ability in the world. This is not about aptitude. It is not about the ability of these children. The debate is whether or not our current education system has served them well. The evidence suggests overwhelmingly that in too many cases our schools are failing these children. 
   Let's look at the statistics. Seventy percent of children in high-poverty schools scored below even the most basic level of reading. Seventy percent have disadvantaged children that are unlikely to graduate from high school if they are in high-poverty schools in the inner cities. Children in high-poverty schools score two grade levels below their peers in high-income schools when it comes to math and three grade levels when it comes to reading. 
   Again, the problem is not a lack of ability. These children have all the ability in the world. The problem is that we are not meeting their needs. 
   We can continue down the path we followed during the past 35 years--a path paved with good intentions but not producing good results. 
   We can try a new approach. We can try to be innovative. We can get away from the ``Washington knows best'' approach, and empower local school boards, teachers, and parents to work together with State education officials to make a real difference in the lives of these children. That is what our Republican bill would do. 
   I point out again that no State is forced to accept the increased flexibility in designing programs using Federal funds. If a State is content with the status quo, if a State believes that its schools are delivering the best education possible, it can continue with the status quo. It can continue along the path of receiving Federal funds, attached with Federal strings, attached with paperwork, and tied up with redtape. If that works fine with a State, then a State can continue with that system. 
   But a second alternative is for a State to enter into what is known as a performance partnership. 
   Under this approach, a State would have more flexibility in spending Federal dollars and can consolidate some Federal programs as long as the State can show improved student achievement. 
   Under the third and most innovative approach, 15 States would be allowed to participate in what is known as the Straight A's Program. Under Straight A's, a State would have great flexibility in combining Federal funds to meet whatever is the greatest need of that community. 
   The needs differ from community to community. One community may need to hire more math teachers. Another may need to concentrate on improving reading skills. Still a third may need to upgrade the science labs. The needs are not identical from community to community. Straight A's recognizes this and would allow a State to choose to consolidate Federal funds to meet the greatest need of that community. That is what this debate is about. It is about trying a new approach that could help ensure a brighter future for the disadvantaged children of America. That is our goal. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee, the Senator from Vermont, for his leadership in bringing this important legislation to the Senate floor. It is evident from the debate we have already heard that we are going to have, this week, a very vigorous and productive debate on the best way for the Federal Government to improve America's public schools, to improve teaching and learning. I look forward to the adoption of this legislation which will strengthen our K-12 education. 
   No endeavor is more important to our Nation's future than ensuring that all children reach high standards. 
   That is exactly what the legislation before us demands. 
   The Educational Opportunities Act will put children first. That should be our goal as we consider this important legislation. We should put children first so that no child is left behind. 
   I recently had a schoolteacher in eastern Maine give me a pin that I am wearing today that says, ``Children First.'' If we keep that in mind, if that is our goal throughout this debate, then I am confident we will pass this legislation which will make a difference in the public schools of America and to the future of our children. 
   During the past 3 years, I have visited dozens of schools all over the State of Maine, from Kittery at the southern tip, to Jackman in the west, Rockland on the coast, and St. Agatha in the north. In fact, just last Friday, I visited two excellent schools in Kittery, ME, the Frisbee Elementary School and the Shapleigh Middle School, where I talked with students and they asked me wonderful questions for over an hour. It was a wonderful visit to these two schools. 
   I have seen firsthand the excellent jobs that Maine teachers and administrators are doing in educating our children. The quality of instruction taking place in Maine schools is, indeed, impressive, and it is producing results. Maine's scores on national tests and its rate of high school graduation proves that our State's public schools are among the best in the Nation. Moreover, Maine's public schools provide a good education for all of our children regardless of their family income or where they live in our State. 
   The recent report issued by the Council of Chief State School Officers shows that low-income students are performing nearly as well as the average of all Maine public school students, and that, of course, is our goal. 
   An important factor in Maine's success has been its ability to obtain waivers from Federal regulations. Let me repeat that. One reason that Maine schools have been successful is they have been able to get waivers from Federal regulations. Federal regulations in some areas have been an obstacle to their success. It is only because Maine's commissioner of education has been vigilant in trying to get waivers from Federal regulations that he has been able to move forward on a number of fronts to improve Maine's schools. 
   The most recent of the waivers that the State received gave Maine's schools more flexibility to use class-size reduction funds for teacher professional development. This is an option that the bill before us, S. 2, would give to all States. 
   Recently, I had a phone call from the chairman of a school board in a small community in Washington County. She conveyed the appreciation of that school district for the flexibility to use Federal class-size monies for teacher professional development. She put it well. She said: We don't need to reduce class size; what we need is funds for professional development. 
   Indeed, this school system is so small that it only received about $6,000 under the Class Size Reduction Program, not enough to hire a teacher, but they were able to put that money to good use by investing in professional development, a high need in that particular school system. 
   On a larger scale, Maine sought and was granted a waiver from Federal regulations to allow it to use a grant from the Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration Program to support the 
   State's major reform initiative focusing on improving high schools. 
   That was to implement this excellent report that the State produced through its Commission on Secondary Education. It is called ``Promising Futures: A Call for Improving Learning for Maine's Secondary Schools.'' Although Maine has almost eliminated the performance gap between disadvantaged and advantaged students in the elementary schools, the Federal regulations require the State of Maine to use these funds only in the lower grades. 
   Fortunately, Maine was able to receive permission to move ahead on carrying out the recommendations put forth in this report by the Maine Commission on Secondary Education and to go forward with comprehensive reform in title I-eligible high schools. 
   Why should the State of Maine have to go to Washington and get special permission to pursue these critical reforms? That does not make sense. It is the people in Maine who know best what their schools need. The people in Maine, working hard on this commission, decided there needed to be more focus on improving Maine's high schools, and yet Federal regulations were an impediment to achieving that goal. 
   We have what I think of as a ``Mother, may I?'' approach to Federal regulation of our schools. Our States have to beg for permission to move forward. They have to seek waivers of regulations in order to pursue worthwhile programs. 
   The Educational Opportunities Act will give the States this option without the time-consuming and costly administrative burden of seeking waivers from all these Federal regulations. These Federal regulations are well meaning, they are well-intentioned, but too often they act as an impediment to reform. 
   Unfortunately, the performance in many other States' schools lags behind  Maine's with large gaps between the performance of children in high-poverty areas versus low-poverty schools. Our goal as a nation, and the intent of the Educational Opportunities Act, is to help every public school succeed so that every student has the opportunity to achieve his or her full potential. 
   In many cases, education is the difference between prosperity and poverty, hope and despair, dreams fulfilled and lost opportunities. Fueled by the remarkable success of the dot-com generation, many areas of the United States have experienced unparalleled economic growth. However, between Silicon Valley and Wall Street, many Americans still live in the shadows of the new prosperity. Education is the best, perhaps the only way, to close the ever-widening economic gap in America. Indeed, the economic gap in America is largely an education gap. Moreover, education is the best way for us to stoke the fire of our Nation's economic engine. 
   The question before us as we debate the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is: What is the proper role of the Federal Government in promoting excellence in every public school and helping every student succeed? We can all agree that our public schools must do a better job in teaching our children and that the Federal Government must also do a better job in supporting our public schools. The question is: How can we best accomplish that goal? 
   Seventeen years ago, the landmark study, ``A Nation at Risk,'' warned of declining performance in American schools and turned the Nation's eyes toward reforming public education. 
   Today, however, too many schools, particularly in our inner cities, continue to fail to provide a solid education to their students. Although the United States spends more than $660 billion a year on education, nearly 60 percent of our low-income fourth graders cannot read at a basic level. Clearly, reforms are necessary to ensure that every child learns and achieves his or her full potential. 
   Recent polls show that the American public thinks our public schools are in a state of crisis. More than two-thirds of the people surveyed said in a recent poll that they are dissatisfied with the way public education is working, and nearly 50 percent gave our schools only a grade of C. 
   On the bright side, Americans are committed to fixing our public schools and eliminating mediocrity. Nearly every person surveyed said that improving our public schools should be a top priority. 
   The Federal Government clearly takes a back seat to States and communities in terms of funding and overseeing our public schools, and that is how it should be. The Federal role is, nevertheless, important, particularly for helping disadvantaged students. Unfortunately, Washington has not always been helpful, nor has it been successful in achieving that goal. 
   The Elementary and Secondary Education Act, first enacted in 1965 as part of President Lyndon Johnson's war on poverty, is the cornerstone of the Federal involvement in K-12 education. It is intended to provide financial assistance to States and school districts to improve education for children from disadvantaged families. 
   Today, title I remains the largest Federal program, funded at nearly $8 billion annually. But, after 35 years, and $120 billion spent, the results remain a disappointment. 
   The statistics are troubling and should give us pause: 
   Only 13 percent of low-income fourth graders score at or above the proficient level on national reading tests; 
   Two out of three African American and Hispanic fourth graders can barely read; 
   Half of the students from urban school districts fail to graduate on time; and 
   In math, fourth graders in high-poverty schools remain two grade levels behind their peers in low-poverty schools; in reading, they are three grade levels below their peers in schools in better neighborhoods. 
   We can no longer pretend that Federal programs have succeeded. We need a new approach. As these sobering statistics highlight, little progress has been made toward achieving the ESEA's fundamental goal of narrowing the achievement gap between low-income and higher-income students. We know that the gap can be narrowed. We have largely accomplished that goal up to eighth grade in the State of Maine. But, clearly, we are not doing all we can to assist States and communities in reaching this goal. Clearly, the approach we have taken during the past 35 years simply has not worked. 
   The Educational Opportunities Act gives the Senate the potential to do for education what it did for welfare a few years ago: end years of inflexible rules, provide new 
   incentives, and focus Federal dollars on results. 
   Under the current system, Washington requires schools to spend an inordinate amount of time filling out forms and complying with bureaucratic mandates. As a result, our public schools spend more than 48 million hours each year on Federal paperwork. That is 48 million hours that could be spent on students; instead, it is spent on Federal paperwork. 
   The bill before us today will increase the authorization for Federal education funding without adding burdensome restrictions. It will create an environment focused on increased achievement, on results, on student learning, not on more bureaucracy and paperwork, and it will improve our public schools, not abandon them. 
   The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee held many hours of hearings on how to improve the effectiveness of the ESEA. The majority of the committee concluded that individual States, local school boards, teachers, and parents are far better prepared than Washington to make decisions about what their students need. So the committee decided to give States more options. 
   This legislation allows States to choose among three options for how to receive Federal funds. First, a State could decide to continue under the traditional ESEA approach of receiving formula grants for specific Federal programs for specific purposes as well as applying for competitive grants. In other words, if a State is content with the status quo, its schools can continue along that path. No one is forced to adopt a different approach. 
   The second option is for States to apply to the Secretary of Education to enter into a performance partnership. This approach gives States somewhat more flexibility in the use of Federal education dollars in return for an agreement to achieve specific results, in other words, in return for an agreement to show true improvement in student learning. 
   Under the third and what I believe to be the most promising and innovative approach, a State could apply, under the Straight A's Program, to be one of 15 States that will be given even more flexibility in spending Federal funds in return for strict accountability focused on student achievement. That is one of the major philosophical differences we are seeing in this debate. Our bill says that what is important is what students are learning. Showing achievement gains should be the bottom line. 
   Unfortunately, too many on the other side of the aisle are wedded to the old approach which says what is important is having Federal strings attached to every dollar and making sure the paperwork is filled out correctly. 
   The premise underlying the performance partnership and the Straight A's approach is similar. Instead of imposing a one-size-fits-all Federal mandate, the Federal Government would recognize that one community may need more math teachers while another may need to concentrate on improving reading programs, and that still a third may need to upgrade the science labs. The point is, it should be your community's decision, not Washington's. 
   The Educational Opportunities Act frees States from Federal control and redtape but only in exchange for increased student performance, increased student achievement gains. 
   Another important title of S. 2 includes the Teacher Empowerment Act. Other than involved parents, a well-qualified 
   and dedicated teacher is the single most important prerequisite for student success. 
   The lessons are clear. We must encourage talented people to choose teaching as a career and keep them in the classroom. The Teacher Empowerment Act authorizes $2 billion for State and local efforts to improve the quality of teaching. It gives States and communities the freedom to use Federal dollars to provide effective professional development for our teachers; to  prepare, recruit, and retain well-qualified teachers; or to reduce class size--whatever the priority is in that community. 
   Some States are also exploring alternatives to traditional teacher certification. I find it ironic that in public high schools in most States Alan Greenspan could not teach a class on economics, and our distinguished scholarly colleague, Senator MOYNIHAN, could not teach a class on American Government. 
   I am not saying that subject matter expertise alone qualifies someone to teach, but surely we should give incentives to States to be more creative in pursuing alternate routes to certification. Our legislation would do just that. 
   I am particularly pleased that the bipartisan legislation that I introduced to help our Nation's rural schools has been included in this bill. I see my colleague, Senator HUTCHINSON from Arkansas, is on the floor. He is one of the cosponsors of this legislation. 
   Although my commitment extends to every student in every school--whether rural, suburban, or urban--I have a particular concern for the challenges that are unique to small school districts, especially those in rural areas. 
   Smaller rural schools face at least two problems under the current Federal system. First, they often receive very small amounts to carry out federally mandated activities. 
   One Maine school district in Frenchboro, ME, received a whopping $28 to fund a district-wide Safe and Drug Free School program--clearly, not enough to accomplish the goal of that Federal law. 
   Another school district in northern Aroostook County with 400 students receives four separate Federal grants, ranging from $1,900 to $9,500. Not one of these grants is sufficient to implement the goals of the Federal program, and each small amount comes with its own paperwork, redtape, and strings attached. 
   The second problem is that small school districts are essentially shut out of the competitive grant program. They lack the grant writers and other resources necessary to apply for and manage Federal grants that larger school districts are able to seek. 
   My legislation addresses both problems by allowing small school districts to consolidate the Federal funds for local priorities and to receive supplemental funds in lieu of applying for competitive grants. 
   These small rural districts could then use these funds to hire a new math or reading teacher, fund professional development, offer a program for gifted and talented students, purchase computers, or pay for any other activity that meets the community's priorities and needs. 
   I thank the chairman of the committee for including my rural education initiative as part of his chairman's mark. 
   Education is more important now than ever before. A strong K through 12 education prepares students for the postsecondary education they will need to adapt to an increasingly dynamic marketplace and to have choices and opportunities throughout their lives. As Plato said centuries ago: The direction in which education starts a man will determine his future life. 
   I look forward to continuing the debate on the Educational Opportunities Act and to assuring that America's public education system starts all children, from all backgrounds, regions, and income levels, toward a lifetime of learning, contributing to society, and achieving their dreams. 
   I yield the floor.

    Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, Thursday, April 13, is National D.O. Day. I therefore want to take this opportunity to recognize the 45,000 osteopathic physicians (D.O.s) across the country for their contributions to the American healthcare system. For more than a century, D.O.s have made a difference in the lives and health of Americans everywhere. They have treated presidents and Olympic athletes. They have helped to keep children well and have contributed to the fight against AIDS. Today, members of the osteopathic medical profession serve as U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, the chief medical officer for the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army. 
   As fully licensed physicians able to prescribe medication and perform surgery, D.O.s are committed to serving the health needs of rural and underserved communities. They make up 15 percent of the total physician population in towns of 10,000 or less. In addition, 64 percent of D.O.s practice in the primary care areas of medicine, fulfilling a need for more primary care physicians in an era marked by the growth of managed care. Their contributions have been particularly important in rural states like Maine. 
   More than 100 million patient visits are made each year to D.O.s. D.O.s approach their patients as ``whole people.'' They don't just treat a specific illness or injury. D.O.s take into account home and work environments, as well as lifestyle, when assessing overall health. This approach provides Americans with high quality healthcare--patients seen as people, not just an illness or injury. 
   From the state-of-the-art healthcare facility in a major city to a clinic in a rural Maine community, D.O.s continue to practice the kind of medicine that Andrew Taylor Still envisioned over 100 years ago when he founded the profession. 
   It was my pleasure to meet today with two representatives of the osteopathic medical profession visiting our Capitol from Maine. The University of New England, College of Osteopathic Medicine (UNECOM), in Biddeford, is the only medical school in my home state. To the more than 400 osteopathic physicians in Maine, the approximately 1,100 graduates of UNECOM, and the 45,000 D.O.s represented by the American Osteopathic Association--congratulations on your contributions to the good health of the American people. I look forward to working with you to further our mutual goal of improving our nation's health care.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with my friend and colleague, Senator JOHNSON, in introducing the Veterans' Higher Education Opportunities Act of 2000. This legislation will provide our veterans with expanded educational opportunities at a reasonable cost. Endorsed by the 47-member Partnership for Veterans Education, our legislation provides a new model for today's GI bill that is logical, fair, and worthy of a nation that values both higher education and our veterans. 
   The original GI bill was enacted in 1944. As a result of this initiative, 7.8 million World War II veterans were able to take advantage of postservice education and training opportunities, including more than 2 million veterans who went on to college. My own father was among those veterans who served bravely in World War II and then came back home to resume his education with assistance from the GI bill. 
   Since that time, various incarnations of the G.I. Bill have continued to assist millions of veterans in taking advantage of the educational opportunities they put on hold in order to serve their country. New laws were enacted to provide educational assistance to those who served in Korea and Vietnam, as well as to those who served during the period in-between. Since the change to an all-volunteer service, additional adjustments to these programs were made, leading up to the enactment of the Montgomery G.I. Bill in 1985. 
   The value of the educational benefit assistance provided by the Montgomery G.I. Bill, however, has greatly eroded over time due to inflation and the escalating cost of higher education. Military recruiters indicate that the program's benefits no longer serve as a strong incentive to join the military; nor do they serve as a retention tool valuable enough to persuade men and women to stay in the military and defer the full or part-time pursuit of their higher education until a later date. Perhaps most important, the program is losing its value as an instrument for readjustment into civilian life after military service. 
   This point really hit home for me when I recently met with representatives of the Maine State Approving Agency (SAA) for Veterans Education Programs. They told me of the ever increasing difficulties that service members are having in using the G.I. Bill's benefits for education and training. 
   For example, the Maine representatives told me that the majority of today's veterans are married and have children. Yet, the Montgomery G.I. Bill often does not cover the cost of tuition to attend a public institution, let alone the other costs associated with the pursuit of higher education and those required to help support a family. 
   In fact, in constant dollars, with one exception, the current G.I. Bill provides the lowest level of assistance ever to those who served in the defense  of our country. The basic benefit program of the Vietnam Era G.I. Bill provided $493 per month in 1981 to a veteran with a spouse and two children. Twenty years later, a veteran in identical circumstances receives only $43 more, a mere 8% increase over a time period when inflation has nearly doubled, and a dollar buys only half of what it once purchased. 
   To address these problems, we are offering a modern version of the Montgomery G. I. Bill. This new model establishes a sensible, easily 
   understood benchmark for G.I. Bill benefits. The benchmark sets G.I. Bill benefits at ``the average monthly costs of tuition and expenses for commuter students at public institutions of higher education that award baccalaureate degrees.'' This commonsense provision would serve as the foundation upon which future education stipends for all veterans would be based and would set benefits at a level sufficient to provide veterans the education promised to them at recruitment. 
   The current G.I. Bill now provides nine monthly $536 stipends per year for four years. The total benefit is $19,296. Under the new benchmark established by this legislation, the monthly stipend for the this academic year would be $975, producing a new total benefit of $35,100 for the four academic years. 
   Mr. President, today's G.I. Bill is woefully under-funded and does not provide the financial support necessary for our veterans to meet their educational goals. The legislation that we are proposing would fulfill the promise made to our nation's veterans, help with recruiting and retention of men and women in our military, and reflect current costs of higher education. Now is the time to enact these modest improvements to the basic benefit program of the Montgomery G.I. Bill. 
   I urge all members of the Senate to join Senator JOHNSON and myself in support of the Veterans' Higher Education Opportunities Act.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for S. 2323, the Worker Economic Opportunity Act. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation, which has broad bipartisan support in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. 
   In recent years, we have seen substantial growth in the use of employee equity programs such as stock options, stock appreciation rights, and employee stock purchase plans. This growth has not only been in the number of companies which offer such plans, but also in the employees to whom such plans are available. While long used as a form of incentive for corporate executives, equity programs are now available to more employees than ever. In fact, a 1998 survey by Hewitt Associates found that in excess of two-thirds of large U.S. companies offered stock options to non-executive employees, and more than a quarter of these companies make such plans available to their entire workforce. 
   Unfortunately, the Fair Labor Standards Act, which was enacted in 1938, does not recognize the importance of stock options as an employee benefit. Thus, when asked how to deal with stock options when calculating overtime pay for hourly-wage employees, the Department of Labor ruled that the options would have to be included in the calculations. 
   The end result of this decision left employers with two options: One, go through the burdensome task of recalculating an employee's regular pay rate, retroactively, based on the change in the value of the stock from the time the option was granted until it was exercised; or, two, do not offer any form of equity program to any employee who is not exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
   Since complying with the Department of Labor's onerous ruling would not likely be worth the benefit of offering an equity plan, the vast majority of companies would be left to face option two, thus eliminating the use of a benefit that is popular with both employers and employees. 
   Recognizing the need to remedy this matter, for the good of companies and workers alike, a bipartisan group of  legislators worked to craft the bill we have before us today, the Worker Economic Opportunity Act. This legislation would exempt employee equity programs from the overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act, just as profit sharing and holiday bonus plans are exempted. In addition, the bill protects employers who offered employee equity programs prior to the date this legislation is enacted. 
   This legislation will allow employers to offer the kind of benefits which will allow them to attract a quality workforce, while providing employees with a benefit they truly want. It is all too rare for Congress to come up with a win-win solution to a problem, but in this case we certainly have. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas and salute the work she has done on behalf of retail businesses in border communities in Texas on the very issue I am about to discuss. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution seeking parity among the countries that are parties to the North American Free-Trade Agreement with respect to the personal exemption allowance for merchandise purchased by returning residents. I am pleased to be joined today by Senators MOYNIHAN, KYL, GREGG, HUTCHISON, and LEAHY as original cosponsors. 
   NAFTA was intended to remove trade barriers among the countries of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. While some of the goals of NAFTA have been realized, glaring inequities remain. One such inequity that affects small businesses, particularly retailers, located in border communities is the difference in personal exemption allowances permitted by the U.S. versus the allowances permitted by Canada and Mexico. 
   For Maine citizens living near the U.S./Canadian border, moving freely and frequently between the two countries is a way of life. Cross-border business and family relationships abound. The difference in personal exemption allowances, however, puts Maine businesses near the Canadian border at a considerable disadvantage in relation to their Canadian counterparts. Let me explain why. A United States citizen traveling to Canada for fewer than 24 hours is exempt from paying duties on $200 worth of merchandise. For trips over 48 hours, the exemption increases to $400 worth of merchandise. Under our laws, Canadian stores are able to serve both Canadian and American customers and, because of the exemption level, can sell Americans a significant amount of merchandise duty-free. 
   Unfortunately, this situation only works one way. A Canadian citizen is allowed a duty-free personal exemption allowance of only $50 for a 24-hour visit and $200 for a 48-hour visit. This means that a Canadian shopping for the day in the border communities of Fort Kent, Madawaska, or Calais or indeed anywhere in Maine can bring home only $50 worth of merchandise before a duty is imposed. This is a significant deterrent to Canadians who would otherwise shop in Maine communities. 
   This disparity harms many Maine businesses, including Central Building Supplies, a small, family-owned home building materials business that has been in the same location in Madawaska, Maine for 35 years. Its owner wrote to me concerned about this issue. Over the past couple years, his small store has lost sales in kitchen cabinets, windows, wood flooring, and ceramic tile largely due to the inequity in duty allowances and the exchange rate. Whether they are located in the St. John Valley or in Washington County, small businesses cite similar problems. The allowance disparity also hurts stores in the Aroostook Centre Mall and the Bangor Mall, which have traditionally attracted Canadian shoppers. 
   This discrepancy in personal exemption allowances gives an enormous competitive advantage to the Canadian and Mexican retailers. It gives these retailers to our north and the south access to cross-border shoppers while limiting that same opportunity for American retailers. Mr. President, this is not fair trade, and this is not free trade. This parity should be eliminated. 
   The resolution I am submitting today would express the sense of the Senate that the United States Trade Representative and the Secretary of the Treasury should initiate discussions with officials of the Governments of Canada and Mexico to achieve parity with respect to the personal exemption allowance structure. In the event that parity in the personal exemption is not reached within one year after the date of the adoption of this resolution, this resolution would require the United States Trade Representative and the Secretary of the Treasury to submit recommendations to Congress on whether legislative changes are necessary to achieve personal exemption parity. The steps set forth in this resolution would begin to resolve this inequity. I urge my colleagues to support its swift passage. 
   I thank the Senator from Texas for not only yielding but for cosponsoring this resolution.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, 25 years ago, the United States Congress made a commitment to pay each school in America 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure for every special education student it enrolled--Washington promised it would help our local communities meet the cost of educating students with special needs. 
   Unfortunately, the Federal Government has failed to meet this obligation, creating an unfunded mandate that must be borne by every state and community in America. For the current school year the average per pupil expenditure is $6,000, yet we have appropriated only $702 per student only 11.7% of the cost--slightly more than one fourth of out promise. To meet the Federal commitment, the budget resolution should assume an expenditure of $15.8 billion for this year. I commend Senator DOMENICI and the 
   Budget Committee for recognizing the importance of this commitment and for providing a $1 billion increase in fiscal year 2001. But this is not enough, and we must do more--we must embark on a short path to full funding. We have the resources to do it, and the amendment before the Senate starts us on our journey to full funding. 
   What would this mean for our states and local school districts? Let's take Maine as an example. For this year the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act promises Maine $2,400 per student receiving special education services. However, the Federal Government will spend only slightly more than $702 per student--which means that Maine will receive $60 million less than it was promised. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the unmet mandate stands at an astounding $11 billion nationally. We can not continue to shift this burden to our local communities. We must meet the Federal commitment to help pay for special education and end this unfunded mandate. 
   Last month, I met with about 75 superintendents and principals from northern and eastern Maine to discuss the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. What was supposed to be a wide-ranging dialog about Federal funding under the ESEA immediately settled into a discussion about special education. They told me that in each of their schools and districts, meeting the special education mandate requires dollars that otherwise could be used for school construction, teacher salaries, new computers, and other effort to improve the performance of their students. They called on us to meet our promise to help pay for special education. They spoke with one voice in strong, unified support for more special education funding, not for new Federal programs. 
   The Jeffords-Collins amendment would means an additional $155 million for Maine schools over the next five years. Mr. President, we need to meet our commitment to bear our fair share of special education costs. When faced with the siren's call for new Federal programs, we must keep in mind what our parents, teachers, and local administrators have told us. If we want to do something for the children of America, let us fund special education, and our schools will be able to hire their our own teachers and build their own schools. The best thing this Congress can do for education is to move toward fully funding the Federal Government's share of special education--not to stand in place as the President's budget would have us do. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Jeffords-Collins amendment and give our states and local communities the financial help they have been promised and so desperately need. Let's finally keep the promise made more than 25 years ago.

   Ms. COLLINS. I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee. He has done a terrific job. I thank Senator REID as well for yielding me time so I can discuss this very important matter. 
   I am very pleased to be a cosponsor of Senator JEFFORDS' amendment to finally start on the path toward paying the share of special education costs that the Federal Government promised to pay when the legislation was passed 25 years ago. 
   During the last recess of the Senate, I met with more than 70 superintendents and principals from northern and eastern Maine to discuss education issues. Originally, my thought was to discuss the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, but the No. 1 issue on their minds was the escalating costs of meeting the needs of children with special needs, the costs of special education. 
   If the U.S. Government kept the promise it made back in 1975, it would mean an additional $60 million to the schools in the State of Maine. That is money that would free up other money so that schools could meet their own needs--whether this is hiring more teachers, improving their libraries, upgrading their science labs or providing special professional development--whatever the need of that particular school and that particular community. 
   If we take this step of starting to meet our obligations under the special education law, it will make a tremendous difference not only to the schools in Maine but to schools throughout our country. The Jeffords-Collins amendment would mean an additional $155 million to the schools of Maine over the next 5 years. 
   I am very pleased to be an original cosponsor. This has been one of my priorities since my election to the Senate. I know it is the No. 1 priority of the school districts in the State of Maine. 
   I thank my colleagues for making the time available to me. If I have additional time, I yield it back to the chairman of the Budget Committee. I yield the floor.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with 35 of my colleagues tonight to introduce the Home Health Payment Fairness Act to eliminate the automatic 15-percent reduction in Medicare payments to home health agencies that is currently scheduled to go into effect on October 1 of next year. The legislation we are introducing will provide a measure of financial relief for home health agencies across the country that are experiencing acute financial problems that are inhibiting their ability to deliver much needed care to some of the most vulnerable senior citizens in our country. 
   America's home health agencies provide invaluable services that have enabled a growing number of our most frail and vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay where they want to be--in the comfort and security of their own home. 
   Unfortunately, due to cutbacks in the Medicare program, home health agencies in my State and others are having a very difficult time providing services, particularly to elderly people with complex health needs. One has only to look at the statistics from my home State of Maine to see the impact of these very onerous budget cuts, as well as burdensome regulations imposed by the Clinton administration. 
   In Maine, in just over 2 years' time, there has been a 30-percent reduction in home health visits, which has resulted in more than 7,470 senior citizens losing their home health services in my State. There has been a 26-percent reduction in the reimbursements that have been provided to home health agencies in Maine. Mr. President, this situation cannot continue. The home health industry has already made an important contribution to reducing the rate of growth in Medicare spending. In fact, the spending cuts have been far beyond what Congress intended and what the CBO estimated. 
   In 1996, home health was the fastest growing component of Medicare spending. The program grew at an average annual rate of more than 25 percent from 1990 to 1997. As a consequence, the number of home health beneficiaries more than doubled and Medicare home health increased soared from $2.5 billion in 1989 to $17.8 billion in 1997. 
   This rapid growth in home health spending understandably prompted Congress and the Administration, as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, to initiate changes that were intended to slow this growth in spending and make the program more cost-effective and efficient. These measures, however, have produced cuts in home health spending far beyond what Congress intended. Home health spending dropped to $9.7 billion in FY 1999--just about half the 1997 amount. To cut payments by an additional 15 percent would put our already struggling home agencies at risk and would seriously jeopardize access to critical home health services for millions of our nation's seniors. 
   It is now clear that the savings goals set for home health in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have not only been met, but far surpassed. According to the March 2000 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) baseline, Medicare home health payments fell by almost 35 percent in FY 1999, and this was on top of a 15 percent drop in FY 1998. In fact, the CBO cites this ``larger than anticipated reduction in the use of home health services'' as the primary reason that total Medicare spending dropped by one percent last year. The CBO now projects that the post-Balanced Budget Act reductions in home health will be about $69 billion between fiscal years 1998 and 2002. This is over four times the $16 billion that the CBO originally estimated for that time period and is a clear indication that the Medicare home health cutbacks have been far deeper and wide-reaching than Congress ever intended. 
   Moreover, the financial problems that home health agencies have experienced have been exacerbated by a number of burdensome new regulatory requirements imposed by the Health Care Financing Administration, including the implementation of OASIS, the new outcome and assessment information data set; new requirements for surety bonds; IPS overpayment recoupment; and a new 15-minute increment reporting requirement. 
   As a consequence of these payment cuts coupled with overly burdensome new regulatory requirements, cost-efficient home health agencies across the country have experienced acute financial difficulties and cash-flow problems, which have inhibited their ability to deliver much-needed care, particularly to the very Medicare beneficiaries who need it the most--individuals with diabetes, wound care patients, stroke patients, and other chronically ill individuals with complex care needs. Over 2,500 agencies--about one quarter of all home health agencies nationwide--have either closed or stopped serving Medicare patients. Others have laid off staff or declined to accept new patients with more serious health problems. In addition, according to a study by the Lewin Group for the American Hospital Association, these cutbacks have resulted in a 30.5 percent reduction in hospital-based home health services. 
   The effect of these home health cuts has been particularly devastating in my state. The number of Medicare home health patients in Maine dropped from 48,740 in June of 1998 to 41,269 in June of 1999, a decline of 15 percent. This means that 7,471 fewer Maine seniors are receiving home health services. Moreover, there was a 30 percent drop in the number of visits, and a 26 percent cut in Medicare payments to home health agencies in Maine. 
   Keep in mind that Maine's home health agencies have historically been prudent in their use of resources and were low-cost to begin with. Ultimately, cuts of this magnitude degrade patient care. The real losers in this situation are our nation's seniors--particularly those sicker Medicare patients with complex, chronic care needs who are already experiencing difficulty in getting the home care services they need. 
   The Balanced Budget Refinement Act did provide a small measure of financial and regulatory relief for home health agencies. It did, for example, delay the automatic 15 percent reduction in Medicare home health payments for one year. I do not think that  this legislation went far enough, however: this automatic reduction should be eliminated entirely. 
   An additional 15 percent cut in Medicare home health payments would ring the death knell for the low-cost, efficient agencies which are currently struggling to hang on and would further reduce our seniors' access to critical home care services. Moreover, we have already far surpassed the savings targets set by the Balanced Budget Act. Further cuts are unnecessary. I therefore urge all of my colleagues to join with myself and Senators BOND, BAUCUS, JEFFORDS, REED, SANTORUM, ABRAHAM, MURRAY, COCHRAN, FEINSTEIN, HOLLINGS, MIKULSKI, BINGAMAN, MURKOWSKI, HUTCHISON, SCHUMER, TORRICELLI, EDWARDS, LEAHY, ENZI, LUGAR, CLELAND, HAGEL, SNOWE, BENNETT, GORTON, HUTCHINSON, HELMS, ALLARD, LINCOLN, DEWINE, CHAFEE, ASHCROFT, SPECTER, ROBERTS, BROWNBACK, and VOINOVICH in cosponsoring the Home Health Payment Fairness Act to eliminate this additional 15 percent cut in Medicare home health payments. 
   Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join with me in providing much needed relief to America's home health agencies. Ultimately, if we don't act, the losers will be our senior citizens who depend so much on this important health care service. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to lend my support for S. 2097, the Launching Our Communities' Access to Local Television, legislation of which I am proud to be an original cosponsor. 
   Mr. President, this legislation is simply about equity. Should satellite customers in the rural Maine communities of Lovell and Greenville and Fort Fairfield have the right to receive the local broadcasts of stations in Portland, Bangor, and Presque Isle, Maine? Should they have the ability to receive their local news, emergency weather forecasts, information about school closures, and the wrap-up of the local school sports via satellite? My answer is yes, of course, they should. 
   While Congress authorized the ability of local network stations to broadcast their local signals via satellite by passing the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act last November, current satellite capacity only allows the top 40 to 50 television markets to receive this unique service. Unfortunately, this excludes the Portland, Bangor, and Presque Isle, Maine, markets and the satellite customers within those markets who want to view local programming. 
   This last year has been a particularly difficult and frustrating one for satellite customers. We took an important step in addressing many of the problems they and local broadcasters have experienced by passing the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act. We are, however, lacking a final component. Providing a rural loan guarantee program that is technologically-neutral, fiscally responsible, and focused on underserved markets will encourage companies to bring important information access to my State's rural communities and lead us to a conclusion of this important issue. I urge my colleagues to pass this important legislation. 
   I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I have heard from many Maine potato farmers that one barrier to their using the crop insurance program is the inability to insure the crops of a farm that may consist of several non-contiguous units under one policy. Therefore, I was pleased to see that The Risk Management for the Twenty-first Century Act authorizes pilot programs to allow farmers to receive premium discounts for using whole farm units or single crop units of insurance and to cross State and county boundaries to form insurable units. This provision has the potential to significantly help farmers in Maine and I appreciate your efforts to ensure its inclusion in the crop insurance bill. I hope, too, that you will make every effort to retain this provision in the bill that emerges form conference.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I begin my remarks this morning by commending the Senator from Alaska, the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, for his outstanding leadership in pulling together a plan to deal with the oil crisis. 
   He has been very attentive and responsive to the concerns of those of us who represent Northeast States. He has pointed out, correctly, time and again that one reason we are in such a bind where we are experiencing this oil crisis is that this administration has had no plan, it has had no policy. Thus, we have been particularly vulnerable to the manipulation of our oil markets by the OPEC nations.  
   I commend the Senator from Alaska for his leadership. It has been a great pleasure to work with him. 
   During the past winter, in Maine, home heating oil prices have more than doubled from the level of the previous winter. I point out, we still have a lot of winter left in New England. It is difficult to remember, when we are in Washington and surrounded by the cherry blossoms that are in full bloom and the tulips that are coming up, that in my home State of Maine we still have a considerable amount of winter yet to go through. 
   In fact, last weekend, when I was in Maine, in Aroostook County, the temperature was a very chilly zero degrees; and in southern Maine, in Portland, on Sunday morning the temperature was 9 degrees. The crisis, as far as the impact of home heating oil costs on my State--and on many New England States--has not yet eased. The crisis is very much still with us. 
   Moreover, we are now seeing the increase in oil prices affecting the cost of gasoline. According to the latest American Automobile Association survey, gasoline prices in Maine now average a staggering $1.62 a gallon. In some parts of the State, such as Aroostook and Washington Counties, the prices are even higher. And there is no end in sight. 
   The Department of Energy has predicted sharply higher prices for gasoline as the summer approaches. Again, this is a particular concern to my State of Maine. We are very dependent on the tourists who come to Maine to enjoy our beautiful scenery and outdoor recreation during the summer months. I fear that many of them will stay away if they are confronted with gasoline prices that approach, or perhaps even exceed, $2 a gallon. 
   The reason behind these soaring prices is simple. OPEC's decision to engage in unfair and anticompetitive practices to constrict the supply of oil and drive up the prices is responsible, primarily, for the crisis we face. This cartel inflicts--and will continue to inflict--economic hardship on the families and the businesses of the Northeast and throughout America. The results of the jump in oil prices may have been felt first in the Northeast, but they are rolling as thunder across America. 
   Let's look more closely at the primary cause of the oil crisis. 
   OPEC is a cartel of 11 oil-producing states that supply over 40 percent of the world's oil and possess over 77 percent of the world's total proven crude oil reserves. 
   OPEC member countries have colluded to take some 6 percent of the world's oil supply off the market in order to maximize their profits. And the strategy is working. 
   Although OPEC countries sold 5 percent less oil last year, 
   their profits were up by more than 38 percent. 
   Last October, I began warning the Clinton administration about OPEC's production squeeze and the detrimental impact the cartel would have on our economy. At that time, oil prices were already beginning to rise and U.S. inventories were falling. 
   Throughout the winter, Mainers and all Americans who heat with oil have suffered from the highest prices in a decade. Gradually, the economic pain caused by OPEC has spread throughout the country. The entire Nation is suffering--and will continue to suffer--the results of record high fuel costs. 
   Last fall, the administration, in response to the concerns Senator SCHUMER and I and other Members expressed, told us what it is still telling us: Just wait and see. Be patient. We will somehow increase production. We will convince OPEC to raise production to normal levels. 
   We have waited and waited and waited. The cost of oil has gone from $20 to $25 to $30 to $34 a barrel. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has admitted that the ``Federal Government was not `prepared' for this crisis. When he was in Maine, he said they had been `caught napping'.'' That is an astonishing admission of a lack of leadership by this administration. 
   The fact is, this administration has no plan, no policy, no approach for dealing with this crisis. It has no energy policy at all. The administration should act immediately to combat OPEC's manipulation of oil markets by using a tool that has proven effective in the past; that is, a measured release of oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
   Along with Senator SCHUMER, I have repeatedly asked the administration to release some of the oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve into the marketplace. I have worked with the chairman to make sure it would be done in a way that did not in any way jeopardize our national security. It would not in any way drain the reserve, which has approximately 575 million barrels in its storages. 
   This would ease the price. 
   Last November, again, Senator SCHUMER and I introduced a bill making clear the President's authority to act. Time and again, we called upon the administration to take some action to provide us with relief. On March 2, we introduced legislation calling upon the administration to draw down the SPR in an economically feasible manner using what is known as swaps. A release from the SPR would have an immediate and dramatic impact on the price of oil. It would help break OPEC's resolve to maintain an iron grip on our Nation's oil supply. 
   I will relate what has happened in the two past cases where we did have a measured release of oil from our reserves. In 1996, the administration sold oil from the SPR simply to raise revenue, and oil prices declined almost immediately by over 7 percent. That was in response to merely the announcement of a one-time sale of 12 million barrels. Previously, when President Bush tapped the reserves during the gulf war, prices dropped by 30 percent. 
   In proposing that we release oil from our reserves, I am pleased to have the very strong support of the American Trucking Association. Perhaps no one has felt the pain of soaring oil prices more than our Nation's truckers. The jump in prices deeply harms them and, by extension, all American consumers and businesses. 
   I have heard from a small Maine trucking company that is in dire straits. One operator of a trucking company in Ellsworth tells me that due to the high cost of diesel, many independent contractors with whom she contracts will simply not be able to stay in business. Potato farmers in northern Maine are concerned they are going to have increasing difficulty in shipping their crop because the high cost of diesel has made it economically infeasible for truckers to drive to Aroostook County. High diesel costs also hurt our lumber and paper industries. 
   Everyone shares in the pain inflicted by OPEC. Record-high crude oil prices hurt all Americans--at the pump, on the farm, in the supermarket, at the airline ticket counter, and at home during cold nights. These exorbitant prices even hurt our kids. Recently a newspaper in my State reported that the high cost of fuel is straining school budgets in Maine. Several schools have canceled all field trips because they have already depleted their budget for gasoline, diesel, and oil costs for the year. 
   I have been disappointed that the administration has failed to heed our call during the past several months. What makes the administration's failure to act even more perplexing is the fact some of the nations involved in the scheme to manipulate prices are supposedly our allies. They have depended heavily on American support in the past. These countries include Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Mexico. I am so frustrated in particular with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. We rescued these countries; 147 Americans gave their lives in the cause of freeing Kuwait and protecting Saudi Arabia. 
   I hope next week when the OPEC nation ministers meet they will decide to restore normal production levels. But we cannot wait. We have to keep the pressure on. We have to provide short-term and long-term relief. 
   There are other steps we could take. We should suspend the 3.4-percent gas tax hike while protecting the highway trust fund, and we must make clear to the OPEC nations that we will not stand idly by. 
   Again, I thank the chairman of the task force and of the committee for his excellent leadership. I look forward to continuing to work with him on this very critical issue.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Americans today are leading healthier and longer lives than ever before. By the year 2030, one-fifth of our American population will be age 65 or older. Given the demographics of the 21st century, it is clearly in our national interest to encourage people to stay in the workforce longer. Today, however, older Americans age 65 through 69 are currently discouraged from working since they lose $1 in Social Security benefits for every $3 they earn over $17,000. I am, therefore, very pleased this week the Senate will consider H.R. 5, the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act, to eliminate the Social Security earnings test that unfairly penalizes senior citizens who need or want to keep working. 
   The elimination of this penalty will be particularly helpful to women. Women frequently have interrupted work histories because they take time off to raise their families. Historically, unfortunately, they also earn less than men. As a result, women are twice as likely to retire in poverty as men. Many women do not have sufficient savings or a private pension, and they depend upon the money they earn to supplement their Social Security benefits in order to make ends meet. These low-income seniors are particularly hard hit by the earnings test, which amounts to a 33-percent tax on their earned income 
   over and above what they are already paying in Federal, State, and Social Security payroll taxes. 
   Moreover, the Social Security earnings penalty takes money away from seniors that is rightfully theirs. According to the Social Security Administration, 800,000 senior citizens sacrificed some of their benefits last year by exceeding the earnings limit. These were benefits they had earned through a lifetime of hard work in contributions to the Social Security system. 
   Finally, this penalty is most burdensome for those seniors who have to work and depend upon their income for survival. More well-to-do seniors generally supplement their Social Security benefits with what we refer to as ``unearned income'' from savings and investments, none of which is affected by the current earnings limit. 
   Earlier this month, in an overwhelming display of bipartisan cooperation, the House of Representatives voted unanimously to repeal this unfair penalty on our senior citizens. They voted to say no to discriminating against seniors and discouraging them from working. It is my hope the Senate will follow suit this week with another unanimous vote on this historic measure. 
   Our Nation's seniors should be free to work without penalty. Older workers have the skills, the wisdom, and the judgment that all employers value. Given our tight labor market and our historically low rate of personal savings, it simply does not make sense for Washington to discourage the most experienced workers we have from remaining in the workforce when they want to do so. I hope all of our colleagues will join me in passing this important legislation before the end of the week. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my colleagues, Senators MURKOWSKI, DODD, TORRICELLI, and HUTCHINSON to introduce the Organ Procurement Organization Certification Act to improve the performance evaluation and certification process that the Health Care Financing Administration currently uses for organ procurement organizations (OPOs). 
   Recent advantages in technology have dramatically increased the number of patients who could benefit from organ transplants. Unfortunately, however, while there has been some interest in the number of organ donors, the supply of organs in the United States has not kept pace with the growing number of transplant candidates, and the gap between transplant demand and organ supply continues to widen. According to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), there are now 68,220 patients in the United States on the waiting list for a transplant. 
   Our nation's 60 organ procurement organizations (OPOs) play a critical role in procuring and placing organs and are therefore key to our efforts to increase the number and quality of organs available for transplant. They provide all of the services necessary in a particular geographic region for coordinating the identification of potential donors, requests for donation, and recovery and transport of organs. The professionals in the OPOs evaluate potential donors, discuss donation with family members, and arrange for the surgical removal of donated organs. They are also responsible for preserving the organs and making arrangements for their distribution according to national organ sharing policies. Finally, the OPOs provide information and education to medical professionals and the general public to encourage organ and tissue donation to increase the availability of organs for transplantation. 
   According to a 1999 report of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) entitled ``Organ Procurement and Transplantation: Assessing Current Policies and the Potential Impact of the DHHS Final Rule'', a major impediment to greater accountability and improved performance on the part of OPOs is the current lack of a reliable and valid method for assessing donor potential and OPO performance. 
   The HCFA's current certification process for OPOs sets an arbitrary, population-based performance standard for certifying OPOs based on donors per million of population in their service areas. It sets a standard for acceptable performance based on five criteria: donors recovered per million, kidneys recovered per million, kidneys transplanted per million, extrarenal organs (heart, liver, pancreas and lungs) recovered per million, and extrarenal organs transplanted per million. The HCFA assesses the OPOs' adherence to these standards every two years. Each OPO must meet at least 75 percent of the national mean for four of these five categories to be recertified as the OPO for a particular area and to receive Medicare and Medicaid payments. Without HCFA certification, an OPO cannot continue to operate. 
   The GAO, the IOM, the Harvard School of Public Health and others all have criticized HCFA's use of this population-based standard to measure OPO performance. According to the GAO, ``HCFA's current performance standard does not accurately assess OPOs' ability to meet the goal of acquiring all usable organs because it is based on the total population, not the number of potential donors, within the OPOs' service areas.'' 
   OPO service areas vary widely in the distribution of deaths by cause, underlying health conditions, age, and race. These variations can pose significant advantages or disadvantages to an OPO's ability to procure organs, and a major problem with HCFA's current performance assessment is that it does not account for these variations. An extremely effective OPO that is getting a high yield of organs from the potential donors in its service area may appear to be performing poorly because it has a disproportionate share of elderly people or a high rate of people infected with HIV or AIDS, which eliminates them for consideration as an organ donor. At the same time, an ineffective OPO may appear to be performing well because it is operating in a service area with a high proportion of potential donors. 
   For example, organ donors typically die from head trauma and accidental injuries, and these rates can vary dramatically from region to region. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 1991, the number of drivers fatally injured in traffic accidents in Maine was 15.54 per 100,000 population. In Alabama, however, it was 29.56, giving the OPO serving that state a tremendous advantage over the New England Organ Bank, which serves Maine, but not for a very good reason! 
   Use of this population-based method to evaluate OPO performance may well result in the decertification of OPOs that are actually excellent performers. Under HCFA's current regulatory practice, OPOs are decertified if they fail to meet the 75th percentile of the national means on 4 of the 5 performance areas. In this process, which resembles a game of musical chairs, it is a mathematical certainty that some OPOs will fail in each cycle, no matter how much they might individually improve. 
   Moreover, unlike other HCFA certification programs, the certification process for OPOs lacks any provision for corrective action plans to remedy deficient performance and also lacks a clearly defined due process component for resolving conflicts. The current system therefore forces OPOs to compete on the basis of an imperfect grading system, with no guarantee of an opportunity for fair hearing based on their actual performance. This situation pressures many OPOs to focus on the  certification process itself rather than on activities and methods to increase donation, undermining what should be the overriding goal of the program. Moreover, the current two-year cycle--which is shorter than other certification programs administered by HCFA--provides little opportunity to examine trends and even less 
   incentive for OPOs to mount long-term interventions. 
   The legislation we are introducing today has three major objectives. First, it imposes a moratorium on the current recertification process for OPOs and the use of population-based performance measurements. Under our bill, the certification of qualified OPOs will remain in place through January 1, 2002, for those OPOs that have been certified as a January 1, 2000, and that meet other qualification requirements apart from the current performance standards. Second, the bill requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate new rules governing OPO recertification by January 1, 2002. These new rules are to rely on outcome and process performance measures based on evidence of organ donor potential and other relevant factors, and recertification for OPOs shall not be required until they are promulgated. Finally, the bill provides for the filing and approval of a corrective action plan by an OPO that fails to meet the standards, a grace period to permit corrective action, an opportunity to appeal a decertification to the Secretary on substantive and procedural grounds and a four-year certification cycle. 
   Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today makes much needed improvements in the flawed process that HCFA currently uses to certify and assess OPO performance, and I urge all of my colleagues to join us as cosponsors.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the St. Croix Island Heritage Act, legislation that will help develop a regional heritage center in Calais, ME, in time to commemorate an event of great historical and international significance: the 400th anniversary of one of the earliest settlements in North America, at St. Croix Island. I am pleased to have my senior colleague from Maine, Ms. SNOWE, as a cosponsor of my legislation. 
   Planning for the regional heritage center is well underway. The residents of the St. Croix River Valley and organizations such as the St. Croix Economic Alliance and the Sunrise County Economic Council have worked hard to move the project forward. They commissioned a consulting firm to evaluate the market potential of the heritage center and to prepare preliminary exhibit and operating plans. They secured planning and seed money from the U.S. Forest Service, the city of Calais, local businesses, and others. And they have hired a full-time project coordinator to oversee development of the heritage center. Now they need assistance from the National Park Service, assistance that this bill would provide. 
   The regional center will preserve and chronicle the region's cultural, natural, and historical heritage. The Interior Department's role in the planning and development of the heritage center stems from the close proximity of the proposed site to St. Croix Island, the only international historic site in the National Park System. 
   In 2004, the United States, Canada, and France will celebrate the 400th anniversary of the first settlement at St. Croix Island. We have only 4 more years to prepare for a celebration of this historic event. 
   I have spoken before on the Senate floor about the historical significance of the settlement of St. Croix Island. It is a remarkable and little-known story that bears retelling. The story dates to the summer of 1604, when a French nobleman, accompanied by a courageous group of adventurers that included Samuel Champlain, landed on St. Croix Island and set about to construct a settlement. They cleared the island, planted crops, dug a well, and built houses, fortifications, and public buildings. In the process, they were aided by Native peoples who made temporary camps on the island. At the same time, Samuel Champlain undertook a number of reconnaissance missions from the island. On one, he found and named Mount Desert Island, now the home to Acadia National Park. 
   By October of 1604, the settlement was ready. But the Maine winter was more than the seventy-nine settlers had bargained for. By winter's end, nearly half had died, and many others were seriously ill. 
   The spring brought relief from the harsh weather. The colony was relocated to Port Royal in what is now Nova Scotia and, in 1608, Champlain and his fellow explorers founded Quebec. 
   According to the National Park Service, the French settlement on St. Croix Island in 1604 and 1605 was the first and ``most ambitious attempt of its time to establish an enduring French presence in the `New World' '' and ``set a precedent for early French claims in New France.'' Many view the expedition that settled on St. Croix Island in 1604 as the beginning of the Acadian culture in North America. This rich and diverse culture spread across the continent, from Canada to Louisiana, where French-speaking Acadians came to be known as ``Cajuns.'' 
   Mr. President, thousands of people attended the celebration that marked the 300th anniversary of the settlement  of St. Croix Island. The consul general of France and the famous Civil War hero General Joshua Chamberlain were among those who spoke at the event. 
   In four years, another century will have passed since the last commemoration, and we will celebrate St. Croix Island's 400th anniversary. There is much work to be done. In 1996, the U.S. National Park Service and Parks Canada agreed to ``conduct joint strategic planning for the international commemoration [of the St. Croix Island], with a special focus on the 400th anniversary of settlement in 2004.'' For its part, Parks Canada constructed an exhibit in New Brunswick overlooking St. Croix Island. The exhibit uses Champlain's first-hand accounts, period images, updated research, and custom artwork to tell the compelling story of the settlement.

   Mr. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator SCHUMER, to submit a senate concurrent resolution expressing the Sense of the Congress that the Administration should act immediately to combat the anticompetitive campaign OPEC has waged on the world's oil markets. Through this resolution, we call upon the President and the Secretary of Energy to defend America's interests through the immediate release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We are pleased to be joined by Senators JEFFORDS, SNOWE, LIEBERMAN, MOYNIHAN, LEVIN, LEAHY, and DODD who are original cosponsors of this important legislation. We are also pleased to have the strong support of the American Trucking Association which represents 9.6 million people employed in the American trucking industry and their families. Perhaps no one has felt the pain for soaring oil prices more then they. 
   Today we ask the Administration to combat the unfair and anticompetitive practices of OPEC, and to ease the pain this cartel has inflicted--and will continue to inflict--on the people and businesses of the Northeast, the Midwest, and throughout America. 
   Last fall, Senator SCHUMER and I began cautioning the Administration about OPEC's production squeeze and the impact the cartel would have on our economy. At that time oil prices were rising, and U.S. inventories were falling. Throughout the winter, Mainers, New Yorkers, and all Americans who heat with oil have suffered from the highest distillate prices in a decade. The entire nation has suffered--and will continue to suffer--through increased gasoline and diesel fuel costs. 
   One year ago, the average retail price of a gallon of diesel fuel was 95.6 cents. Today, prices across the nation have skyrocketed. In my home state, diesel costs range from $1.60 in Bangor to $1.90 in Biddeford. 
   This jump in prices deeply harms truckers and, by extension, all American consumers and businesses. The trucking industry consumes nearly 30 billion of gallons of diesel fuel a year. At today's prices, that means truckers across the nation must shoulder $15 billion more in fuel costs this year, compared to last. 
   I have heard from small Maine trucking companies that are in dire straits. One owner of a trucking company in Ellsworth, Maine tells me that, due to particularly high fuel costs, many independent truckers she contracts with may not be able to stay in business. She says that owner-operators and small trucking companies cannot withstand the exorbitant price of diesel fuel for much longer and warns that immediate action is necessary. Potato farmers in northern Maine tell me they are having difficulty shipping their crop to market because the high cost of diesel has made it economically unfeasible to come to Aroostock County. 
   I was struck by a sign I saw on a rig two weeks ago when truckers converged upon Washington, demanding action from our government--it read: ``if you eat it, drink or wear it, it probably got to you by truck.'' This catchy slogan underscores the importance of trucking to our country and our way of life. 
   But everyone shares in the pain inflicted by OPEC. Yesterday, a barrel of crude oil closed at $30.43, a one hundred-fifty percent increase from one year ago. These high crude prices hurt all Americans--at the pump, on the farm, in the supermarket, at the airline ticket counter, and at home during cold winter nights. 
   OPEC member-countries have colluded to take some 6% of the world's supply of oil off the markets in order to maximize profits. The strategy's is working--although OPEC countries sold 5% less oil in 1999, their profits were up 38%. 
   OPEC's production squeeze has caused fuel reserves to shrink to historic lows. The Administrator of the Energy Information Administration--which is part of the Department of Energy--was quoted in The New York Times last week saying the fuel reserves in the Northeast were ``dangerously low,'' the lowest in 20 years, and that American's were ``skating on thin ice'' due to low fuel inventories. Indeed, we were told by the Energy Information Agency that distillate stocks in New England reached an all-time low last month. 
   We have been disappointed that the Administration has failed to heed our call over the past several months. But even now, it is not too late. A release of oil from the SPR would have an immediate impact upon the price of oil and would help break OPEC's resolve to maintain an iron grip on our nation's supply. 
   So today we offer a resolution calling upon the Administration to use the tools at its disposal to fight OPEC's unfair and dangerously harmful trade practices. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support the pending amendment which I have offered on behalf of myself, Senator KYL, Senator COVERDELL, Senator HATCH, Senator ABRAHAM, and Senator BUNNING. I know the hour is late and I understand if I speak very shortly I will get more votes, so I will be very brief in describing my amendment. 
   We have worked together to craft an amendment to help our public school teachers when they either pursue professional development at their own expense or purchase supplies for their classroom. Our amendment has two major provisions. 
   First, it will allow teachers to deduct their professional development expenses without subjecting the deduction to the existing 2-percent floor that is in our Tax Code. Second, it will grant teachers a tax credit of up to $100 for books, supplies, and other equipment they purchase for their students. As Senator KYL has noted, a study by the National Education Association indicates the average schoolteacher spends more than $400 a year on supplies and other materials for the classroom. 
   Our amendment would reward teachers for undertaking these activities that are designed to make them better teachers or to provide better supplies for their students. It is an example of a way that we can say thank you to teachers who do so much for our children. 
   While our amendment provides financial relief for our dedicated teachers, its real beneficiaries are our Nation's students. Other than involved parents, which we all know to be the most important component, a well-qualified and dedicated teacher is the single most important prerequisite for student success. Educational researchers have repeatedly demonstrated the  close relationship between qualified teachers and successful students. 
   Moreover, teachers themselves understand how important professional development is to maintaining and expanding their levels of competence. When I meet with teachers from Maine, they always tell me of their need for more professional development and the scarcity of financial support for this very worthy pursuit. The willingness of Maine's teachers to reach deep into their own pockets to fund their own professional development impresses me deeply. For example, an English teacher in Bangor, who serves on my Educational Policy Advisory Committee, told me of spending her own money to attend a curriculum conference. She then came back and shared that information with all of the English teachers in her department. She is not alone. She is typical of teachers who are willing to pay for their own professional development as well as to purchase supplies and materials to enhance their teaching. 
   I greatly admire the many teachers who have voluntarily financed the additional education they need to improve their schools and to serve their students better. I greatly admire those teachers who reach into their own pockets to buy supplies, paints, books, all sorts of materials that are lacking in their classroom. We should reward those teachers. Let us change the Tax Code to recognize and reward their sacrifice and to encourage more teachers to take the courses they need or to help supplement the supplies in their classroom. I hope those changes in our Tax Code will encourage more teachers to undertake the formal course work in the subject matter they teach, or to complete graduate degrees in either a subject matter or in education, or to attend conferences to give them more ideas for innovative approaches to presenting the course work they teach in perhaps a more challenging manner. 
   This amendment will reimburse teachers for just a small part of what they invest in our children's future. This money will be money well spent. Investing in education helps us to build one of the most important assets for our country's future; that is, a well-educated population. We need to ensure that our public schools have the very best teachers possible in order to bring out the very best in our students. Adopting this amendment is the first step toward that goal. It will help us in a small way recognize the many sacrifices our teachers make each and every day.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, improving education for all American children is our No. 1 priority in the Senate. It is No. 1 on our Republican plan. 
   Education is more important than ever before in our history. While education has always been the engine of social and economic progress, today it assumes more importance than ever before. Education is critical to allow people to fully participate in our increasingly technological society. Education is critical to narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor in this country, which is largely an educational gap. In fact, an individual with a college degree can expect to earn, on average, $17,000 more a year than an individual who only has a high school degree. Increasingly, education is important not only to our quality of life, not only to technological and medical breakthroughs, but to narrowing the gaps in our society and ensuring that everyone is able to have the quality of life he or she wishes to have. 
   By working with our parents, our teachers, our communities, and our States, our goal is to strengthen our schools so that every American child has the opportunity for a good education, so that no child, in the words of Texas Governor George Bush, is left behind. That is our goal. 
   A good education is a ladder of opportunity. It turns dreams into reality, it is responsible for improvements in our quality of life, and it enables a child to achieve his or her full potential. That is why I am a strong supporter of the Affordable Education Act, the legislation we are debating today. 
   The Presiding Officer knows I am a very strong supporter of public education. I would not support a bill I thought in any way weakened public education. The last time this bill was debated on the Senate floor--and again today--I heard suggestions that somehow this bill was a backdoor attempt at vouchers. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, this legislation will allow American families to save for their children's future education--to save for college, for example. It will allow them to use the money they put aside to supplement public education in K through 12, to hire a tutor, for example, to pay for a school trip, to help to afford extra help by way of buying a computer. This will help parents help their own children with their own money that they are putting aside in an educational savings account. 
   I am particularly interested in this legislation because I think it will help parents afford higher education, which often seems to be an obstacle that many families question they can afford. 
   Creating the educational IRA, as this Congress did, was an important first step in encouraging families to save for higher education. But we need to go further, and the Affordable Education Act contains significantly improved benefits for families using educational IRAs to save for postsecondary education. 
   In the State of Maine, we have a terrific record of encouraging our students to complete high school. We have one of the best records in the country. But, unfortunately, we don't do as well encouraging students to go beyond high school. In that area, we lag behind other States. Yet we know how important higher education is. It is more important than ever before. As I talk with students and their families, school administrators, and teachers, I find that too many Maine families believe education beyond high school is simply beyond their means. This legislation will help them save for the cost of higher education. It will increase the annual amount a family can contribute to an educational IRA from $500 to $2,000. 
   Now, let's look at what that means and the difference that can make. That means if a family were saving the maximum amount of $2,000 each year for 18 years, starting at the child's birth, at a return of about 8 percent per year, they would have about $75,000 to pay for a college education. Now, that contrasts sharply with the $19,000 they would have under current law. That is important because $75,000 is an awful lot closer to the average cost of attending a private college for 4 years than $19,000 would be. 
   The Affordable Education Act also makes some important changes and improvements in prepaid tuition plans. That is another way we can help American families better afford higher education. Some of the provisions in this bill were originally proposed in legislation I introduced called the Savings For Scholars legislation. 
   For example, families will be allowed to roll over accounts without incurring tax liability from one prepaid plan to another. So if they move from one State to another with a different variation, they don't lose the benefits of that plan. 
   The legislation includes first cousins among the family members to whom a plan can be transferred should it not be needed or used by the child who was the original beneficiary. It will provide greater incentives for grandparents to establish prepaid tuition or to participate in prepaid tuition plans. 
   Another provision of this legislation, which I think is very important, is that it will eliminate the 60-month limit on the deduction of student loan interest. The second bill I introduced as a new Senator in 1997 allowed students to deduct the interest on their student loans. I am very pleased that a version of my legislation--and there were many others supporting that approach as well--was incorporated into the 1997 Tax Relief Act. But we found that there was a 60-month limit put on how long someone could deduct the interest on a student loan. This legislation eliminates that 60-month limit. That is going to be very important to students who attend graduate or professional school or who otherwise have incurred a large debt burden. 
   The impetus for the legislation I introduced back in 1997 came from my experience while working at a small college in Maine. Most of the students of this college--Husson College in Bangor, ME--were first-generation college students, the first members of their family to attend college. Eighty-five percent of them received some sort of student loan in order to be able to afford college. What I found is that many of them were graduating with a mountain of debt. They were worried about how they were going to be able to pay off those student loans. Allowing them to deduct that interest every month when they write that check, knowing they will be able to deduct that interest, is an enormous help to them. By eliminating that 60-month limit, we will help even more students and help make higher education that much more affordable. 
   Another important provision of the Affordable Education Act is the provision dealing with the National Health Corps scholarships exclusion. Because Maine is underserved in many of our rural areas for health care providers, this provision is particularly important to our State. What it would do is allow health care providers who had received these National Health Corps scholarships to exclude the cost of that scholarship from their gross income. 
   I have touched on just some of the very important provisions of this legislation. We know that investing in education and making it easier for families to afford education, whether it is helping at the K through 12 level or making higher education more affordable, is a good investment, that it is the surest and best way for us to build our country's assets for the future. We need to help more American families afford higher education. We need to strengthen our educational system. That is what this legislation will accomplish. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to join in supporting this legislation, which will  make a real difference to so many American families. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to the Affordable Education Act on behalf of myself, the Presiding Officer--Senator COVERDELL--and my good friend from Arizona, Senator KYL. 
   We worked together to craft this amendment to help our public school teachers when they either pursue professional development at their own expense or when they purchase supplies for their classrooms. 
   Our legislation has two major provisions. First, it will allow teachers to deduct their professional development expenses without subjecting the deduction to the existing 2-percent floor that is in our Tax Code. Second, it will grant teachers a tax credit of up to $100 for books, supplies, and other equipment they purchase for their students. That is very common. As Senator KYL noted earlier today, a study by the National Education Association indicates the average schoolteacher teaching K through the 12th grade spends more than $400 annually on supplies for the classroom. 
   Our amendment would reward teachers for undertaking these activities that are designed to make them better teachers or to provide better supplies for their students. It is an example of a way that we can say thank you to teachers who do much for our children. 
   Provisions similar to both of these components of our amendment were included in last year's tax bill. In this amendment, the definition of ``acceptable professional development activities'' has been changed to reflect the definition included in the Teacher Empowerment Act that Senator GREGG of New Hampshire and I introduced last year, and which we expect to be included in the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions is about to mark up. 
   This definition sets high standards for the quality of professional development activities covered by our amendment, ensuring that such programs will help teachers truly excel in the classroom. 
   While our amendment provides financial relief for our dedicated teachers, its real beneficiaries are our Nation's students. Other than involved parents, which we all know to be the most important component, a well-qualified and dedicated teacher is the single most important prerequisite for student success. Educational researchers have repeatedly demonstrated the close relationship between qualified teachers and successful students. Moreover, teachers themselves understand how important professional development is to maintaining and expanding their levels of competence. When I meet with teachers from Maine, they always tell me of their need for more professional development and the scarcity of financial support for this very worthy pursuit. The willingness of Maine's teachers to reach deep into their own pockets to fund their own professional development impresses me deeply. 
   For example, an English teacher in Bangor, who serves on my Educational Policy Advisory Committee, told me of spending her own money to attend a curriculum conference. She then came back and shared that information with all of the English teachers in her department. She is not alone. She is typical of teachers who are willing to pay for their own professional development as well as to purchase supplies and materials to enhance their teaching. 
   Let me explain how our amendment would work in terms of real dollars when it comes to professional development. In 1997, the average yearly salary for a teacher was about $38,000. Under current law, a teacher earning this amount could not deduct the first $770 in professional development expenses he or she paid for out of pocket. So imagine, you are a teacher who is making about $38,000 a year and you are spending more than $700 in order to take a course to improve your teaching to help you be a better teacher. Yet because you don't reach that 2-percent floor that is in the existing Tax Code, you don't get a tax break for that first $770. You have to spend more than that before you can get the deduction. Our amendment would change that. It would see to it that teachers receive tax relief for all such expenses. Under our amendment, that $770 would be a deduction on the teacher's income tax form. 
   I greatly admire the many teachers who have voluntarily financed the additional education they need to improve their schools and to serve their students better. I greatly admire those teachers who reach into their own pockets to buy supplies, paints, books, all sorts of materials that are lacking in their classroom. We should reward those teachers. Let us change the Tax Code to recognize and reward their sacrifice and to encourage more teachers to take the courses they need or to help supplement the supplies in their classroom. 
   I hope these changes in our Tax Code will encourage more teachers to undertake the formal course work in the subject matter they teach, or to complete graduate degrees in either a subject matter or in education, or to attend conferences to give them more ideas for innovative approaches to presenting the course work they teach in perhaps a more challenging manner. 
   This amendment will reimburse teachers for just a small part of what they invest in our children's future. This money will be money well spent. Investing in education helps us to build one of the most important assets for our country's future; that is, a well-educated population. We need to ensure that our public schools have the very best teachers possible in order to bring out the very best in our students. Adopting this amendment is the first step toward that goal. It will help us in a small way recognize the many sacrifices our teachers make each and every day. 
   I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to work with the Senator from Georgia and the Senator from Arizona on this amendment. They have  both been great leaders in education and in coming up with innovative ways to use our Tax Code to encourage better teaching. I urge all of my colleagues to join us in support of this modest but important effort. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his graciousness. 
   I rise in support of the provisions of the manager's amendment that strikes the take title language from the Nuclear Waste Policy Act amendments. I express my great appreciation to the committee chairman, Senator MURKOWSKI, for his willingness to work with us to address the concerns of a number of States, including my home State of Maine, about the take title provisions. 
   Our States feared that the take title provisions would grant the Department of Energy a license to permanently store nuclear waste where it now sits--on the very vulnerable riverfronts, seashores, and lake borders of many States. 
   The take title provision was a fatal flaw in this otherwise necessary and sound legislation. This provision was based upon an ill-advised effort by the Department of Energy to shirk its responsibilities to store nuclear waste. 
   The take title provision would have allowed the Department of Energy to take ownership of the nuclear waste at each individual nuclear plant across the Nation. At first blush, that sounds very reasonable, but we have to look at the record. 
   Given the Department of Energy's dismal record of missed deadlines and its utter failure to deal with the nuclear waste issue, new waste storage facilities created under the take title provision would run the very real risk of becoming de facto permanent waste sites. 
   Moreover, this administration has simply done a miserable job of allaying the fears of the Governor of my State and the people of many other States who all fear the take title provision is a ruse to create permanent repositories at each site. 
   Residents of my State of Maine have been paying into the nuclear waste fund for years with assurances that the radioactive waste from the State of Maine and from Maine Yankee, in particular, would be moved to a permanent repository, not left in Wiscasset, ME, where the plant once operated. Since 1982, the ratepayers of Maine have paid nearly $150 million into the fund. Yet we have seen no progress, no results. 
   What to do with our Nation's nuclear waste is, indeed, a difficult question, but creating semipermanent storage at over 100 facilities across the Nation is clearly not the answer. 
   Similarly, allowing the Department of Energy to continue to dodge its responsibilities is not the answer. The answer is a safe, consolidated facility. The answer is for the Department of Energy to fulfill its obligations. The answer is for the Department of Energy to take possession of the waste, not just in Maine but by physically removing it from these sites across our country. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the manager's amendment. I believe it will solve the problems with the take title provision and thus improve this important piece of legislation. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank the Senator from Wyoming for yielding. 
   Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

   Ms. COLLINS. For the information of all of our colleagues, I inform Senators that we are still working out some last-minute issues that will then allow the Senate to move a number of important bills that have been cleared on both sides. While we are waiting for these last-minute glitches to be resolved, I want to take this opportunity to respond to some of the comments made by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle this morning. 
   I am disappointed in some of the process, and I do not support all of the provisions of the omnibus appropriations bill which we will consider later this day, but I very much disagree with the assertions made by some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  that we have not accomplished anything during this Congress. We have, in fact, accomplished a great deal of which we can be proud. Rather than engaging in harsh partisan rhetoric, we should be coming together in these final hours of this session to celebrate what we have done for the American people. 
   First of all, I think we can take great pride in the accomplishment that we will be producing a balanced budget for the first time in decades, one which does not raid the Social Security trust fund. This is a tremendous accomplishment and it establishes a new milestone in fiscal responsibility. It has been the Republican caucus that has held firm in their determination to prevent one penny of the Social Security trust fund from being diverted to support expensive new unrelated Government programs. We have succeeded. We have kept that commitment. We have fulfilled our obligation to the senior citizens of this country. For the first time in 30 years, the Congress has produced a balanced budget which will result in a surplus that does not rely on funds from the Social Security trust fund. The raid on the Social Security trust fund has been stopped cold. 
   I give a great deal of credit to Senator DOMENICI, to Senator STEVENS, to Senator ABRAHAM, and to all colleagues in the Republican caucus who have united in their determination to secure the Social Security trust fund for our seniors and for future generations. That is an accomplishment of which we can be proud. 
   Second, I am delighted the omnibus appropriations bill includes what has been my highest priority in the last few months and that is to restore some of the unintended cuts made by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 as well as by onerous regulations imposed by the Clinton administration that have impaired the ability of our rural hospitals, our home health care agencies, and our nursing homes to provide much needed quality health care to our Nation's senior citizens. 
   The Presiding Officer has been an early supporter of legislation that I have introduced to provide financial relief to our distressed home health care agencies. America's home health care agencies allow our senior citizens and our disabled citizens to receive the health care where they want it, in the security and the privacy of their own homes. Unfortunately, under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, and exacerbated by misguided policies of the Clinton administration, America's home health agencies have found their ability to provide this care has been jeopardized. This care is so important to our Nation's senior citizens, particularly those who are living in rural areas of our country where access to home health care may spell the difference between staying in their own homes and having to travel many miles to receive health care. 
   Unfortunately, since cutbacks in home health care have gone into effect, there has been a devastating impact on the senior citizens of our country. Let me use the example of the State of Maine. As you can see, in just a year's time, more than 6,000 Maine senior citizens have lost their access to home care. In fact, it is 6,600 Maine seniors who have lost their access to home health care. The number of home health care visits in Maine has declined by more than 420,000. Reimbursements to Maine's home health agencies have declined in a year's time by more than $20 million. 
   Maine's home health agencies have had a long tradition of providing low-cost compassionate care. We are not talking about home health agencies that were in any way abusing the system, making too many visits, or overbilling Medicare. We are talking about home health agencies that were cost effective and efficient, providing quality low-cost care throughout the State of Maine. 
   I have visited with many of these seniors who have lost access 
   to home health care. One was a retired priest in my hometown of Caribou, ME. He relied on his home health services and has now had to dig deeply into his savings to provide for the care out of his own pocket because Medicare is no longer providing the services he needs. 
   In another case, I visited an elderly couple in rural Maine who were able to stay together in their own home rather than go into a nursing home because of the valuable services provided by home health care nurses. The woman in this case was severely diabetic. She was confined to a wheelchair and had a wound that was not healing. It was home health care nurses who came three times a week to clean the wound, to change the dressing, to take care of her other health care needs. Home health care allowed her and her elderly husband to stay together in their golden years. 
   It is that kind of service which has made such a difference to the quality of life of our senior citizens, and it was that kind of service which has been so jeopardized by the ill-advised Clinton administration regulations and the unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 
   The legislation I introduced was a bipartisan bill. It was cosponsored by more than 30 of my colleagues, to reverse these unintended consequences. The Balanced Budget Remedies Act that is included in the omnibus appropriations bill does not go as far as I would like, frankly, but it is a good and necessary first step. I commend the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, as well as Senator MOYNIHAN, for working with us to come up with legislation that we can enact to ensure our senior citizens do not lose access to much needed health care. 
   That is also a very important bill to our rural hospitals. In our hospitals, in States such as Maine, we have been suffering from the cutbacks that jeopardize their ability to provide care. These hospitals, in most cases, are the only hospital in the community. If they are forced to close because of unfair and inadequate reimbursements from Medicare, it will devastate the communities. It will leave many of our senior citizens and others in the community without access to health care at all when they become ill and need hospitalization. 
   One of the features of the cutbacks in home health care troubles me. I wonder what has become of these nearly 7,000 Maine citizens. In some cases they have been forced to pay for the care themselves. Many of the seniors in Maine simply cannot afford that kind of out-of-pocket expense. They are living on Social Security, on limited incomes. They already have a very difficult time affording their prescription drugs. Some of them have become sicker because they have lost their access to home health care and have prematurely been forced into nursing homes or have been subject to repeated hospitalization which would have been avoided had the home health care services been provided. The irony and the wrongheaded effect of this policy is we are probably going to end up paying more for the care for these senior citizens who have lost access to their home health care because hospitalization and nursing home care is so much more expensive than home health care. Surely this has been a shortsighted policy. 
   I am pleased this legislation is going to take the first steps we need to provide much needed financial relief to our Nation's home health care agencies, our rural hospitals, and our nursing homes. It is going to make a real difference. There is much else that is very valuable in this legislation for our Nation's families. Not only our senior citizens but our children are going to benefit from this legislation. 
   When you hear the rhetoric in this Chamber about education, you would think that somehow there has been an attempt to slash education funding. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the Republican Senate increased--increased, Mr. President--education spending by $500 million beyond what was requested by President Clinton in his budget. 
   The increase also represents a substantial hike in spending for education programs over last year's spending levels. In fact, the legislation we are about to consider increases education spending by $2 billion over the last fiscal year, and, again, the increase is $500 million over what the President proposed. 
   Clearly, there is a deep and heartfelt commitment in the Senate to increase education spending and to recognize its importance to the future of this country and to ensuring a bright future for our Nation's children. The issue has not been about money. The issue has been who is best able to make education decisions. That is the debate we will continue next year.  
   To me, the answer is obvious. We do need to increase the Federal investment in education, but at the same time we need to empower our local school boards, our parents, our teachers, and our principals to make the decisions and set the priorities. We need to hold them accountable for improved education achievement, but we do not need a Washington-knows-best, a one-size-fits-all approach to education policy. 
   There is other good news in the omnibus appropriations bill, and that is good news for students and their families who are pursuing higher education. Since I have come to the Senate, one of my highest priorities has been to increase Pell grants and student loans so that no qualified student faces a financial barrier that makes it impossible for him or her to attend college. 
   Prior to coming to the Senate, I worked at a small business and health college in Bangor, ME, known as Husson College. It was there that I first became aware of how critically important Federal financial assistance was for students who are attending college. 
   Eighty-five percent of the students at Husson College could not afford to attend college but for the assistance they were provided from student loans and from Pell grants. This assistance was absolutely essential in allowing them to attend college. Many of them were first-generation college students. They were the first people in their families to have the opportunity to attend college. They were taking a big step they knew would ensure a brighter future for them and more opportunities. 
   We know the vast majority of new jobs that are being created into the next century will require some kind of postsecondary education, either attendance at a technical college, a private college, or a university. We are going to need more and more skills, more and more education, if we are to compete for the jobs of the future. That is why I am so delighted the legislation provides a significant increase for Pell grants. 
   As you can see, the maximum Pell grant will be increased in the appropriations bill. Currently, it is $3,125. The President proposed $3,250. The appropriations bill passed by the Senate proposed $3,325. Those are good steps. They will help make college a little bit more affordable for our Nation's young people; indeed, also for older adults who are returning to college because they realize they need additional skills. 
   Once again, it is important we emphasize, the Senate increased spending for these essential Pell grants beyond what the President recommended. This is a budget of which we can be proud. It does not include every provision each of us would like. It reflects hours, weeks, and months of work. It reflects compromise. That is what the system is all about. 
   Each of us would write this bill differently. Each of us wishes the process could be cleaner, that we could work to get our legislation accomplished earlier, that we had more cooperation with the White House in achieving this goal. But the fact is, this legislation will ensure brighter futures for the families of America. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to set the record straight on these important issues. The bill, which will be before us later today, is not perfect but it is good legislation that deserves the support of all our colleagues. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am delighted the Senate has now sent S. 335, the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act that I introduced to curb deceptive mailings, to the President for his signature. 
   The Senate originally passed this legislation by a vote of 93-0 on August 2. It will impose new disclosure requirements on sweepstakes mailings to protect consumers. It will also provide new authority to the Postal Service to take enforcement action against those companies sending deceptive mailings. 
   I want to thank several people whose hard work has made passage today possible. I particularly want to acknowledge the contributions of Senator LEVIN of Michigan, the ranking minority member of the permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and the chief cosponsor of this important legislation. In addition, Senator COCHRAN and Senator EDWARDS were real leaders in this effort and contributed greatly to the legislation. 
   There were many other Senators, as well, who cosponsored this measure. In particular, I want to recognize the contributions of several members of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, including Chairman THOMPSON, Senators LIEBERMAN, STEVENS, DURBIN, DOMENICI, AKAKA, and SPECTER. They were early cosponsors of this legislation. 
   Senator CAMPBELL has also played an important role. He first introduced legislation to curb some of the deceptive practices of sweepstakes companies. 
   In addition, there are several Members of the House of Representatives who have also worked very hard to bring to about passage today. They include Congressman JOHN MCHUGH, who is chairman of the Subcommittee on the Postal Service; Congressman FATTAH, who is the ranking minority member of the subcommittee; Congressman LOBIONDO, Congressman ROGAN, Congressman MCCOLLUM, Congressman and Chairman DAN BURTON, and Congressman HENRY WAXMAN. All of them worked very hard to forge workable legislation that is going to make a real difference. 
   I also want to express my thanks to the members of my staff who worked very hard on this. On the subcommittee staff, Lee Blalack and Kirk Walder were instrumental, and on my personal staff, Michael Bopp, my legislative director--all of them worked very hard. 
   The requirements in this legislation will reduce the deceptive techniques that have caused countless Americans, hundreds of thousands of Americans, many of them elderly, to purchase products they do not need nor do they want. Once this legislation takes effect, mailings will be required to make crystal clear to consumers that no purchase is necessary to enter a sweepstakes and that making a purchase will not improve your chances of winning. 
   That is the primary misconception our investigation identified. Too many consumers believe if they make a purchase, somehow they will improve their chances of winning, but nothing could be further from the truth. It is easy to see why they have that misconception because that is exactly the impression these deceptive mailings are intended to leave. 
   In addition, the legislation will prohibit sweepstakes companies from telling people they are a winner unless they really have won a prize. 
   Enactment of this legislation concludes a year-long investigation by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair. Prompted by  complaints from my constituents in Maine, I began an investigation to examine deceptive mailings. Hearings before the subcommittee demonstrated that the deceptive techniques of major sweepstakes companies were misleading thousands of Americans into making purchases of products. Further investigation into the activities of the smaller sweepstakes companies, the ones that I call the ``stealth companies,'' showed that their practices were even more deceptive. In some cases, they bordered on outright fraud. 
   The subcommittee heard heartbreaking testimony that deceptive sweepstakes can induce trusting consumers to buy thousands of dollars of unnecessary and unwanted merchandise. One example was a magazine subscription extending to the year 2018 that one witness 
   testified that her 82-year-old father-in-law purchased because of sweepstakes promotions. 
   We found that our senior citizens are particularly vulnerable to these kinds of deceptive mailings. They are a trusting generation. Many seniors tend to believe what they read, particularly if it is endorsed by a trusted spokesman, comes from a well-known company, or involves a mailing that has been designed to appear as if it is from the Federal Government. 
   Family members told us of loved ones who were so convinced that they had won a sweepstakes that they refused to leave their home for fear they would miss the Prize Patrol. One constituent of mine actually canceled needed surgery because she did not want to miss Ed McMahon's visit. Sadly, of course, Ed McMahon never showed up. 
   We found cases of seniors enticed by the bold promises of sweepstakes who spent their Social Security checks, squandered their life's savings, and even borrowed money to buy unwanted magazines and other merchandise. 
   I will never forget the testimony of one man who broke down in tears as he recounted how the sweepstakes companies had deceived him into purchasing $15,000 worth of products in an effort to win the big prize. 
   The loss suffered by consumers cannot be measured in dollars alone. As one elderly gentleman put it:  
   My wife has finally come to realize that she has been duped by the sweepstakes solicitations for all these years. Although the financial train is now halted, the loss of her dignity is incalculable.  
   Unfortunately, these are not isolated examples. According to a survey commissioned by the AARP, 40 percent of seniors surveyed believe there is a connection between purchasing and winning. It is easy to see why consumers believe they have already won or that they will win if they just purchase something as a result of these mailings. 
   I would like to show you, Mr. President, and read from a sweepstakes mailing that I received last week at my home in Bangor, ME. As you can see, in bold print, it proclaims: ``Our sweepstakes results are now final.'' ``Ms. Susan M. Collins has won a cash prize of $833,337.'' ``A bank check for $833,337 is on its way to''--my address--``in Bangor.'' It further warns that I will forfeit the entire amount if I refuse to respond to this notice. On the back it says, again, ``A bank check for $833,337 in cash will be sent to you by certified mail if you respond now.'' 
   I have a feeling you will not be surprised to learn that I am not the big winner. But if I relied on the information in this mailing, it would be easy to see why many people would be deceived into thinking they have, indeed, won the grand prize. 
   Now, in the small print--not in the bold type--but in the small print it explains that I have to have the winning number to really win the prize. 
   That message is overwhelmed by the bold proclamations telling me I am a winner. Of course, in case I am tempted not to enter, there is what appears to be a personal note that says, ``Please don't say no now,'' and implores me to enter and to buy the product offered. This is not unusual. This is typical of the kinds of deceptive mailings that are all too common and that flood the mailboxes of American consumers with more than a billion pieces of mail a year. 
   You shouldn't have to be a lawyer, you shouldn't have to have a magnifying glass, to figure out the rules of the game and the odds of winning. Our legislation will make a real difference by requiring honest disclosures, by preventing sweepstakes companies from telling people they have won when they have not, and, most importantly, by making crystal clear to consumers that you don't have to make a purchase to win and that making a purchase will not increase your chances of winning. 
   Mr. President, as I said, I am pleased that the Senate is now poised to send my legislation to curb deceptive mailings to the President for his signature. 
   As I have described to my colleagues previously, you only have to look at some of these sweepstakes mailings to understand why. For example, one mailing by Publisher's Clearing House, which is famous for its Prize Patrol, tells the consumer to ``Open Your Door To $31 Million on January 31.'' This mailing suggests to the reader that his or her past purchases are paying off. Specifically, the mailing states: ``You see, your recent order and entry has proven to us that you're indeed one of our loyal friends and a savvy sweepstakes player. And now I'm pleased to tell you that you've passed our selection criteria to receive this special invitation.'' 
   Another mailing from American Family Publishers stated, ``It's Down to a 2 person race for $11,000,000--You And One Other Person In Georgia Were Issued the Winning Number ..... Whoever Returns It First Wins It All!'' Most people probably didn't see the fine print that declared, ``If you have the winning number.'' Unless the contestant reads and understands this fine print, the mailing leaves the unmistakable impression that the recipient and one other person have the winning number for the $11 million prize. 
   Mr. President, the bill adopted by the Senate would curb these problems by, for the first time, establishing federal standards for a variety of promotional mailings, including sweepstakes mailings. Such mailings must clearly and conspicuously display several important disclosures, including statements that no purchase is necessary to enter the contest and that a purchase will not improve your chances of winning; the odds of winning; the value and nature of each prize; and the name and address of the sponsor. Sweepstakes mailings would also be required to include all the rules and entry procedures for the sweepstakes. 
   This legislation also addresses another problem consumers experience in dealing with sweepstakes companies. The Subcommittee heard from many individuals who found it difficult to have their name or a parent's name removed from the mailing lists of sweepstakes companies, or who were told that the name removal process might take as long as six months. To address this problem, this legislation includes a section developed by Senator EDWARDS that would require companies sending sweepstakes or skill contests to establish a system allowing consumers to call or write to have their names removed from the companies' mailing lists. 
   The House made several modifications to this section of the bill, including extending the time from 35 days to 60 days by which companies must remove names of consumers who do not wish to receive future sweepstakes or skill contest mailings. Non-profit mailers who use sweepstakes contests requested a time limit of longer than 35 days, arguing that their limited resources might not allow the establishment of a system to quickly remove names. The 60-day limit in the bill, however, should not be used by any company to continue to inundate with more mailings those consumers who have asked to be removed from sweepstakes mailing lists. Accordingly, companies should make every effort to remove names as quickly as possible. 
   The House also added provisions to allow consumers to bring a private right of action in state court if they receive a mailing after previously requesting to be removed from the mailing list of a skill contest or sweepstakes promoter. Sweepstakes promoters will have an affirmative defense if they have established and implemented, with due care, reasonable practices and procedures to effectively prevent mailings that would violate the section on name removal. 
   The notification system in the bill passed by the Senate, and modified by the House, requires companies to include in every mailing the address or a  toll-free telephone number of the notification system, but does not require that consumers submit their name in writing to comply with the removal system. Companies are encouraged to adopt a consumer friendly system for the removal of names from their mailing lists, which may include the ability to have names removed by calling a toll-free number. Under this legislation, companies using a toll-free number to permit the removal of names would not need to require a consumer to also provide their name in writing. Any appropriate method of establishing a record of removal requests by consumers would comply with the requirements of Section 8(d) of the legislation. For example, companies may wish to electronically verify the consumer's election to be removed from their mailing list. 
   The legislation would strengthen the ability of the Postal Service to investigate, penalize, and stop deceptive mailings. It grants the Postal Inspection Service subpoena authority, nationwide stop mail authority, and the ability to impose tougher civil penalties. The House made several changes in the subpoena authority, including requiring the Postal Service to develop procedures for the issuance of subpoenas and their approval by the General Counsel or a Deputy General Counsel of the Postal Service. The new subpoena authority will give the Postal Inspection Service better ability to investigate and stop deceptive mailings, and I encourage the General Counsel of the Postal Service to recognize that effective enforcement of this legislation requires the timely issuance of subpoenas. 
   Mr. President, S. 335 will provide important new consumer protections against the many deceptive techniques currently used in promotional mailings. I thank my colleagues for their support of this measure. 
   I yield to the subcommittee's ranking minority member, Senator LEVIN. As I explained earlier in my remarks, he has been the chief cosponsor of this legislation and a true leader in the effort to crack down on deceptive mailings.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am delighted to offer the substitute amendment on this legislation on behalf of myself, Senator ROBB, and Senator MOYNIHAN. This amendment is also cosponsored by Senators CHAFEE, BREAUX, JEFFORDS, KENNEDY, REED, GRAHAM, SNOWE, GORTON, FEINSTEIN, GREGG, LANDRIEU, BOND, LEVIN, and KERRY. It is a revised version of the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999, which our beloved friend and late colleague, Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island, first introduced with Senator ROCKEFELLER earlier this year.  
   I particularly commend the chairman and the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN, for their leadership in negotiating and clearing this important bill so it could be sent to the President this year. Both have been long-time advocates for the well-being of foster children. 
   I also know Senator John Chafee would be so pleased that his son, LINC, is carrying on his efforts to help the well-being of foster children. 
   I thank the majority leader and the assistant majority leader for all of their work in helping us to bring this very important legislation to the Senate floor before we adjourn. 
   This legislation was very dear to the heart of Senator John Chafee. He recognized it as a rare opportunity to provide needed assistance to one of our Nation's most vulnerable groups, children in foster care programs. Senator Chafee was well known as a guardian of the rights of children, and he had a particular soft spot in his heart for children in foster care programs. He was a fierce advocate on their behalf. 
   It was tremendously important to Senator Chafee that we complete consideration of this legislation this year. This is why I am so proud this evening to be able to offer the substitute amendment as a tribute to Senator Chafee and to this commitment to help teenagers who are ``aging out'' of foster care. 
   Let me explain exactly what that means. Although practices vary from State to State, many foster children find themselves at risk of homelessness and being uninsured when they reach their 18th birthday. The families caring for them lose their financial assistance and the children themselves lose their health insurance coverage under the Medicaid program. 
   This can occur, even if the child is still in high school, even if the child has not yet graduated but has turned 18. Each year about 20,000 teenagers are forced to leave the foster care system simply because they have reached the age of 18. The legislation we are considering this evening will help remedy this very serious problem. It is similar to legislation that has already overwhelming passed the House of Representatives. 
   Among other things, the legislation renames the independent living programs for older foster children to be John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program. The legislation doubles the funding for States to assist young people in making the transition from foster care to independent living. It will double the funding from $70 million to $140 million a year. 
   The bill also provides access to needed health and mental health services for the teenagers who are ``aging out'' of foster care by encouraging States to extend Medicaid coverage to these young people until they reach the age of 21. Moreover, the legislation recognizes our moral obligation to provide special help for young people, age 18 to 21, who have left the foster care program. 
   The last hearing that Senator Chafee chaired was on the 
   issue of foster care teenagers. I remember his discussing with me how deeply moved he was by a teenage girl who had to finish high school while living in a homeless shelter. 
   This legislation will help prevent these kinds of tragedies by requiring States to use some portion of their funds under the new John Chafee Independent Program for room and board for 18- to 21-year-olds who have left foster care. At the same time, the legislation also gives States greater flexibility in designing their independent living programs. 
   Senator Chafee and Senator ROCKEFELLER brought together a lot of these older foster children to meet with a number of us who were interested in hearing their stories. We heard incredible hardships of teenagers who were trying to finish high school while coping with medical problems and the loss of their foster homes. One of them was living in laundromats, was brushing her teeth at a McDonald's, was trying to keep her life together under very difficult circumstances. 
   This simply should not occur. This bill will go a long way to prevent such awful situations by making sure we are helping these teenagers, these young adults as they transition from foster care to independent living. 
   The Foster Care Independence Act will provide much needed support to vulnerable teenagers as they make the critical and always difficult, under the best circumstances, transition from adolescence to adulthood. It will greatly improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of young people who will move through the foster care system in future years. As such, it serves as a tremendous living tribute to the late Senator John Chafee, who was so committed to their care. 
   I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this very important legislation.

   Ms. COLLINS. Thank you Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the reauthorization of the Northeast Dairy Compact. I am pleased that it appears Congress will accomplish this vital task before we adjourn for the year. 
   The reauthorization of the Compact is more critical now than ever before. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently predicted that milk prices for dairy farmers will be reduced 40 cents per gallon in December as a result of the announced drop in the basic formula price this past week. This translates into a 30 percent reduction in blend prices in December and will continue on into next year with additional declines in prices expected throughout the winter. The Dairy Compact will blunt the 40 cent per gallon drop in farm milk prices by one-half and will, by itself, make the difference between continuing in business and closing down for many small dairy farmers. 
   The Northeast Dairy Compact is a proven success and is critical to the survival of dairy farmers in Maine and throughout New England. The Compact has a proven track record of quantifiable benefits to both consumers and farmers. The Compact works by simply evening out the peaks and valleys in fluid milk prices, providing stability to the cost of milk and ensuring a supply of fresh, wholesome, local milk. The Compact works with market forces to help both the farmer and the consumer. As prices climb and farmers receive a sustainable price for milk, the Compact turns off. When prices drop to unsustainable levels, the Compact is triggered. The Compact simply softens the blow to farmers of an abrupt and dramatic drop in the volatile fluid milk market. 
   It is important to reiterate that consumers also benefit from the Compact. Not only does the Compact stabilize prices, thus avoiding dramatic fluctuation in retail cost of milk, it also guarantees that the consumer is assured of the availability of a supply of fresh, local milk. Let's remember that under the Compact, New England has lower retail fluid milk prices than many regions operating without a Compact. 
   Moreover, the Compact, while providing clear benefits to dairy producers and consumers in the Northeast, has proven it does not harm farmers or taxpayers from outside the region. A 1998 report by the Office of Management and Budget showed that, during its first 6 months of operation, the Compact did not adversely affect farmers from outside the Compact region and added no federal costs to nutrition programs. In fact, the Compact specifically excepts the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program from any costs related to the Compact. 
   The reauthorization of the Northeast Dairy Compact is also important as a matter of states rights. We often hear of criticism of the inside-the-beltway mentality that tells states, we here in Washington know better than you, even on issues traditionally under state and local control. Mr. President, that is wrong. In the Northeast Dairy Compact, we have a solution that was approved by all the legislatures and governors of the New England States. It is supported by every state commissioner in the region and overwhelmingly--if not unanimously--by Northeastern dairy farmers. 
   We in Congress should not be an obstacle to this practical, workable, local solution. 
   I urge my colleagues to refrain from holding up this critical measure for Maine and for our Nation's dairy farmers. To small farms in my State and in states throughout New England, this is not just a matter of profit margins; it is a matter of their survival. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to join my distinguished colleague, Senator SCHUMER, in introducing legislation that provides an effective option to the President and the Secretary of Energy to address the unfair, harmful manipulation in the global oil market. The Oil Price Safeguard Act would help to moderate sharp spikes in oil and gas prices caused by price fixing and production quotas through the judicious use of our enormous petroleum reserves. 
   The global oil market is dominated by an international cartel with the ability to dramatically affect the price of oil. The eleven member countries of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries known as OPEC supply over 40 percent of the world's oil and possess 78 percent of the world's total proven crude oil reserves. Their control of the world's oil supply allows these countries to collude to drive up the price of oil. OPEC has power to dominate the market and when it wields this power, consumers lose. Mr. President, if OPEC operated in the United States, the Department of Justice would undoubtedly prosecute the cartel for violation of U.S. anti-trust laws, but the cartel is beyond the reach of our antitrust enforcement. 
   To appreciate how much economic power OPEC wields, it is helpful to review the historical relationship between world oil prices and the U.S. Gross Domestic Product. When OPEC cuts production to increase profits, the American consumer suffers, as does our economy. Rising oil prices increase transportation and manufacturing costs, dampening economic growth. 
   The chart behind me entitled, ``Oil is a Vital Resource for the U.S. Economy,'' was prepared by the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy. On this chart, world oil prices are represented by the blue line, and U.S. Gross Domestic Product is represented by the red line. It is easy to see the inverse relationship between the two. When world oil prices are high, U.S. Gross Domestic Product drops. For example, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as the price of oil climbed, the U.S. economy slumped into a deep recession. Conversely, the strength currently enjoyed by the U.S. economy was until recently accompanied by low oil prices. 
   If these historical trends hold, the current rise in crude oil prices is a serious threat to our economic prosperity. This second chart entitled ``EIA Crude Oil Price Outlook,'' shows that crude oil prices have risen since January 1999 and are expected to continue rising this winter. To a large extent, this chart demonstrates the ability of OPEC to drive the price of oil up. It is chilling, that the Federal agency responsible for projecting energy prices for the government is predicting that the price of oil will be above $25 a barrel into January of next year. This prediction underscores the need for the legislation Senator SCHUMER and I introduce today. 
   The bottom line is that consumers, as well as businesses, are hurt by expensive petroleum products. A rise in crude oil prices increases the price of home heating oil and gasoline. Northern states like Maine are particularly hard hit by increased oil prices because of the need to heat homes through long cold winters. Since about 6 out of 10 Maine homes burn oil and the average household uses 800 gallons annually increases in oil prices have a dramatic impact on the state's population and particularly on low-income families and seniors. 
   A rural state like Maine is also hard hit by increased gasoline prices at the pump since rural residents often travel further distances than those living in urban or suburban areas. For example, my constituents in Aroostook County are currently paying close to $1.50 a gallon for regular octane gasoline. At the same time, higher petroleum prices increase the cost of transporting oil and gasoline to rural areas, like Northern Maine. 
   At a recent OPEC meeting, the member nations reasserted their resolve to maintain high crude oil prices through production quotas. This is particularly troubling considering that the Energy Information Administration has projected that if New England experiences a particularly cold winter, the price of home heating oil could reach as high as $1.20 per gallon. This is 50 percent higher than what New Englanders paid for oil last year. Even if this winter has normal weather, the Energy Information Administration predicts significantly increased oil prices due in large measure to the OPEC production reductions. This chart, ``Crude and Distillate Price Outlook Higher than Last Winter'' shows projections for steeply increased prices in crude oil and, consequently, home heating oil. As you can see, prices have risen already and are expected to reach levels higher than those experienced during the winter of 1996-97. 
   Even if our diplomatic efforts fail to break OPEC's choke-hold on the world oil supply, we need not sit idly as oil and gas prices rise well-beyond where they would be in a normally-functioning market. 
   The United States has a tool available to ease the sting of this unfair market manipulation. The United States owns the largest strategic reserve of crude oil in the world. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) consists of roughly 571 million barrels of crude oil held in salt caverns in Texas and Louisiana. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act allows the Secretary of Energy to sell oil from the reserve if the President makes certain findings set forth in the law. In order to tap into the Reserve, the President must determine that an emergency situation exists causing significant and lasting reductions in the supply of oil and severe price increases likely to cause a major adverse impact on the national economy. In the history of the Reserve, the President has only made this declaration once, during the Gulf War. 
   The legislation I am proud to sponsor with Senator SCHUMER today, who has been a leader on this issue, will give the President more flexibility in using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to protect American consumers. Specifically, this measure will amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to authorize a draw down of the reserve when the President finds that a significant reduction in the supply of oil has been caused by anti-competitive conduct. While many, myself included, believe that the President currently should consider ordering a draw down to counteract OPEC's latest market-distorting production quotas, this legislation will make it clear that he has the power to do so. It will also ensure that the proceeds from a draw-down of the Reserve are used to replenish its oil. The bill does by mandating that the proceeds are deposited in a special account designed for that purpose. We want to give the President the authority to use the SPR to restore market discipline, but not to permanently deplete the reserve in the process. 
   To further encourage the use of the SPR to offset harmful and uncompetitive activities of foreign pricing cartels, the Oil Price Safeguard Act will require the Secretary of Energy to consult with Congress regarding the sale of oil from the Reserve. If the price of a barrel of crude exceeds 25 dollars for a period greater than 14 days, the  President, through the Secretary of Energy, will be required to submit to Congress a report within thirty days. This report will have four parts. First, it will detail the causes and potential consequences of the price increase. Second, it will provide an estimate of the likely duration of the price increase, based on analyses and forecasts of the Energy Information Administration. Third, it will provide an analysis of the effects of the price increase on the cost of home heating oil. And fourth, the report will provide a specific rationale for why the President does or does not support a draw down and distribution of oil from the SPR to counteract anti-competitive behavior in the oil market. 
   The bill we are introducing today will grant important new authority to the President to protect consumers from the market-distorting behavior of foreign cartels. It will require the President to explain to Congress and the American people why actions available to the President have not been exercised to protect consumers. I urge my colleagues to join Senator SCHUMER and me in working for expeditious passage of this important measure. 
   I yield to my colleague, the distinguished Senator from New York, so he may provide further explanation of our legislation. I commend him for his leadership on this issue.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of S. 1516, legislation reauthorizing the Federal Emergency Administration's Emergency Food and Shelter program, I am very pleased that the Senate is about to pass this legislation and send it to the House of Representatives. I hope that our colleagues in the House will swiftly approve this important bill, so that it can be sent to President Clinton for his signature before our legislative session adjourns for the year. 
   FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter (EFS) program provides financial assistance to supplement community efforts to provide food, shelter, and other valuable items to homeless and hungry people around the country. Most of the EFS' monies are distributed directly to local boards, which are comprised of representatives from religious and charitable organizations from the surrounding area. These boards then award grants to non-profit, voluntary, and social service organizations, which assist individuals with their food, shelter, or emergency assistance costs. Using a local distribution network helps to ensure that the EFS' funds are targeted to those who most need assistance. 
   To its credit, FEMA has been very successful in keeping the administrative costs of this program very low. In fact, these costs consume less than 3 percent of the funding, which is an inspiring example that all of the Federal Government's agencies and departments should strive to follow. 
   In Maine, the EFS program has been extremely helpful. For example the Sister Mary O'Donnell Shelter, located in Presque Isle, Maine, received a $10,500 grant from this program. Amazingly enough, this shelter was able to use this modest funding to provide the equivalent of 1,974 nights of shelter for the homeless in northern Maine. 
   EFS is a very successful program that carefully targets its resources where they are needed most, and does so with an absolute minimum of administrative expense. The Government Affairs Committee approved this legislation with a unanimous voice vote on November 3, 1999, and I hope the full Senate will do likewise.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to explain my opposition to the African Growth and Opportunity Act. My decision was difficult because I wholeheartedly support provisions of the bill that would reauthorize of two important trade-related programs--the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). These programs provide vital benefits to the state of Maine and the nation. Although on balance, I believe that H.R. 434 unfairly damages Maine's economy, I take solace in the fact that the TAA and GSP programs are one step closer to being reauthorized. I would like to focus for a moment on these two programs. 
   The TAA aids workers and firms in global economic readjustments. By providing funds to retrain workers, TAA's program offers both opportunity and a lifeline to workers displaced by market changes caused by imports. It helps firms threatened by increased imports through grants to explore new technology, manufacturing methods, and marketing techniques. I have seen the effectiveness and efficiency of the TAA program firsthand in my state of Maine and strongly support both its goal and methods. 
    Mr. President, I would like to recount just one TAA success story of the many in Maine and the nation. Four years ago, when a shoe factory in Old Town, Maine closed, one of the employees laid off was a woman in her fifties. She had worked in shoe factories all of her working life. With no high school degree, unemployed, and no skills other than making shoes in an economy with few shoe-making jobs, this woman was in dire straits until she qualified for TAA assistance. Fortunately, she seized the retraining opportunity to earn her GED and then trained as a nursing assistant. She recently proudly stopped by the local retraining office to let them know of her new job as a nursing assistant. She now works in home health care, making more money and enjoying greater flexibility than when she worked in a shoe  factory. In a true tribute to the effectiveness of the TAA program, she told the retraining officials, ``I wish I had been laid off sooner.'' This story exemplified why the TAA program must be expeditiously reauthorized. 
   Similarly, the GSP program deserves swift reauthorization. It establishes a mechanism for extending duty-free treatment of certain products imported from designated developing countries. The GSP program allows for participation by only those countries that adequately protect intellectual and property rights, observe international standards of labor rights, employ certain economic policies, and satisfy other important criteria. Moreover, the GSP program is limited to products that are non-import sensitive, meaning American jobs are not threatened. 
   In fact, the GSP program helps create jobs in America. The Foreside Company based on Gorham, Maine, depends on the GSP program to be able to import product necessary to create jobs in Maine. The Foreside Company, with over 150 employees, is one of the fastest growing companies in Maine. The energetic entrepreneur who runs this company tells me that if GSP is not renewed, it would harm this Maine business to the point that it would jeopardize dozens of jobs. 
   I am disappointed that legislation reauthorizing the TAA and GSP programs were incorporated in H.R. 434, and not passed as independent bills. Unfortunately, H.R. 434 includes measures that I cannot support. The African Growth and Opportunity Act and the Carribean Basin Initiative are both deeply flawed proposals that would hurt Maine workers and companies. 
   I want the record to clearly show, however, that in spite of my votes against H.R. 434, I remain strongly supportive of both the Generalized System of Preferences Extension Act and the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act and strongly advocate for reauthorization of both programs.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, earlier this year the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, undertook an extensive investigation of the practices of sweepstakes companies. We held hearings in March and later in the year to examine the increasingly deceptive and aggressive marketing techniques used by many of the sweepstakes companies in this country. 
   At these hearings, I was told repeatedly by these companies that they did not target the elderly, they did not use deceptive techniques to try to induce people to buy products they didn't really need or want, and that they were constantly reviewing their promotional language to make sure it was fair. They pledged to further improve their efforts to make sure their mailings were not deceptive. 
   Recently, my constituents have sent me a number of examples of deceptive sweepstakes mailings. I tell my colleagues, they are just as deceptive as ever. I have seen absolutely no voluntary improvement by the sweepstakes industry, despite the extensive attention given to their deceptive practices. 
   Let me share with the Senate some of the recent examples my constituents have sent me. This example is from Charles M. Sias of Bangor, ME. Mr. Sias happens to be the head of the local AARP chapter, and he recently arranged for me to talk to a group of senior citizens in the Bangor area about sweepstakes. We developed a list of tips  for them to be able to identify deceptive mailings. It is particularly ironic that Mr. Sias is himself receiving mailings that are clearly deceptive. He is very aware of what to look out for, so he is not going to be deceived by the language of these mailings. But, unfortunately, that is not the case with many other consumers who are inundated with mailings of this sort. 
   Take a look at this mailing. It says, in very large print: The judges have decided: Charles M. Sias of Bangor is our $833,337 winner. And then: We will update our official winners list so that it reads--again, it lists Mr. Sias' name. Urgent: Mail back your prize number within 5 days. In the corner: This is your exclusive prize claim number--giving the appearance that Mr. Sias has already won. 
   This particular mailing comes from a division of Time, Inc., known as Guaranteed & Bonded. It is very similar to the kinds of deceptive mailings we have seen during the past year. 
   A representative of Time, Inc., testified at our hearings. She testified that this kind of mailing is fair but assured us they were continuing to evaluate the copy in their mailings and they were trying to improve it so there would be no question. 
   This is a recent solicitation, and it is just as deceptive as previous ones. I think it is very disappointing to once again see the use of very large, bold headlines declaring that one of my constituents is the winner of more than $833,000 when obviously his chances of winning are less than his chances of being struck by lightning. 
   Let me give another example provided to me by one of my constituents. In some ways, this letter from Publishers Clearing House, another one of the major sweepstakes companies, is even more insidious. It was personally addressed to the woman who sent it to me. It says: These are the certified cash winner documents we alerted you to watch for. 
   The use of the words ``certified cash winner'' creates the image that my constituent has won a great deal of money. But this goes beyond the other mailing. The $100,000 figure appears to have been personally crossed out. On the side, it says it is now $200,000 my 
   constituent is going to win, and it appears a woman named Dorothy, whom we know to be an employee of Publishers Clearing House, has written a personal note to my constituent, to this woman who lives in Portland, ME, and has written: ``$200,000--see enclosed urgent notification for details,''--once again, creating the impression that my constituent is going to win not $100,000 but now $200,000. It is her lucky day. 
   Again, if we look at the small print, we find that, in fact, the vast majority of people responding to this solicitation will receive just $1. It is extremely misleading. 
   To add to the deception, Publishers Clearinghouse includes what appears to be a check of some sort. They call it a claim voucher. It is made out to my constituent. I have blocked out her name to protect her privacy. It appears to be personally signed in blue ink by the treasurer and by Dorothy Addeo, and it says: Cash value up to $100,000--although we know from Dorothy's helpful little note that it actually may be $200,000. 
   My point is that this is clearly intended to deceive the people who are receiving these solicitations. The intent is to part people from their money, to get them to buy merchandise they don't really need or want, in the mistaken belief that somehow making a purchase will either guarantee they will be a winner or at least increase the odds of their winning that great prize, those hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
   There is another harm that is done beyond the financial waste of senior citizens and others wasting their money buying products they don't really need or want. That is the injury that is done to a senior citizen's dignity when they realize they have been duped by these highly deceptive mailings. 
   I recently received a letter from one of my constituents which I will share with my colleagues. It shows how tragic some of the results are of these sweepstakes. We found seniors who have wasted $10,000, $20,000, $60,000 on sweepstakes, thinking it would help them win the grand prize. In some cases, they have squandered their Social Security checks and even borrowed money. As I said, there is also the injury to a person's dignity once they realize they have been fooled. 
   This letter captures that part of the problem. My constituent writes to Reader's Digest in this case:  
   Several days ago my father received your ``announcement'' that he had been nominated to fill ``your newest position'' on the ``exclusive Winners Advisory Board.'' With its official looking certificates and ``personal'' Internal Selection Record you had him convinced that he was indeed being asked to serve in some official, though honorary capacity. When he realized that this was another sweepstakes gimmick, and that he was no more special to you than the thousands of others who received this same ``special'' announcement, he was devastated. 
   My father shared your ``announcement'' with me because he was proud that he was being recognized by a company he has supported for many, many years. What a cruel game you have played with a man who has truly been a good customer. What a cruel game you play with every person who received this same, or similar letter, and who, like my father, are vulnerable because they believe the best about people.  
   I think my constituent has described the problem very eloquently. These kinds of deceptive mailings prey on people who believe what they read, who want to trust that they are not being misled. 
   Mr. President, on August 2, the Senate unanimously approved legislation that I, Senator LEVIN, Senator COCHRAN, Senator EDWARDS, and many others have worked on, which would curtail these kinds of deceptive sweepstakes mailings. 
   I want to thank the Chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Postal Service, Congressman JOHN MCHUGH, for his excellent work in securing approval by the House of a strong measure to prevent these types of deceptive sweepstakes mailings. In addition, Congressman FRANK LOBIONDO, who introduced a strong sweepstakes disclosure measure in the House, has made a valuable contribution to the effort to curb deceptive mailings. Congressman JAMES ROGAN and Congressman BILL MCCOLLUM have also introduced legislation to address this problem, and have given their strong support to the effort to reform the current practices. I also appreciate the support and assistance given by Congressman CHAKA FATTAH and Congressman HENRY WAXMAN, who have provided both excellent ideas and leadership during House consideration of legislation to address the problem of deceptive sweepstakes. 
   The Senate bill was passed, as I said, unanimously, and it is now pending in the House Government Reform Committee. It has been unanimously approved by the Postal Subcommittee of the House Government Reform Committee, and it is my fervent hope that before we adjourn this year we can clear this important legislation and see it signed into law. It is time to put an end to these deceptive and unfair mailings that prey on the hopes and dreams of our senior citizens. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor, and seeing no one seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my friend and colleague, Senator JACK REED of Rhode Island, in discussing the passage of a resolution we introduced designating this week, October 24 through the 30th, as National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week. 
   Senator REED has been such a strong advocate and leader on lead poisoning issues. I have enjoyed working with him on this important public health issue. 
   It is my hope the designation of this week as National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week will help to increase awareness of the significant dangers and prevalence of childhood lead poisoning across our Nation. 
   Great strides have been made in the past 20 years to reduce the threat that lead poses to human health. Most notably, lead has been banned from many products, including residential paints, food cans, and gasoline. These commendable steps have significantly reduced the incidence of lead poisoning. But unfortunately, contrary to what many people think, the threat has not been eradicated. In fact, it remains and continues to imperil the health and well-being of our Nation's children. In  fact, lead poisoning is the No. 1 environmental health threat to children in the United States. 
   Even low levels of lead exposure can have serious developmental consequences, including reductions in IQ and attention span, reading and learning disabilities, hyperactivity and behavioral problems. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently estimates that 890,000 children, age 1 through 5, have blood levels of lead that are high enough to affect their ability to learn--nearly a million children. 
   Today, the major lead poisoning threat to children is posed by paint that has deteriorated. Contrary to popular belief, it is the dust from deteriorating or disturbed paint, rather than paint chips, that is the primary source of lead poisoning. Unfortunately, it is all too common for older homes to contain lead-based paint, particularly if they were built before 1978. More than half of the entire housing stock and three-quarters of homes built before 1978, contain some lead-based paint. Paint manufactured prior to the residential lead paint ban often remains safely contained and unexposed for decades. But over time, often through remodeling or normal wear and tear, the paint can become exposed, contaminating the home with dangerous lead dust.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer congratulations to one of Maine's most impressive athletes. At the age of 95, Mr. Napoleon ``Nappy'' LaChance of Westbrook, ME, will be our State's oldest participant in the National Senior Olympics. 
   Mr. LaChance, who earned a gold medal in the fast walk competition in the last Maine Senior Olympics, will travel to Orlando, FL, tomorrow, October 23, to represent the State of Maine in that event. 
   Equally impressive, Mr. LaChance does not excel in just one sport. Not only did he win a gold medal for fast walking in the Maine Senior Olympics, but he also has won gold medals for golfing and bowling. 
   Mr. LaChance has achieved success in his career as well as in athletic competitions. In 1917, Mr. LaChance began working at Valee Pharmacy as a floor sweeper and errand boy. Through hard work and dedication, he became a registered pharmacist and managed the pharmacy until his retirement. For his dedication to his community's well-being, Mr. LaChance has been rewarded with the respect, affection, and admiration of his customers, neighbors, family, and friends. 
   Mr. LaChance's accomplishments are an inspiration to anyone who aspires to be the best they can be. Whether old or young, athlete or artist, social worker or science teacher, those who seek to be the best share the dedication and the determination exhibited for so long by Mr. LaChance. I extend to him my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes as he competes in the National Senior Olympics representing the great State of Maine. Regardless of the outcome of the race, I know Mr. LaChance will make Maine proud. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by my friend and colleague from Illinois, Senator DURBIN, and the senior Senator from Maine to ban all late-term abortions, including partial-birth abortions that are not necessary to save the mother's life or to protect her health from grievous physical harm. 
   Let me be clear from the outset. I am strongly opposed to all late-term abortions, including partial-birth abortions. I agree they should be banned. However, I also believe that an exception must be made for those rare cases when it is necessary to save the life of the mother or to protect her physical health from grievous harm. Fortunately, late-term abortions are extremely rare in my State where, according to the Maine Department of Human Services, just two late-term abortions have been performed in the last 16 years. 
   This debate should not be about one particular method of abortion but, rather, about the larger question of under what circumstances should late-term or postviability abortions be legally available. The sponsors of this amendment--and I am pleased to be a cosponsor--believe that all late-term abortions, regardless of the procedure used, should be banned except in those rare cases where the life or the physical health 
   of the mother is at serious risk. 
   In my view, Congress is ill equipped to make judgments on specific medical procedures. As the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which represents over 90 percent of OB/GYNs and which opposes the legislation introduced by the Senator from Pennsylvania, has said:  
   The intervention of legislative bodies into medical decisionmaking is inappropriate, ill advised, and dangerous.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in its statement, the Maine Medical Association states that ``such a ban would deny a patient and her physician the right to make medically appropriate decisions about the best course for that patient's care. ..... The intervention of legislative bodies into medical decisionmaking is inappropriate, ill advised and dangerous.'' 
   The MMA statement goes on to say:  
   ..... when serious fetal anomalies are discovered or a pregnant woman develops a life or health-threatening medical condition that makes continuation of the pregnancy dangerous, abortion--  
   Unfortunately, I add--  
   may be medically necessary. In these cases, intact dilation and evacuation procedures may provide substantial medical benefits or, in fact, may be the only option. This procedure may be safer than the alternatives ..... [may] reduce blood loss, and reduce the potential for other complications.  
   That is what the experts are telling us. That is what the doctors are telling us. 
   Our amendment goes far beyond, in many ways, what the Senator from Pennsylvania is attempting to accomplish. His legislation would only prohibit one specific medical procedure. It will not prevent a single late-term abortion. Let me emphasize that point. The partial-birth legislation before us would not prevent a single late-term abortion. A physician could simply use  another, perhaps more dangerous, method to end the pregnancy. 
   By contrast, the Durbin-Snowe proposal would prohibit the abortion of any viable fetus by any method unless the abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the mother or to prevent grievous injury to her physical health. 
   We have taken great care to tightly limit the health exception in our bill to grievous injury to the mother's physical health. It would not allow late-term abortions to be performed simply because a woman is depressed or feeling stressed or has some minor physical health problem because of pregnancy. 
   Moreover, we have included a very important second safeguard. The initial opinion of the treating physician that the continuation of pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health must be confirmed by a second opinion from an independent physician. 
   This second opinion must come from an independent physician who will not be involved in the abortion procedure and who has not been involved in the treatment of the mother. This second physician must also certify--in writing--that, in his or her medical judgment, the continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health. 
   What we are talking about are the severe, medically diagnosable threats to a woman's physical health that are sometimes brought on or aggravated by pregnancy. 
   Let me give you a few examples: Primary pulmonary hypertension, which can cause sudden death or intractable congestive heart failure; severe pregnancy-aggravated hypertension with accompanying kidney or liver failure; complications from aggravated diabetes such as amputation or blindness; or an inability to treat aggressive cancers such as leukemia, breast cancer, or non-Hodgkins lymphoma. 
   These are all obstetric conditions that are cited in the medical literature as possible indications for pregnancy terminations. In these extremely rare cases--where the mother has been certified by two physicians to be at risk of losing her life or suffering grievous physical harm--I believe that we should leave the very difficult decisions about what should be done to the best judgment of the women, families, and physicians involved. 
   The Durbin-Snowe-Collins amendment is a fair and compassionate compromise on this extremely difficult issue. It would ensure that all late-term abortions--including partial-birth abortions--are strictly limited to those rare and tragic cases where the life or the physical health of the mother is in serious jeopardy. This amendment presents an unusual opportunity for both ``pro-choice'' and ``pro-life'' advocates to work together on a reasonable approach, and I urge our colleagues to join us in supporting it.

    Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an extraordinary Maine family, distinguished both by its record of public service and the accomplishments it has achieved in many other walks of life. The Washburn family included three sisters  and seven brothers who helped guide this country through the Civil War and prepare our Nation for the 20th century. I am proud, as all Mainers are, that the Washburns hailed from Livermore, Maine, where the Norlands Living History Center still honors their memory and provides people of all ages with a chance to experience rural life in the late 1800's. 
   Israel and Martha Washburn raised 10 children in Livermore, Maine, during the early years of the 19th century. Included among the children were seven brothers who made substantial contributions to our Nation. The Washburns hold the distinction of being the only family in the history of our Nation to have three brothers serve in Congress simultaneously. In the 1850's Cadwallader Washburn representing Wisconsin, Elihu Washburn representing Illinois, and Israel Washburn, Jr., representing Maine were all Members of Congress in the tumultuous era leading up to the Civil War. Years later, William Washburn followed his brothers to Congress, representing Minnesota for three terms. William concluded his time in Washington with a term in the United States Senate. 
   The Washburns served the public outside of Washington as well. Cadwallader Washburn was elected Governor of Minnesota in 1872. His brother, Israel, was Governor of Maine from 1861 to 1863 and is ranked as one of the great ``war governors'' of the Civil War era for his skill and dedication in raising and equipping volunteer regiments for the Union cause. Israel was also an early member of the Republican Party and is given credit by some for naming the party. 
   The Washburns also served their country abroad. Charles Washburn served as a Minister to Paraguay in the 1860's. During the War of the Triple Alliance, he was forced to flee the country when the dictator of Paraguay, General Francisco Solano Lopez, accused Washburn and other embassy staffers of conspiring with Paraguay's enemies. 
   Elihu Washburne, who added the English ``e'' to his last name, was also a diplomat. After 16 years in the House of Representatives, where he was known as the ``watchdog of the Treasury'' for his unyielding oversight of the ``peoples money,'' he was appointed to a 2-week term as President Grant's Secretary of State. Following the courtesy appointment, he was selected as our Nation's Ambassador to France. Elihu rose to diplomatic greatness during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871, which resulted in the fall of Napoleon III and the French Empire. Throughout the Siege of Paris and the upheaval of the Commune, he alone among foreign ambassadors remained at his post and gave refuge to hundreds of foreign citizens trapped in the city. His memoirs, ``Recollections of a Minister to France, 1869-1877,'' provide an important historical accounting of the end of France's Empire and his service is a model of exemplary diplomatic performance during a crisis. 
   The Washburn brothers also served our Nation in the military. Samual Washburn spent his life on the sea and served in the U.S. Navy during the Civil War as the captain of the gunboat Galena. Cadwallader recruited and commanded the Second Wisconsin Volunteer Cavalry, which served with distinction in the Civil War's southwestern theater. He rose to the rank of major-general, serving with Grant at Vicksburg and later as military commander of the Memphis District of the Army of the Tennessee. 
   As remarkable as they were, the achievements of the Washburn Brothers were not limited to military and governmental pursuits. Four of the brothers, Israel, Elihu, William, and Cadwallader, were lawyers. Charles was a writer and journalist who invented a typewriting machine that was sold to the Remington Company. Algernon Sydney Washburn was a successful banker in Hallowell, Maine. ``Sid,'' as he was known, provided loans to his brothers that financed many of their ventures. Cadwallader was also a successful businessman and founded a large milling operation in Minneapolis that produced Gold Medal flour, which can still be found on the shelves of America's grocery stores. Today, his company is known as General Mills. William also engaged in milling, and his company later merged with the Pillsbury Corporation. 
   Though the adventures of the seven brothers Washburn took them all over the globe, the Norlands in Livermore, Maine, was always their home. In 1973, their descendants donated the property, which included the family mansion, surrounding historic buildings, and hundreds of acres of land, to the non-profit Washburn-Norlands Foundation. Today, the property that was once home to this remarkable family is a living history center. Each year, approximately 25,000 visitors have the opportunity to sample life in the 1800's through Norland's hands-on educational programs. Moreover, the museum and property honors the many accomplishments of a family that is nearly without peer in the history of public service to this great nation. The Norlands Living History Center is significant for both the history it preserves and the innovative education it provides, and I commend those associated with the center for the important work that they do. 
   Mr. President, the legacy of the Washburn family is yet another example of why Maine and its people are so special. I am grateful for having had this opportunity to share with you the story of this remarkable family and to acknowledge the important work being done by the dedicated staff and friends of the Norlands Living History Center to protect and share this important piece of our heritage.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the question before the Senate is, Are we going to make progress in reforming our campaign finance system or not? 
   That is the simple question before us. In the 105th Congress, the Senate took up comprehensive campaign finance reform measures three times--in September of 1997, in March of 1998, and in September of 1998. Despite my support and the support of a majority of the Senate, these measures could not break the legislative logjam and move forward. So it was obvious it was time for a new approach, a new test that would allow the Senate to consider a more narrow piece of legislation and then work its will on the various components of the original McCain-Feingold bill. 
   Now, I am a supporter of the more comprehensive approach. I am proud to have been an early cosponsor of the McCain-Feingold bill. The Shays-Meehan bill is, too, an excellent piece of legislation. It contains many provisions I wholeheartedly support. But the point is--and the Senator from New Jersey is well aware of it--the comprehensive approach will not garner the votes necessary to move through this Senate. So the question is, Do we want to make progress or don't we? 
   It is difficult to think of a better example of the old adage of ``the perfect being the enemy of the good'' than the debate we are having this morning. So I rise in strong support of the underlying measure before us, the revised McCain-Feingold bill. 
   The underlying bill closes the most glaring loophole in our campaign finance laws by banning the unlimited, unregulated contributions known as soft money. The legislation also takes an important step of codifying the Supreme Court's decision in the Beck case. This will preserve the rights of nonunion members who must pay fees to a union to have their money excluded from the union's political activity fund. 
   In 1974, in the aftermath of Watergate, Congress passed comprehensive campaign finance reform measures that placed dollar limits on political contributions. 
   In its Buckley v. Valeo ruling, the Supreme Court upheld those contributions limits reasoning they were a legitimate means to guard against the reality or appearance of improper political influence. 
   Contribution limits remain on the books, but in reality, they have become a dead letter. The resourceful have found that the easiest way to circumvent the spirit of Federal election  law is to provide huge sums to the political parties through soft money donations. For years, soft money contributions to the major political parties were used for party overhead and organizational expenses. But over time, the use of soft money has increased dramatically to include a wider range of activities which influence elections. 
   Mr. President, in 1907, corporations were banned from directly contributing to Federal elections from their treasury funds. In 1947, Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act, which banned labor unions from contributing treasury funds to candidates. Plain and simple, the soft money corporations and labor unions funnel through the parties clearly circumvents those laws. 
   We in this body decry legal loopholes, but we have reserved a gaping one for ourselves. Indeed, the soft money loophole is more like a black hole, and that sucking sound you hear during election years is the whoosh of six-figure soft money donations gushing into party coffers. 
   The soft money loophole in our Federal election laws has been exploited to the point where the legislative framework put in place in the 1970's has become a mere shell. In 1994, approximately $100 million was raised through soft money by the major parties. Four years later, that amount more than doubled--fully $224 million was raised in soft money. 
   The problem with soft money was painfully evident during the 1997 hearings at the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, in which the Committee heard from one individual who gave $325,000 to the Democratic National Committee in order to secure a picture with the President of the United States. We also heard from another individual, the infamous and clearly unrepentant Roger Tamraz who testified that next time he is willing to spend $600,000, rather than $300,000, to purchase access to the White House. In a July, 1997 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Johnny Chung, who gave $366,000 derived from illegal foreign sources to the Democratic National Committee and other Democrat organizations, cynically revealed the depth of the current problem; he said, ``I see the White House is like a subway--you have to put in the coins to open up the gates.'' 
   This is what this debate is about. 
   How long can public faith in a political system survive when the public 
   perception exists that wealthy groups are given a stage, podium and a microphone to broadcast their concerns, while the voice of the vast majority remains muted? 
   I hope Members will indulge me if I take a moment to explain the importance of this issue to the people of Maine. 
   Time and time again, I hear it said on the Senate floor and elsewhere that the American people do not care about this issue. I can't speak for the citizens of other States, but I know the people of Maine care deeply about this issue--about reforming our campaign finance system. 
   My home State has a deep commitment to preserving the integrity of the electoral system and ensuring that all Mainers have an equal political voice--and Mainers have backed their commitment to an open political process in both word and deed. In many regions of Maine, political life is dominated by town meetings and public forums in which all citizens are invited to share their concerns, and hash out critical political matters. This is unvarnished direct democracy where all citizens are a part of the process. People with more money do not get to speak longer or louder than people with less money. Perhaps it is our tradition of town meetings that explains why so many Maine citizens feel so strongly about reforming our Federal campaign laws, about reforming the current system. And that strong feeling is one I share. 
   The bill before us today is not a broad sweeping reform such as the one we considered last year and the year before. Rather, it is a modest attempt to achieve some progress by tackling the biggest abuse in the system. This primary purpose of today's bill is to stem the growing reliance on huge soft money contributions. This is not a radical approach; rather, our proposal to eliminate political party soft money, endorsed by former Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George Bush, is a measured step toward meaningful reform. 
   Mr. President, when I ran for a seat in this body, I advocated major changes to our campaign finance law, but I recognize that goal must wait for another time. 
   But surely we can take this initial critical first step. Although I remain personally committed to more comprehensive changes in the current law, I believe the revised McCain-Feingold bill before us today will serve as a building block on which we can build a much better election financing system. 
   I look forward to the debate in the days ahead. My colleagues have several proposals to improve this bill. But at the conclusion of this debate, my guiding principle in casting my votes on the amendments before us, including the proposal by the Democratic leader, will be answering the question of whether we are moving forward and whether we are successfully ending the abuse of unregulated soft money in our campaign finance system. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this modest, commonsense first step to restore integrity and public confidence in our campaign system. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Senate Republicans are committed to enacting legislation to preserve, strengthen, and save Medicare for current and future generations. In addition to addressing the long-term issues facing Medicare, it is absolutely critical that this Congress also take action this year to remedy some of the unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which have been exacerbated by a host of ill-conceived new regulatory requirements imposed by the Clinton administration. 
   These problems are the subject of the issue my colleague from Kansas and I wish to address today, for these problems are jeopardizing access to critical home health services for millions of our Nation's most vulnerable and frail senior citizens. 
   America's home health agencies provide invaluable services that have enabled a growing number of our vulnerable senior citizens to avoid hospitals, to avoid nursing homes, and receive the care they need and want in the security and privacy of their own homes--right where they want to be. 
   In 1996, however, home health was the fastest growing component of the Medicare budget, which understandably prompted Congress and the Clinton administration to initiate changes that were intended to make the program more cost effective and efficient. There was strong bipartisan support for the provisions that called for the implementation of a prospective payment system for home care. Unfortunately, until this system is implemented, home health care agencies are being paid under a critically flawed interim payment system known as IPS, 
   that penalizes those home health agencies that historically have been the most cost effective.

   Ms. COLLINS. Unfortunately, that is exactly right. Unbelievable though it may seem, the formula that is being used actually penalizes those agencies in our two States that have done a good job of holding down costs. It rewards those home health agencies that have provided the most visits, that have spent the most Medicare dollars. It is totally backwards. In fact, home health agencies in our two regions of the country, the Northeast and the Midwest, are among those that have been particularly hard hit by this inexplicable formula, the IPS, that the Senator just mentioned. 
   The Wall Street Journal observed last year--this could be said of agencies in the Midwest as well--that if New England had just been a little greedier, its home health agencies would be a whole lot better off now. Ironically, the regions, yours and mine, are getting clobbered by the system because they have had a tradition of nonprofit community service and efficiency. 
   Even more troubling--and I commend the Senator from Kansas for his leadership on this issue; I know this troubles him as well--is the fact the flawed system is restricting access to care for the very senior citizens who need the care the most. Those are our seniors who are the sicker patients, who have complex chronic care needs, such as diabetic wound care patients whom I visited in northern Maine during a home health care visit, or IV therapy patients who require multiple visits. Indeed, according to a recent survey by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, almost 40 percent of home health agencies have said there are patients who they no longer serve due to the flawed interim payment system and the regulatory overkill on the part of the Clinton administration. 
   I show the distinguished Senator from Kansas and the distinguished Presiding Officer, who is also committed to this issue, and my other colleagues, a chart that demonstrates the dramatic impact the IPS, this flawed payment system, has had in my own State of Maine. 
   As you can see, the number of Medicare beneficiaries who have been served by home health care agencies has dropped dramatically. It has dropped by 13 percent, from 49,458 to 42,858; 6,600 senior and disabled citizens in my State have lost their access to home health care services in 1 year. This is so 
   troubling to me. The number of visits has plummeted by more than 420,000, and reimbursements to our home health agencies have dropped by an astounding $20 million in a year. Keep in mind that Maine has some of the least costly home health care agencies in the country. They have been very prudent in their use of resources. They were low cost to begin with. So when this formula went into effect, it put such a squeeze on them, they had no choice but to close offices, lay off staff, and stop serving some of the most vulnerable, ill senior citizens in my State. 
   The point is, cuts of this magnitude, that we have seen in the State of Maine and throughout the country, cannot be sustained without hurting senior citizens.

The problems with the IPS system, which the Senator has described so eloquently for his State, and we have seen in my State, are all the more pressing because the Clinton administration has missed the deadline for implementing the prospective payment system. As a consequence, home health care agencies throughout our Nation are going to be struggling under this unfair and flawed payment system far longer than Congress ever envisioned or intended when it passed the Balanced Budget Act.

   Ms. COLLINS. The Senator is absolutely correct. We not only have a flawed payment system, but home health agencies are struggling under a mountain of burden of unnecessary and onerous regulations imposed by HCFA, imposed by the Clinton administration. In fact, my colleague may be interested to know that earlier this year I chaired a hearing of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on home health care. We heard firsthand about the financial distress and cash-flow problems that home health agencies across the country are experiencing. In fact, the Senator has talked about the number that have closed in Kansas. 
   The Senator may already know, but for the benefit of my colleagues who may not be as well informed as the Senator from Kansas, more than 2,300 home health agencies across the country have been forced to close their doors as a result of the regulatory burden and the flawed payment system. 
   We heard witnesses talk about their frustrations. In fact, the CEO of the Visiting Nurses Service in Saco, ME, termed the Clinton administration's regulatory policy as being one of ``implement and suspend.'' She and others pointed to numerous examples of hastily enacted, ill-conceived requirements along the lines of what the Senator  pointed out--surety bonds, sequential billing, the OASIS system, a host of unnecessary regulatory requirements. What has happened is, no sooner does HCFA impose this burden on these home health agencies and they invest the costs necessary to comply, then HCFA changes its mind and suspends the regulatory requirements and says never mind.

This is a typical example of the administration rushing in without thinking through the regulatory burden that is imposed and, in response to an outcry from Members of Congress, such as ourselves, and from senior citizens and home health agencies, it then decided maybe it made a mistake. But, in the meantime, our home health agencies have gone through the time, trouble and expense of implementing these requirements.

   Ms. COLLINS. The Senator is exactly correct. Let me give you a specific example. In 1998, HCFA instituted a new policy for sequential billing. Under this policy, home health agencies are required to submit claims in a sequential order to Medicare. Now, this required a substantial investment in computer software, a lot of process changes on behalf of the home health agencies and the fiscal intermediaries. Moreover, the way the system was set up, if there were subsequent claims for a particular patient, they could not be paid until all previous claims relating to this patient were settled. This caused enormous cash flow problems for home health agencies. They experienced delays as long as 120 days before they could get the payment they were due. 
   One witness at my hearing testified that her agency was still owed about $20,000 for fiscal '98, and other agencies reported they had to obtain bridge loans, or tap into their credit lines, solely because of this ill-conceived policy. 
   Now, due to the objections raised by the Senator from Kansas, myself, other Members, and the home health care industry, HCFA finally decided to suspend the policy this past July. But, in the meantime, we have had over a year of turmoil because of this policy, and home health agencies had already spent time, energy, training, and effort to comply with a misguided policy that now is, as you put it, in ``HCFA purgatory.''

   Ms. COLLINS. Most agencies are reporting that it takes a nurse between 1  and a half and 2 hours per patient. Now, I point out, that is 2 hours that could be used on direct patient care, on tending to the problems that caused the home health visits to be necessary in the first place. Instead, as the Senator has so ably described, it is being spent on unnecessary paperwork.

   but also on the patient's living arrangements, sensory status, medications, and emotional state.

   Ms. COLLINS. I completely agree with my colleague. These are the questions, when asked of the senior citizens whom I talked to, they find very intrusive. The nurses who are treating them are offended that they have to pry into matters that have no connection to the reason for the home health visit. 
   Moreover, as I pointed out earlier to my friend and colleague, this is time that is being spent on unnecessary paperwork, on intrusive questions that alienate and destroy the relationship between the nurse and the patients that could better be used for actually caring for the patient. 
   Agencies are not reimbursed for this time. Moreover, in a State such as Maine, which is very rural, our home health providers have to spend a lot of time traveling from patient to patient. This is time that is lost from the system. 
   Another issue, which the Senator has also raised, which is inexplicable to me, is why is HCFA collecting this data for non-Medicare patients? I don't understand that. Am I correct? The Senator from Kansas is much more knowledgeable about the OASIS system than I am. Am I correct that it actually applies to non-Medicare patients as well?

Yet another sample of what the Senator has described as policies being implemented, then pulled back, agencies not knowing whether they are coming or going, and being subjected to the confusing and conflicting and extensive requirements that are detracting from the ability of these agencies to provide essential care to our seniors. 
   I want to give the Senator from Kansas yet another example of this regulatory overkill by HCFA. I don't know whether the Senator from Kansas is familiar with this, but it is the new 15 -minute incremental reporting requirement. HCFA is requiring nurses to act more like accountants or lawyers billing for every 15 minutes of their time. They are going to have to carry stopwatches to comply with this. Implementation is not only going to be very difficult for the staff to administer, but also, once again, it changes the very relationship between the patient and the nurse. It is very disruptive to a patient's care.

   Ms. COLLINS. The Senator has raised an excellent question. There is a very good answer. That is no. In fact, the regulatory overkill of the Clinton administration has already exceeded the savings projected by the balanced budget amendment. Medicare for home health fell nearly 15 percent last year, and CBO now projects the reductions in home health care will exceed $46 billion over the next 5 years. That is almost three times greater than the $16 billion estimate that the Congressional Budget Office originally estimated. 
   It is yet another indication that these cuts are far too deep, and that they are hurting far too many people completely unnecessarily. They have been far too severe and much more far reaching than Congress ever intended when it was trying to bring a measure of fiscal restraint to the Medicare Program.

   Ms. COLLINS. The Senator worked closely with me and others last year in providing a small measure of relief in the omnibus appropriations bill. I am pleased that together we were able to take some initial steps to remedy this issue. However, I think it is evident from the overwhelming evidence that the proposal did not go nearly far enough in relieving the financial distress of these home health agencies. The ones that are paying the price are the good agencies, the cost-effective agencies that are serving our seniors. That is the tragedy.

   Ms. COLLINS. I know the Senator from Kansas has been such a leader and cares so much about this issue and has joined with me in introducing legislation, along with our colleague from Missouri, Senator BOND, and 31 of our colleagues. Both sides of the aisle have joined in legislation that we have introduced called the Medicare Home Health Equity Act. 
   This solves the problem. For one thing, it eliminates another 15-percent cut that is scheduled to go into effect in October of next year. I am sure my friend, the Senator from Kansas, agrees with me if that goes into effect, it will sound the death knell for the remaining home health agencies. That means the ones that have been struggling to hang on will be forced to close their doors or refuse even more services to our senior citizens. This is totally unnecessary because we have already achieved the savings, the targets set by the Balanced Budget Act. 
   The legislation includes a number of other provisions that affect a lot of the regulatory issues we have discussed today. I think it is absolutely critical we pass this legislation or similar provisions before we go home. I have visited senior citizens in my State who, if they lose their home health services, are going to be forced into nursing homes or hospitals. The irony is that is going to be at far greater cost.

   Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the conference report on the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture appropriations bill. I do so with considerable reluctance because the distinguished senior Senator from Mississippi, the subcommittee chairman, has always been so responsive to the needs of rural Maine. And the Senator, in his capacity as chairman, has provided valuable assistance to the State of Maine, particularly in the area of agricultural research, which is very important to my State.  
   Unfortunately, circumstances largely beyond the control of my good friend from Mississippi have brought this measure before us without a component that is absolutely critical to the survival of Maine's dairy farmers. The lack of provisions reauthorizing the Northeast Dairy Compact creates a serious regional inequity and places an unfair burden on Maine's dairy farmers. 
   While this measure contains $5.4 billion in payments for farmers harmed by low commodity prices, it ignores a mechanism that provides stability in pricing for dairy farmers in the Northeast. The Northeast Dairy Compact is a proven success, and it is absolutely critical to the survival of dairy farmers in Maine and throughout the Northeast. 
   First approved by Congress as part of the 1996 farm bill, the Northeast Dairy Compact has a proven track record of benefits for both consumers and farmers. The compact works by simply evening out the peaks and valleys in the fluid milk prices, providing stability to the cost of milk, and ensuring a supply of fresh, wholesome local milk. 
   The compact works with market forces to help both the farmer and the consumer. As prices climb and farmers begin to receive a sustainable price for their milk, the compact turns off. When prices drop to unsustainable levels, the compact is triggered on. The compact simply softens the blow to farmers of an abrupt and dramatic drop in the volatile fluid milk market. 
   It is important to reiterate that consumers also benefit from the compact. Not only does the compact stabilize prices, thus avoiding dramatic fluctuations in the retail cost of milk, but also it guarantees that the consumer is assured of the availability of a supply of fresh local milk. Let us remember that the proof is in the prices. 
   Under the compact, New England consumers have enjoyed lower retail fluid milk prices than many other regions operating without a dairy compact. Moreover, the compact, while providing clear benefits to dairy producers and consumers in the Northeast, has proven that it does not harm farmers or taxpayers in other regions of the country. Indeed, a 1998 report by the Office of Management and Budget showed that during its first 6 months of operation, the compact did not adversely affect farmers outside the compact region and added no Federal cost to nutrition programs. In fact, the compact specifically exempts WIC, the Women, Infants, and Children's Program, 
   from any costs resulting or related to the compact. 
   The reauthorization of the Northeast Dairy Compact is also important as a matter of States rights. We often hear criticism of the inside-the-beltway mentality that tells States that we here in Washington know better than they do, even on issues that traditionally fall under State and local control. 
   That is simply wrong. In the Northeast Dairy Compact, we have a solution that was devised by our dairy farmers, that was approved by the legislators and Governors of the New England States, that is supported by every State agricultural commissioner in the region and overwhelmingly, if not unanimously, by the dairy farmers of the region. We in Congress should not be an obstacle to this practical local solution. 
   It is not too late. There are a variety of ways that Congress can allow dairy farmers in the Northeast to help themselves. All we need to do is to reauthorize the compact and take advantage of those opportunities. I am very disappointed, however, that Congress is missing the logical opportunity to renew this important measure through the Agriculture appropriations bill. Therefore, I must oppose this conference report. But I look forward to working with my colleagues to resolve this matter before we adjourn. 
   Again, I thank the Senator from Mississippi. He has been extremely responsive to the needs of agricultural producers in my State. I know that he shares my commitment to resolving this matter and coming to a solution that will help our dairy farmers survive before we adjourn this session of the Senate. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back to the chairman any remaining time I might have.

    Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join my colleague, Senator JACK REED, in submitting a resolution designating October 24th-30th as National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week. This designation will help increase awareness of the significant dangers and prevalence of child lead poisoning across our nation.  
   Recently, Senator REED and I held a hearing in Rhode Island to address the impact exposure to lead paint can have on children's health and development, and to explore ways to improve our efforts to prevent and eventually eliminate lead poisoning in children. 
   Great strides have been made in the last 20 years to reduce the threat lead poses to human health. Most notably, lead has been banned from many products including residential paint, food cans and gasoline. These commendable steps have significantly reduced the incidence of lead poisoning. But the threat remains, and continues to imperil, the health and welfare of our nation's children. 
   In fact, lead poisoning is the most significant and prevalent environmental health threat to children in the U.S. today. Even low levels of lead exposure can have serious developmental consequences including reductions in IQ and attention span, reading and learning disabilities, hyperactivity and behavioral problems. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently estimates that 890,000 children aged 1-5 have blood levels of lead that are high enough to affect their ability to learn. 
   Today, the major lead poisoning threat to children in found in interior paint that has deteriorated. Unfortunately, it is all too common for older homes to contain lead-based paint. In fact, more than half the entire housing stock--and three quarters of the stock built prior to 1978--contain some lead-based paint. Paint manufactured prior to the residential lead paint ban often remains safely contained and unexposed for decades, but over time, often through the remodeling process or through normal wear and tear, the paint can become exposed, contaminating the home with dangerous lead dust. 
   Because of the prevalence of older homes in the Northeast, lead poisoning exposure is a significant problem in our region. In Maine, 42 percent of our homes were built prior to 1950. Although screening rates nationally and in my state are considered to be too low, the sampling that has been done in my state shows that in some areas of the state 7-15 percent of children tested have high blood lead levels. In some areas of our country, the percentage is even higher. 
   Next month, I will hold a hearing in Maine to address the lead-based paint threat in our homes, and what parents can do to protect their children from the risks associated with lead exposure. 
   Once childhood development is impaired by exposure to lead, the effect is largely irreversible. However, if the presence of lead is detected prior to exposure, then remedial steps can be taken, such as lead containment or abatement, to prevent children from ever being harmed by lead's presence in the home. 
   We are not helpless to stop this insidious threat. By raising awareness of the prevalence of lead paint in homes, and the steps that can be taken to prevent poisoning, we can stop the life-impairing effects of childhood lead poisoning. I urge my colleagues to support me in raising awareness about childhood lead poisoning by co-sponsoring Childhood Lead Paint Poisoning Prevention Week.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to begin my remarks by commending my friend and colleague from Texas for her leadership on this issue and for bringing it to the Senate's attention. 
   I wish to share with my colleagues a wonderful example of the accomplishments that can be realized by a same-gender class. A gifted math teacher, Donna Lisnik, at Presque High School, pioneered an all-girls math class some years ago. She believed it would result in greater achievement by the young girls who were studying math at Presque High School. She began to offer the same-sex class in math and she proved to be absolutely right. The class was offered for over 5 years and the results were outstanding. Both the achievement of these girls and the number of them participating in advanced math and science classes increased. 
   I had the privilege of visiting Mrs. Lisnik's classroom. I cannot overstate the excitement of the girls in her class studying advanced math. They were learning so much and they were so excited by this opportunity to learn together. 
   Incredibly, the Federal Department of Education concluded that this math class violated title IX of the Education Act. Consequently, Presque High  School was required to open the class to both boys and girls. It is interesting to note, however, that it is girls who continue to enroll in this class even though it is open to both boys and girls. 
   It is unfortunate that schools are prevented by the Federal regulations from developing single-gender classes in which both young women--and in other classes, young men--can flourish and reach their full potential. Senator HUTCHISON's proposal assures that other schools with innovative education programs 
   designed to meet gender-specific needs will not face such obstacles. 
   This proposal does not weaken or undercut in any way the protections for women and girls in title IX. It does not allow a school to offer an education benefit for only one sex, to the exclusion of the other. Schools must have comparable programs for both boys and girls. However, it does give schools the flexibility to design and offer single-gender classes when the school determines that such classes will provide their students with a better opportunity to achieve high standards, the kind of high standards and achievement that I witnessed firsthand in Mrs. Lisnik's exciting math class in northern Maine. 
   Although Senator HUTCHISON has decided to withdraw her amendment, I am going to work with her to ensure that it is incorporated in the rewrite of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act that will be undertaken by the health committee later this year. This is a proposal that is designed to help young girls and young boys excel by using the device of single-sex classrooms. It deserves support. 
   I am very pleased to join with the Senator from Texas in supporting this effort. 
   I yield back any remaining time.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the FAA reauthorization bill to establish an independent commission to thoroughly examine the impact of airline deregulation on smalltown America. I am very pleased to be joined in this effort by several cosponsors, including Senators ROCKEFELLER, BURNS, BAUCUS, ROBB, HOLLINGS, and HARKIN. 
   This amendment is modeled after a bill I recently introduced that would authorize a study into how airline deregulation has affected the economic development of smaller towns in America, the quality and availability of air transportation, particularly in rural areas of this country, and the long-term viability of local airports in smaller communities and rural areas. 
   For far too long, small communities throughout this Nation, from Bangor, ME, to Billings, MT, to Bristol, TN, have weathered the effects of airline deregulation without adequately assessing how deregulation has affected their economic development, their ability to create and attract new jobs, the quality and availability of air transportation for their residents, and the long-term viability of their local airports. It is time to evaluate the effects of airline deregulation from this new perspective by looking at how it has affected the economies in small towns and rural America. 
   Bangor, ME, where I live, is an excellent example of how airline deregulation can cause real problems for a smaller community. Bangor recently learned it was going to lose the services of Continental Express. This follows a pullout by Delta Airlines last year. It has been very difficult for Bangor to provide the kind of quality air  service that is so important in trying to attract new businesses to locate in the area as well as to encourage businesses to expand. 
   Nowadays, businesses expect to have convenient, accessible, and affordable air service. It is very important to their ability to do business. Although there have been several studies on the impact of airline deregulation, they have all focused on some aspects of air service itself. For example, there have been GAO studies that have looked at the impact on airline prices. 
   Not one study I am aware of has actually analyzed the impact of airline deregulation on economic development and job creation in rural States. Indeed, we have spoken to the GAO and the Department of Transportation, and they are not aware of a single study that has taken the kind of comprehensive approach I am proposing. Moreover, one GAO official told my staff he thought such a study was long overdue. We need to know more about how airline deregulation has affected smaller and medium-sized communities such as Presque Isle, ME, and Bangor, ME. We need to focus on the relationship between access to affordable, quality airline service and the economic development of America's smaller towns and cities. 
   During the past 20 years, air travel has become increasingly linked to business development. Successful businesses expect and need their personnel to travel quickly over long distances. It is expected that a region being considered for business location or expansion should be reachable conveniently, quickly, and easily via jet service. Those areas without air access or with access that is restricted by prohibitive travel costs, infrequent flights, or small, slow planes appear to be at a distinct disadvantage compared to those communities that enjoy accessible, convenient, and economic air service. 
   This country's air infrastructure has grown to the point where it now rivals our ground transportation infrastructure in its importance to the economic vibrancy and vitality of our communities. It has long been accepted that building a highway creates an almost instant corridor of economic activity for businesses eager to cut shipping and transportation costs by locating close to the stream of commerce. 
   Like a community located on an interstate versus one that is reachable only by back roads, a community with a midsize or small airport underserved by air carriers appears to be operating at a disadvantage to one located near a large airport. What this proposal would do is allow us to take a close look at the relationship between quality air service and the communities it serves. 
   Bob Ziegelaar, director of the Bangor International Airport, perhaps put it best. He tells me: Communities such as Bangor are at risk of being left behind with service levels below what the market warrants, both in terms of capacity and quality. The follow-on consequences are a decreasing capacity to attract economic growth. 
   He sums it up well. A region's ability to attract and keep good jobs is inextricably linked to its transportation system. Twenty-one years after Congress deregulated the airline industry, it is important that we now look and assess the long-term impacts of our actions. The commission established by my amendment will ensure that Congress, small communities, and the airlines are able to make future decisions on airline issues fully aware of the concerns and the needs of smalltown America. 
   Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee and the ranking minority members of both the subcommittee and the full committee for their assistance in shaping this amendment. I look forward to working with them. I know they share my concerns about providing quality, accessible air service to all parts of America. I thank them for their cooperation in this effort and yield the floor.

   Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to join my co-chair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, Senator BREAUX, as well as the chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, Senator GRASSLEY, and the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Mr. ABRAHAM, in introducing a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to help address the devastating impact of diabetes and its resulting complications on Americans of all ages. 
   This resolution calls for increased support for diabetes research, education, early detection, and treatment. Diabetes research has been underfunded in recent years. It is imperative that we increase our commitment in order to take full advantage of the unprecedented and exciting scientific opportunities that we have as the millennium approaches for advances leading to better detection, treatment, prevention, and ultimately a cure for this devastating disease. 
   Diabetes is a very serious condition that affects people of every age, race, and nationality. Here in America, 16 million people suffer from diabetes, and about 800,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. 
   Moreover, diabetes frequently goes undiagnosed. Of the 16 million Americans with diabetes, it is estimated that 5.4 million do not realize they have this very serious condition. 
   Diabetes is one of our Nation's most costly diseases, both in human and economic terms. It is the sixth deadliest disease in the United States and kills almost 200,000 Americans annually. It is the leading cause of kidney failure, of blindness in adults, and amputations. It is a significant risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and birth defects. The disease shortens the average life expectancy by up to 15 years 
   Moreover, it is very costly in financial terms as well. Diabetes costs the Nation in excess of $105 billion annually in health-related expenditures. At present, more than 1 out of every 10 dollars that we spend on health care is related to treating people with diabetes. About 1 out of 4 Medicare dollars are used to treat people with diabetes. Indeed, more than 40 billion in tax dollars is spent each year treating people with diabetes through Medicare, Medicaid, veterans' health, and Federal employees' programs. 
   Unfortunately, there currently is no way to prevent or to cure diabetes. Available treatments have had only limited success in controlling the devastating consequences of this disease. This problem is made all the more complex by the fact that diabetes is not a single disease, but rather it occurs in several forms and the complications affect virtually every system of the body. 
   Children with type I diabetes face a lifetime of multiple daily finger pricks to check their blood sugar levels, daily insulin injections, and the possibility of lifelong complications, including kidney failure and blindness, which can be deadly, can be disabling. 
   Older Americans with diabetes also can be disabled by the multiple complications of the disease. 
   Every year, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation hosts a children's congress in Washington, DC. They bring children from all over this Nation to put a human face on the consequences of type I diabetes. 
   Recently, I had the opportunity to meet a courageous 8-year-old boy from North Yarmouth, ME. Nathan Reynolds is an active young boy. He loves school, biking, swimming, and baseball, and he particularly likes collecting old coins. He is also suffering from type I diabetes. He was diagnosed about 2 years ago, and it has completely changed his life and the life of his family. 
   He has had to learn how to check his blood. In fact, his 4-year-old brother reminds him to do it before each meal.  He has to give himself an insulin shot or get his teacher or the school nurse or his parents to help him do so. Nathan can never take a day off from his disease. It does not matter whether it is Christmas or his birthday, he still has to prick his finger and check his blood sugar. He still has to inject himself with insulin in order to keep relatively healthy. 
   I will never forget the story a teacher told me of all the children in her class making a wish for Christmas. Some of them wished for a new toy, one wished for a pony, another wished to go to Disney World. But one little boy who had juvenile diabetes made the wish that he could just have Christmas without having to give himself ``yucky'' shots. 
   That story touched me deeply, and it hit home with the fact that this is a lifelong condition for children who are diagnosed with type I diabetes. 
   I will also never forget the anguish on a young mother's face who told me her 5-year-old son had just been diagnosed with diabetes. ``How do I tell him?'' she said. ``How do I tell him he is going to have to have shots every day, that he is going to have to constantly prick his finger to check his blood sugar levels? How do I tell him what this means for him and for all of us who love him?'' 
   There is also some good news. Exciting research is underway that should lead to medical breakthroughs for Nathan, for other children, and for adults who have type I and type II diabetes. Reducing the tremendous health and human burdens of diabetes and its enormous economic toll depends upon identifying the factors responsible for the disease and developing new methods for treatment, prevention, and ultimately a cure. 
   The next decade holds tremendous potential and promise for diabetes research. Improvements in technology and the general growth in scientific knowledge have created unprecedented opportunities for advancements that might lead to better 
   treatments, prevention, and a cure. 
   Earlier this year, the congressionally mandated diabetes research working group, an independent panel composed of 12 scientific experts of diabetes and 4 representatives of the lay diabetes communities, issued an important report. It is called ``Conquering Diabetes: A Strategic Plan for the 21st Century.'' This important report details the magnitude of the problem, and it lays out a comprehensive plan for research conducted by the National Institutes of Health on diabetes. 
   In this report, the diabetes working group found, ``Many scientific opportunities are not being pursued due to insufficient funding, lack of appropriate mechanisms and a shortage of trained researchers.'' 
   The report also concluded that the current level of funding, the level of effort, and the scope of diabetes research falls far short of what is needed to capitalize on these promising opportunities. The funding level, the report found, is so far short of what is required to make progress on this complex and difficult problem. 
   The report goes on to recommend a funding level of $827 million for diabetes research at NIH in fiscal year 2000, and, indeed, many of our colleagues signed a letter to the Appropriations Committee requesting an appropriation of just that level to be included to advance the goals of this legislation. 
   I am a strong supporter of increased research and of efforts to double our investment in biomedical research over the next few years. There is simply no investment that would yield greater returns for the American taxpayers, and the commitment of the bill before us of an additional $2 billion in funding for NIH, which represents nearly a 13-percent increase, will bring us so much closer to that goal. This strategy is particularly important as we move into the next century when our public health and disability programs will be under increasing strains due to the aging of our population. 
   I am also very pleased and commend the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator SPECTER, and the ranking minority member, Senator HARKIN, for including very strong language in the report accompanying this bill which recognizes that diabetes research has been underfunded in the past and directs that funding for diabetes be increased at the National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease and other NIH institutes. Again, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator STEVENS, and the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN, have all been tremendous advocates for people with diabetes and are to be commended for their strong leadership in this effort. 
   The amendment I am offering today does not earmark a particular funding level for diabetes research. Rather, it is intended to heighten awareness of the devastating impact of this disease, and it is intended to affirm that diabetes research is a high priority. Most of all, the amendment expresses the clear intent of the Senate that the National Institutes of Health should substantially increase its investment in the fight against diabetes along the lines recommended in this landmark report, the $827 million recommendation. 
   We must ensure that sufficient resources are available to take full advantage of the extraordinary and unprecedented scientific opportunities identified by the diabetes working group. If we do so, we can better understand and ultimately conquer this devastating disease. 
   I thank the Chair for his attention. I hope all of my colleagues will join us in supporting this resolution to send a clear signal that we are committed to conquering diabetes. 
   I reserve any remaining time I may have left.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, we are on the edge of an exciting breakthrough in the treatment and ultimately the prevention and cure of diabetes. That is why I am so excited by the possibility of a significant increase in research in this area. 
   As the chairman of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I have had the opportunity to visit some of the leading-edge research labs that are doing work on diabetes. I have visited Jackson Labs in Bar Harbor, MA, where very exciting research is ongoing into the causes of both type I and type II diabetes. I am very proud of the contributions made by these distinguished scientists in my home State. 
   In addition, I have had the pleasure of visiting the JDF Foundation Center at Harvard Medical School, where there is also tremendous research underway. I am convinced, with the kind of increased commitment called for by my resolution, and indicated in the Appropriations Committee's report, that we can in fact break through and reach a cure for this devastating disease. 
   Mr. President, I do not know whether there is any other request for time. It is my understanding the vote is scheduled for 9:30. We have reached that hour. 
   Mr. President, seeing no one seeking further time to speak, I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending amendment.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 1653, which would reauthorize the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. As an original cosponsor of this important legislation, I would like to applaud the excellent work of Senator CHAFEE and the Foundation to conserve the fish, wildlife, and plant resources of the United States. 
   The Foundation was created by Congress in 1984 to promote improved conservation and sustainable use of our country's natural resources. Since then, it has awarded over 2,400 grants, using $101 million in federal funds, which it matched with $189 million in nonfederal funds, putting a total of over $290 million on the ground to promote environmental education, protect habitats, prevent species from becoming endangered, restore wetlands, improve riparian areas, and conserve native plants. The hallmark of this outstanding organization is forgoing partnerships between the public and private sectors--involving the government, private citizens, and corporations--to address the root causes of environmental problems. This reauthorization will allow the Foundation to continue its valuable work throughout the country. 
   Besides being an important link between groups with differing interests in natural resources, the Foundation is an extremely effective tool for stretching scarce federal dollars. The Foundation was created by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act, which stipulates that the Foundation must match any federal money appropriated to it on a one-to-one basis. The Foundation does the Act one better. It has an internal policy of matching federal funds at least two-to-one with money from individuals, corporations, state and local governments,  foundations, and nongovernmental organizations. Furthermore, all of the federal money appropriated to the Foundation supports on-the-ground conservation--its operating funds come strictly from private donations. The Foundation does not use federal funds for lobbying; nor does it support projects that entail political advocacy or litigation. 
   In my home state of Maine, the Foundation has invested over $3.4 million in federal funds in 109 projects, generating an additional $6.9 million in matching funds from private, corporate, and other state sources. Most notably, the Foundation has funded projects in Maine to help fishermen cope with the collapse of traditional groundfish fisheries, build a program to preserve Maine's native Atlantic salmon, and protect habitat for breeding Neotropical migratory birds. 
   Mr. President, I strongly support this bill to reauthorize the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. Year after year, the Foundation consistently performs valuable conservation work, not only in my state, but throughout the country. Its ability to triple the power of federal funding for conservation is unique, making it one of the most effective means we have for preserving our natural resources. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting expeditious passage of this important measure.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, those of us who strongly supported an increased Federal investment in education should be celebrating this legislation, not criticizing it. Let's look at the numbers. 
   The committee's appropriation for total education spending is $1.9 billion more than for fiscal year 1999. It is a half billion dollars more than the President's request. Let me repeat that because I think that has been lost in this debate. The fact is, the Appropriations Committee has increased total education funding in this bill by a half billion dollars more than President Clinton requested. 
   Similarly, the committee has increased spending for Pell grants--an essential program that I strongly support--for title I, for special education--I could go on and on. 
   So it is clear that this debate is not about money. What is it about? It is about power. It is about command and control. It is about who will be making the decisions and where they will be made. 
   Let's look at the language of the amendment offered by the Senator from Washington, Mr. GORTON. It says: School districts may use the funds for class size reductions or for any other authorized activity in the ESEA that will improve the academic achievement of our students. 
   Who could be opposed to that? Isn't that the bottom line? Isn't that what we want--improved academic achievement, better results for our students? 
   So the question before the Senate is whether we should continue with the Washington-knows-best, arrogant attitude or whether we should recognize that our local school boards, our principals, our teachers, and our parents are best able to 
   determine what local students need to improve their performance. 
   The question--the bottom line--should be: What have our students learned? Have they improved? It should not be: How did you spend your Federal grant? Did you fill out the paperwork correctly? 
   In some school districts, smaller class size may be what is needed. But in others, we may need to upgrade the science lab or institute a program for gifted and talented students or hire more teachers. The needs vary as much as our schools vary. A one-size-fits-all approach simply does not work. 
   The Senator from Connecticut mentioned an article in today's newspaper which has the startling results that nationally three-fourths of the students cannot compose an organized essay. I am pleased to note that my State of Maine ranks near the top--No. 2 only to Connecticut--in performance on this test. But nationwide, three-quarters of the students failed this simple test. 
   Is the answer the same in every State? I do not think so. In some States, improved professional development for the teachers may be the key to reversing these test results. In other States, it may be smaller classes. Yet in another State it may be another technique or method or solution that is required. 
   The point is that we do not know here in Washington what the best approach is in the thousands of school districts across this country. All we are saying is, let the local school districts decide what they need to do to improve student achievement. 
   There is nothing in Senator GORTON's amendment that prohibits the school district from using the money to reduce class size if that is what is needed. But that may not be what is needed. Indeed, 41 States already exceed the ideal teacher-student ratio. 
   What we need to do is to trust local people to make the decisions that are going to help bring out the best in the students in our communities across the United States. That is exactly what Senator GORTON's amendment would do. 
   This is not a debate about money. All of us agree that we want to increase the Federal investment in education. It is the best investment of our money we can make. The issue is about who is making the decision. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

   Ms. COLLINS. So what the Senator is saying is it has been the Republican Congress that has attempted to live up to the promise made in funding special education; it has been the Republican Congress, and, today, the Appropriations Committee is going to meet to add educational dollars to the President's budget. In fact, we will be increasing spending for essential programs such as special ed, Pell grants, the TRIO programs, above what the President has requested; am I correct in that understanding?

So this is not a debate about money because it has been the Republicans who have continually increased educational funding. What this is a debate about is who is going to make the decisions. This is a debate about philosophy. Does the Senator agree with that?

   Ms. COLLINS. I want to join my colleague, Senator SNOWE, and reiterate my support for this important proposal. If funding is made available, the Sensor Research/University of Maryland team will examine mercury emissions from several combustion sources and will compare a new family of mercury vapor sensors to state-of-the-art continuous monitoring devices in order to determine the efficacy and fidelity of the newer technology. I understand that these new ``Surface Acoustic Wave'' senors offer the promise of low cost/extremely-high reliability monitoring that can better determine the origin of and transport mechanisms involving this family of pollutants. 
   I thank the Chairman for his consideration of this proposal and ask that he and Senator MIKULSKI make this a top priority in Conference.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me begin by praising the terrific work done by the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Maryland in putting together this appropriations bill. I know a lot of the issues are very difficult. They have worked together in a bipartisan way to come up with a bill that is responsible fiscally and yet meets some urgent needs of many people in our Nation. I commend them both for their efforts in this regard. 
   I appreciate the Senator from Missouri giving me this opportunity to engage him in a discussion on an issue of great importance to Maine and the Nation as a whole. That is the issue of providing fair Federal assistance to our homeless men, women, and children, regardless of where they live. Senator BOND and Senator MIKULSKI have been leaders in addressing housing issues affecting underserved and vulnerable populations, especially our Nation's homeless population. 
   Under their leadership, the Department of Housing and Urban Development homeless assistance grants have increased from $823 million in fiscal year 1998 to $975 million in fiscal year 1999. I am very pleased to note that the appropriations bill that is before us now would further increase funding for vital homeless assistance grants by providing a little more than $1 billion for these critical programs. 
   Senator BOND's continued dedication to this vital and often forgotten issue has served the public well, as has the commitment of the Senator from the State of Maryland. I salute them for their effort to direct the funding of the resources to those most in need.

   Ms. COLLINS. Although Congress has done a good job in recognizing the need for more funding in this area to serve this very vulnerable population, I have become extremely concerned about the process that the Department of Housing and Urban Development has used to award a particular kind of homeless grant, and that is the continuum of care grant. This has been a real problem in my State, and I suspect the Senator from Missouri has heard from other States as well.

   Ms. COLLINS. I note that has been exactly the very unfortunate experience in my State. Let me give you a little 
   background. 
   The needs of the homeless population in Maine have increased in recent years. Often when we think of the homeless, we think of large cities. In fact, there are homeless people throughout this Nation, including in rural States such as Maine. 
   From 1993 to 1996, Maine's homeless population grew by almost 20 percent. It is estimated that more than 14,000 people are homeless in my home State today. Despite this great and growing need, however, the Department of Housing and Urban Development denied both the applications from the State of Maine for continuum of care funding last year. In effect, the HUD competitive homeless assistance funding distributed to the State of Maine went from $3.7 million to zero. You can imagine the impact on my State. 
   Moreover, we were stunned by HUD's decision because Secretary Cuomo, in 1998, had awarded Maine's programs with the HUD ``best practices'' awards of excellence. 
   A vigorous public campaign by people in Maine and repeated efforts by the congressional delegation ultimately compelled HUD to provide $1 million to the city of Portland to renew certain projects. This money, though welcomed, was far from sufficient to allow the State to meet the needs of its homeless population. 
   That is the experience I wanted to share with the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Maryland.

   Ms. COLLINS. It seems to me that HUD needs to understand the impact on the homeless, on the very people we are trying to serve, of simply shutting States out from the housing award process. HUD needs to take greater care to work with States where funding may be in peril in order to ensure that we are not hurting the homeless people of our Nation. 
   Contrary to what HUD seems to think, homeless men and women do not disappear. Their needs do not disappear when funding is cut off. In fact, their desperate needs still exist. 
   To address these problems, I have introduced a Senate bill which would require a minimum distribution of continuum of care homeless assistance funding to each State. I realize that I cannot offer that on this bill because of the rule XVI issue, but I hope the chairman and the ranking minority member will agree with me that this is an important issue. 
   Would the chairman agree that the goal of HUD should be to make every effort to ensure that every State can receive some homeless grant funding because every State has homeless people, unfortunately?

I hope we have sent a very clear signal to HUD that it needs a funding process that ensures the needs of our homeless men and women and children, no matter where they live, are being met. It is particularly important in a State such as Maine, where our winters can be quite severe, that we provide that kind of shelter and assistance in helping people not only get a bed for the night but to put their lives back together. 
   I thank my colleagues very much for their assistance in this matter, and I yield the floor.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to engage the distinguished subcommittee chairman, Senator SHELBY, and the distinguished ranking member, Senator LAUTENBERG, in a brief colloquy in order to make clear the intent behind some language contained in the Senate Appropriations Committee's report accompanying S. 1143, the FY 2000 Transportation appropriations bill. 
   I want to first thank the distinguished managers of this bill for their assistance last year in securing approximately $1.2 million in FY 99 funding for advanced engineered wood composites for bridge construction to be conducted by the University of Maine's Advanced Wood Composite Center. As both Senator SHELBY and Senator LAUTENBERG may recall, the University of Maine is the institution that pioneered this technology and is currently working with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in this area of research and development. 
   On page 95 of this year's Senate Appropriations Committee Report accompanying S. 1143, it states in part ``The Committee is interested in research to develop advanced engineering and wood composites for bridge construction and has provided $1.2 million for that purpose within this program.'' 
   I want to inquire of the distinguished managers of this bill if it is their intent that the University of Maine's Advanced Wood Composites Center is to receive the funding referenced by this part of the Committee's report, in order that the University can continue to support FHWA's research in this vital area.

   Ms. COLLINS. I rise today to condemn the President's use of the Constitutional power to grant clemency to FALN terrorists. The members of the Armed Forces of National Liberation, known by their Spanish acronym FALN, were responsible for 130 bombings in the late 1970's and early 1980's. As a result of these FALN actions, six people died, scores of citizens were maimed and injured, and the public at large was petrified by an indiscriminate threat. 
   The FALN's stated purpose in conducting this reign of terror was to further the cause of Puerto Rican independence. But it virtually goes without saying that there is no justification for this vicious lawlessness that terrorized, killed and maimed human beings. After a Herculean effort on the part of law enforcement and prosecutors, the FALN members were brought to justice and convicted of a variety of serious charges including seditious conspiracy. 
   Those who suffered at the hands of the FALN, those whose only crime was to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, had names and lives before they had the misfortune to encounter an FALN-placed bomb. But their lives were ended or irrevocably altered by senseless actions. The law enforcement officers and prosecutors who brought the FALN to justice placed themselves at personal risk in their effort to protect the public from the terror of the FALN bombings. 
   On August 11th, the President unexpectedly offered clemency to 16 FALN members. Their release was conditioned on each prisoner renouncing violence, obeying a ban on the use of weapons, and refusing fraternization with independence leaders. Unbelievably, it was indicated that these vague promises would release these individuals from their sentences--a privilege that he has granted only three times previously. And even more unbelievably, these promises were not forthcoming. 
   The President made this clemency offer despite the fact that he was advised against it by the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons, and two United States Attorneys. 
   The President made this offer despite the fact that the jailed FALN members had illustrated no remorse for their actions. This became painfully clear on this past weekend's ``Meet the Press'' where Ricardo Jimenez, one of the freed conspirators, appeared. Mr. Jimenez identified himself as a freedom fighter and justified his criminal actions as a remedy for Puerto Rican ``colonization.'' 
   Mr. Jimenez is not unique among the FALN conspirators in his utter lack of remorse for the terrorist bombings. Unbelievably, in fact, Bureau of Prison audiotapes have captured several of the former FALN members recently released from prison saying they would return to violence upon release. 
   By releasing prisoners convicted of serious crimes, for which they showed no remorse, based on only the promise that they will not commit such crimes again, the President has undermined the standard for eligibility for the extraordinary remedy of clemency. 
   There is no recourse from the President's action, which was based on his unquestioned Constitutional authority. The Senate can only express our sentiment that his actions were appalling and dangerous. Therefore, in the strongest possible terms, I support the resolution offered today condemning the President's action.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of two amendments I have filed in connection with the Interior appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000. 
   My amendments, which are cosponsored by Senator SNOWE, are expected to be accepted as part of the managers' package, which the chairman of the subcommittee will be sending to the desk shortly. 
   I want to take this opportunity to thank the subcommittee chairman, Senator GORTON, and the ranking minority member, Senator BYRD, for their assistance and support of my proposals. 
   The amendments I am proposing will provide funding and National Park Service support for projects of great historical and international significant to my State and our country. Yet probably only a few of our colleagues have ever heard of St. Croix Island, nestled in the St. Croix River that separates Maine from Canada, or this island's place in the history of the United States and Canada and in the hearts of North Americans of French descent. 
   We have all probably heard of the Pilgrims' landing at Plymouth Rock in 1620, or the English colonial settlement at Jamestown in 1607, but few know the story of an even older settlement, dating back to 1604, when French nobleman Pierre Dugua Sieur de Mons, accompanied by a courageous group of adventurers that included Samuel Champlain, landed on St. Croix Island and quickly set about to construct a settlement. They cleared the island, planted crops, dug a well, and built houses, fortifications, public buildings, and gun emplacements. In the process, they were aided by Native peoples who made temporary camps on the island and assisted in various ways. At the same time, Samuel Champlain undertook a number of reconnaissance missions from the island. On one, he found and named Mount Desert Island, now the home to Acadia National Park. 
   By October, the settlement was ready. But the Maine winter was more than the seventy-nine settlers had bargained for. By winter's end, nearly half had died and many others were seriously ill. 
   The spring brought relief from the harsh weather. Sieur de Mons relocated his colony to Port Royal in what is now Nova Scotia and, in 1608, Champlain and a company of men founded Quebec. 
   According to the National Park Service, the French settlement on St. Croix Island in 1604 and 1605 was the first and ``most ambitious attempt of its time to establish an enduring French presence in the `New World.' '' Many view the expedition that settled on St. Croix Island in 1604 as the beginning of the Acadian culture in North America. This rich and diverse culture spread across the continent, from Canada to Louisiana, where French-speaking Acadians came to be known as ``Cajuns.'' 
   The rich history and cultural significance of the 1604 settlement at St. Croix Island are beyond question. Yet, with only four years remaining before the 400th anniversary of the settlement, there is still much to prepare for a proper and appropriate commemoration of this historical event. 
   Let me try to put the occasion in perspective. For the 300th anniversary of the settlement, U.S., British, and French naval ships, flagged out for the occasion, steamed up the St. Croix River and anchored off the historic island. Speakers at the ceremony honoring the anniversary included the consul general of France and the famous U.S. general and Maine patriot, Joshua Chamberlain. 
   Several thousand people attended the celebration. 
   In 1996, the U.S. National Park Service and Parks Canada agreed to ``conduct joint strategic planning for the international commemoration [of the St. Croix Island], with a special focus on the 400th anniversary of settlement in 2004.'' For its part, Parks Canada constructed an exhibit in New Brunswick overlooking St. Croix Island. The exhibit uses Champlain's first-hand accounts, period images, updated research, and custom artwork to tell the compelling story of the settlement. 
   The National Park Service, on the other hand, has plans to expand a small, existing site located just south of Calais, Maine. The Park Service plan envisions a modest, but appropriate outdoor exhibit overlooking St. Croix Island and exhibits in an indoor visitor center, preferably located in nearby Calais. These plans are intended to commemorate in an appropriate way one of only two international historic sites in the U.S. national park system and, as far as they go, the plans are a welcome first step. The next steps have yet to be taken and time is growing short. That is why I offered two amendments to this appropriations bill. 
   The first amendment makes $90,000 available in FY 2000 to finish pre-construction planning for and begin development of the outdoor site at Red Beach and to plan for the possible location of interpretive exhibits in Calais, Maine. Currently, no money is scheduled to be appropriated for the Red Beach site until FY 2002, and National Park Service officials in Maine and in the Northeast Regional Office agree with me that the funding schedule provides for too little too late. This money is needed now in order to ensure that the project is completed in time for the 400th anniversary celebration. 
   My second amendment asks the National Park Service to work with the people of Calais to make an indoor visitors center--known as the ``Downeast Heritage Center--a reality. The people of Calais and surrounding areas have worked tirelessly to move the project towards completion. They need the assistance of the National Park Service--which already has endorsed the concept--but which now must help with planning and financial assistance to bring the project from a dream to reality. My amendment asks and directs the Park Service to work with the people of Calais on this project and to ensure that appropriate exhibits are completed in time for the 400th anniversary celebration. 
   I further request that the Park Service include in its fiscal year 2001 budget submission funds for both the Red Beach site and the Downeast Heritage Center in downtown Calais. 
   My amendments seeks only a small commitment of funds that are designed to commemorate a 1604 settlement of enormous historical significance. 
   I again want to thank Senator GORTON and Senator BYRD for their assistance in helping our country prepare for a terrific 400th anniversary celebration of the early French settlement at St. Croix Island.  
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Senate Republicans are committed to enacting legislation to preserve, strengthen, and save the Medicare system for current and future generations. The Republican congressional budget plan has set aside $505 billion over the next 10 years specifically to address domestic issues such as Medicare. Moreover, $90 billion of this amount has been set aside in a reserve fund that is dedicated exclusively to strengthening Medicare's financing and modernizing its benefits, including the provision of coverage for prescription drugs. Prescription drugs are as important to our senior citizens' health today as the hospital bed was back in 1965 when the Medicare program was first created. Medicare clearly should be restructured to reflect these changing priorities. 
   The money to address this challenge has been set prudently aside as part of the Republican budget. We have the resources, we have the determination, and we have the will to address this critical issue. Now it is up to Congress to come up with the plan, which I hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will help us devise. We need to strengthen and modernize this critically important program to meet the health care needs of elderly and disabled Americans into the 21st century. 
   In addition to addressing the long-term structural issues facing Medicare, it is essential that Congress also take action this year to address some of the unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, as well as regulatory overkill by the Clinton administration, which is jeopardizing access to critically important home health care services for millions of senior citizens. 
   The growth in Medicare spending has slowed dramatically, and that is due, in part, to the reforms that were enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. While it was Congress' intent in enacting this legislation to slow the rate of growth, it has become increasingly clear that the payment policies implemented by the Clinton administration as a consequence of the Balanced Budget Act have gone too far and that the cutbacks have been far  too deep, jeopardizing our seniors' access to critical hospital, skilled nursing, and home health care. 
   Nowhere is this problem more serious than in home health care. America's home health agencies provide services that have enabled a growing number of our most frail and vulnerable senior citizens to avoid hospitals, to avoid nursing homes, and to receive the care they need and want in the security and privacy of their homes, just where they want to be. 
   I have visited with home health nurses in Maine who have taken me on home health visits. I know firsthand how vital these important health care services are to our frail seniors. I know of couples who have been able to stay together in their own home solely because of the services provided by our home health agencies. In 1996, home health was the fastest growing component of the Medicare budget. That, understandably, prompted Congress and the Clinton administration to initiate changes that were intended to make the program more cost-effective and efficient. 
   There was strong bipartisan support for the provisions in the BBA that called for the implementation of a prospective payment system for home care. Unfortunately, until this system is implemented, home health agencies are being paid under a very flawed interim payment system, or IPS. 
   In trying to get a handle on cost, Congress and the administration created a system that penalizes efficient agencies and that may be restricting access to care for the very Medicare beneficiaries who need the care the most. These include our sicker patients with complex chronic care needs, like diabetic wound care patients, or IV-therapy patients who require multiple visits. 
   According to a recent survey by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, almost 40 percent of home health agencies indicated that there were patients whom they previously would have accepted for care, whom they no longer serve due to this flawed interim payment system and the regulatory overkill of the Clinton administration. Thirty-one percent of these agencies admitted they had actually discharged patients due to the inadequate payment system. 
   The discharged patients tend to be those with chronic care needs who require a large number of visits and are expensive to serve. Indeed, they are the very people who most need home health services. 
   I know that Congress simply did not intend to construct a payment system that inevitably discourages home health agencies from caring for those senior citizens who need the service the most. These problems are all the more pressing because they have been exacerbated by the failure of the Clinton administration to meet the original deadline for implementing a prospective payment system. As a result, home health care agencies will be struggling under a flawed IPS system, the interim payment system, for far longer than Congress ever envisioned when it enacted the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 
   Moreover, it now appears the savings from the Balanced Budget Act were greatly underestimated. Medicare spending for home health care fell by nearly 15 percent last year and the CBO now projects that the post-Balanced Budget Act reductions in home health care will exceed $46 billion over the next 5 years. This is three times greater than the $16 billion that CBO originally estimated for that time period. That is another indication that the cutbacks have been far too deep, far too severe, and much more wide-reaching than Congress ever intended. 
   Again, the flaws in the Balanced Budget Act have been exacerbated by regulatory decisions made by this administration. Earlier this year, I chaired a hearing held by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. We heard firsthand about the financial distress and cash-flow problems of very good, cost-effective, home health agencies from across the country. We heard about the impact of these cutbacks on our senior citizens. Witnesses expressed concern that the problems in the system are inhibiting their ability to deliver much needed care, particularly to chronically ill patients with complex needs. Some agencies have actually closed because the reimbursement levels under Medicare have fallen far short of their actual operating costs. Many others in Maine and throughout the Nation are laying off staff or declining to accept new patients, particularly those with the more serious health problems that require more care and more visits. 
   This points to the most critical and central issue: Cuts of this magnitude simply cannot be sustained without ultimately affecting the care that we provide to our senior citizens. Moreover, the financial problems that home health agencies have been experiencing have been exacerbated by a host of onerous, burdensome, and ill-conceived new regulatory requirements imposed by the Clinton administration through HCFA, including the implementation of what is known as OASIS, the new outcome and assessment information data set; new requirements for surety bonds; sequential billing requirements; IPS overpayment recoupment; and a new 15-minute increment home health reporting requirement requiring nurses to act as if they were accountants or lawyers, billing every 15 minutes of their time. 
   Witnesses at our hearing before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations expressed particular frustration with what the CEO from the Visiting Nurse Service in Saco, ME, Maryanna Arsenault, termed as the Clinton administration's regulatory policy of ``implement and suspend.'' She and others pointed to numerous examples of hastily enacted, ill-conceived requirements for surety bonds and sequential billing. No sooner had HCFA imposed the cost burden of a specific mandate on America's home health agencies, than it then had second thoughts and suspended the requirements--but only after damage had been done, only after our home health agencies had invested significant time and resources they do not have, trying to comply with this regulatory overkill. 
   Responding to the excessive regulation of the Clinton administration, as well as the problems in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, my colleague from Missouri, Senator BOND, and I have 
   together introduced legislation titled, ``The Medicare Home Health Equity Act,'' which is cosponsored, I am pleased to say, by a bipartisan group of 26 of our colleagues. It makes needed adjustments in the Balanced Budget Act and related Federal regulations to ensure that our senior citizens have access to necessary home health services. 
   One of the ironies of the formula enacted in the Balanced Budget Act is that it penalizes the low-cost nonprofit agencies that had been doing a good job of holding down their expenses. The program needs to be entirely revamped. 
   The most important provision of our bill eliminates the automatic 15-percent reduction in Medicare home health payments that is now scheduled for October 1 of next year, whether or not a prospective payment system is enacted. I am not overstating the situation when I say that if another 15-percent cut is imposed on America's home health agencies, it would be a disaster. It would threaten our ability to provide these services to millions of senior citizens throughout this country. 
   A further 15-percent cut would be devastating. It would destroy the low-cost, cost-effective providers, and it would further reduce our seniors' access to home health care. Furthermore, as I mentioned earlier, it is entirely unnecessary because we have already achieved the budget savings that were anticipated in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. We have not only exceeded them, we have exceeded them by a factor of three. 
   Our legislation also provides for what we call supplemental ``outlier'' payments to home health agencies on a patient-by-patient basis. This is needed because there are some patients who are expensive to care for because they have complex and chronic health conditions that need a great deal of care. We heed to have a formula that recognizes that there are certain higher cost patients who are higher cost in a legitimate sense. It is still far cheaper to treat those patients through home health care than in a nursing home or hospital setting. 
   The provision in our bill removes the existing financial disincentive for agencies to care for patients with intensive medical needs. We know from the recent studies from GAO and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission that those are the individuals who  are most at risk right now of losing access to home health services under the current interim payment system. 
   To decrease total costs in order to remain under their per-beneficiary limits, too many home health agencies have had to significantly reduce the number of visits, which in turn has increased the cost of each visit. We need to deal with the regulatory issues that I have mentioned, including OASIS, surety bonds, sequential billing, and the 15-minute incremental reporting requirement. Our legislation accomplishes these goals. 
   The Medicare Home Health Equity Act of 1999 will provide a measure of financial and regulatory relief to beleaguered home health agencies in order to ensure that our senior citizens have access to medically necessary home health services. 
   It has been a pleasure to work with the Senate majority leader, Senator LOTT, as well as Senator ABRAHAM, Senator SANTORUM, Senator BOND, and others who have been real leaders in this effort to come up with a solution to this very pressing problem. My hope is that we will make reforming the payment system for Medicare home health services a top priority this fall. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time to the Senator from Wyoming.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would establish a commission to study the impact of deregulation of the airline industry on small-town America. For too long, we have allowed small and medium-sized communities from Bangor, Maine to Billings, Montana to Bristol, Tennessee to weather the effects of airline deregulation without adequately assessing how deregulation has affected their economic development, the quality and availability of air transportation for their residents, and the long-term viability of their local airports. It is time to evaluate the effects of airline deregulation in a new, meaningful way. 
   The 1978 deregulation of the airline industry has dramatically shaped the modern airline industry and the way Americans travel. The purpose of deregulation was to harness the market in order to foster competition that would improve service and lower costs for consumers. According to some measures, this market experiment has been a success. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, since the advent of deregulation, the average airfare in major hubs has been reduced by 35 percent. Economists at George Mason University and the Brookings Institution estimate that the increased competition resulting from deregulation saves consumers billions of dollars. 
   Similarly, other studies conducted by the General Accounting Office have shown that deregulation has ushered in an overall decline in airfares and an improvement in the quality of air service--although many of us who fly frequently would take strong issue with the finding of improved quality. 
   For many large cities, this is as far as the story needs be told. But for many smaller and medium-sized communities, several chapters remain. The rest of the story tells us that deregulation's benefits are not evenly distributed throughout U.S. markets. Although a March 1999 GAO report found that, on average, airfares declined about 21 percent from 1990 to the second quarter of 1998, it also found that airports serving small communities have experienced the lowest average decline in airfare. Similarly, the Department of Transportation has found that the competition encouraged by deregulation has not made its way to all parts of our great nation. Indeed, the number of cities served by more than two airlines has fallen 41 percent since 1989. 
   In short, there are signs that the airline deregulation story is not good for smaller and medium-sized communities--like Presque Isle and Bangor in my state. There are important areas of inquiry that, I believe, no one has yet explored, and that is why I am introducing this bill today. 
   We need to know more about how airline deregulation has affected smaller and medium-sized communities, and we need to focus on the relationship between access to affordable, quality airline service and the economic development of America's smaller communities. As many communities continue to struggle to attract businesses, it is not enough for us report that airfares, in the aggregate, have decreased in constant dollars. Nor is it sufficient to select certain proxies for quality air travel and to conclude that quality has improved. Just as not all communities have benefitted equally from our recent prosperity, not all can say that deregulation has enhanced their air transportation. We need to evaluate how airline deregulation has affected these communities' ability to compete for business development, job creation, and economic expansion. In the process, we need 
   to differentiate between business and leisure travel, as each serves a very different set of needs in our communities. And we much ask communities how they measure quality service, instead of making assumptions that may or may not apply to a given area. 
   What I am proposing is a thorough evaluation of the effects of airline deregulation on communities--an evaluation that has not yet been done, but would happen under the bill I introduce today. 
   Mr. President, during the past 20 years, air travel has become increasingly linked to business development. Successful businesses expect and need to be able to travel quickly over long distances. It is expected that a region being considered for business location or expansion should be reachable, conveniently, via airplane. Those areas without air access, or with access that is restricted by prohibitive costs of travel, infrequent flights, or small,  slower planes are at a distinct disadvantage compared to those areas that enjoy accessible, convenient, and economical air service. 
   This country's air infrastructure has grown to the point where it now rivals our ground transportation infrastructure in its importance to the economic viability of communities. It has long been accepted that building a highway creates an almost instant corridor of economic activity of businesses eager to cut shipping and transportation costs by locating close to the stream of commerce. Like a community located on an interstate versus one only reachable by back roads, a community with a mid-size or small airport underserved by air carriers operates at a distinct disadvantage to one located near a large airport. 
   Bob Ziegelaar, Director of the Bangor, Maine International Airport, perhaps put it best. He tells me, ``Communities like Bangor are at risk of being left with service levels below what the market warrants both in terms of capacity and quality. The follow-on consequences is a decreasing capacity to attract economic growth.'' 
   This issue is of critical importance and has not received the attention it deserves. The legislation I have introduced will result in a comprehensive examination of how this complicated issue affects the economy of small town America. It would establish a commission of 15 members from all areas of the country, including at least five members from rural areas, to study and report on the effects of airline deregulation. The Commission will examine a vital component of the deregulated airline industry--the effects on economic development and job creation, particularly in areas that are underserved by air carriers. 
   The Commission will also explore the broader effects of deregulation on affordability, accessibility, availability, and the quality of air transportation, nationally and in small-sized and medium-sized communities. It will explore deregulation's impact on the economical viability of smaller airports and the long-term configuration of the U.S. passenger air transportation system. 
   Mr. President, sometimes the best use we can make of the Senate's legislative powers is to study the results of our previous actions. In passing airline deregulation, Congress unleashed the power of competition with many positive benefits for consumers who live in large cities. It is now time to evaluate the impact on residents living in small-town America. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this important measure.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Jeffords amendment to delay implementation of the final pricing rule on Federal milk market order reform. The intent of this amendment is to delay the expiration of the Northeast Dairy Compact. I am proud to be a strong supporter of the Compact, which is a proven success that is critical to the survival of dairy farmers in Maine and throughout New England. 
   First approved by Congress in the 1996 farm bill, the New England Dairy Compact already has a proven track record of quantifiable benefits to both consumers and farmers. The Compact works simply by evening out the peaks and valleys in fluid milk prices, providing stability to the cost of milk and ensuring a supply a fresh, wholesome, local milk. 
   This past year, the Compact has proven its worth to both dairy farmers and consumers. As prices climbed and farmers were receiving a sustainable price for milk, the Compact turned off, allowing the market to function through principles of supply and demand. But when prices dropped sharply, the Compact was triggered to soften and slow the blow to farmers of an abrupt and dramatic drop in the volatile, often unpredictable milk market. 
   Consumers also benefit from the Compact. Not only does the Compact stabilize prices, thus avoiding dramatic fluctuation in the retail cost of milk, it also guarantees that the consumer is assured the availability of a supply of fresh, local milk. We've known for a long time that dairy products are an important part of a healthy diet, but recent studies are proving that dairy products provide a host of previously unknown nutritional benefits. Just as we are learning of the tremendous health benefits of dairy foods, however, milk consumption, especially among young people, is dropping. It is a crucial, common-sense, first step to reverse this trend, for milk to be available and consistently affordable for young families. 
   Finally, the Compact, while providing clear benefits to dairy producers and consumers in the Northeast, has proven it does not harm farmers or taxpayers from outside the region. A 1998  report by the Office of Management and Budget showed that, during the first 6-months of the Compact, it did not adversely affect farmers from outside the Compact region and added no costs to Federal nutrition programs. 
   Mr. President, many of Maine's dairy farmers tell me that the Compact is critical to their long-term survival and ability to continue to maintain a way of life vital to rural communities. On behalf of these farmers and consumers throughout New England and the country, I urge my colleagues to support the Jeffords amendment.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, there is no question that cold-water marine aquaculture holds enormous exciting potential that remains untapped by the Federal Government. Despite its cryptic name, cold-water marine aquaculture is the lifeblood of a very tangible important industry. Each year millions of Atlantic salmon are raised in the cold quick-moving coastal water off the coast of Downeast Maine. The strong tides and rocky coast combined with many sheltering islands provide the perfect environment for a commercially viable finfish aquaculture industry. My discussions with the Agricultural Resources Service, experienced aquaculturalists, and researchers at the University of Maine have confirmed that the coast of Maine would, indeed, be an excellent location for Federal research into marine aquaculture. 
   I understand that language included in the Agricultural appropriations bill requires ARS to study all of its current aquacultural activities. Is it the chairman's understanding that the study referenced in this bill will focus on, among other things, the feasibility of marine cold-water research program?

   Ms. COLLINS. Yes, I agree with the Senator from Michigan. The practice of using different-looking promotional mailings without any information explaining that they are for the same sweepstakes serves no purpose except to lead recipients into believing that they are different sweepstakes. Once the recipient believes that they are different sweepstakes, the recipient who believes that a purchase either is required or will confer an advantage upon them will then believe that a separate purchase must be made for each unique-looking sweepstakes. Because these different-looking mailings do not clearly state that they are promoting the same sweepstakes, I agree with the Senator from Michigan that they can be deceptive.

   Ms. COLLINS. Yes, I do. Of the several disclosures we require to be included in a mailing containing a sweepstakes or skill contest promotion, these two disclosures--that no purchase is necessary and that purchasing does not improve your chances of winning--are particularly important for the reader to see in a prominent way. The statements themselves should be clear and conspicuous, as required by the bill, and they should be prominent in three places in each mailing, so it would be very difficult for a recipient not to notice them. 
   A number of sweepstakes and skill contest promoters currently include in their mailings the statement that no purchase is necessary. But this is often included only as a part of a lengthy set of rules or buried in other statements and notices that allow it to be easily overlooked. That is why our managers' amendment includes the requirement that these two statements be prominent, and clearly and conspicuously displayed. I thank the Senator from Michigan for his assistance on this issue.

<TEXT>
   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I offer this managers' amendment on behalf of myself and Senator LEVIN to clarify certain provisions of S. 335. 
   As I described in my opening statement, this legislation imposes a number of new standards on promotional mailings. The managers' amendment further defines the ``clear and conspicuous'' standard for the disclaimers and notices required in this bill. All disclaimers and notices must be ``clearly and conspicuously displayed,'' which means ``in a manner that is readily noticeable, readable and understandable to the group to whom the applicable matter is disseminated.'' 
   During its investigation into deceptive sweepstakes mailings, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found numerous examples of mailings that misled consumers into believing that they must purchase a product to win a prize, or that a purchase will improve their chances of winning. The investigation showed that many mailings did not clearly inform consumers that no purchase was necessary to enter the sweepstakes and that buying a product did not increase their chances of winning. The disclaimers and notices in many existing sweepstakes mailings are of little value because they are too often buried in tiny print or contradicted by the promotional copy. Consumers should not need a law degree or a magnifying glass to read the rules or to decipher how to enter a sweepstakes without placing an order. In order to give some value to the disclaimers and consumer notices mandated by this bill, S. 335 requires each of these disclosures to be ``clearly and conspicuously displayed.'' 
   The managers' amendment defines ``clearly and conspicuously displayed'' in a manner that is consistent with previous agency and court rulings. As the committee report for this legislation explains, the Federal Trade Commission has issued opinions on the meaning of ``clear and conspicuous'' and this standard is a staple of commercial law. The definition of clear and conspicuous, as used in S. 335, is meant to be consistent with the interpretation of the standard as developed in previous regulatory opinions, statements, and case law. 
   Thus, as the definition states, the required disclosures must be readily noticeable, readable, and understandable to the group to whom the matter is mailed. As the committee report notes, in some instances, the language may need to be highlighted, in bold letters, or placed in a visible location. We recognize that the format and layout of promotional mailings differ dramatically and, accordingly, the presentation of each required disclosure will necessarily vary. Thus, we believe it is unwise to dictate the size, font, color, or placement of each disclaimer imposed on promotional mailings. The definition in this managers' amendment, however, gives the regulators broad guidance to interpret on a case-by-case basis what is required for a disclaimer or notice to qualify as ``clearly and conspicuously displayed.'' 
   The committee report accompanying S. 335 provides a detailed description of the clear and conspicuous standard as  enunciated by the Federal Trade Commission and in court decisions. The standard was designed to prevent deception, and we expect those enforcing this Act to make use of this standard to protect consumers receiving promotional mailings from deceptive practices. We agree with the Federal Trade Commission that deception occurs if there is a representation, omission, or practice that is likely to mislead the reasonable consumer or his or her detriment. 
   Furthermore, the managers' amendment adds the word ``prominently'' to the two most significant disclosures required by S. 335: first, that no purchase is necessary to enter the sweepstakes; and second, that a purchase will not increase an individual's chances of winning with that entry. S. 335 already places significance on these two disclaimers by requiring that they appear in three different places in most sweepstakes mailings: (1) the mailing, (2) the rules, and (3) the entry or order form. Because the subcommittee's investigation found strong evidence that some consumers believed a purchase would increase their chances of winning, we view these two disclosures as particularly important. As such, and because of the brevity of these disclosures, we believe that it is particularly important that they be easily identifiable by the reader. 
   The Federal Trade Commission has used a variety of terms to describe clear and conspicuous, including sufficiently clear and prominent. Because many of the other disclosures required by S. 335 may be lengthy and may only appear in one place in a mailing, we believe that what is ``clear and conspicuous'' for one disclaimer may differ from what is necessitated by another. A disclosure of a few words, such as ``no purchase necessary,'' would by its very nature dictate a different yardstick than would the entire contest rules, which might consist of several hundred words. We expect all disclosures to be clear and conspicuous but these two disclosures should be ``prominent'' in the three required places in each mailing. 
   The managers' amendment also makes several technical changes. it removes duplicative language from several different disclosures required by S. 335. These deletions, however, are not intended in any way to weaken the overall requirement that disclosures must be ``clearly and conspicuously displayed.'' The managers' amendment also deletes a somewhat duplicative requirement relating to advantages that a sweepstakes might imply are given to those entries that accompany a purchase. Given the disclaimer which states that a purchase will not improve the contestant's chance of winning, we determined that this provision was superfluous. 
   Finally, the managers' amendment replaces section 8 of the bill reported by the Governmental Affairs Committee with new language requiring all companies sending sweepstakes or skill contest mailings to establish a system for removing the names of individuals who do not wish to receive such mailings. Section 8, as reported out of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, established a uniform notification system for most sweepstakes and contest mailings. 
   Under the new provisions companies would be required--on a company-by-company basis--to include on their mailings a notice of the address or toll-free telephone number that individuals could contact to request that their names be removed from future mailings. Such names must be removed within 35 days after appropriate notice. If a mailing is recklessly sent to consumers who have requested not to receive further solicitations, the mailer shall be subject to a penalty of $10,000. This section shall take effect one year after enactment of this legislation. We commend our colleague and friend Senator EDWARDS for his strong leadership in crafting this proposal. 
   In closing, I thank my colleagues, particularly Senator LEVIN, for their assistance in crafting this managers' amendment, and I urge its adoption.

   Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, let me start by expressing my deep appreciation to the members of the subcommittee and the full committee who worked so closely with me on this legislation. In particular, I recognize the enormous contributions of the Senator from Michigan, Mr. LEVIN; the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. EDWARDS; and the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. COCHRAN. Without their help, we would not have been able to craft such an effective bill. I am very grateful for their assistance and support. 
   We have heard very eloquent statements from a number of Senators today about the need for this legislation. In closing this debate, let me quote from a 74-year-old woman who wrote to me about how deceptive sweepstakes put her deeply into debt. In her letter, she said:  
   My only source of income is a monthly Social Security check totaling $893. I estimate that I have spent somewhere between $10,000 and $20,000 in the last 19 years. What money I did not have, I borrowed from my daughter who is now responsible for my total financial support. I am deeply in financial debt. Their mailings were worded in such a way that I was certain I was going to win anywhere from $1 million to $10 million. I truly wish I could recoup the moneys that I squandered in the hope that a real payoff would come my way.  
   Unfortunately, it is too late for this woman, but today the Senate can act to avoid financial hardship, wasted savings, and a great deal of heartache for countless other vulnerable citizens by passing this legislation. 
   It is my hope that we will have a very strong vote today and that it will prompt the House to act and we will see this important legislation signed into law before we adjourn this year. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time. I ask for the yeas and nays. I think they have already been ordered, but if they have not, I request the yeas and nays.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, yesterday I offered an amendment to the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999. My good friend Senator COVERDELL and I crafted this amendment to help our public school teachers pursue professional development and pay for incidental supplies for their classrooms. 
   Our amendment will allow teachers to deduct their professional development expenses without subjecting the deduction to the existing two percent floor. It will also allow teachers to deduct up to $125 for books, supplies, and equipment related to their teaching. 
   Mr. President, while our amendment provides financial relief for teachers, its ultimate beneficiaries will be their students. Other than involved parents, a well-qualified teacher is the most important prerequisite for student success. Educational researchers have demonstrated the close relationship between qualified teachers and successful students. Moreover, teachers themselves understand how important professional development is to maintaining and extending their levels of competence. When I meet with teachers from Maine, they repeatedly tell me of their need for more professional development and the scarcity of financial support for this worthy pursuit.  
   The willingness of Maine's teachers to fund their own professional development activities has impressed me deeply. For example, an English teacher who serves on my Educational Policy Advisory Committee told me of spending her own money to attend a curriculum conference. She is typical of many teachers who generously reach into their own pockets to pay for professional development and to purchase materials that enhance their teaching. 
   Let me explain how our amendment works in terms of real dollars. The average yearly salary of a teacher in 1997 was about $38,500. Under current law, a teacher making this salary could not deduct the first $770 in professional development and incidental instruction-related expenses that he or she paid for out of pocket. Our amendment would see to it that teachers receive tax relief for all such expenses. 
   I greatly admire the many teachers who have voluntarily financed the additional education that they need to improve their skills and to serve their students better and who purchase books, supplies, equipment and other materials that enhance their teaching. I hope that this change in our tax code will encourage teachers to continue to take formal course work in the subject matter that they teach, to complete graduate degrees in either their subject matter or in education, and to attend conferences to give them new ideas for presenting course work in a challenging manner. This amendment will reimburse teachers for a small part of what they invest in our children's future. 
   Mr. President, this would be money well spent. Investing in education is the surest way for us to build one of the most important assets for our country's future, a well-educated population. We need to ensure that our public schools have the best teachers possible in order to bring out the best in our students. Adopting this amendment will help us to accomplish this goal. I thank my colleagues in joining Senator COVERDELL and me in support of this effort.

   Ms. COLLINS. I thank my colleague from Louisiana. 
   Mr. President, I rise today in strong support and as a proud cosponsor of the Chafee-Breaux bipartisan compromise plan. I commend the Senator from Louisiana and the Senator from Rhode Island for their leadership in bringing Members together to craft this important proposal. This amendment represents a fair, prudent, and responsible compromise between and among the competing proposals we have been debating. It is a sensible bipartisan plan. 
   In crafting this proposal, our bipartisan coalition has been guided by several principles. The first is perhaps best summed up by the expression, ``Don't count your chickens until they are hatched.'' We know, based on CBO estimates for the next 10 years, that we may have a projected surplus of $3 trillion. However, $1.9 trillion of that surplus is due to a surplus in the Social Security trust fund. I don't think we should spend a penny of the Social Security trust fund surplus for either tax cuts or for spending increases on non-  Social Security-related programs. That should be reserved for paying Social Security benefits and for Social Security reform. 
   That leaves roughly $1 trillion to decide how we are going to allocate. Our bipartisan coalition believes adopting a more prudent tax relief goal of approximately $500 billion over the next 10 years will provide millions of families in Maine and across the country with much-needed tax relief, while at the same time guarding against the possibility that the current surplus projections may not be fully realized in the years to come. Our proposal allows for additional amounts of the public 
   debt to be paid down, as well as reserving extra funds that could be used to preserve and protect Medicare, to strengthen education, and for other priority programs. 
   Our second principle is to target the tax relief we are providing. In this time of economic good fortune, we should focus our tax relief on hard-working lower-income and middle-income families. Our proposal would do just that. It allows for additional public debt to be paid off while removing 3 million low-income taxpayers from the tax rolls altogether. In addition, it slices the marginal tax rate nearly in half for another 4 million Americans. 
   The third principle we have adhered to is quite simply pragmatism. In order to craft, to pass, and actually enact into law a tax relief bill, we must offer a plan that enjoys bipartisan support. Our proposal meets this test and in the process offers a blueprint for reasonable tax relief that should and could become law. Indeed, I predict that ultimately what will be signed into law will be very close to the proposal the bipartisan coalition has put forth today. 
   In addition to this broad-based tax relief, our proposal includes a number of compelling tax relief measures. For example, the amendment provides substantial relief for the unfair marriage tax penalty that causes many married couples to pay more taxes together than they would if they had remained separate. It also contains important health care-related tax proposals that I, along with many other Senators, have advocated for some time. That includes a 100-percent deduction for self-employed individuals purchasing their own health insurance, as well as the deduction for the purchase of long-term care insurance. 
   In addition, our amendment contains valuable estate tax relief provisions to help our family businesses and our family farms stay in the family. It includes provisions that I sponsored to help families save for college education of their children as well as to encourage the environmental benefits that come from biomass plants. 
   An astute, perhaps even a casual, observer might well notice that our bipartisan coalition's plan bears a striking resemblance to the plan put forth by the Finance Committee. It is, however, a slimmed down version of the Finance Committee bill in that it trims about $300 billion from the Finance Committee legislation. 
   I urge the adoption of the Chafee-Breaux amendment. It seems a good middle ground that best provides tax relief in a prudent way for American families.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator SNOWE in offering a resolution congratulating the University of Maine Men's Ice Hockey team, who, as many of my colleagues know, won the 1999 NCAA Division I Hockey Championship earlier this year. 
   Like all who watched the thrilling championship game on April 3, I was on the edge of my seat when Marcus Gustafsson scored the game-winning goal to give the Black Bears a heart-stopping 3-2 overtime victory over the University of New Hampshire Wildcats. This incredible victory gave the Black Bears their second national championship in seven years--and nearly gave me a heart attack. I must say, had the game not been as close as it was, I would have been able to relax a bit more that night. But as any sports fan knows, a close game--particularly a game that is won in overtime--is all the more rewarding, and much more befitting as the crowning achievement of a national champion. 
   In Maine, where we take our sports seriously despite not having any major league sports teams, the Black Bears are a tremendous source of pride. As anyone traveling on the Maine Turnpike can tell you, signs that once welcomed you to ``Vacationland'' now welcome you to the home of the NCAA Hockey Champions. This year the Black Bears once again earned our admiration with an impressive record of 31 wins, 6 losses, and 4 ties. Also, they repeatedly wowed the faithful Maine fans by winning all but one game on their home ice--the beloved Alfond Arena. 
   Throughout the season, the players and coaching staff all showed tremendous dedication and heart, and their ability to work together as a team was second to none. They advanced boldly through the NCAA tournament, beating Boston College in overtime at the ``Frozen Four,'' and ultimately earned the right to play in the championship game against the University of New Hampshire Wildcats--a team that had beaten the Black Bears twice earlier in the season. Not to be denied, the Black Bears persevered and beat the Wildcats when it mattered the most. 
   True to form for any national championship team, the Black Bears have a tremendous amount of talent. Four Maine men were selected in this year's National Hockey League draft, and I suspect that several more of their teammates will eventually join them in playing professional hockey. What made this team great, however, was its strong determination, its ability to work together, and its perseverance. It is these qualities that produce championships, and they are qualities that will continue to serve these fine young men very well--both on and off the ice. 
   Since winning the championship, the Black Bears have enjoyed a substantial amount of much-deserved recognition. I was proud to be among those fans who were on hand to welcome the victorious team home, and I was also pleased to speak at an awards dinner in the team's honor. Soon, Maine's players and coaches will be honored by the President at the White House. Therefore, I believe it is altogether fitting and proper that the Senate add its voice, and recognize the Black Bears' accomplishments, by adopting the resolution that I so proudly offer with Senator SNOWE. While the Senate chamber may not be Alfond Arena, it is most appropriate that I close my remarks with the chant, ``M-A-I-N-E  
   Gooooooo Blue!'' 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution commending the Georges Bank review panel on the recent extension of the moratorium on oil and gas exploration on Georges Bank and urging our Canadian neighbors to adopt a longer-term moratorium that would match that adopted by the United States. 
   Georges Bank is a large shallow bank on the Outer Continental Shelf of the eastern North American continent. Georges Bank, which separates the Gulf of Maine from the open Atlantic Ocean, is traditionally known as one of the most productive fishing grounds in the world. Fishing vessels from New England and Canada catch cod, haddock, yellowtail flounder, scallops, lobsters, swordfish, herring, and bluefin tuna in its waters. Literally hundreds of communities depend upon fish from Georges Bank for their way of life and livelihood. 
   In 1984, the United States-Canadian boundary dispute involving ownership of Georges Bank was resolved by the International Court of Justice at The Hague. The Court declared the northeastern portion of the bank as under Canadian jurisdiction and the southwestern portion as under the jurisdiction of the United States. Since that decision, both the United States and Canada have maintained a moratorium on oil and gas exploration on Georges Bank. 
   In 1998, the United States extended its moratorium until the year 2012.  
   In 1988, with the adoption of the Canada-Nova Scotia Accord Acts, Canada placed a moratorium on petroleum activities on Georges Bank until January 1, 2000. In preparation for the expiration of that moratorium, a three-person review panel held an extensive public comment period, commissioned studies, and thoroughly explored the pros and cons of allowing oil and gas activity on the Canadian portion of Georges Bank. Last month, at the conclusion of its review, the panel recommended that the moratorium on petroleum activities on Georges Bank be continued, but it did not specify a date. 
   I certainly respect the fact that Canada is entitled to make its own mineral management decisions. Nevertheless, given the joint jurisdiction that the United States and Canada have over Georges Bank, I believe it is appropriate for this body to convey its concern and support for the unique ecosystem and fisheries of Georges Bank. An accident involving a petroleum spill on either side of the line could have a devastating impact on fisheries well up and down the coast from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to the coast of New England. 
   The severe weather in and the vast expanse of Georges Bank far from shore would greatly complicate any effort to clean up any spill that could occur. Indeed, even if a spill never occurred, the lubricants used in drilling could well have a toxic impact on Georges Bank's delicate fisheries. 
   Fishermen from Canada and the United States are subject to strict regulations governing fishing on Georges Bank. These regulations are designed to allow fish stocks to recover after years of overfishing. They have involved considerable sacrifices for the fishermen who depend on Georges Bank to make a living. But the sacrifices are paying off, and the fish stocks are recovering. It would be a shame to set back or to reverse completely those hard-won recovery efforts with even the risk of a major oil spill. 
   The resolution I am submitting today encourages the Government of Canada to accept the recommendations of its review panel. It also goes further by asking our neighbor to the north to extend its drilling moratorium until the year 2012 to match the American moratorium. In that way, both Canadians and Americans may be assured that Georges Bank will remain in its traditional uses.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to address a growing problem in this country, and that is the needless proliferation of area codes. 
   As many of my colleagues have witnessed in their own States, new area codes are being imposed upon consumers and businesses at a dizzying pace. While the modern technology of faxes, cell phones, pagers, and computer modems has played a role in creating this problem, area code exhaustion stems largely from the woefully inefficient system for allocating numbers to local telephone companies. This leads to the exhaustion of an area code long before all of the telephone numbers covered by that code actually have been used. 
   My own home State of Maine dramatically illustrates this problem. We have a population in Maine of approximately 1.2 million people. Within our ``207'' area code, there are roughly 8 million usable numbers and some 5.7 million of these numbers are still unused. Incredibly enough, however, Maine has been notified that it will be forced to add a new area code by the year 2001. 
   This paradigm of inefficiency in the midst of America's telecommunications revolution might almost be amusing were it not for the fact that it causes real hardships for many small businesses, particularly small businesses in the tourism industry. Businesspeople throughout my State, particularly in the coastal communities, have contacted me to express their concern. I have heard from a gallery owner in Rockport, an innkeeper in Bar Harbor, and a schooner captain in Rockland, who have expressed to me their concern about the costs involved in updating brochures, business cards, and other promotional literature, all of which will be necessitated by the creation of a new area code--the needless creation of a new area code. As one innkeeper told me, it takes as long as 2 years to revise certain guidebooks, which are the principal means by which he communicates with potential customers. 
   Changing the area code could lead to a significant loss in business for many small tourism businesses as well as unneeded expense for these small companies. Moreover, along with the economic costs, a new area code creates tremendous disruption and confusion for consumers. 
   The Federal Communications Commission has initiated a rulemaking procedure to address this growing problem. But since time is of the essence in ensuring that Maine and many other States not be forced to add another unnecessary area code, my amendment requires that the FCC release its final report and order no later than March 31 of next year. 
   It also specifies that the order shall minimize costs and disruptions to consumers and businesses located in all areas of the country, not just in major cities. The FCC right now appears to be focusing mainly on the larger markets and ignoring the implications for rural areas. 
   It is my understanding that this amendment is acceptable to the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee as well as the distinguished ranking minority member. I thank them very much for their cooperation and assistance in drafting this amendment, as well as for their cosponsorship of it.

The Alliance, which includes the Maine State Police, Catholic Charities Maine, and the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Pleasant Point, will improve and expand the coordination of services for preventing and reducing the negative impact that exposure to violence has on young children. As my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire is aware, rural regions have unique problems coordinating and delivering services to children exposed to violence.

   Ms. COLLINS. Downeast Maine is particularly in need of help. Washington County, for example, is a large rural area in which chronic poverty, unemployment, substance abuse and domestic violence result in far too many children being exposed to violence. Currently there is no program in these counties that offers adequate intervention and treatment to address the harmful aftereffects of exposure to violence. The Alliance will develop a system through which existing resources can be coordinated to provide appropriate and timely responses to the emotionally and physically damaging situations children often face. There is strong evidence that a rapid response team, intervening on behalf of children in crisis situations, can mitigate the long term consequences of trauma.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the important issue of a visa entry-exit control system with the Senator from Michigan, Mr. ABRAHAM, the Chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, and Senator GREGG, the Chairman of the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Subcommittee. 
   Senator ABRAHAM, you and I and other Members who represent the Northern regions of our country have been working for over 3 years now to repeal Section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-208). Section 110 of this 1996 Immigration law would require a recording and identification system to be implemented to document the arrival and departure of all non-U.S. citizens at all ports of entry in the U.S., including those entry points along the U.S. border with Canada.

   Ms. COLLINS. In my State of Maine, this new border policy would have the most immediate impact on border communities such as Calais, Houlton, Madawaska, and Jackman. Businesses in these communities rely on Canadian consumers to stay in business. Moreover, the impact on trade, including lumber and tourism, would extend beyond these communities and reverberate across Maine and through the Northern economy as a whole. 
   Those of us who represent states along the Canadian border know intimately how deep the shared ties between the U.S. and Canada truly are. Our relationship has included disagreements over the years, but our Canadian neighbors are part of our family--a fact that is literally and figuratively true for many Mainers whose extended families live across the border in Canada.

   Ms. COLLINS. Largely because of your efforts, Senator ABRAHAM, Section 110 has yet to be substantively implemented at land borders and sea ports of entry. Last year, the FY99 Omnibus Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act (105-277) delayed the implementation of Section 110 on land and sea ports of entry until March 31, 2001, and included language stating that the entry/exit control system must ``not significantly disrupt trade, tourism, or other legitimate cross-border traffic at land border points of entry''. And in today's Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill, Section 110 is repealed outright. I salute your efforts on behalf of this very important measure which will benefit both of our states and the northern economy as a whole.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce The Higher Education Reporting Relief Act of 1999, which will reduce the burdensome reporting requirements placed on educational institutions by the Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning Tax Credits. I am pleased to be joined by my principal cosponsor, Senator DEWINE, who has been a leader on this and many other education issues, and by one colleague Senator GORDON SMITH, who shares our concern for the reporting burden we are placing on our institutions of higher education. 
   When Congress created the Hope Scholarship and the Lifetime Learning Tax Credits, it unfortunately imposed a burdensome and costly reporting requirement on our universities, colleges and proprietary schools. If implemented, the regulations will require schools to provide the IRS with information on their students that is difficult to obtain, including the taxpayer identification number of the individual who will actually claim the tax credit generated by the student. In many cases, this individual will not be the student but rather his or her parent or parents. 
   In the words of the President of the University of Maine at Farmington:  
   At a time when we are working to increase access and to contain college costs, new government reporting requirements are working against us. We will need to add personnel, not in support of our educational functions but to comply with new IRS regulations. This is not sensible and it is definitely not in the interests of the people we are here to serve.  
   I think that her words say it very well. 
   Already, the University of Maine System has been forced to spend $112,000 to meet the Hope Scholarship reporting requirement, and the most burdensome requirements have not yet become mandatory. In total, these reporting requirements are estimated to cost America's postsecondary educational institutions as much as $125 million. This burden does not make sense. 
   Last year, by passing the Collins-DeWine amendment to the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act, the Senate eliminated one of the most difficult reporting requirements. Our amendment freed schools from the requirement to report financial aid received by a student from a third party and held them responsible for only informing the IRS about financial aid that a school actually administered. In addition, the conference report on the act recognized the problem faced by schools and deferred the implementation of full reporting requirements until the IRS had issued final guidelines. Since the final reporting requirements have not been issued, this deferral remains in effect for tax year 1999. 
   The conference report further urged the IRS to modernize its computer systems to include the capacity to match a dependent student's taxpayer identification number with the return of the person claiming the student as a dependent. This is the true answer to this problem. Unfortunately, this has not yet been done. If this step is not taken, institutions of higher education will be required to provide this burdensome & costly information to the IRS--a very difficult process. 
   The legislation we introduce today will defer the implementation of the reporting requirements for three years--through tax year 2001. 
   Further, it will require the IRS to upgrade its data processing systems along the lines recommended by the conference report. Today, as I mention, the IRS has not done this. The IRS will be required to make this change in time for processing tax returns for the year 2002. We have included this delay to give the IRS 2 years after it has been completed dealing with any data processing problems caused by the year 2000 problem. 
   The rationale for the Hope and the Lifetime Learning credits is to make postsecondary education more affordable and therefore more accessible. What Congress has given with one hand it has taken away in part with its regulatory hand. The cost of conforming to the regulatory requirements will inevitably result in increases in tuition, chipping away at the benefit of the tax credits. We need to correct this problem. The $112,000 that the University of Maine has already been forced to spend to comply with the law clearly is going to be passed on to the students in increased tuitions. 
   Last year, Senator DEWINE and I introduced the Higher Education Reporting Relief Act that would have completely repealed the reporting requirements imposed on educational institutions. Because of the cost of that approach, we have reworked last year's bill in a way that will accomplish its most important objectives while substantially reducing its potential costs to the Treasury. Our legislation would still leave a reporting burden on the schools but a much more modest and reasonable one that takes into account who is best equipped to report the information that the IRS needs to administer the law. 
   I hope our colleagues will join us in supporting the Higher Education Reporting Relief Act of 1999. 
   I yield the reminder of my time to Senator DEWINE.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor to the Kyl/Domenici/Murkowski amendment requiring reorganization of the Department of Energy. 
   Over the past several months, I have been deeply troubled by the revelations regarding the efforts made by the People's Republic of China to acquire our most sensitive technology. The report of the House Select Committee revealed that design information has been stolen on all of the nuclear warheads that the United States currently has deployed. Among the material stolen by China was design information on the W-88, the most sophisticated nuclear weapon the U.S. has ever built. We use the W-88 on the sixth-generation ballistic missiles carried aboard our nuclear submarine fleet. 
   With this information, the PRC has rapidly assimilated stolen nuclear secrets into its own weapons systems and advanced their nuclear program by approximately forty years. Not only am I deeply concerned about these incidents of espionage, I am even more disturbed by the lackadaisical response by the Clinton Administration. After learning about the theft of information in 1995, the Administration failed to undertake a serious reassessment of our intelligence community. When questioned a few months ago about the Department of Energy's security structure, Secretary Bill Richardson commented, ``whoever figured it out must've been smoking dope or drunk.'' What a sobering assessment, indeed, of the state of security at our nuclear weapons laboratories. In fact, only after the espionage accounts hit the news media earlier this year did the President take any action to reevaluate the security of our weapons labs. 
   In March, the President requested that the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) undertake an inquiry and issue a report on the security threat at the Department of Energy's weapons labs. This review, chaired by the former Senator Warren B. Rudman, found that the Department of Energy is responsible for the worst security record that the members of  the advisory board had ever encountered. The Department devoted far too little time, attention, and resources to the responsibilities of security and counterintelligence. Without change, it is feared that the Department of Energy laboratories would continue to be a major target of foreign intelligence services. According to the Rudman report, the only way to combat these problems is through a reorganization which takes the oversight of our weapons labs away from the ``dysfunctional bureaucracy'' of the Department of Energy and gives it to a new, semi-autonomous agency. 
   The Kyl/Domenici/Murkowski amendment, which I am pleased to cosponsor, will begin the reform efforts at the Department of Energy by establishing a separate organizational entity, the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship, with clear lines of authority, accountability, and responsibility. These changes will help correct the current organizational disarray and ensure that all programs and activities related to national security functions receive proper attention and oversight. These changes will strengthen the security and protection of our most vital technological secrets and ensure that if violations do occur, the responsible parties are readily identified, and the proper corrective actions put into place immediately. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with us in support of this amendment to help ensure the security of our nation for years to come. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   This amendment includes two provisions that are intended to strengthen the Patients' Bill of Rights that was reported by the Senate HELP Committee. We do not have much time, but I would like to take a moment to describe two of the provisions that are of particular concern and interest to me. 
   First, our amendment includes provider nondiscrimination language. During the HELP Committee markup, as the Senator from New Mexico will recall, I pledged I would attempt to come up with language on the floor because we shared many of the same concerns, reflecting, I think, the populations of our State. So we have done just that. 
   The exclusion of a class of providers solely on the basis of their license or certification unfairly restricts patients' access to qualified professionals who are licensed and certified by the various 50 States. This is a very important issue in rural areas because there may not be a sufficient supply of physicians to provide the care that the health plan has promised. In these areas, if, for example, a plan discriminates against optometrists, the result may be that patients have to travel long distances in order to get eye care or, conversely, they have to pay out of their own pockets for services that are supposed to be covered benefits. 
   Maine, for example, has optometrists in virtually every community in the State, but we have very few ophthalmologists, and they are located primarily in southern Maine, primarily in our larger cities. 
   In 1982, 17 years ago, to respond to this problem, Maine specifically passed legislation requiring State-regulated health plans to have nondiscrimination language with regard to optometrists. The Republican amendment tracks similar protections that are provided for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 
   Our amendment would prohibit federally regulated group health plans from arbitrarily excluding providers, based solely on their licensure or certification, from providing services for benefits that are covered by the plan. 
   Let me be clear about what this amendment does not do. It does not require the plans to cover new services just because the State may license a health care professional in that area. For example, there are some States which license aromatherapists. Just because aromatherapists may be licensed by a State doesn't mean the health plan has to cover those kinds of services. Moreover, nothing in our amendment would require the health plan to reimburse physicians and nonphysicians at the same rate. 
   The amendment also makes clear--and this is really critical--that this provision is a nondiscrimination provision. But it is not a willing provider requirement. It does not require health plans to take all comers. It simply says that a managed care plan cannot exclude a health care professional's entry into that plan solely on the basis of licensure or certification. Senator GRASSLEY, Senator HATCH, Senator JEFFORDS, and Senator ENZI have all worked with me on drafting this provision. 
   The second provision, which is of particular concern to me, improves upon the continuity of care provisions in the HELP Committee bill. Our amendment would affect the legislation in two different ways. 
   First, it recognizes that it would be unconscionable to require a patient  who is terminally ill to change health care providers in the final months of life just because the health plan either stopped contracting with that particular provider or the employer providing the health plan switched plans, thus causing a change in the providers under contract. Our proposal would extend the transition period for patients who are terminally ill from 90 days until the end of life. This proposal is one that I know is of concern to Senator MIKULSKI, and it is something on which I completely agree with her. 
   Second, it would require a comprehensive study--I don't believe this is part of the Democratic proposal--into the appropriate thresholds, costs, and quality implications of moving away from the current narrow definition in Medicare of who is considered terminally ill and toward a definition that better identifies those with serious and complex illnesses. This study was suggested by the group, Americans for Better Care of the Dying. Senator JAY ROCKEFELLER and I have worked with this group in proposing our end-of-life care legislation.

   Ms. COLLINS. This study, as I said, was suggested by the group, Americans for Better Care of the Dying. It is intended to help us shift the paradigm in this country of how we view serious illness. Medicare currently defines terminally ill people as those having no more than 6 months to live. It is often very difficult to predict with any certainty how long exactly a seriously ill person is likely to live. This study will help us to provide better care for that broader category of patients who are terminally ill and have the need for more coordinated care but who may well live longer than a 6-month period. 
   I thank Senator ENZI and Senator GRASSLEY for their work and joining with me in improving the continuity of care provisions of the bill. 
   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I recently discussed the continuity provisions which are included in the amendment before us. This is one of the rare areas of agreement on both sides of the aisle. We both agree that if someone is terminally ill, and if there is a change in health care providers, the terminally ill patient should be able to stay with that provider until the end of his or her life. 
   Our amendment clearly says that the care shall extend for the remainder of the individual's life for such care. There is, however, a technical mistake which could create some ambiguity in that provision. 
   I ask unanimous consent, since the yeas and nays have been ordered, that I send a modification to the desk to correct that technical amendment. I hope my colleagues will agree to that.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, since there has been an objection, which I think is very unfortunate, the technical correction will be included in the final Republican package that will be offered. 
   As I said, I think the intent is very clear. The majority of the language is very clear. But there is an ambiguity in one section which will be cleared up in the final language. 
   Also, at this time I request the yeas and nays on the underlying Collins amendment which was set aside.

   Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I begin by expressing my appreciation to Senator NICKLES and my other colleagues on the health task force. We have labored hard during the past year and a half, and I am very proud of the legislation we introduced. 
   I also thank our staff, particularly Priscilla Hanley on my staff who has worked night and day during the debate. 
   We are on the verge of passing landmark legislation that will expand access to health care, that will hold HMOs accountable for providing the care that they have promised, and that will improve the quality of health care in this country. 
   I am particularly pleased that the final bill contains provisions I offered to provide a tax deduction for the purchase of long-term care insurance, to ensure that women have direct access to OB/GYNs without having to go through a gatekeeper, to guarantee that a terminally ill patient is able to keep his or her doctor even if that doctor has left the HMO network, and to expand patient access to a variety of health care providers. 
   At the heart of this bill is the internal and external appeals process that will provide coverage and protections to everyone in all employer-sponsored health plans. This appeals process will ensure that consumers receive the care they have been promised up front, before harm is done, and without having to hire an expensive lawyer and resort to a lawsuit in order to get the care they need. 
   That is the heart of this bill. We have worked hard to provide these kinds of protections which will ensure that people do get the treatment they need when they need it--not damages years later in a courtroom. 
   I thank the assistant majority leader for the time. 
   I am proud to be a supporter of this important legislation. 
   Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I start by commending the Senator from Wyoming for his excellent statement. He has provided Members with a very clear explanation of the issue that is before the Senate. 
   I am disappointed to hear my friends and colleagues from the Democratic side of the aisle once again completely disregard and, indeed, belittle the tremendous efforts that the 50 States have made to protect health care consumers. It is disappointing to once again hear Senator KENNEDY completely ignore the good work of the States in this area. 
   The health committee bill builds upon the good work that the States have undertaken to protect health care consumers. Our legislation provides the key protections that consumers want, without causing costs to soar so high that we add to the growing number of uninsured Americans. We would apply the protections responsibly where they are needed. 
   Current Federal law prohibits States from acting to regulate and to provide consumer protections in self-funded plans. They are covered by Federal law, by ERISA, which specifically prohibits the States from acting in this area. 
   The States have had the primary responsibility for regulation of health insurance since the 1940s, more than 50 years. I served for 5 years in State government as commissioner of a department that included the Bureau of Insurance. I know how hard the civil servants at the Bureau of Insurance worked to protect Maine consumers. I know Maine health care consumers who are having problems with their insurance companies' coverage or have a dispute would rather call the Bureau of Insurance in Gardiner, ME, than have to go through the maze of the ERISA office in Boston. That is what this debate is about. 
   The fact is, the States have done a good job of responding to the needs and concerns of their citizens. In fact, every single State has debated and enacted legislation to protect health care consumers. That has been totally ignored by our friends on the other side of the aisle. 
   This chart shows the enormous number of State laws regulating health insurance. There are more than 1,400 State health insurance mandates--more than 1,400. Every single State has enacted legislation to protect health care consumers by mandating either specific coverages or specific procedures. It is not as if the States have ignored this responsibility. In fact, they have acted far ahead of Washington. They have acted without any prod from Washington. They have acted responsibly and swiftly--indeed, much more quickly than we have--to protect their consumers. 
   The next chart shows State laws protecting parties are extremely common. This chart demonstrates 47 States have passed laws prohibiting gag clauses that restrict communications between patients and their doctors. This is something I think every single Member of the Senate can agree on: Gag clauses should be prohibited. Mr. President, 47 States have acted to do just that; 50 States have consumer grievance procedure laws; 28 have external appeals; 36 have direct access to OB/GYN; 40 States have provisions dealing with access to emergency rooms. 
   The States have acted. They have acted in a way to tailor their laws to the problems within their particular State. These problems vary from State to State. We have rural States such as those represented by my friend from Wyoming which do not have a high penetration of managed care. Therefore, imposing all these burdensome new regulations is not necessary. In other States where managed care represents a high degree or a high concentration of the coverage provided, there may be a need for many more State laws. 
   The point is that the States have acted. They have acted without any mandate or prod from Washington, and they have acted in a way so as to tailor their laws to their marketplace. One size does not fit all. We do not know what is best for every State-regulated plan. What may be appropriate in one State may not be necessary in another.

   Ms. COLLINS. Let me quote from the letter because I think it captures the issue before the Senate.  
   As Congress begins debate on managed care reform legislation, we would like to emphasize our confidence in states' achievements in managed care and ask that any legislation you consider preserve state authority and innovation. We applaud the Republican Leadership's efforts to complement the states' reforms by expanding managed care protections to self-insured plans without preempting state authority. 
   Historically, regulating private insurance has been the responsibility of the states. Many, if not all of the ideas under consideration now in Congress, have been considered by states. Because the saturation of managed care is different throughout the nation, each state has its own unique issues relative to its market place. We have concerns about the unintended consequences of imposing one-size-fits-all standards on states which could result in increasing the number of uninsured and increasing health care costs. 
   As Governors, we have taken the reports of abuses in managed care seriously and have addressed specific areas of importance to our citizens.  
   That is exactly the issue before us. We do need to act to protect those consumers who are beyond the reach of State regulation. We do not and should not act to preempt the good work done by our States. 
   Another issue that is before us, raised by the Kennedy one-size-fits-all approach, is what if a State has made an affirmative decision not to act in one of the areas which Senator KENNEDY would impose upon that marketplace? What if the legislature, perhaps even a legislature controlled by the Senator's own party, has reached the decision that a particular mandate is not appropriate for that State and would increase health care costs?

   Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Presiding Officer. I thank my friend and colleague from Massachusetts. 
   Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator HUTCHISON, Senator FRIST, Senator JEFFORDS, Senator GRASSLEY, and Senator GRAMS, I have sent to the desk a four-part amendment. 
   We explained in producing our health committee bill that two of our goals were to expand access to health insurance and also to provide important consumer protections to those individuals who are insured in self-funded plans that the States cannot reach, cannot regulate, and that come under Federal jurisdiction. The amendment which I and my colleagues have proposed seeks to advance both those goals. 
   The legislation would permit individuals who purchase long-term care insurance that is not subsidized by their employer to deduct 100 percent of the cost of that coverage. 
   That is the first part of the amendment. 
   The second part of the amendment includes the access to emergency services provision which Senator HUTCHINSON and Senator FRIST have been working on. We believe it strengthens those provisions. It includes some of the language which Senator GRAHAM of Florida had offered yesterday, but that has been refined. It takes a somewhat different approach. 
   The third part of this amendment includes language developed by Senator FRIST dealing with timely access to specialists. Senator FRIST will explain that provision in more detail. 
   The fourth provision in this amendment has been developed by Senator JEFFORDS dealing with access to OB/GYNs. It is an attempt to improve upon and strengthen the health committee legislation. 
   I am not going to address the provisions that deal with long-term care insurance. Most Americans mistakenly believe that either Medicare or their regular health insurance policies will cover the costs of long-term care should they develop a chronic illness or a cognitive impairment such as Alzheimer's disease. 
   Unfortunately, far too late, far too many Americans discover their families do not have the coverage they need until they are confronted with a difficult decision of placing a frail parent or loved one in a long-term care facility and face the shocking realization they will have to bear those enormous costs themselves. With nursing home costs ranging from $40,000 to $70,000 a year, a chronic illness requiring long-term care can easily bankrupt a family. It can also result in the taxpayer eventually having to pick up the costs through the Medicaid program. Concerns about how to finance long-term care will only multiply as our population ages and is at greater risk of chronic illness. 
   By the year 2030, the demographics of 32 States will resemble those of Florida today. The number of people over age 65 will nearly double. Moreover, the fastest growing segment of our population are Americans who are age 85 and older. These older Americans are at least five times more likely to reside in a nursing home than people who are age 65. 
   Americans should obviously think about and plan for their future long-term care needs as they plan for their retirement or purchase life insurance to protect their families. Private planning for long-term care through the purchase of long-term care insurance will not only provide families with greater financial security, but it will also ease the growing financial burden on Medicaid and strengthen the ability of that program to serve as a vital safety net for those Americans most in need. 
   Moreover, private long-term care insurance policies provide Americans with much greater choice in the type of services they can receive. While government programs predominantly pay for nursing home stays, private long-term care policies provide a wide variety of services, ranging from personal assistance with activities of daily living such as bathing or eating or dressing, to 24-hour skilled nursing assistance. Many policies also cover assisted living. 
   In addition, policies often cover home care, adult day care, and respite  care, giving seniors greater flexibility and enabling them to retain the dignity of choice and to have the most appropriate care in their senior years. 
   The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 
   1996 made long-needed changes in our Tax Code to give long-term care insurance essentially the same tax treatment as other health insurance. As a consequence, long-term care insurance premiums are now deductible for those employers who choose to offer the coverages of benefit and also are excludable for taxable income for the employee. Moreover, premiums for long-term care insurance are treated as a medical expense for the purposes of itemized deductions for medical expenses and are also partially deductible for self-employed individuals. 
   The amendment I am introducing today will expand the tax deductibility of long-term care insurance to encourage and to help more Americans to purchase it. In this regard, I want to acknowledge the leadership of Senator GRASSLEY as chairman of the Aging Committee on which I am privileged to serve. Senator GRASSLEY has been a long-time advocate of expanding the tax deductibility for long-term care insurance. 
   The legislation I am proposing will permit individuals who purchase long-term care insurance on their own, without any kind of subsidy from their employer, to deduct 100 percent of the cost of that insurance. Providing additional financial incentives for individuals to plan for their own future long-term care needs is particularly important in order to encourage younger people to purchase the coverage. 
   By encouraging individuals to plan now for retirement through the purchase of long-term care insurance, not only are we helping to ensure their future financial security; we are also giving them the peace of mind knowing that should they develop a chronic illness, should they become ill with Alzheimer's disease, for example, they will be covered by private insurance. Moreover, the insurance will ensure that they receive the choice of care they need and on their own terms. 
   Finally, encouraging individuals to plan and prepare for their future long-term care needs will help strengthen and preserve the financial solvency of the Medicaid program. This is an idea that I hope will have the support of colleagues from both sides of the aisle. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in this effort to make this critical coverage more affordable to millions of Americans. 
   I yield such time as he desires to my colleague from Arkansas for an explanation of the emergency care provisions of this amendment.

He has been a leader in working to improve still further on the work that was done in the HELP Committee. 
   The task force has been working on this issue for some time. We first started working on the issue in January of last year. We met every week for many months. That is an indication of our determination to produce a balanced bill that will really make a difference to millions of Americans. 
   Our efforts did not cease. Once we went to the HELP Committee, we continued our work, and we are continuing our work today. That is why we have come up with this amendment to further strengthen and improve the legislation reported by the HELP Committee.

   Ms. COLLINS. I yield myself such time on this amendment as I may consume. 
   Mr. President, this amendment goes to the heart of this debate. All of us agree HMOs must be held accountable for providing the care that they have promised. All of us agree we need a strong appeals process so that anyone who is denied medical treatment or medical care has an avenue that is cost free, expeditious, and easy to appeal an adverse decision from an HMO. That is not what this debate is about. 
   The debate is whether we solve these problems in a way that is going to cause health insurance premiums to soar, thus jeopardizing the health insurance coverage of millions of Americans, or are we going to take the approach that the HELP Committee bill takes, which is to address these problems in a way that is sensible and that  addresses the concerns about quality, about unfair denial of care, without imposing such onerous and expensive Federal regulations that we drive up the cost of health insurance and cause some people to lose their coverage altogether. 
   That is the heart of this debate. That is the key difference between the bill advocated by my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle and the bill which we support. 
   This amendment is simple; it is straightforward. What this amendment says is, if the Kennedy bill, in fact, increases the cost of health insurance along the lines projected by the independent Congressional Budget Office, then it would be 
   essentially no longer in effect for group health plans. 
   This is an important amendment. It recognizes that cost is the single biggest obstacle to providing health insurance. It addresses the issues the CBO has outlined in its report in which it warned about what would happen if the Kennedy bill goes into effect. What would happen is, under the Kennedy bill that is before us, 1.8 million Americans would most likely lose their health insurance; employers would drop coverage, particularly small businesses that may be operating on the margin already; self-employed individuals would find health insurance still further out of reach; and we would further exacerbate the problem of the growing number of uninsured in this Nation. 
   We have a record 43 million Americans without health insurance. We should not be increasing the number of uninsured. 
   So what our amendment does is very simple. It says if there is an increase in health insurance premiums beyond 1 percent, or if the number of uninsured Americans increases by more than 100,000 people, that we will take a second look, we will put a stop to the mandates that would be imposed by the Kennedy bill. 
   Surely, we should be able to come to an agreement that this is the right approach to take. If my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle believe that their bill will not have the kind of cost estimate that the independent CBO says it will have, then they should join with us in supporting this amendment because this amendment offers important safeguards. 
   It says the Senate should not be implementing, we should not be passing legislation that is going to drive up the cost of health insurance and further increase the number of uninsured Americans--a number that already stands far too high at 43 million people. 
   By contrast, the Republican approach seeks to expand, not contract, the number of Americans with insurance. We would do that, for example, by providing full deductibility for health insurance for self-employed individuals. This is a critical issue in my State of Maine where we have so many Mainers who are self-employed. Perhaps it is in keeping with the independent Yankee spirit of the State of Maine that we do have so many people who run their own businesses. We see them everywhere. It is the small businesses on Main Street of every town in Maine. It is our lobstermen, our fishermen, our gift shop owners, our electricians, our plumbers. We see it throughout our State. It would be the most important thing that we could do to help them to afford health insurance if we made their health insurance premium fully deductible. 
   So we have a very clear choice. Do we want the Kennedy approach, which is going to cause health insurance premiums to soar, causing small businesses to be unable to provide coverage at all and putting health insurance further out of reach for the 43 million uninsured Americans or do we want the approach that we have proposed through the HELP Committee bill? 
   Our legislation addresses the very real problems that do exist with managed care. Our approach would put treatment decisions back in the hands of physicians, not insurance company accountants, not trial lawyers. But our approach strikes that critical balance. We do so not by so overloading the system that we are going to drive up costs but, rather, by putting in commonsense safeguards that will solve the problems with managed care without jeopardizing the health insurance coverage of millions of Americans. 
   I urge my colleagues to join, I hope in a bipartisan way, in supporting this very important amendment. It is a way for the Senate to put itself on record as recognizing that cost is the single biggest obstacle to expanded health insurance coverage. I hope we will have bipartisan support for this amendment. 
   I thank my colleagues and yield the floor but reserve the remainder of our time.

   Ms. COLLINS. First, I commend the Senator from Tennessee for his very lucid explanation clearing up a lot of the misinformation about what is in the Republican package with regard to the independent, impartial, unbiased external review. 
   This is a very complicated issue. On the surface, the Kennedy bill appears to have a great deal of appeal. It sounds so simple. It reminds me of that expression by H.L. Mencken when he said that for every complicated problem there is a solution that is simple, easy, and invariably wrong. 
   That fits the Kennedy bill on medical necessity. 
   Physicians clearly must play a central role in care decisions. No one disputes or wants to minimize the critical role of treating physicians in the process of determining what is medically appropriate and necessary care. However, the very same patient can go to different physicians, be told different things, and receive markedly different care. 
   This chart illustrates the problem. The Washington Family Physicians Collaborative Research Network studied how physicians treat bladder infections for adult women. This is the second most common problem seen in a physician's office. Mr. President, 137 treating physicians were asked to describe their treatment recommendations for a 30-year-old woman with a 1-day history of the infection and an uncomplicated urinary tract infection. They responded with 82 different treatment options. 
   Which of these is the prudent physician? Which of these 82 different treatments is the generally accepted principle of medical practice as provided by the Kennedy bill? The Kennedy bill would require health plans to cover all 82 different treatments without any thought being given to what is the best treatment, what is the most effective treatment, what is the newest treatment based on the latest in medical research. 
   Even if something is consistent with generally accepted principles and professional practice, it may not necessarily be the medically best treatment for that patient. Dr. Jack Wennberg is Dartmouth's premier expert in studying quality and medical outcomes. He testified before our committee recently that medical necessity in one community is unnecessary care in another. 
   Let me give an example from my home State of Maine. The Maine Medical Assessment Foundation conducts peer review and studies area variations in practice patterns in an effort to identify cases in which too many procedures being performed, unnecessarily putting patients at risk. They did a study that showed that physicians in one city in Maine were performing a disproportionately high rate of hysterectomies. They counseled the physicians in that city and were able to lower the rate, thus saving women from being exposed to unnecessary risks of surgery. 
   I ask my friends on the other side of the aisle, wasn't that review appropriate? Wasn't that review necessary? Wasn't that review a good idea to save these women from undergoing unnecessary hysterectomies? 
   Let me give some other examples. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that physicians performed 349,000 unnecessary C sections in 1991. Again, these women were placed at risk for unnecessary surgery. Isn't it a good idea to question in some of these cases the decision of the physician to order this unnecessary surgery? 
   Let me give yet another example. Despite solid evidence that women who undergo breast-sparing surgery followed by chemotherapy or radiation and women who undergo total mastectomies have similar survival rates, regional preferences--as opposed to medical necessity--still prevail in determining treatment. 
   There was a recent article in the New York Times which showed that the rate of mastectomies was 35 times higher for Medicare patients in one region of the country than in another. According to another study at Dartmouth, women in Rapid City, SD, were 33 times less likely to have breast-sparing surgery than women in a similar city in Ohio. 
   Yet another example involves children. Today, treatment for frequent ear infections includes the implantation of tubes. I have a nephew who had this procedure, and I am sure many of  my colleagues have children who have gone through this as well. In fact, almost 700,000 children in the United States have had this procedure. According to a 1994 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, however, this treatment is inappropriate for more than a quarter of these children.

<TEXT>
   Ms. COLLINS. In another 41 percent of the cases reviewed, the clinical indications for having the tubes implanted were inconclusive at best. 
   A 1997 study showed that only 21 percent of elderly patients were treated with beta blockers after a heart attack, despite evidence that mortality rates are 75 percent higher for those not receiving treatment. 
   I would note, in contrast, that HMO members in plans that submit data to the National Committee on Quality Assurance are 2 1/2 times more likely than members of fee-for-service plans to receive beta blockers. 
   I could go on and on and on. Perhaps the President's own commission said it best. It concluded that excessive procedures--procedures that lack scientific justification--could account for as much as 30 percent of our Nation's medical bills. 
   Not to mention posing unnecessary risks as well as pain an suffering for those who undergo these unnecessary procedures. 
   As we can see by these examples and countless more, there may well be valid, indeed, very worthwhile. In fact, there may be very good reasons for the health plan, in some cases, to suggest an alternative treatment to the one the treating physician has initially selected. It may be far better for the patient than the initial recommendation of his or her physician. These examples show that, even if something is consistent with generally accepted principles of professional medical practice, it is not necessarily appropriate high quality care. That should be our goal. Our goal should be to put the patient first and to provide the best quality care to that patient. 
   The Republican bill deals with the issue of medical necessity through a strong, independent, external appeals process. That is the way to deal with disputes about medical coverage. A Federal statutory definition of medical necessity is unwarranted and unwise. 
   I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of our time.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume from general debate on the bill under the unanimous consent agreement. 
   I am pleased that the Senate has begun debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights and the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus. There is a growing unease across this Nation about changes in how we receive our health care. People worry that if they or their loved ones become ill, their HMO may deny them coverage and force them to accept either inadequate care or financial ruin, or perhaps even both. They believe that vital decisions affecting their lives will be made not by a supportive family doctor but, rather, by an unfeeling bureaucracy. 
   Our goal this week should be to join together to work in a bipartisan way to enact legislation that accomplishes three major purposes. 
   First, it should protect patients' rights and hold HMOs accountable for the care they promise. 
   Second, it should expand, not contract, Americans' access to affordable health care. 
   And, third, it should improve health care quality and outcomes. 
   I believe all of us should be able to agree that medically necessary patient care should not be sacrificed to the bottom line and that health care decisions should be in the hands of medical professionals, not insurance accountants or trial lawyers. 
   We do face an extremely delicate balancing act as we attempt to respond to concerns about managed care without resorting to unduly burdensome Federal controls and mandates that will further drive up the cost of insurance and cause some people to lose their health insurance altogether. 
   That is the crux of the debate we are undertaking this week. The crux of this debate is how can we make sure that we address those critical concerns we all have about managed care without so driving up the cost of the health insurance people have--as the Kennedy bill would do--that we jeopardize coverage for thousands, indeed millions, of Americans. 
   As the President's Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality noted in its report, ``costs matter ..... the Commission has sought to balance the need for stronger consumer rights with the need to keep coverage affordable..... Health coverage is the best consumer protection.'' 
   I think President Clinton's quality commission hit it right. I believe they have stated exactly what the debate is before us. I, therefore, have been alarmed by recent reports that American employers everywhere, from giant multinational corporations to the tiny corner store, are facing huge hikes in medical insurance averaging 8 percent and sometimes soaring to 20 percent or more. 
   This is a remarkable contrast to the past few years when premiums rose less than 3 percent, if at all. I am particularly concerned about the impact these rising costs are having on small businesses and their employees. 
   A survey of small employers conducted by the United States Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that, on average, small businesses were hit with a 20-percent premium hike last year. More important, of the small employers surveyed, 10 percent were forced to discontinue health care coverage for their employees because of these premium increases. 
   Over half of the employers surveyed indicated that they switched to a lower cost plan, while an overwhelming majority indicated that they had passed the additional costs of these premium hikes on to their employees through increased deductibles, higher copays, or premium hikes. 
   This, too, is very troubling since it will induce many more employees, especially lower wage workers and their families, who are disproportionately affected by increased costs, to turn down coverage when it is offered to them. Indeed, in the HELP Committee, on which I serve, we saw a GAO report which indicated that an increasing number of American employees are turning down the health insurance offered by their employers because they simply cannot afford to pay their share of the costs. 
   It is no wonder that the ranks of uninsured Americans increased dramatically last year to 43 million people--the highest percentage in a decade. This is happening at a time when our economy is thriving. Imagine what could happen in an economic downturn. 
   We know that increasing health insurance premiums cause significant losses in coverage. That is the primary reason that I am so opposed to the Kennedy bill. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Kennedy bill, that has been laid down before us, will increase health insurance premiums by an additional 6.1 percent over and above the premium increases we have already experienced or are likely to experience as a result of a resurgent increase in health care inflation. 
   The CBO report goes on to note that:  
   Employers could respond to premium increases in a variety of ways. They could drop health insurance [coverage] entirely, reduce the generosity of the benefit package [in other words, cut back on the benefits that are provided], increase cost-sharing by [their employees], or increase the employee's share of the premium.  
   CBO assumed that employers would deflect about 60 percent of the increase in premiums through these strategies. In other words, 60 percent of this increased cost is going to go right to American workers. The remaining increase in premiums would be passed on to workers in the form of lower wages. In short, it is the workers of America, it is the employees, who will be paying this increased cost. 
   Lewin Associates, a well-respected health consulting firm, in a study for  the AFL-CIO, has estimated that for every 1 percent increase in premiums, 300,000 Americans have their health insurance jeopardized. Based on these projections, passage of the Kennedy bill would result in the loss of coverage for more than 1.8 million Americans. That is more than the entire population of my home State of Maine. 
   The Kennedy bill should be more aptly titled the ``Patients Bill of Costs'' because ultimately it will be the patient who will get hit with higher health care costs if the Kennedy bill is approved. 
   Our legislation, by contrast, provides the key protections that consumers want without causing costs to soar. It responsibly applies these protections where they are needed. The legislation does not preempt but, rather, builds upon the good work that States have done in the area of patients' rights and protections. States have had the primary responsibility for the regulation of health insurance since the 1940s. 
   I spent 5 years in State government as a member of the Governor's cabinet and was responsible for the Bureau of 
   Insurance. I know State insurance regulators have done a good job in protecting the rights and needs of their consumers in their State. In fact, they have been far ahead of the Federal Government in responding to concerns about managed care. 
   For example, 47 States have passed laws prohibiting ``gag clauses'' that restrict communications between patients and their doctors. As a consequence, as the CBO notes in its report on the Kennedy bill, ``Several studies have shown that few plans impose such restrictions today.'' 
   Forty States have requirements for emergency care. All 50 States have requirements for grievance procedures. And 36 States require direct access to an OB/GYN. 
   States have acted without any mandate from Washington, without any prod from Washington, to protect their consumers. Moreover, one size does not fit all; what might be appropriate for one State may not fit for the consumers in another. 
   Florida, for example, provides for direct access to a dermatologist, which is understandable given the high rate of skin cancer in that State. In the State of Maine, another kind of mandate may be more appropriate. Similarly, what may be appropriate for California, which has a high penetration of HMOs, may simply not be necessary in a rural State such as Wyoming where there is little or no managed care. In such States, a new blanket of heavyhanded Federal mandates in coverage requirements will simply drive up costs and impede, not enhance, health care. That is why the National Association of Insurance Commissioners supports the approach we have taken in our bill. 
   Currently, Federal law prohibits States from regulating the self-funded, employer-sponsored health plans that cover 48 million Americans. Our bill, which is intended to protect the unprotected consumer, extends many of the same rights and protections to these individuals and their families that those in State-regulated health plans already enjoy. 
   For the first time, people in self-funded plans will be guaranteed the right to talk freely and openly with their doctors about treatment options without being subjected to any kind of ``gag clauses'' that limit their communications. They will be guaranteed coverage for emergency room care that a ``prudent layperson'' would consider medically necessary without having to get prior authorization from their health plan. They will be able to see their OB/GYN or pediatrician without a referral from their plan's ``gatekeeper.'' They will have the option of seeing a doctor who is outside the HMO's network. They will also be guaranteed access to nonformulary drugs when it is medically necessary, and they will have an assurance of continuity of care if their health care plan terminates its contract with their doctor or hospital. 
   The opponents of our legislation contend that the Federal Government should preempt the States' patient protection laws unless they have already enacted identical protections. However, the States' approaches vary widely--for good reasons. Moreover, if we start adopting a Washington-knows-best approach to health care, we will have HCFA deciding whether a State has met the test of a Federal regulation. Our experience with other laws should show that is not a good idea. 
   Other provisions of our bill provide new protections for additional millions of other Americans. These are the procedural protections that are in our bill. A key provision of our bill builds upon the existing regulatory framework under ERISA to give all 124 million Americans in employer-sponsored plans the assurance that they will get the care they need when they need it. 
   The legislation will enhance and improve current ERISA information disclosure requirements and penalties and strengthen existing requirements for coverage determinations, grievances and appeals, including--and this is the most important provision of our bill--the addition of a new requirement for strong, independent, external review that is available at no cost to the patient. 
   All 124 million Americans in employer-sponsored plans will be entitled to clear and complete information about their health plan--about what it covers and what it does not cover, about any cost-sharing requirements, and about the plan's providers. Helping patients understand their coverage before they need to use it will help to avoid disputes about coverage later. 
   The goal of any patients' rights legislation should be to resolve disputes about coverage up front when the care is needed, not months or even years later in a courtroom, as the Kennedy bill proposes. 
   Our legislation would accomplish this goal by creating a strong internal and external review process. Both appeals processes are available at no cost to the patient. 
   Here is how it would work. First, patients or doctors who are unhappy with an HMO's decision could appeal it internally through a review conducted by individuals with appropriate expertise who are not involved in the initial decision. Moreover, this review would have to be conducted by a physician, if the denial is based on a determination that the service is not medically necessary or that it was experimental treatment. Patients would expect results from this review within 30 days, or 72 hours, in cases where delay poses a serious risk to the patient's health. 
   Let's say that after this internal review process is completed, the patient or the physician is still unhappy with the decision; let's say that the internal review upheld the HMO's decision. There is still another protection in our bill. Patients turned down by this internal review would then have the right to a free, independent, external review conducted by medical experts who are completely independent of the insurance plan. 
   This review must be completed within 30 days, and even faster, if there is a medical emergency or a risk to the patient's life or health. Moreover, the decision of these outside reviewers is binding on the health plan. It is not binding on the patient. 
   If you have been denied care you think you need, you can apply for an internal review. If you are not happy with that review, you can go on to an independent external review, and the decision of the physician, who has to have expertise in the condition at issue, is binding on the health plan, but it is not binding on you, if you are still unhappy. If you are still unhappy with the decision made, the patient would still have the right, would retain the right to sue in Federal or State court for attorney's fees, for court costs, for the value of the benefit, and injunctive relief. Really, it is a three-stage appeals process: First, an internal review, an external appeal, and then you can still go to court to sue for the benefit and for your attorney's fees and court costs. 
   The purpose of our legislation is to place treatment decisions in the hands of doctors, not insurance company accountants, and not in the hands of trial lawyers. If your HMO denies treatment that your physician believes is medically necessary, you should not have to resort to a costly and lengthy court battle to get the care you need. You should not have to hire a lawyer. You should not have to file an expensive lawsuit to get the treatment. 
   Our approach contrasts with the approach taken in the Kennedy bill, which encourages patients to sue their health plans. I simply do not believe you can sue your way to quality health care. We should solve problems about  health care coverage upfront, when the care is needed, not months or even years later, after the harm has occurred. 
   Let's look at the experience with medical malpractice cases. According to the GAO, it takes an average of 33 months to resolve malpractice cases. This does nothing to ensure a patient's right to timely and appropriate care. Moreover, patients receive only 43 cents out of every dollar awarded in malpractice cases. Exposing health plans and employers to greater liability would force plans to cover unnecessary 
   services that do not benefit patients in order to avoid costly litigation and to make decisions based not on the best practice protocols but, rather, on the latest jury verdicts and court decisions or out of fear of being sued. 
   The noted Princeton health economist Uwe Reinhardt was quoted in this Sunday's Washington Post as saying that he believes the financial impact of the Kennedy bill's liability provisions would be profound. He noted:  
   In the end, we're back again to basically the open-ended deal where the individual physician makes a judgment and no one dares question it.  
   Mr. President, all of us treasure the relationships we have with our physicians. We are also well aware of studies that have shown there have been unnecessary hysterectomies, for example, or the use of mastectomy when removal of a lump from a breast would suffice. That is why we need to have reviews based on the best medical evidence and decisionmaking possible. 
   The President's Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality specifically rejected expanded lawsuits for health plans because the commission believed it would have serious consequences for the entire health care industry. I agree with that assessment. The last thing we need is to introduce more costly litigation into our health care system. 
   At a time when the tort system of the United States has been criticized as inefficient, expensive, and of little benefit to the injured, the Kennedy bill would be bad medicine for American families, workers, and employers, driving up the cost of health insurance and jeopardizing coverage for some who need it most. 
   Our concern is not just theoretical. I met with a group, a very good group of Maine employers who care deeply about their employees. They expressed to me their serious concerns about the Kennedy proposal to expand liability for health plans and employers. For example, the representative from Bowdoin College in Maine talked about how moving to a self-funded ERISA plan had enabled the college to greatly improve the coverage it provided to Bowdoin's employees and to offer affordable coverage to them. 
   Since the college is self-funded, it has actually been able to lower premiums for its employees while at the same time providing an enhanced benefit package with such features as well baby care, free annual physicals, and prescription drug cards with low copayments. The people at Bowdoin College told me that the Kennedy proposal to expand liability would seriously jeopardize their ability to offer affordable coverage for their employees. In fact, they told me they would probably abandon their self-funded plan and go back into the insurance market and, thus, buy a plan that would have fewer benefits for their employees in order to avoid this increased risk of liability and litigation. 
   Similar concerns were expressed to me by the Maine Municipal Association, which represents cities and towns throughout Maine, L.L. Bean, Bath Iron Works, and many other responsible Maine employers. 
   Unlike the Kennedy bill, the Republican bill contains key provisions that will help hold down the cost of health care while improving health care quality and holding HMOs accountable. 
   For example, I am particularly pleased that our bill contains a proposal, introduced by my colleague, the senior Senator from Maine, that prohibits insurers from discriminating on the basis of predictive genetic information. Genetic testing holds tremendous promise for individuals who have a genetic predisposition to breast cancer and other diseases and conditions with a genetic link. However, this promise is significantly threatened when insurance companies use the results of such testing to deny or limit coverage to consumers on the basis of genetic information. 
   Our legislation also establishes the agency for health care research and quality, an initiative of our physician in the Senate, Mr. FRIST from Tennessee. The purpose of these provisions is to foster an overall improvement in health care quality, to bridge the gap between what we know and what we do in health care today. 
   Most important, the Republican bill will expand access to health insurance for millions more Americans by making it more affordable. This is the key difference between the two alternatives before the Senate. Our bill would expand access to health care, a critical issue at a time when we have 43 million uninsured Americans. The Kennedy bill would constrict access and jeopardize coverage for many Americans. 
   The biggest obstacle to health care in the United States today is simply cost. This is due, in part, to the Tax Code's inequitable treatment of people who do not receive health insurance through their employers. Some 25 million Americans are in families headed by self-employed individuals, and, of these, 5 million are uninsured. The Republican bill will make health insurance more affordable for these Americans by allowing self-employed individuals to deduct the full amount of their health care premiums. 
   I have never understood the policy behind our Tax Code that allows a large corporation to deduct 100 percent of the cost of the health insurance premiums that it is providing to its employees but restricts a self-employed individual to a deduction of only 45 percent. Our bill would move that to 100 percent immediately. This would help reduce the number of uninsured working Americans. It would help make health insurance more affordable to the 82,000 people in Maine who are self-employed. They include our lobster men, our hair dressers, our electricians, our plumbers, and the owners of our gift shops, which we hope all of you will visit this summer along the coast of Maine. It includes so many hard-working Mainers for whom the cost of health insurance is simply out of reach. 
   Mr. President, I believe that the Republican approach strikes the right balance, as we effectively address concerns about quality and choice without resorting to unduly burdensome Federal controls and expensive, bureaucratic, new Federal mandates that will further drive up costs and cause some Americans to lose their health insurance altogether. 
   I urge my colleagues to join in supporting the Republican health task force legislation. 
   I reserve the remainder of our time. 
   Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

   Ms. COLLINS. Will the Senator agree that it is absolutely irresponsible to be proposing a vast expansion of HCFA's authority 
   in regulating the private insurance market given HCFA's record, which includes missing 25 percent of the implementation deadlines in the balanced budget amendment of 1997; of taking 10 years to implement a 1987 law establishing nursing home standards; of yet to have updated 1985 fire safety standards for hospitals; when it is utilizing 1976 health and safety standards for the treatment of end-stage kidney disease; when it is shown that it has been unable to handle the responsibilities that Congress gave it under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act? 
   Is that part of the Senator's concern about taking away the authority from State governments that are doing an excellent job in providing patient protections, and instead relying on the Federal Government and the agency of HCFA to do that job?

If the Senator will yield on one further point for a question, would the Senator agree that the health committee legislation is an attempt to protect the unprotected consumers, to reach out to those health care consumers that the States are prohibited from protecting, and that, indeed, the assertions we are hearing from Senator KENNEDY, our colleague, and others, and that we are leaving more than 100 million Americans completely unprotected is absolutely false because they are protected under State laws that the States enacted without any prompt from Washington, without any encouragement from Washington, and in fact the States are far ahead of Washington in this debate?

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, we have heard it again. Once again we have heard the myth that is being perpetrated on the other side of the aisle that the bill approved by the health committee leaves millions of Americans unprotected, completely unprotected. You heard it again. That is simply not true. These Americans live in States that have enacted patient protections very similar to the ones included in the health committee bill to apply to those plans where people truly are unprotected. Those are the ERISA plans, the self-funded plans that the States cannot regulate because of a Federal preemption. 
   According to the CBO, 80 percent of the U.S. population lives in States with laws guaranteeing access to emergency care; 77 percent of Americans work in organizations offering employee health plans with a point-of-service option. The Kennedy mandates, with direct access to OB/GYN, already exist in States containing almost 70 percent of the population. We know that 47 States have enacted laws to prohibit gag clauses, something we all agree need to be prohibited. Why do we need to duplicate and preempt the good work of the States? Why not build on the good work of the States? 
   The State of Maine has enacted 35 mandates--35 patient protections. Now, who is to say the emergency access protection of the State of Maine is somehow inferior to the one in Senator KENNEDY's bill, just because it differs from Senator KENNEDY's bill? Who is going to make these determinations? Are they going to end up in court? Is HCFA, by the Federal Government, by fiat, going to decide that Maine's was not quite right, that it should be knocked out, replaced by the Kennedy standard, because Washington knows best? Washington is the source of all wisdom in this? 
   The opponents of our legislation contend that the Federal Government should preempt the States' patient protection laws unless they are identical to the ones in Senator KENNEDY's legislation. However, the States' approaches to the same types of patient protection can vary widely. 
   States may have emergency requirements but not the exact same standards as in the Kennedy bill. That is the case with the State of Maine. 
   Moreover, what if the State has made an affirmative decision not to act in one of these areas because the market in their State does not require it and they are concerned about costs? What if the bill has failed in the legislature or has been vetoed by the Governor? Let me give a recent example from my home State of Maine. 
   Maine law requires insurance plans to allow direct access to OB/GYN care without a referral from a primary care physician but only for an annual visit. Maine's law also requires plans to allow OB/GYNs to serve as the primary care provider. 
   Our State legislature recently decided that those current laws, which Maine was the head of the Nation in enacting, provided sufficient access, that they corrected a problem in the  marketplace. The legislature rejected a bill that would have expanded the direct access provision primarily out of concern that it would drive up premium costs. 
   I note for my colleague from Massachusetts, this decision was made by a legislature controlled by the Democratic Party. This was not some Republican legislature that made this decision, but rather the legislators in Maine were satisfied with the current law and decided not to expand it because they were concerned about the additional costs that would be incurred. 
   In cases such as this, the Kennedy proposal for a one-size-fits-all model would just simply preempt the decision made by the State legislature. That is why the National Association of Insurance Commissioners supports the approach that was taken in the legislation reported by the Health Committee. 
   In a March letter to the committee, the NAIC pointed out:  
   The states have already adopted statutory and regulatory protections for consumers in fully insured plans and have tailored these protections to fit the needs of their states' consumers and health care marketplaces. In addition, many states are supplementing their existing protections during the current legislative session based upon particular circumstances within their own states. We do not want states to be preempted by Congressional.......actions.  
   The letter continues:  
   It is our belief that states should and will continue the efforts to develop creative, flexible, market-sensitive protections for health care consumers in fully insured plans, and Congress should focus attention on those consumers who have no protections in self-funded ERISA plans.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, current Federal law prohibits the States from regulating the self-funded, employer-sponsored health plans that cover 48 million Americans. Our legislation, which is intended to protect the unprotected, to reach those consumers in self-funded plans that the States are prohibited from regulating, would extend many of the same rights and protections to the Americans covered by these plans that are already enjoyed by Americans who are under the State-regulated plans. 
   The States have been ahead of the Federal Government in this area. They have acted over the past 10 years to correct problems in the managed care marketplace by enacting specific consumer protections. Our bill extends those kinds of protections to those plans that the States cannot reach. We go beyond that, though, when it comes to the procedural protections, the all-important internal and external appeal procedures that are in our legislation. We provide that to all plans across the board. Again, another myth perpetuated by those on the other side of the aisle that somehow our appeals process does not cover these Americans. 
   We have produced a good bill. It builds on, but does not preempt, the good work of the States. It provides protections to those 48 million Americans whom the States cannot protect. It balances carefully the need to have reforms that ensure that essential care is provided, that no one is denied care that an HMO has promised. It holds HMOs accountable for their decisions. It puts decisions in the hands of physicians, not insurance company executives or accountants and not trial lawyers. It carefully strikes a balance of providing important consumer protections without driving up the costs, as the Kennedy bill would do, in a way that would jeopardize, that would undermine health insurance coverage for millions of Americans. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I regret that my colleague and friend from Illinois, Senator DURBIN, has temporarily left the floor because I wanted him to hear my comments. 
   I want to start by commending the Senator from Illinois who has, indeed, been a leader in the effort to provide 100 percent tax-deductibility for health insurance purchased by self-employed individuals. I have been proud to be a cosponsor of the legislation he has introduced, as well as an identical bill introduced by Senator BOND, the chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee. 
   This issue has been an important one to me. I believe it will help many of our small business men and women throughout this Nation, including the 82,000 Mainers who are self-employed. They include, as you might suspect, many of our farmers, our fishermen, our lobstermen, our hairdressers, our electricians, our plumbers, our small shop owners. They are the ones who find it very difficult to afford the costs of health insurance. 
   Indeed, the part of Maine's population that has the most difficulty in affording health insurance is our self-employed individuals. By providing 100 percent deductibility for health insurance, we can assist these individuals in affording health insurance coverage. We thus will be taking a very important step toward reducing the number, the growing number, of uninsured Americans. 
   But this provision is important for another reason. It is important as a matter of equity. Right now a multinational corporation can deduct 100 percent of the cost of health insurance premiums for its employees, and yet the Tax Code discriminates against self-employed individuals. It allows self-employed individuals to deduct only 45 percent of the cost of the health insurance they purchase. That is simply unfair. So this corrects an inequity in our Tax Code, and it is important in terms of expanding access to health insurance. 
   I disagree with those on the other side of the aisle who contend, however, that somehow this very important provision does not belong on this bill, that it is a diversion of some sort. That statement tells me that my friends on the other side of the aisle still do not understand the crux of this debate. The crux of this debate is, are we going to pass legislation which will drive up the cost of health insurance to the point where we jeopardize coverage for 1.8 million Americans? That is the crux of this debate. 
   This debate is not only about holding HMOs accountable for the care that they promise; it is not only about improving the quality of care; it is not only about ensuring that people who are denied care that they need have the remedies to give them that care to ensure that care is provided before harm is done, but also this debate is about ensuring access to health insurance. 
   The single most important determining factor about whether or not people have health insurance is its cost. We face a growing problem with uninsured Americans in this country. It has gone to a record high 43 million Americans who lack health insurance. That is a terrible situation. 
   We should not be passing any legislation that is going to exacerbate that problem. Yet that is exactly what the Kennedy bill would do, by driving up the cost of health insurance to the point where it would jeopardize coverage for 1.8 million Americans. That is more than the population of the entire State of Maine. The last thing we need to do is to increase the pressure to drive up the cost and jeopardize insurance for working Americans. 
   The second part of Senator NICKLES' amendment is also important. It affirms the Federal policy that was passed back in the 1940s when Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act giving the States primary responsibility for insurance regulation. Some on this side of the aisle apparently believe that we need a debate on the McCarran-Ferguson Act. Fine. Let's have a debate on that. But we should recognize that until we repeal or change the McCarran-Ferguson Act, it is the policy of this country and the law of the land that the States, not the Federal Government, have the primary responsibility for the regulation of insurance. It is a system that has worked well for more than 50 years. 
   As someone who was responsible for the Bureau of Insurance in the State of  Maine for 5 years, I know firsthand what a good job our State regulators do and how seriously they take their responsibility of protecting consumers. Indeed, in my capacity as commissioner of the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, I worked hard to strengthen the consumer division of our Bureau of Insurance. 
    We took enforcement actions against insurance companies that did not live up to the letter and the spirit of Maine's law. I can tell you that I know the people of Maine would much rather make a phone call to Augusta to the Bureau of Insurance and to ask for help--it has actually moved to Gardiner now--but to ask for help from the Bureau of Insurance's Consumer Division than to try to figure out the maze of Federal regulation and call the ERISA office in Boston for assistance. I don't think that is serving our consumers well. 
   I urge my colleagues to support Senator NICKLES' amendment. It is an important amendment that will help expand access to health care while reaffirming the wisdom of the policy adopted more than 50 years ago when the Federal Government gave responsibility to the States to be the primary regulator of insurance. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time on our side.

   Ms. COLLINS. On behalf of Senators CAMPBELL, DORGAN, GREGG, and myself, I am pleased to offer a sense-of-the-Senate amendment urging the U.S. Postal Service to issue a commemorative postage stamp honoring the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States. 
   The VFW will be celebrating its centennial in September of this year. This sense-of-the-Senate resolution is similar to legislation I introduced earlier this year which had been cosponsored by 59 of our colleagues.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as a member of the VFW Ladies Auxiliary post in Caribou, ME, and as the daughter of a World War II veteran who was wounded twice in combat, I am honored to lead the charge for this worthwhile legislation. 
   The Veterans of Foreign Wars traces its roots back to 1899, when veterans of the Spanish-American War and the Philippine Insurrection returned home and banded together to establish a handful of local organizations intended to help secure medical care and pensions for their military service. These original foreign service organizations gradually grew in number and influence and in 1914 came to be known collectively as the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States. 
   Mr. President, it was several years later, on June 24, 1921, when the VFW's chapter in my home State of Maine was chartered. Today, there are 84 VFW posts in Maine to which over 16,000 veterans belong. 
   Those small groups of veterans who organized in 1899 have today grown to over 2 million strong. During that time, VFW members have fought in every war, conflict, and military intervention in which the United States has been engaged during this century. 
   As we near the start of a new millennium, the VFW's members continue to live by the organization's creed of ``Honor the dead by helping the living.'' They do so by representing the interests of veterans across the nation through an established network of trained service officers who, at no charge, help millions of veterans and their dependents secure the educational benefits, disability compensation, pension, and health care services to which they are rightfully entitled as a result of their distinguished service to our country. 
   This service also extends beyond veterans. The VFW's Community Service Program, through members in its 10,000 posts, serves communities, states, and the nation. During the past program year, for example, the VFW, working side by side with its Ladies Auxiliary, contributed nearly 13 million hours of volunteer service and donated nearly $55 million to a variety of community projects. In addition, the VFW helps young men and women attend college by providing more than $2.6 million in scholarships annually. 
   Mr. President, this Sunday, on the Fourth of July, we will celebrate the 223rd anniversary of the founding of the United States of America. I can think of no more appropriate time to honor the brave men and women who, while far from home, sacrificed so much that the dreams of our founding fathers might become, and remain, a reality. By urging the U.S. Postal Service to issue a commemorative stamp honoring the VFW's 100th anniversary, as was done for its 50th and 75th anniversaries, the Senate can take a small step toward remembering their service and showing our deep appreciation for their unwavering commitment to our country, both in peacetime and in times of conflict. 
   I thank the distinguished Senator from Colorado and the distinguished Senator from North Dakota for working with me on this amendment. It is my understanding the amendment has been cleared and that it is acceptable to the committee.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare Home  Health Equity Act of 1999, which is designed to provide a measure of financial and regulatory relief for cost-efficient home health agencies across the country. These agencies are experiencing severe financial problems that are inhibiting their ability to deliver much-needed care, particularly to chronically ill seniors with complex needs. 
   America's home health agencies provide invaluable services that have enabled a growing number of our most frail and vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just where they want to be--in the comfort and security of their own homes. 
   In 1996, home health was the fastest growing component of Medicare spending, consuming one out of every eleven Medicare dollars, compared with one in every forty in 1989. The program grew at an average annual rate of more than 25 percent from 1990 to 1997. As a consequence, the number of home health beneficiaries more than doubled, and Medicare home health spending soared from $2.5 billion in 1989 to $18.1 billion in 1996. 
   This rapid growth in home health spending understandably prompted Congress and the Administration, as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, to initiate changes that were intended to make the program more cost-effective and efficient. Therefore, there was widespread support for the provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which called for the implementation of a prospective payment system for home care. Until this system can be implemented, home health agencies are being paid according to an ``interim payment system,'' or IPS. 
   In trying to get a handle on costs, however, Congress and the Administration created a system that penalizes efficient agencies and that may be restricting access for the very Medicare beneficiaries who need care the most--the sicker seniors with complex, chronic care needs like diabetic, wound care patients or IV therapy patients who require multiple visits. 
   Unfortunately, the ``interim payment system'' is critically flawed in that it effectively rewards the agencies that provided the most visits and spent the most Medicare dollars in 1994, the base year, while it penalizes low-cost, more efficient providers--and their patients. None of us should tolerate wasteful expenditures, but neither should we impede the delivery of necessary services by low-cost providers. 
   Home health agencies in the Northeast and the mid-West have been among those particularly hard-hit by the interim payment system. As the Wall Street Journal observed last year, ``If New England had been just a little greedier, its home health industry would be a lot better off now--Ironically, the region is getting clobbered by the system because of its tradition of non-profit community service and efficiency.'' 
   Even more troubling, this flawed system may force our most cost-efficient providers to stop accepting Medicare patients with more serious health care needs. According to a recent survey by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, almost 40 percent of the home health agencies surveyed indicated that there were patients whom they previously would have accepted whom they no longer accept due to the IPS. Thirty-one percent of the agencies admitted that they had discharged patients due to the IPS. These 
   discharged patients tended to be those with chronic care needs who required a large number of visits and were expensive to serve. As a consequence, these patients caused the agencies to exceed their aggregate per-beneficiary caps. 
   I simply do not believe that Congress and the Administration intended to construct a payment system that inevitably discourages home health agencies from caring for those seniors who need care the most. Last year's Omnibus Appropriations bill did provide a small measure of relief for home health agencies. This proposal did not, however, go far enough to relieve the financial distress that cost-effective agencies are experiencing. 
   These problems are all the more pressing given the fact that the Health Care Financing Administration was unable to meet its original deadline for implementing a prospective payment system. As a result, home health agencies will be struggling under the IPS far longer than Congress envisioned when it enacted the Balanced Budget Act. 
   Moreover, it now appears that Congress greatly underestimated the savings stemming from the BBA. Medicare spending for home health fell by nearly 15 percent last year, and the CBO now projects that post-BBA reductions in home care spending will exceed $47 billion in FY 1998-2002. This is a whopping three times greater than the $16 billion CBO originally estimated for that time period. 
   I recently chaired a Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) hearing where we heard about the financial distress and cash-flow problems cost-efficient agencies across the country are experiencing. Witnesses expressed concern that these problems are inhibiting their ability to deliver much-needed care, particularly to chronically ill patients with complex needs. More than a thousand agencies have closed in the past year because the reimbursement levels under Medicare fell so far short of their actual operating costs. Others are laying off staff or declining to accept new patients with more serious health problems. 
   This points to the most central and critical issue--cuts of this magnitude cannot be sustained without ultimately affecting care for our most vulnerable seniors. At the PSI hearing, Barbara Smith, a senior research staff scientist with the Center for Health Services Research and Policy at George Washington University, testified that the preliminary findings of her studies suggest significant potential effects on beneficiaries, particularly those with unstable chronic care needs. Her research shows that these patients are being displaced from home care or are experiencing significant changes in services that appear to be driven by reimbursement policies rather than by clinical considerations. In her testimony, she stated:  
   ``My main concern is that we are carving out a wedge of people who are chronically ill and have intensive needs for services who are not going to have a reliable source of care in any sector. They are becoming the health care system's untouchables.''  
   Moreover, the financial problems that home health agencies have been experiencing have been exacerbated by a number of new regulatory requirements imposed by HCFA, including the implementation of OASIS, the new outcome and assessment information data set; new requirements for surety bonds; sequential billing; IPS overpayment recoupment; and a new 15-minute increment home health reporting requirement. Witnesses at the PSI hearing expressed particular frustration about what Maryanna Arsenault, the CEO of the Visiting Nurse Service in Saco, Maine, termed HCFA's regulatory policy of ``implement and suspend.'' They pointed to examples such as the hastily enacted requirements for surety bonds and sequential billing where no sooner had a mandate been put into an effect, than it was suspended but only after agencies had invested significant time and resources in compliance. 
   The legislation that my colleague from Missouri and I are introducing today, along with a bipartisan group of 16 of our colleagues, responds to these concerns. It makes needed adjustments to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and related federal regulations to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries have access to medically-necessary home health services. 
   Among other provisions, the bill eliminates the automatic 15 percent reduction in Medicare home health payments now scheduled for October 1, 2000, whether or not a prospective payment system is enacted. When the Balanced Budget Act was enacted, CBO reported that the effect of the BBA would be to reduce home health expenditures by $16.1 billion between fiscal years 1998 and 2002. CBO's March 1999 revised analysis estimates those reductions to exceed $47 billion--three times the anticipated budgetary impact. A further 15 percent cut would be devastating to cost-efficient providers and would further reduce seniors' access to care. Moreover, it is unnecessary since the budget target for home health outlays will be achieved, if not exceeded, without it. 
   The legislation will also provide supplemental ``outlier'' payments to home health agencies on a patient-by-patient  basis, if the cost of care for an individual is considered to be significantly higher than average due to the patient's particular health and functional condition. This provision would remove the existing financial disincentive for agencies to care for patients with intensive medical needs who, according to recent reports issued by both the General Accounting Office (GAO) and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), are the individuals most at risk of losing access to home health care under the IPS. 
   The current IPS unfairly penalizes historically cost-efficient home health agencies that have been most prudent with their Medicare resources. Our legislation builds on reforms in last year's Omnibus Appropriations Act by gradually raising low-cost agencies' per-beneficiary limits up to the national average over three years, or until the new home health prospective payment system is implemented and IPS is terminated. 
   To decrease total costs in order to remain under their per-beneficiary limits, agencies have had to significantly reduce the number of visits to patients, which has, in turn, increased the cost of each visit. Implementation of OASIS has also significantly increased agencies' per-visit costs. Therefore, the legislation will increase the IPS per-visit cost limit from 106 to 108 percent of the national median. 
   Other provisions of the legislation will: 
   Extend the current IPS overpayment recoupment period from one to three years without interest; 
   Revise the surety bond requirement for home health agencies to more appropriately target fraud; 
   Eliminate the 15-minute incremental reporting requirement; and

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a coauthor of the Independent Counsel Reform Act of 1999. At the outset, let me express my deep appreciation to Senators SPECTER, LIEBERMAN, and LEVIN for the bipartisan spirit in which they approached the task of drafting this important legislation. Legislation of this complexity, which must balance innumerable competing but important interests, is never easy to achieve. This is particularly true when the legislation--as is the case in this bill--touches on political nerves that are still raw and fresh. 
   We have worked very hard to achieve legislation that I believe truly serves the public interest while correcting the significant flaws in the current law. 
   Supporting the reauthorization of the Independent Counsel Act is not likely to win this bipartisan group much applause from the Clinton administration or congressional partisans on either side of the aisle. Many of our colleagues say let it die. However, I caution my colleagues against short memories. We should not forget what prompted passage of this legislation more than two decades ago and its reauthorization three times since then. 
   The Congress that passed the independent counsel law after Watergate wanted to assure the public that there were institutional guarantees that would never again allow the political leadership of the Justice Department to obstruct a criminal investigation of the President and the highest Government officials in the land. Their concern was not abstract or based on conjecture. The Justice Department, indeed, the Attorney General himself was implicated in the coverup of criminal acts by the incumbent administration. 
   Do we think it couldn't happen again? Clearly, unfortunately, it could. 
   The fact is, there will always be cases in which the Attorney General has an  actual or an apparent conflict of interest. The Attorney General simply cannot credibly conduct an extensive investigation and make prosecutorial decisions involving his or her boss, the President, the Vice President, or colleagues in the Cabinet. We must have an institutional mechanism that assures the public that allegations of serious criminal conduct by high level officials will be thoroughly investigated and, if necessary, prosecuted. 
   Only by resorting to a prosecutor beyond the actual and perceived control of the administration can the public be assured that impartial justice extends to the most influential and powerful leaders of our land. Moreover, the independent counsel law fosters public confidence in the decision not to prosecute high level Government officials. A Government official who has been investigated but cleared by an independent counsel can justifiably and with credibility reclaim his or her public reputation. Political opponents cannot reasonably claim that the official escapes scrutiny and punishment by pulling political strings at the Justice Department. 
   We should keep in mind that the majority of the independent counsel over the past two decades have conducted prompt and cost-effective investigations that resulted in decisions not to prosecute or indict the official accused of the criminal wrongdoing. Can there be any doubt that the political credibility of these decisions was enhanced significantly because the prosecutor had no political or financial connections to the target or other members of the administration? If we return these important decisions to the Justice Department, I fear we will encourage public skepticism of decisions not to prosecute. There will always be a cloud of suspicion tainting the decision. 
   The need for the independent counsel mechanism is as evident today as it was back in 1978, when the law was first enacted. We have learned much from our experience with the law. It is flawed. It needs significant reform. That is just what the legislation we are introducing today would do. 
   Though I strongly believe we should reauthorize the Independent Counsel Act, I am mindful of its many shortcomings. I participated in an excellent series of hearings chaired by my colleague from Tennessee, Senator THOMPSON, and virtually every witness agreed that the law must be changed. 
   The legislation we are introducing today takes significant steps to rein in the length and the cost of independent counsel investigations. It limits all independent counsel investigations to a maximum of 2 years and only allows the investigation to proceed for additional 1-year periods upon a special showing to the court. It requires independent counsel to serve full time and to submit annual budgets to the General Accounting Office. 
   We substantially limit the number of covered officials under the act, limiting coverage to only the President, the Vice President, the Cabinet, and the President's chief of staff. By limiting the coverage of the law, we have reserved the extraordinary remedy of an independent counsel for those high-level officials who will always, by virtue of their position, pose a conflict of interest to the Justice Department. 
   We make many other changes. We heighten the threshold for the appointment of an independent counsel, and we make clear that an independent counsel must follow the prosecutorial guidelines of the Department of Justice. 
   We also abolish the requirement for independent counsel to report impeachable conduct to the House of Representatives. We have come up with a bill that would preserve this important mechanism while correcting the serious flaws in the current act. 
   Let me conclude by again recognizing the efforts of my distinguished colleagues and applaud them for their leadership on this important issue. My hope is that the rest of our colleagues will take advantage of this opportunity to remedy the weaknesses in the independent counsel law before the next unfortunate and inevitable crisis occurs and the public is left doubting whether it can have confidence that the laws of this country will be enforced impartially, without regard to rank or privilege. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, there is growing unease across this Nation about the changes in how we receive our health care, which has prompted the current debate on managed care. People worry, if they or their loved ones become ill, that their HMO may deny them coverage and force them to accept either inadequate care or financial ruin--or perhaps even both. They believe vital decisions affecting their lives will be made not by a supportive family doctor but by an unfeeling bureaucracy. 
   All Members agree that medically necessary patient care should never be sacrificed to the bottom line and that health care decisions should be in the hands of medical professionals, not in the hands of insurance accountants. 
   We do, however, face an extremely delicate balancing act as we attempt to respond to concerns without resorting to unduly burdensome Federal controls and mandates that will further drive up the costs of health insurance and cause some people to lose their coverage altogether. That is the crux of this entire debate. 
   I am very alarmed by recent reports that American employers everywhere, from giant multinational corporations to the small corner store, are facing huge hikes in their medical insurance coverage for their employees, 
   averaging over 8 percent, and sometimes soaring to 20 percent or more. This is a remarkable contrast to the past few years when premiums rose less than 3 percent, if at all. 
   We know for a fact that increasing health insurance premiums cause significant losses in coverage. That is the primary reason why I am so opposed to the approach offered by the Senator from Massachusetts. Even if we discard CBO's previous estimate that the Kennedy bill would increase premiums by 6.1 percent and accept the newly revised estimate of 4.8 percent, the fact is the CBO score for the Democratic bill is six times higher than the cost for the bill we are proposing. 
   Moreover, the Lewin Associates, in a study for the AFL-CIO, has estimated that for every 1-percent increase in premiums, we are jeopardizing the insurance coverage of as many as 300,000 Americans. Based on these projections, the passage of the Kennedy legislation could result in the loss of coverage for more than 1.4 million Americans. That is more than the population of the entire State of Maine. This is a significant cost. 
   If you look at the CBO estimate of the revised Kennedy bill, CBO estimates it will impose additional costs to the private sector of nearly $41 billion over the next 5 years. That is a cost that is going to cause employers to drop insurance altogether or employees to be unable to pay their share of the premium. At a time when the number of uninsured Americans, unfortunately, is increasing with every year, we should be acting to decrease the number of uninsured Americans, not impose costly new burdens that are going to cause some of the most vulnerable working Americans to lose their coverage altogether. 
   Our approach, on the other hand, provides the key protections that consumers need and want without causing costs to soar. It applies these protections responsibly, where they are needed. Our legislation does not preempt, but rather builds upon the good work the States have done in the area of patients' rights and protections. States have had the primary responsibility for the regulation of health insurance since the 1940s. As someone who has worked in State government for 5 years overseeing a Bureau of Insurance, I know State regulators and State legislators have done an excellent job of responding to the needs and concerns of their citizens. 
   Let me give you just a few examples. Mr. President, 47 States have already passed laws prohibiting gag clauses that restrict communications between patients and their doctors; 40 States have requirements for emergency care; all 50 States have requirements for grievance procedures; 36 require direct access to an obstetrician or a gynecologist. 
   The States have acted, without any prod or mandate from Washington, to protect health care consumers. That is why the National Association of Insurance Commissioners supports the approach we have taken in our bill. 
   In a March letter to the chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, the NAIC pointed out:  
   It is our belief that states should and will continue the efforts to develop creative, flexible, market-sensitive protections for health consumers in fully insured plans, and Congress should focus attention on those consumers who have no protections in self-funded ERISA plans.  
   That is exactly the approach we have taken. Currently, Federal law prohibits States from regulating the self-funded, employer-sponsored health plans that cover 48 million Americans. Our legislation is intended to protect the unprotected. We would extend many of the same rights and protections to these consumers and their families that those in State-regulated plans already enjoy. 
   For the first time they will be guaranteed the right to talk freely and openly with their doctors about their treatment options. We would ban the gag clauses. They will be guaranteed coverage for emergency room care that a ``prudent layperson'' would deem medically necessary without prior authorization. They will be able to see a pediatrician or an OB/GYN without a referral from their plan's ``gatekeeper.'' They will have the option of seeing a doctor who is not part of the HMO's network. They will be guaranteed access to nonformulary drugs when it is medically necessary. They will have an assurance of continuity of care if their health plan terminates its contract with their doctor or hospital. 
   The opponents of our legislation contend that the Federal Government should simply preempt the States' patient protection laws unless they are virtually identical to what the Federal Government would require. But the States' approaches to these patient protections vary widely. For example, States may have emergency requirements, but not exactly the same standard that the Democrats in Senator KENNEDY's bill would impose on everyone. States that have already acted in this area would have to make extensive changes to their laws, if they are forced to comply with the one-size-fits-all model. 
   Moreover, what if the State has made an affirmative decision not to act in one of these areas? What if the bill failed in the legislature or was vetoed by the Governor? Let me give you a recent example from my State. Maine law requires plans to allow direct access to ob/gyn care--without a referral from the primary care physician--but only for an annual visit. Maine also requires plans to allow ob/gyns to serve as the primary care provider. Our State Legislature recently decided that the current provisions provide sufficient protection and rejected a bill that would have expanded the direct access  provision, primarily out of concern that it would drive up premium costs. I would note that this decision was made by a legislature controlled by the Democratic Party. In cases like these, the Kennedy proposal for a one-size-fits-all model would be a clear pre-emption of State authority. 
   Other provisions of our bill provide new protections for millions more Americans. A key provision of our bill builds upon the existing regulatory framework under ERISA to give all 124 million Americans in employer-sponsored plans assurance that they will get the care that they need when they need it. The legislation will enhance current ERISA information disclosure requirements and penalties and strengthen existing requirements for coverage determinations, grievances and appeals, including the addition of a new requirement for independent, external review. 
   All 124 million Americans in employer-sponsored plans will be entitled to clear and complete information about their health plan--about what it covers and does not cover, about any cost-sharing requirements, and about the plan's providers. Helping patients understand their coverage before they need to use it will help to avoid coverage disputes later. 
   The goal of any patients' rights legislation should be to resolve disputes about coverage up front, when the care is needed, not months or even years later in a court room. 
   Our bill would accomplish this goal by creating a strong internal and an independent external review process. First, patients or doctors who are unhappy with an HMO's decision could appeal it internally through a review conducted by individuals with ``appropriate expertise'' who were not involved in the initial decision. Moreover, this review would have to be conducted by a physician if the denial is based on a determination that the service is not medically necessary or is an experimental treatment. Patients could expect results from this review within 30 days, or 72 hours in cases when delay poses a serious risk to the patient's life or health. 
   Patients turned down by this internal review would then have the right to a free, external review by medical experts who are completely independent of the health plan. This review must be completed within 30 days--and even faster in a medical emergency or when the delay would be detrimental to the patient's health. Moreover, the decision of these outside reviewers is binding 
   on the health plan, but not on the patient. If the patient is not satisfied, he or she retains the right to sue in federal or state court for attorneys' fees, court costs, the value of the benefit and injunctive relief. 
   Our bill places treatment decisions in the hands of doctors, not lawyers. If your HMO denies you treatment that your doctor believes is medically necessary, you should not have to resort to a costly and lengthy court battle to get the care you need. You should not have to hire a lawyer and file an expensive lawsuit to get the treatment. 
   Our approach contrasts with the approach taken in the measure offered by Senators DASCHLE and KENNEDY that would encourage patients to sue health plans. I do not support Senator KENNEDY's approach. You just can't sue your way to quality health care. 
   We would solve problems up front, when the care is needed, not months or even years later after the harm has occurred. According to the GAO, it takes an average of 33 months to resolve malpractice cases. This does nothing to ensure a patient's right to timely and appropriate care. Moreover, patients only receive 43 cents out of every dollar awarded in malpractice cases. The rest winds up in the pockets of trial lawyers and administrators of the court and insurance systems. 
   I met with a group of Maine employers who expressed their serious concerns about the Kennedy proposal to expand liability for health plans and employers. The Assistant Director for Human Resources at Bowdoin College talked about how moving to a self-funded, ERISA plan enabled them to continue to offer affordable coverage to Bowdoin employees when premiums for their fully-insured plan skyrocketed in the late 1980s. Since they self-funded, they have actually been able to lower premiums for their employees, while, at the same time, enhance their benefit package with such features as well-baby care, free annual physicals, and prescription drug cards with low copayments. They told me that the Democrats' proposal to expand liability seriously jeopardizes their ability to offer affordable coverage for their employees. Similar concerns were expressed by the Maine Municipal Association, L.L. Bean, Bath Iron Works, and other responsible Maine employers. 
   And finally, our amendment will make health insurance more affordable by allowing self-employed individuals to deduct the full amount of their health care premiums. Establishing parity in the tax treatment of health insurance costs between the self-employed and those working for large businesses is a matter of basic equity, and it will also help to reduce the number of uninsured, but working, Americans. It will make health insurance more affordable for the 82,000 people in Maine who are self-employed. They include our lobstermen, our hairdressers, our electricians, our plumbers, and the many owners of mom-and-pop stores that dot communities throughout my state. 
   Mr. President, I believe that this amendments strikes the right balance as we effectively address concerns about quality and choice without resorting to unduly burdensome federal controls and mandates that will further drive up costs and cause some Americans to lose their health insurance altogether, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the assistant majority leader. 
   The goal of any patients' rights legislation should be to resolve disputes about coverage, about access to treatment upfront when the care is needed, not months or even years later in a courtroom. That is a fundamental difference between the bill supported by Senator KENNEDY and the proposal that we have advanced. 
   Our legislation would accomplish this goal by creating a strong internal and external review process. If a patient or a physician is unhappy with an HMO's decision, the patient or the provider can appeal it internally for a review. If they are unhappy with the review decision, the internal review, they have the right for a free and quick review by an external panel. The goal of our legislation is to ensure that people get the treatment they have been promised. 
   Moreover, the decision of the outside reviewers is binding on the health plan but not on the patient. If the patient is still not satisfied, he or she retains the right to sue in Federal or State court for attorneys' fees, court costs, value of the benefit, and injunctive relief. 
   Our bill places treatment decisions in the hands of physicians, not trial lawyers. If your HMO denies you the treatment your doctor believes is medically necessary, you should not have to resort to a costly and lengthy court battle to get the care you need. You should not have to hire a lawyer and file an expensive lawsuit to get treatment. 
   Our approach contrasts with the approach taken in the measure offered by Senator KENNEDY. Their approach, which I do not support, would encourage patients to sue health care plans. You just can't sue your way to quality health care. We want to solve the problems upfront, when the care is needed, not months or even years later, after the harm has occurred. 
   According to the GAO, it takes an average of 33 months to resolve medical malpractice cases. This does nothing to ensure a patient's right to timely and appropriate care. Moreover, patients only receive 43 cents out of every dollar awarded in malpractice cases. The rest winds up in the pockets of trial lawyers and the administrators of court and insurance systems. 
   Suing is not the answer. The answer is having a fair, free, and prompt appeals process that gets patients the care they need, the care they were promised before harm can be done. 
   I recently met with a group of Maine employers who expressed their very serious concerns about the Kennedy proposal to expand liability for health plans and employers. One of these employers was Bowdoin College in Brunswick, ME. I want to talk briefly about Bowdoin's experience. 
   They moved to a self-funded plan in order to improve the coverage provided to their employees. They now provide an annual physical, low-cost prescription coverage, and well-baby care. But they told me that if the Democrats' proposal to expand liability goes through, it would seriously jeopardize their ability to offer affordable coverage for their employees. They would return to the insurance market and to a plan less favorable to their employees. 
   I thank the assistant majority leader for yielding the additional minute. I yield back my time to the assistant majority leader.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my distinguished colleagues Senator DURBIN and Senator GRASSLEY, I rise today to introduce the Medicare Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Act of 1999. Both of these Senators have been leaders in the fight against Medicare fraud. 
   This bill will help solve an almost $13 billion problem. According to the HHS Inspector General, waste, fraud, abuse, and other improper payments drained about that much from the Medicare Trust Fund in fiscal year 1998. Fraud and abuse not only compromise the solvency of the Medicare program but also, in some cases, directly affect the quality of care delivered to the 38 million older and disabled Americans who depend upon this program. Although this legislation will not prevent all of the waste, fraud, and abuse that now plagues Medicare, it represents an important step toward a solution to a problem that threatens the financial integrity of this vital social program. 
   Unfortunately, there is no line item in the budget called ``Medicare Waste, Fraud and Abuse'' that we can simply cut to eliminate this insidious problem. It is a complicated, difficult challenge to plug the holes that make Medicare at high risk for fraud and abuse. 
   In May 1997, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, started an extensive investigation of the Medicare program. So far, my Subcommittee has held three hearings in an effort to expose fraud and abuse within Medicare. 
   As the Subcommittee's hearings revealed, we are now seeing a dangerous and growing problem with Medicare fraud. Career criminals and bogus providers with no background in health care are increasingly entering the system with the sole purpose of stealing hard-earned taxpayer dollars from the Medicare Trust Fund. Only tough deterrents can prevent these unscrupulous providers from entering the Medicare system. At the same time, however, we must be careful not to make entry into the Medicare program so difficult that the process deters legitimate health care providers. We owe it to the American public to strike this crucial balance. 
   During a Subcommittee hearing earlier last year, we heard testimony describing egregious examples of fraud committed by unscrupulous health care providers. For example, two physicians who submitted in excess of $690,000 in fraudulent Medicare claims listed nothing more than a Brooklyn laundromat as their office location. We were also told that over $6 million in Medicare funds were sent to durable medical equipment companies that provided no services; one of these companies even listed a fictitious address that would have placed the firm in the middle of a runway at the Miami International Airport. 
   While the number of unscrupulous providers in the Medicare program is very small relative to the number of honest providers, these criminals nevertheless are able to steal millions of dollars from Medicare, wreaking financial havoc on the program. This fraud contributes to the tremendous increase in health care expenditures and adversely affects the quality of health care given to our nation's elderly and disabled. 
   In response to the serious problems identified through my Subcommittee's investigation, Senator DURBIN, Senator GRASSLEY, and I are introducing legislation designed to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse by strengthening the Medicare enrollment process, expanding certain standards of participation, and reducing erroneous payments. Among other things, this legislation gives additional enforcement tools to the federal law enforcement agencies pursuing health care criminals. 
   One of the most important steps this bill takes is to prevent scam artists and criminals from securing the provider numbers that permit them to gain access to the Medicare system. Specifically, this bill requires background investigations to be conducted on all new providers to prevent career criminals from getting involved with Medicare in the first place. In addition, this bill requires site inspections of new durable medical equipment suppliers and community mental health  centers prior to their being given a provider number. This will help close the system to those who apply for a provider number from a bogus or nonexistent location. Together, these provisions are designed to make it more difficult for unscrupulous individuals to obtain a Medicare provider number and begin submitting fraudulent claims. 
   This legislation also requires community mental health centers to meet 
   applicable certification or licensing requirements in their state before they are issued a provider number, and requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish additional standards for such centers to participate in the Medicare system. 
   In September of last year, Health Care Financing Administration Administrator Nancy-Ann DeParle acknowledged the extensive fraud associated with community mental health centers as she announced a 10-point plan to curb abuses within this program. I applaud Administrator DeParle for taking a step in the right direction, but we can go further. 
   Our legislation requires each agency that bills Medicare on behalf of physicians or provider groups to register with HCFA and receive a unique registration number. Many billing companies receive a percentage of the claims they submit that are paid by Medicare. Unethical companies, therefore, have a financial incentive to inflate the cost or number of claims submitted. Because billing companies do not have a Medicare provider number, however, it is difficult for HCFA to sanction or exclude them from billing Medicare. Hence, there is little to deter unscrupulous billing companies from submitting inflated claims. This bill makes all companies accountable for their billings through a uniform registration system. 
   This legislation also provides that Medicare contractors should be held financially accountable for any amounts they improperly pay to excluded providers 60 or more days after being notified of the exclusion. There have been numerous instances in which a Medicare contractor has continued to pay a provider after HCFA had excluded the provider from participating in the program. As a result, excluded providers have sometimes continued to receive unauthorized payments due to the negligence of contractors. 
   Why should American taxpayers swallow the cost of improper payments when a contractor has been specifically told not to pay a particular provider and yet continues to do so? This bill would help deter such negligence. I realize, however, that this is a complex issue and that this accountability provision may require further refinement. 
   Under our legislation, providers also would be required to refund overpayments even if they filed for bankruptcy, if the overpayments were incurred through fraudulent means. This money would then be deposited into the Medicare Trust Fund. Some bad actors have used bankruptcy as a shield against repaying Medicare. Essentially, unscrupulous individuals steal literally hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Medicare program, hide or spend it quickly, and then file for bankruptcy protection when they are caught, leaving the Medicare Trust Fund in debt. With this bill, we intend to close this loophole. 
   Another provision of this legislation aims to halt trafficking in provider numbers. The bill makes it a felony to knowingly, purchase, sell, or distribute Medicare beneficiary or provider numbers with the intent to defraud. Our investigation revealed that there is a growing problem with unscrupulous providers using ``recruiters'' to fraudulently obtain Medicare beneficiary identification numbers, thereafter using these numbers to bill for services never delivered. This problem must be stopped. 
   Our legislation will also grant much needed statutory law enforcement authority to qualified special agents of the Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Inspector General. Even though one of their major 
   responsibilities is to enforce federal criminal laws, these special agents have no statutory authority to carry firearms, make arrests, or execute search warrants. The office now operates under a temporary Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Justice. 
   This lack of full law enforcement authority jeopardizes the safety of HHS-OIG special agents and witnesses under their protection. As my Subcommittee's hearings have demonstrated, more and more career criminals are becoming involved in health care fraud; this increases the potential danger to the agents charged with investigating these crimes. It is time for Congress to spell out the law enforcement authorities of the HHS Office of Inspector General in a more permanent way. 
   I am very pleased that Senator GRASSLEY, who has been a leader in the fight against Medicare fraud, waste, and abuse, has agreed to be an original cosponsor of our legislation. Senator DURBIN and I have incorporated into our legislation a valuable proposal that Senator GRASSLEY sponsored, namely requiring the use of Universal Product Numbers (``UPNs'') on claims forms for reimbursement under the Medicare program. Senator GRASSLEY, and a bi-partisan coalition, introduced this concept as a freestanding bill, S.256, which I cosponsored earlier this year. 
   These provisions of our legislation would require that a UPN that uniquely identifies the item would be affixed by the manufacturer to medical equipment and supplies. The UPNs would be based on commercially-accepted identification standards, however, customized equipment would not be required to comply with this requirement. Senator DURBIN and I believe that this proposal is complementary to our package of reforms and strengthens the legislation we are introducing today. 
   Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today represents our concrete commitment to improve the Medicare program by providing additional tools that are needed to combat the extensive waste, fraud, and abuse that plague our nation's most important health care program. The unscrupulous individuals who commit Medicare fraud drive legitimate providers out of business, cost taxpayers vast sums of money, deliver substandard services and equipment, and endanger our elderly by not providing needed services. 
   We must use common sense and cost-effective solutions to curtail the spreading infection of fraud that threatens the vitality of Medicare. Yet, we must do more. We have a serious responsibility to older Americans across the country and to the nation's taxpayers to protect the Medicare program. We urge our colleagues to join us in this bi-partisan effort to strengthen and improve the Medicare program.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural Education Initiative Act. I am very pleased to be joined by my colleagues Senators GREGG, CONRAD, KERREY, BURNS, HUTCHINSON, and HAGEL as original cosponsors of this commonsense, bipartisan proposal to help rural schools make better use of Federal education dollars. I also want to acknowledge the valuable assistance provided by the American Association of School Administrators in the drafting of this legislation. 
   The Elementary and Secondary Education Act authorizes formula and competitive grants that allow many of our local school districts to improve the education of their students. These Federal grants support efforts to promote such laudable goals as the professional development of teachers, the incorporation of technology into the classroom, gifted and talented programs and class-size reduction. Schools receive several categorical grants supporting these programs, each with its own authorized activities and regulations and each with its own redtape and paperwork. Unfortunately, as valuable as these programs may be for thousands of predominantly urban and suburban school districts, they simply do not work well in rural areas. 
   The Rural Education Initiative Act will make these Federal grant programs more flexible in order to help school districts in rural communities with fewer than 600 students. Six hundred may not sound like many students to some of my colleagues from more populous or urban States, but they may be surprised to learn that more than 35 percent of all school districts in the United States have 600 or fewer students. In my State of Maine, 56 percent, or 158 of its 284 school districts, have fewer than 600 students. The two education initiatives contained in our legislation will overcome some of the most challenging obstacles that these districts face in participating in Federal education programs. 
   The first rural education initiative deals with four formula grants. Formula-driven grants from some education programs simply do not reach small rural schools in amounts that are sufficient to improve curriculum and teaching in the same way that they do for larger suburban or urban schools. 
   This is because the grants are based on school district enrollment. Unfortunately, these individual grants confront smaller schools with a dilemma; namely, they simply may not receive enough funding from any single grant to carry out meaningful activity. Our legislation will allow a district to combine the funds from four categorical programs. 
   Under the Rural Education Initiative Act, rural districts will be permitted to combine the funds from these programs and use the money to support reform efforts of their own choice to improve the achievement of their students and the quality of the instruction. Instead of receiving grants from four independent programs, each insufficient to accomplish the program's objectives, these rural districts will have the flexibility to combine the grants and the  dollars to support locally chosen educational goals. 
   I want to emphasize that the rural initiative I have just described does not change the level of funding a district receives under these formula grant programs. It simply gives these rural districts the flexibility they need to use the funds far more effectively. 
   The second rural initiative in our legislation involves several competitive grant programs that present small rural schools with a different problem. Because many rural school districts simply do not have the resources required to hire grant writers and to manage a grant, they are essentially shut out of those programs where grants are competitively awarded. 
   The Rural Education Initiative Act will give small, rural districts a formula grant in lieu of eligibility for the competitive programs of the ESEA. A district will be able to combine this new formula grant with the funds from the regular formula grants and use the combined moneys for any purpose that will improve student achievement or teaching quality. 
   Districts might use these funds, for example, to hire a new reading or math teacher, to fund important professional development, to offer a program for gifted and talented students, to purchase high technology, or to upgrade a science lab, or to pay for any other activity that meets the district's priorities and needs. 
   Let me give you a specific example of what these two initiatives will mean for one Maine school district, School Administrative District 33. This district serves two northern Maine communities, Frenchville and St. Agatha. Each of these communities has about 200 school-age children. SAD 33 receives four separate formula grants ranging from about $1,900 from the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program to $9,500 under the Class Size Reduction Act. 
   You can see the problem right there. The amounts of the grants under these programs are so small that they really are not useful in accomplishing the goals of the program. The total received by this small school district for all four of the programs is just under $16,000. But each grant must be applied for separately, used for different--and federally mandated--purposes, and accounted for independently. 
   Under our legislation, this school district will be freed from the multiple applications and reports, and it will have $16,000 to use for locally identified education priorities. In addition, since SAD 33 does not have the resources needed to apply for the current competitively awarded grant programs, our legislation will allow this school district to receive a 
   supplemental formula grant of $34,000. The bottom line is, under my legislation this district will have about $50,000 and the flexibility to use these Federal funds to address its most pressing educational needs. 
   But with this flexibility and additional funding comes responsibility. In return for the advantages and flexibility that our legislation provides, participating districts will be held accountable for demonstrating improved student performance. Each participating school district will be required to administer the same test of its choice annually during the 5-year period of this program. Based on the results of this test, a district will have to show that student achievement has improved in order to continue its participation beyond the 5-year period. 
   Since Maine and many other States already administer annual education assessments, districts will not incur any significant administrative burden in accounting and complying with this accountability provision. More important, the schools will be held responsible for what is really important, and that is improved student achievement, rather than for time-consuming paperwork in the form of applications and reports. 
   As one rural Maine superintendent told me: ``Give me the resources I need plus the flexibility to use them, and I am happy to be held accountable for improved student performance. It will happen.'' 
   The Federal Government has an important role to play in improving education in our schools. But it has a supporting role, whereas States and communities have the lead role. We must improve our education system, we must enhance student achievement, without requiring every school in this Nation to adopt a plan designed in Washington and without imposing burdensome and costly regulations in return for Federal assistance. 
   The two initiatives contained in our bill will accomplish those goals. They will allow rural schools to use their own strategies for improvement without the encumbrance of onerous regulations and unnecessary paperwork. It is my hope that we will be able to enact this important and bipartisan legislation this year. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of S. 331, the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. 
   This historic initiative, which Republicans have been working on for many years now, has strong bipartisan support and will help tear down the barriers that prevent disabled Americans who want to work from reaching their full potential and achieving economic independence. 
   Approximately 8 million American adults receive more than $73 billion a year in cash benefits under the Supplemental Security Income and the Social Security Disability programs, making these disability programs the fourth largest entitlement expenditure in the Federal budget. In Maine, there are close to 55,000 people receiving more than $335 million each year in cash disability benefits under these two programs. If only 1 percent, or 75,000, of these disabled Americans were to enter the workplace, Federal savings in cash benefits would total $3.5 billion over the worklife of these individuals. 
   While surveys show that the overwhelming majority of adults with disabilities want to work, fewer than one half of 1 percent of them actually do. The reason is very simple: The current law contains disincentives that prevent these people with disabilities from going into the workforce. I know that the Presiding Officer has been working on this issue for several years and shares our concern. 
   Removing the barriers that prevent Americans with disabilities from working will not only assist these individuals in their pursuit of self-sufficiency, but it will also contribute to preserving the Social Security trust fund. 
   Advances in medicine and technology, coupled with civil rights laws, have made it possible for more and more people with physical and mental disabilities to enter the workforce. These are people who genuinely want to work. They have the skills and the talents necessary to contribute greatly to the American economy, but they currently face a Catch-22. If they leave the disability rolls for a job, they risk losing essential Medicare and Medicaid benefits that made it possible for them to overcome the obstacles that prevented them from entering or reentering the workforce in the first place. Moreover, many of these individuals' lives depend on the prescription drugs, the technology, the personal assistant services and the medical care that they receive. 
   Let me put a human face on this problem which is facing too many Americans with disabilities. In Bangor, ME, I know a young man in his 20s who unfortunately suffers from a severe mental illness. The good news is that if he takes his medicine, which is very expensive and is now covered by Medicaid, he can hold down a part-time job. He very much enjoys working. He enjoys the skills he is learning. He enjoys the companionship. He enjoys the sense of pride he feels when he works. Unfortunately, if he goes to work, he loses the very Medicaid coverage that provides the essential prescription drug that he needs to enable him to work. He should not face that kind of dilemma. 
   The truth is that no one should have to make the choice between a job and essential health care. The Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 will create and fund new options for States, to encourage them to allow people with disabilities who 
   enter into the workforce to buy into the Medicare program and the Medicaid program so that they can continue to receive the essential prescription drugs they need which enable them to work, and the personal assistant services and the medical care upon which they depend. It will also allow workers who leave the Social Security Disability Insurance program to extend their Medicare coverage for 10 years. 
   This is tremendously important since many people returning to work after having been on SSDI either work part-time and, therefore, are not eligible for most employer-based insurance, or they work in jobs that simply do not offer health insurance. Allowing these disabled Americans to maintain their Medicare coverage, and to maintain their Medicaid coverage in some cases, will serve as a tremendous incentive for them to return to or to enter the workforce. 
   Other provisions of this legislation incorporate a more user-friendly approach in programs, providing job training and placement assistance to individuals with disabilities who want to and are able to work. 
   Our legislation gives disabled SSI and SSDI beneficiaries greater consumer choice by creating essentially a ticket that enables them to choose whether they want to go to a public or a private provider of vocational rehabilitation services. The bill also provides grants to States and organizations to help connect people with disabilities with the appropriate services, and it funds demonstration projects  and studies to better understand and identify the policies that will encourage and enable work. 
   Mr. President, this legislation is an investment in human potential that promises tremendous returns. By ensuring that Americans with disabilities have access to affordable health insurance, we are removing a major barrier, a significant disincentive that too often keeps them out of the workplace. 
   The Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 will both encourage and enable Americans with disabilities to be full participants in our Nation's workforce and growing economy and, equally important, it will allow them to reach their full potential. It deserves our strong support and the President's signature. I am very proud to be an original cosponsor of this landmark legislation.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Microcap Fraud Prevention Act of 1999 which will equip Federal law enforcement authorities with new tools to prosecute the fight against microcap securities fraud that costs unwary investors an estimated $6 billion annually. 
   While cold-calling families at dinnertime and high-pressure sales remain a favorite tactic of microcap con artists, the Internet is providing a new and inviting frontier for the commission of microcap frauds. I find it particularly disturbing that despite the best efforts of regulatory authorities, microcap scam artists often commit repeat offenses. Similarly, under current law, persons barred from other segments of the financial industry, such as banking or insurance, can easily bring their deceptive practices into our securities markets. 
   I am very pleased to have the cosponsorship of two of my distinguished colleagues in introducing this important legislation. Senator CLELAND and Senator GREGG are united with me in a commitment to ensure that security regulators have the necessary authority to crack down on securities fraud. Senator CLELAND has a longstanding interest in protecting investors from securities scams. Senator GREGG also has been a leader in this arena in his position as the chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over the SEC's budgets.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Collins-Cleland-Gregg legislation is the product of hearings of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations which I chair. We first started looking at this issue in 1997 and held our first hearing in September of that year. Those hearings revealed that microcap securities fraud is pervasive, so much so that regulators estimated that it cost investors $6 billion in losses annually, according to an article in the Wall Street Journal. 
   The damage from these microcap scams, however, is not confined to investor losses. They also damage the reputation of legitimate small companies and limit their ability to raise capital through the securities markets. Ironically, the strong performance of the securities markets over the past several years has provided an ideal breeding ground for these microcap scams as more and more Americans invest in stocks. In fact, according to the SEC, in 1980, only 1 in 18 individual Americans participated in the securities markets. Today, 1 in 3 Americans participate in the securities markets. There has been a tremendous growth in more and more American households investing in equities. 
   In a typical microcap fraud, an unscrupulous broker, often acting through an intermediary, purchases large blocks of shares in a small company with dubious business and financial prospects. The company stock may be nearly worthless, but the brokers repeatedly cold call customers, promise glowing returns and drive up the stock through high-pressure sales tactics. Inevitably, after the manipulators sell their shares at a profit, the artificially inflated price plummets, leaving thousands of unsophisticated investors with worthless stock and heavy losses. The manipulators then count their ill-gotten gains and move on to their next target. 
   The subcommittee's investigation demonstrated that the rapid growth of the Internet has also provided a new frontier for the commission of microcap securities frauds. At hearings held by the subcommittee last March, expert witnesses testified that while the 
   Internet provides many, many benefits to online investors, such as lower trading costs and a wealth of investment information, the medium is inviting to con men as well. 
   Specifically, the Internet makes it easier and cheaper for microcap scam artists to contact potential victims and to perpetrate pump-and-dump schemes or related securities frauds. Rather than having to cold call potential victims one at a time, con men with home computers and Internet access can reach millions of potential investors with the click of a mouse. At a very low cost, these cybercrooks can deceive many more victims using professionally designed web sites, online financial newsletters or bulk e-mail. SEC officials testified that the agency now receives hundreds of e-mail complaints per day, an estimated 70 percent of which involve potential Internet securities frauds. 
   For example, a constituent of mine from Ellsworth, ME, who appeared at the subcommittee's hearings, testified that he lost more than $20,000 in a sophisticated Internet securities scam. My constituent has an engineering degree, and he has been investing for nearly 10 years. This demonstrates the potential risk that Internet fraud poses to even experienced investors. Although the SEC has brought charges against the alleged perpetrators of this scam, it is, unfortunately, very unlikely that my constituent will ever be able to recover his losses. 
   Whether they use cold calls, the Internet, or both, microcap scam artists rarely strike only once. The subcommittee's investigations have found that when regulators close down one microcap scam, often after very lengthy proceedings, it is very common  for the perpetrators to pop up in connection with yet another securities fraud. 
   Moreover, individuals who have committed consumer frauds in other financial services industries, such as insurance or banking, frequently move on to work in the securities industry. Our regulatory system must be able to prevent these individuals who have violated the law from migrating freely from one financial sector to another. 
   I commend the actions of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the State securities regulators in aggressively fighting microcap securities fraud, but they are simply overwhelmed with the magnitude of the problem. 
   The SEC has established a special unit to monitor the Internet for potential microcap or similar stock securities scams and has initiated 83 enforcement actions against approximately 250 individuals and companies who have allegedly committed Internet securities frauds. 
   Similarly, in July of 1998, the State securities regulators, represented by NASAA, announced that the State securities regulators had filed 100 enforcement actions in a ``sweep'' against illegal boiler room operations. Approximately 64 of these enforcement actions involved brokers peddling microcap stocks. Despite these commendable efforts, however, the SEC and State regulators face significant challenges just to keep up with the explosive growth of microcap securities fraud, particularly on the Internet. 
   The legislation that I am introducing today is designed to bolster the SEC's ability to protect investors from ever-increasing microcap frauds while ensuring that legitimate small companies can continue to raise capital through securities offerings. To accomplish these objectives, the bill will streamline the microcap fraud investigative process and provide the SEC with the tools it needs to suspend or ban rogue brokers, particularly those who have a history of committing fraudulent offenses. 
   Specifically, our legislation will do the following: 
   First, it will allow the SEC to bring enforcement actions against securities fraud violators on the basis of enforcement actions brought by State securities regulators. Currently, State regulators can rely on SEC-initiated enforcement actions, but the SEC does not have reciprocal authority. Consequently, the SEC must often conduct duplicative investigations before the agency can bring enforcement actions against microcap securities frauds first identified at the State level but which operate on a nationwide basis. With the new authority proposed by our legislation, the SEC and the State regulators will be able to maximize the impact of their limited enforcement resources. 
   Second, our legislation would permit the SEC to keep out of the securities business unscrupulous individuals from other sectors of the financial services industry. As I stated previously, persons with histories of violations too often roam freely throughout the financial services industry and commit new frauds. The bill would allow the SEC to prevent individuals who have ripped off consumers in insurance or banking scams from similarly defrauding America's small investors. 
   Third, our legislation will broaden the current penny stock bar to include fraudulent violations in the microcap markets. Under current law, the SEC can suspend or bar individuals who commit serious penny stock frauds involving stocks that cost less than $5. You may be surprised to learn, however, that the law permits such violators to participate in micro-cap securities offerings, because even though the total capitalization of these companies is small, each of their shares costs more than $5. Our bill will close this loophole by allowing the SEC to suspend or bar individuals who have committed serious penny stock fraud from participating in both the penny stock and micro-cap securities markets either as registered brokers or in related positions, such as promoters. 
   Fourth, our proposal will expand the statutory officer and director bar to include all publicly traded companies. Current law applies only to companies that report to the SEC, leaving the door open for violators to serve as officers or directors of all other companies. Our proposal would extend the bar to include all publicly traded businesses, including ``Pink Sheet'' or Over The 
   Counter (``OTC'') Bulletin Board companies, which are often the vehicles for micro-cap fraud schemes. 
   Finally, our bill will strengthen the SEC's ability to take enforcement actions against repeat violators. Currently, the SEC must request that the Justice Department initiate criminal contempt proceedings against individuals who violate SEC orders or court injunctions, which can be a very burdensome and timely process. Our legislation would allow the SEC to seek immediate civil penalties for repeat violators without the need to file criminal contempt proceedings. 
   Our Nation is blessed with the strongest and safest security markets in the world. This is a tribute to both the industry and its regulators. Unfortunately, as our markets bring benefits to more and more Americans, they also attract those who would exploit unsuspecting investors through manipulative practices. 
   By virtue of their small size and relative obscurity, microcap securities are the most susceptible to manipulation. By giving the SEC the tools it needs to combat this fraud, this legislation will benefit not only individual investors, but also the vast majority of legitimate small businesses who contribute so much to our Nation's growth and prosperity. 
   I urge my colleagues to join in supporting the Microcap Fraud Prevention Act of 1999.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the majority leader's amendment to the defense authorization bill. The amendment takes important steps to improve the monitoring of the export of advanced U.S. satellite technology and to strengthen security and counterintelligence measures at Department of Energy facilities. 
   As a Senator, I have been privy to a wide range of classified and unclassified information relating to efforts by the People's Republic of China to acquire our sensitive technology and influence our political process. As a United States citizen, I am gravely concerned. 
   As a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I learned during the campaign finance investigation ably lead by Chairman THOMPSON that China developed and implemented a plan to influence U.S. politicians and elections. And from Charlie Trie and John Huang, both of whom have recently plead to felony offenses and agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department, I suspect we could learn more. More recently, I reviewed the Cox report, and just yesterday, listened to testimony concerning the report during a hearing of the Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services. The evidence is clear that China stole very sensitive military secrets involving virtually all of our nuclear weapons. What is more, I believe that the lax security at our government labs is completely inexcusable as is the Clinton Administration's abject failure to take swift and strong action when it became aware of evidence of serious breaches in our national security. 
   This administration is faced now with the opportunity to focus the country on constructive solutions to our problems concerning espionage and undue foreign influence. I fear, however, that we will be mired for a long time to come in the details of what happened, because those who know will not tell. Instead of a swift accounting of what went wrong, I am afraid we can expect the stonewalling and lack of cooperation we received during the campaign finance inquiry. 
   Yet there are things Congress can do now to improve security at our national labs, and the majority leader's amendment is one of them. The Amendment increases the exchange of information between the Administration and the Congress and requires changes at the Departments of State, Energy, Defense as well as other intelligence agencies. These changes will help strengthen security checks, licensing procedures, and access to classified information. I am hopeful that these provisions will enhance the security and protection of our most vital technological secrets and ensure that if violations do occur, swift and decisive action is taken to correct them. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will give consumers important information many will want to factor into their decisions when they shop for a new vehicle. My legislation will ensure that consumers have the information they need to compare the pollution emissions of new vehicles. The Automobile Emissions Consumer Information Act of 1999 simply takes data already collected by the Environmental Protection Agency and requires that this information be presented to consumers in an understandable format as they purchase cars. This proposal, if enacted into law, will benefit both the consumer and the environment. 
   This measure is modeled after existing requirements for gas mileage information. It ensures that emissions information will be on the window stickers of new cars just as fuel efficiency information is currently displayed. Additionally, emissions information for all new vehicles will be published by the EPA in an easy-to-understand booklet for consumers. 
   This information is already collected by the EPA, but is disseminated in an extremely burdensome way. First, consumers must pro-actively request emissions information. Then, after securing the relevant EPA documents, the consumer is presented with an overload of complicated data in spreadsheet form. Furthermore, the EPA organizes emissions data by engine type and not by the more commonly compared model and make categories. 
   Let me refer to a page from the EPA's 1999 Annual Certification Test Results of emission standards. As my colleagues can see, it is an extraordinarily difficult document to read and interpret. The complicated nature of this document becomes increasingly apparent when this table is compared with the simplified information currently provided to consumers about fuel mileage. The federal government should be aiding consumers who want to consider emissions in choosing which vehicle to purchase. This bill will do just that. 
   Mr. President, this is not a new idea. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 mandated that the EPA make available to the public the data collected from manufacturers on emissions. The 1970 Amendments further required, ``Such results shall be described in such nontechnical manner as 
    will responsibly disclose to prospective ultimate purchasers of new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines the comparative performance of the vehicles and engines tested.'' Mr. President, clearly, the EPA is not abiding by the letter and spirit of the 1970 law. 
   It is important to note that the Automobile Emissions Consumer Information Act of 1999 does not require either motor vehicle manufacturers or the EPA to conduct new tests. Manufacturers must already test emissions of all new vehicles and submit the test results to the EPA. Unfortunately, the gathering of this information does not translate into useful information for consumers. 
   While all vehicles must meet the Federal standards, some vehicles exceed the standards. Consumers who are concerned about vehicle emissions deserve to be able to exercise their right to buy from manufacturers who take extra steps in reducing emissions, if they so chose. 
   Representative BRIAN BILBRAY of California is introducing this bill in the House of Representatives today. I greatly appreciate his leadership on this issue and his bringing this common-sense proposal to my attention. He is clearly committed to protecting both consumers and the environment.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, Senator COVERDELL and I are introducing two bills that will help teachers who spend their personal funds in order to improve their teaching skills and to provide quality learning materials for their students. I am going to discuss the first of those bills, the Teachers' Professional Development Act. 
   I am very pleased to be joined by my colleague from Georgia, Senator COVERDELL, in presenting this response to the critical need of our elementary and secondary schoolteachers for more professional development. 
   Other than involved parents, a well-qualified teacher is the most important element of student success. Educational researchers have repeatedly demonstrated the close relationship between well-qualified teachers and successful students. Moreover, teachers themselves understand how important professional development is to maintaining and expanding their level of competence. When I meet with Maine teachers, they tell me of their need for more professional development and the scarcity of financial support for this worthwhile pursuit. 
   In Maine, we have seen the results of a strong, sustained professional development program on student achievement in science and math. With support from the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of Education, the State of Maine, private foundations, the business community, and colleges in our State, the Maine Mathematics and Science Alliance established a statewide training program for teachers. The results have been outstanding. 
   While American students, overall, performed at the bottom of the Third International Science and Mathematics Study, Maine students outperformed the students of all but one of the 41 participating nations. The professional development available to Maine's science and math teachers undoubtedly played a critical role in this tremendous success story. Unfortunately, however, this level of support for professional development is the exception and not the rule. 
   The willingness of Maine's teachers to fund their own professional development activities has impressed me deeply. For example, an English teacher who serves as a member of my Educational Policy Advisory Committee told me of spending her own money to attend a curriculum conference. She then came back to her high school and shared the results of this curriculum conference with all the other teachers in her English department. She is typical of the many teachers throughout the United States who generously reach within their own pockets to pay for their own professional development to make them even better, even more effective at their jobs. 
   I firmly believe that we should encourage our educators to seek professional training, and that is the purpose of the legislation I am introducing today. The Collins-Coverdell legislation would help teachers to finance professional development by allowing them to deduct from their taxable income such expenses as conference fees, tuitions, books, supplies, and transportation associated with qualifying programs. Under the current law, teachers may only deduct these expenses if they exceed 2 percent of their income. My bill would eliminate this 2 percent floor and allow all of the professional development expenses to be deductible. 
   I greatly admire the many teachers who have voluntarily financed the additional education they need to improve their skills and to serve their students better. I hope that this legislation will encourage teachers to continue to take courses in the subject areas that they teach, to complete graduate degrees in either their subject area or in education, and to attend conferences to get new ideas for presenting course work in a challenging manner. This bill would reimburse our teachers for a very small part of what they invest in our children's future. This would be money well spent. 
   Investing in education is the surest way for us to build one of our most important assets for our country's future, and that is a well-educated population. We need to ensure that our nation's elementary and secondary school teachers are the best possible so that they can bring out the best in our students. Adopting this legislation would help us to accomplish this goal. 
   I urge my colleagues to support these efforts, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in assuring enactment of this legislation. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

    Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, food safety is a serious and growing public health concern. According to the General Accounting Office (GAO), as many as 81 million cases of foodborne illness and 9,000 related deaths occur in the U.S. every year. Most at risk are the very old, the very young, and the very ill. While these statistics refer to all cases of foodborne illness, recent outbreaks demonstrate that tainted imported foods have increased the incidence of illness and have exposed American consumers to new pathogens. 
   The volume of imported foods continues to grow, yet our current food import system is riddled with holes which allow unsafe food to penetrate our borders. Contaminated food imports have caused illnesses rarely seen in the United States and can be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for consumers to detect. 
   I first became interested in this issue when I learned that fruit from Mexico and Guatemala was associated with three multi-state outbreaks of foodborne illesses--one of hepatitis A and two of Cyclospora infection--that sickened thousands of Americans. These outbreaks included victims in my home State of Maine. 
   In my State's grocery stores, as in any typical American grocery store, the fresh fruit and vegetables that are available during the winter months come from many other countries. In many ways, imported food is a blessing for American consumers. Fruit and vegetables that would normally be unavailable in our local grocery stores during the winter months are now available all year long, making it easier and more enjoyable to eat the five servings of fruit and vegetables a day the National Cancer Institute recommends. But, it's only a blessing if the food is safe. Even one serving of tainted food can cause sickness and even death. 
   The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reports that the increasing importation of produce is a trend that is expected to continue. In 1996, the U.S. imported $7.2 billion worth of fruit and vegetables from at least 90 different countries, a dramatic increase from the 1990 level of $4.8 billion. Total food imports have increased from 1.1 million shipments in 1992 to 2.7 million in 1997. And, of all the fish and shellfish consumed in the U.S., more than half is imported. 
   Yet, the FDA annually inspects less than 2 percent of the 2.7 million shipments of food that arrive in the U.S. And of the small number of shipments that are inspected, only about a third are tested for some of the most significant pathogens. What's more, even when the FDA does catch contaminated food, the system often fails to dispose of it adequately. Indeed, according to one survey conducted by the Customs Service in 1997, as many as 70 percent of the imported food shipments the FDA ordered re-exported or destroyed may have ended up in U.S. commerce any way. Unscrupulous food importers can easily circumvent the inspection system. 
   Mr. President, to respond to these problems, I am introducing the Imported Food Safety Improvement Act, with Senator FRIST, Senator ABRAHAM, Senator COVERDELL, Senator JEFFORDS, and Senator SNOWE as original cosponsors. 
   Our legislation is an effort designed to strengthen the existing food import system to help ensure that unsafe food does not enter the United States. Our goal is to reduce the incidence of foodborne illnesses and to ensure that American families can enjoy a variety of foods year-round without the risk of illness when they sit down to the dinner table.  
   This legislation is the product of an extensive investigation by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair. During the 105th Congress, the Subcommittee undertook a 16-month, in-depth investigation into the safety of food imports. During five days of Subcommittee hearings, we heard testimony from 29 witnesses, including scientists, industry and consumer representatives, government officials, the General Accounting Office, and two persons with first-hand knowledge of the seamier side of the imported food industry, a convicted Customs broker and a convicted former FDA inspector. As a result of the compelling testimony that we heard, I have worked with my colleagues in drafting the legislation we introduce today--the Imported Food Safety Improvement Act--to address a broad array of problems uncovered during the Subcommittee's investigation. 
   My Subcommittee's investigation has revealed much about the food we import into this country and the government's flawed food safety net. Let me briefly recount some of our findings which make it clear why this legislation is so urgently needed: 
   In the worlds of the GAO, ``federal efforts to ensure the safety of imported food are inconsistent and unreliable.'' Federal agencies have not effectively targeted their resources on imported foods posing the greatest risks; 
   Weaknesses in FDA import controls, specifically the ability of importers to control the food shipments from the port to the point of distribution, makes the system vulnerable to fraud and deception; 
   The bonds required to be posted by importers who violate food safety laws are so low that they are considered by some unscrupulous importers at the cost of doing business; 
   Maintaining the food safety net for imported food is an increasingly complex task, made more complicated by previously unknown foodborne pathogens, like Cyclospora, that are difficult to detect; 
   Because some imported food can be contaminated by organisms that cannot be detected by visual inspection or laboratory tests, placing additional federal inspectors at ports-of-entry alone will not protect Americans from unsafe food imports; and 
   Since contamination of imported food can occur at many different places from the farm to the table, the ability to trace-back outbreaks of foodborne illnesses to the source of contamination is a complex process that requires a more coordinated effort among the federal, state, and local agencies as well as improved education for health care providers so that they can better recognize and treat foodborne illnesses. 
   The testimony that I heard during my Subcommittee's hearings was troubling. The United States Customs Service told us of one particularly egregious situation that I would like to share. It involves contaminated fish and illustrates the challenges facing federal regulators who are charged with ensuring the safety of our nation's food supply. 
   In 1996, federal inspectors along our border with Mexico opened a shipment of seafood destined for sales to restaurants in Los Angeles. The shipment was dangerously tainted with life-threatening contaminants, including botulism, Salmonella, and just plain filth. Much to the surprise of the inspectors, this shipment of frozen fish had been inspected before by federal authorities. Alarmingly, in fact, it had arrived at our border two years before, and had been rejected by the FDA as unfit for consumption. Its importers then held this rotten shipment for two years before attempting to bring it into the country again, by a different route. 
   The inspectors only narrowly prevented this poisoned fish from reaching American plates. And what happened to the importer who tried to sell this deadly food to American consumers? In effect, nothing. He was placed on probation and asked to perform 50 hours of community service. 
   I suppose we should be thankful that the perpetrators were caught and held responsible. After all, the unsafe food might have escaped detection and reached our tables. But it worries me that the importer essentially received a slap on the wrist. I believe that forfeiting the small amount of money currently required for the Custom's bond, which importers now consider no more than a ``cost of doing business,'' does little to deter unscrupulous importers from trying to slip tainted fish that is two years old past overworked Customs agents. 
   All too often, unscrupulous importers are never discovered. The General Accounting Office testified about a special operation known as Operation Bad Apple, conducted by Customs at the Port of San Francisco in 1997, identified 23 weaknesses in the controls over FDA-regulated imported food. For example, under current law, importers retain custody of their shipments from the time they arrive at the border. The importers must also put up a bond and agree to ``redeliver'' the shipment to Customs, for reexport or destruction, if ordered to do so or forfeit the bond. However, Operation Bad Apple revealed a very disturbing fact. Of the shipments found to violate U.S. standards, thereby requiring redelivery to Customs for destruction or re-export, a full 40 percent were never returned. The Customs Service believes an additional 30 percent of shipments that the FDA required to be returned contained good products that the importers had substituted for the original bad products. Customs further believes that the violative products were on their way to the marketplace. This means that a total of 70 
    percent of products ordered returned, because they were unsafe, presumably entered into U.S. commerce. 
   Weak import controls make our system all too easy to circumvent. After all, FDA only physically inspects about 17 of every 1,000 food shipments and, of the food inspected, only about a third is actually tested. That is why we have worked with the FDA, the Customs Service, and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to ensure that our legislation addresses many of the issues explored over the course of the Subcommittee's investigation and hearings. Let me describe what this bill is designed to accomplish. 
   Our legislation will fill the existing gaps in the food import system and provide the FDA with certain stronger authority to protect American consumers against tainted food imports. First and foremost, this bill gives the FDA the authority to stop such food from entering our country. This authority allows the FDA to deny the entry of imported food that has caused repeated outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, presents a reasonable probability of causing serious adverse health consequences, and is likely without systemic changes to cause disease again. 
   Second, this legislation includes the authority for the FDA to require secure storage of shipments offered by repeat offenders prior to their release into commerce, to prohibit the practice of ``port-shopping,'' and to mark boxes containing violative foods as ``U.S.--Refused Entry.'' This latter authority, which would allow the FDA to clearly mark boxes containing contaminated foods, is currently used with success by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and has been requested specifically by the FDA. Our bill also will require the destruction of certain imported foods that cannot be adequately reconditioned to ensure safety. Third, the legislation directs the FDA to develop criteria for use by private laboratories used to collect and analyze samples of food offered for import. This will ensure the integrity of the testing process. 
   Fourth, the bill will give ``teeth'' to the current food import system by establishing two strong deterrents--the threats of high bonds and of debarment--for unscrupulous importers who repeatedly violate U.S. law. No longer will the industry's ``bad actors'' be able to profit from endangering the health of American consumers. 
   Finally, our bill will authorize the CDC to award grants to state and local public health agencies to strengthen the public health infrastructure by updating essential items such as laboratory and electronic-reporting equipment. Grants will also be available for universities to develop new and improved tests to detect pathogens and for professional schools and professional societies to develop programs to increase the awareness of foodborne illness among healthcare providers and the public. 
   We believe the measures provided for in this legislation will help to curtail  the risks that unsafe food imports currently pose to our citizens, particularly our elderly, our children and our sick. I appreciate the advice and input we have received from scientists, industry and consumer groups, and the FDA, the CDC and the U.S. Customs Service in drafting this legislation. 
   We are truly fortunate that the American food supply is one of the safest in the world. But, our system for safeguarding our people from tainted food imports is flawed and poses needless risks of serious foodborne illnesses. I believe it is the responsibility of Congress to provide our federal agencies with the direction, authority, and resources necessary to keep unsafe food out of the United States and off American dinner tables.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would make a technical correction to a provision of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that is causing great unfairness to long-established home health agencies and their patients. It would provide for a special rule for long-existing home health agencies that have been classified as ``new'' home health agencies for purposes of the Interim Payment System (IPS) simply because they happened to change the ending date of their fiscal year, and, as a consequence, do not have a full 12-month cost reporting period in federal fiscal year 1994. 
   Under the complicated formula for the Medicare Interim Payment System for home health agencies, Medicare determines a limit for most established agencies using a formula that recognizes the agency's historical costs and blends them, in a proportion of 75 percent to 25 percent, with regional norms. For new home health agencies without a historic record of cost reports, the per-beneficiary limit is set at the national median. 
   In defining the difference between new and existing agencies, the Administration focused on fiscal year 1994 and established a general rule that the national median per-beneficiary limit would apply to ``new providers and providers without a 12-month reporting period ending in fiscal year 1994.'' Congress did, however, specifically exclude from the ``new'' category any home health agency that had changed its name or corporate structure. 
   Nevertheless, one of the home health agencies in my State --Hancock County HomeCare--has been classified as a ``new'' home health agency, even though it has been serving the people of rural Down East Maine for more than 60 years. I am sure that there are other long-standing home health agencies across the country that have found themselves in a similar situation as a consequence of this provision. 
   Hancock County HomeCare is a division of Blue Hill Memorial Hospital, a charitable, tax-exempt hospital. Hancock County HomeCare emerged as a result of a merger of the hospital with the Four Town Nursing Service and Bar Harbor Public Health Nursing, both non-profit home health agencies that have provided uninterrupted service to residents of Hancock County, Maine for more than 60 years. The unified agency, which provides skilled home nursing and therapies to residents of 36 towns, has been part of Blue Hill Memorial Hospital since 1981. 
   Despite its 60-year history of service to the community, Hancock County HomeCare has been classified as a ``new'' agency simply because it happened to change the ending date of its fiscal year during 1994, when Blue Hill Memorial and its affiliate changed theirs. Solely because it changed its fiscal year from a period ending June 30 to a period ending March 31, this 60-year old agency is being treated as a new agency by HCFA. Given the care taken by Congress to exclude name changes and corporate structure changes from the definition of a ``new'' agency, I simply do not believe that it was our intent to visit radically different treatment upon an agency that simply changed its financial reporting practices, but otherwise has a continuous history of operation and is fully able to provide 12 months of reliable data in accordance with Medicare cost reporting requirements. 
   I believe that the statute gives the Health Care Financing Administration sufficient discretion to deal with this situation administratively. Unfortunately, however, HCFA does not agree with that interpretation and insists that further legislative action is necessary if Hancock County HomeCare is to be considered an ``old'' agency for purposes of the Interim Payment System. 
   The legislation that I am introducing today to clarify the law was prepared with technical assistance from HCFA. Essentially, the bill would provide for a special rule for home care agencies that were in existence and had an active Medicare provider number prior to fiscal year 1980, but which had less than a 12-month cost reporting period in fiscal year 1994 because the agency changed the end date of its cost reporting period in that year. For these agencies, Medicare could, upon the request of the agency, use the agency's partial-year cost report from fiscal year 1994 to  determine the agency-specific portion of the per beneficiary limit. As a consequence, the agency could then be treated as an ``old'' agency for purposes of the Interim Payment System. 
   Mr. President, this legislation is simply a technical correction to address a specific problem that Congress clearly did not intend to create when it enacted the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The legislation is narrowly drafted and, in all likelihood, will not affect more than a few home health agencies, but it will make a critical difference in the ability of those agencies to continue to serve their elderly clients. 
   Home health agencies across the country, however, are experiencing acute financial problems due to other problems with a critically-flawed payment system that effectively penalizes our most cost-efficient agencies. These agencies are finding it increasingly difficult to cope with cash-flow problems, which inhibit their ability to deliver much-needed care. As many as twenty organizations in Maine have either closed or are no longer providing home care services because their reimbursement levels under Medicare fell so far short of their actual operating costs. Other agencies are laying off staff or are declining to accept new patients with more serious health problems. The real losers in this situation are our seniors, since cuts of this magnitude cannot be sustained without ultimately affecting patient care. 
   Moreover, these payment problems have been exacerbated by a number of new regulatory requirements imposed by HCFA, including the implementation of OASIS, sequential billing, medical review, and IPS overpayment recoupment. I will soon be introducing legislation to provide some relief for these beleaguered home health agencies and also plan to hold a hearing next month in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to examine the combined effect that these payment reductions coupled with the multiple new regulatory requirements have had on home health agencies' ability to meet their patients' needs.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, the Savings for Scholars Act, to help families  save for college expenses. This bill would make education IRAs and State tuition plans more effective vehicles for families to use in saving for postsecondary education. I want to thank Senator ROTH and his staff on the Finance Committee for working with me and my staff in drafting this legislation. In the 3 years that he has chaired the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH has been a true champion for all of us who place a tremendous value on educating our nation's children and young adults. 
   When Congress created the education IRA 2 years ago, we took an important first step in the direction of encouraging families to save for their children's education. But, the law contains a very significant limitation--families cannot contribute more than $500 a year to these accounts. This restriction makes it difficult for a family to accumulate savings sufficient to pay the cost of a college degree. Even if parents start saving from the time their child is born, an investment in an education IRA of $500 a year, assuming an average annual return of 8 percent, will only yield about $19,000 when that child begins higher education. Today, the average cost of 
   4 years of higher education is about $30,000 at a public institution and about $75,000 at a private school. In short, the current limits are not nearly high enough to finance even today's college costs, much less the cost 18 years from now. 
   Raising the maximum contribution to $2,000 will allow a family to accumulate at least as much as the current average cost of attending a private school. This is money that many middle-class families and their children otherwise would need to borrow; it is tens of thousands of dollars in student loans that would burden graduates with a mountain of debt. Most important, raising the education IRA contribution limit would make a 4-year college education more accessible and less of a financial challenge for middle-income families. 
   In addition to increasing the education IRA contribution limit, this bill would make a technical change to remove a confusing inconsistently between the education IRA and the traditional IRA. The last date on which a contribution to an education IRA can be made is December 31 of any year. Traditional IRAs may receive contributions until April 15 of the year following the tax year. This bill changes the deadline for contributions to education IRAs to coincide with that of the traditional IRA. This modest change would eliminate a source of confusion that might cause a family planning to contribute to a child's IRA to inadvertently miss the deadline. 
   The second part of my bill deals with qualified State tuition plans. These are tax-deferred plans, administered by the individual states, that allow families to prepay college tuition or to accumulate tax-deferred savings for postsecondary education expenses. My bill makes two changes in the requirements of these plans that should make them more flexible and useful to families. The first is to require that all qualified State tuition plans allow at least three rollovers without any change in beneficiary. This change would guarantee that participants in one state's plan can transfer their assets to another state's plan. The need for this could be the result of a family moving from one state to another or of a change in a child's education plans. My bill will give greater flexibility in the choice of postsecondary education institutions to the beneficiaries of these plans. 
   The bill also proposes one additional change to the qualified tuition programs--a change that will make the plans more attractive to families. Under current law, the assets of a plan can be rolled over to specified members of a beneficiary's family. This allows the plan's assets to be used by a sibling if the original beneficiary cannot or does not use the plan. However, the definition of a family member does not include first cousins. Thus, a parent of a single child could not transfer the benefits to a niece or nephew if his or her child did not use the plan. Perhaps more significantly, this change would make the qualified state tuition plan more desirable for grandparents. They could be assured that a plan established for the benefit of one grandchild could be transferred to any of their grandchildren. 
   The final part of this bill corrects an unfair consequence of the interaction between the HOPE tax credits and the education IRA. Currently, a taxpayer is prohibited from claiming the HOPE tax credit in any year in which a withdrawal from an education IRA is made--regardless of the total amount the taxpayer spends on education. This bill allows the HOPE tax credit to be claimed to the extent that the cost of education exceeds the amount withdrawn from the IRA. It does not allow a double benefit, but it does prevent one benefit--the IRA withdrawal--from canceling another benefit. It also eliminates a potential trap for the unwary taxpayer who may accidentally claim both benefits and, as a result, incur a penalty. 
   Mr. President, investing in education is the surest way for us to build our country's assets for the future. We need to ensure that postsecondary education is affordable and that graduates do not accumulate crippling debts while attending school. Adopting this bill will help us to accomplish both of these goals. I urge my colleagues to support these efforts.

   Ms. COLLINS. I thank the distinguished chairman for his patience in working this out. And I also thank the Senators from Vermont and New Jersey for agreeing to this arrangement. 
   Mr. President, I rise to support the provisions in the Hatch-Craig amendment requiring background checks at gun shows. I believe we have very carefully crafted provisions that strike the right balance. I support the requirement that sales of firearms at gun shows pass the muster of an instant background check. Gun shows are a popular mechanism for buying and selling guns, and these legitimate business transactions should be made with the knowledge that the sellers are selling their firearms to lawful purchasers. 
   What I opposed yesterday is something I will always oppose--and that is the creation of a Federal centralized recordkeeping system of gun owners. That would be a heavy regulatory burden that would seriously infringe on the privacy rights of millions of law-abiding American citizens who own guns. That is why I voted against the amendment offered by the Senator from New Jersey. 
   I would like to make one brief comment regarding gun shows. I am very concerned that the publicity surrounding this issue has created the false impression that gun shows are somehow gathering places for criminals, anarchists, and mercenaries. Nothing could be further from the truth. In reality, thousands of Americans go to gun shows every weekend in this country. People who attend these shows live in every State in the Union. They come from all walks of life. They share a common interest in a part-time hobby that is deeply ingrained in our American culture. Many are sportsmen or target shooters; many others are collectors who enjoy showing, buying and selling their antique firearms. 
   These are people who enjoy the tradition of responsible gun ownership in this country. This is a tradition--and a right--that we need to preserve. 
   Our gun laws should be directed at the illegal misuse of firearms, not the lawful ownership of guns by law-abiding citizens. The first step we should take is to address the concerns the Senator from Alabama will speak on shortly that gun laws are not being strictly enforced. The Senator from Alabama has documented an appalling drop in prosecutions of gun-related offenses, gun control laws under this administration. 
   That should be our first step. 
   Second, the Republican package puts together reasonable restrictions that will ensure that guns do not fall into the hands of criminals through the mechanism of a gun show. 
   I know the people who attend gun shows across America want to make sure they are selling to people who will use firearms in a responsible way that is the American tradition. 
   This legislation before us strikes the right balance, and I urge support of the amendment. I commend those who have worked on this to respond to the concerns we raised yesterday. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time to the chairman of the committee.

   Ms. COLLINS. Today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 2 p.m. There will be no rollcall votes during today's session of the Senate. Under the previous order, the Senate will begin consideration of S. 254, the juvenile justice bill, at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow. It is hoped significant progress will be made on that bill, and therefore Senators should expect votes after 2:15 p.m. during Tuesday's session of the Senate. I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, last Thursday, I introduced the Biomass Energy Equity Act of 1999. I was pleased to be joined by Senator BOXER, my colleague from California, as an original cosponsor. This legislation makes a common-sense change to the renewable energy production tax credit by expanding it to include additional types of biomass plants. I would like to take a few minutes now to discuss the need for this important bill and to describe what it would do. 
   Simply put, biomass energy production uses combustion to turn wood and organic waste into energy in an environmentally sound process. Biomass takes a public liability, organic waste, and converts it into a public asset, energy. 
   The renewable energy production tax credit enacted in 1992 provides incentives to the solid-fuel biomass and wind energy industry to develop economically viable and environmentally responsible renewable sources of electricity. In enacting that legislation, Congress recognized that biomass energy offers substantial environmental benefits, specifically a reduced dependence on oil and coal, a desirable alternative to open field burnings and the landfilling of organic material, and a net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. 
   Unfortunately, an error was made that nullified the potential societal benefits that incentives for biomass energy production offers. The 1992 act narrowly defined an eligible biomass facility as including only so-called closed-loop biomass facilities. Closed-loop biomass is a hypothetical form of electricity generation where the fuel is planted, grown, and harvested specifically and solely for the fuel of the power plant. Not only does this definition rule out the significant environmental benefit of disposal of organic waste otherwise destined for a landfill or to be field-burned, but also this scenario is not feasible and therefore remains unused. Since the biomass tax credit was passed, no taxpayer, not one, has taken advantage of the tax benefit. Simply put, the closed-loop tax credit is not a sufficient incentive to develop a costly ``fuel plantation,'' which entails large-scale land purchases, property taxes, and growing material for the sole purpose of burning it. By demanding that newly grown material be used rather than organic waste, the closed-loop biomass definition flies in the face of the commonly accepted environmental principle that products should be put to as many ``highest value'' uses as possible. 
   Mr. President, several states, including Maine, are deregulating their energy industries. Starting March 1, 2000, electricity consumers in Maine will be  able to shop for electricity as they now shop for long-distance telephone service. 
   While the specifics remain very much up in the air, the country is progressing toward restructuring electricity generation and distribution. While there are many clear economic benefits to a deregulated energy market, without incentives like the one I am proposing, green, renewable energy production like biomass is unlikely to be able to survive in deregulated market. 
   The legislation that I have introduced would expand the eligibility of the biomass tax credit to include conventional biomass plants. This legislation is designed to encourage a source of energy generation that offers substantial air quality, waste management, and greenhouse gas reduction benefits. The national biomass industry currently uses over 22,000,000 tons of wood waste a year. The waste the biomass industry converts into energy otherwise would be disposed of in one of three ways: burned in an open field, which generates pollution not energy; landfilled, where it fills limited landfill space and biodegrades, emitting methane, carbon dioxide, and other gases, or left in the woods or fields, increasing the risk and severity of forest fires. 
   The air quality benefits of biomass energy are of particular importance. According to the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, an organization of all the Northeastern States Air Quality Bureaus, biomass energy produces less nitrogen oxide than biomass alternatives, and furthermore, it generates virtually no sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, or mercury. Biomass energy production also results in a net reduction of greenhouse gases, as I have previously stated. 
   In addition to their environmental benefits, biomass plants contribute to the economy of many rural towns throughout America. Because of their dependence on organic waste, biomass facilities are usually located in rural areas where they are often important engines of economic growth. For example, in the small town of Sherman, ME, a biomass facility provides 56 percent of the property tax base. It also directly employs 23 individuals and indirectly provides work for hundreds of truck drivers, wood operators, mill workers and maintenance contractors. 
   In another small town of Maine, Athens, ME, a biomass facility provides a third of that small town's tax base and directly employs 20 people, while supporting a local wood operator who, in turn, employs 40 people. 
   The point is, the economy in many of the small towns in Maine, in towns such as Livermore, Ashland, Greenville, Fort Fairfield, Stratton and West Enfield benefit considerably from these biomass facilities. In total, there are over 100 biomass facilities in the United States, representing an investment in excess of $7 billion. These facilities contribute jobs, property taxes and a disposal point for waste products. In addition, rural biomass facilities also provide ash for use by local farmers, reducing their purchases of lime. I understand there is regularly more demand for the ash produced by these biomass plants than there is supply. 
   With biomass energy production, nothing is wasted. Biomass turns waste products--the byproducts of timber, paper or farming operations--into needed energy, wasting nothing. Even the ash is returned to the Earth to grow organic matter yielding both crops and waste to generate still more electricity. 
   We in Congress often discuss ways to help rural America. I know that is of great concern to the Presiding Officer. This proposal offers an opportunity to do so in a way that not only benefits the economy of small towns in rural America but also in a way that generates considerable environmental benefits that we all can enjoy. 
   This measure makes both economic and environmental sense. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation and working for its passage. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the resolution that the Senate just unanimously approved to designate May as the National Military Appreciation Month. 
   With troops in harm's way in Bosnia, in Serbia, in Haiti and the Persian Gulf, it is difficult to conceive of a more appropriate time for the Senate to have clearly put itself on record as supporting our brave men and women in uniform. 
   Regardless of how we may feel about these individual deployments, it is important that the American people send an unmistakable signal to our troops that we salute their bravery, their patriotism, their courage and their unparalleled skill as they carry out dangerous missions throughout the world. 
   I am proud to support our troops 100 percent, as they carry out their missions and the will of the Commander in Chief. 
   Mr. President, let us all join together today and every day to remember our troops throughout the world. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Homelessness Assistance Funding Fairness Act. I introduce this bill in conjunction with my House colleague, Congressman JOHN BALDACCI, who is sponsoring a companion bill in the House. Congressman BALDACCI and I have been working on issues involving the homeless for some time, in our attempt to devise an approach that will distribute federal funds more equitably and effectively. 
   Congress has taken important steps to begin to address the root causes of homelessness in America. Some of the most important are the Continuum of Care programs which provide grants that link neighborhood partnerships and community services with shelter. The goal of Continuum of Care programs is self-sufficiency for people who are homeless, an approach that goes well-beyond the ``band aid'' solutions of yesteryear which provided the homeless only a bed for the night. Continuum of Care programs support treatment and counseling programs in conjunction with shelter, recognizing the hard reality that many homeless people must overcome serious substance abuse, addiction, and mental health problems before a life of permanent housing and stability is possible. 
   Under the leadership of VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman BOND, Congress has recognized the great importance of Continuum of Care programs, and has risen to the challenge to provide this broad spectrum of care by appropriating $975 million last year for homeless assistance grants, a large portion of which are Continuum of Care grants. 
   Although the strategy behind the Continuum of Care grant programs has been saluted for its logic, the Department of Housing and Urban Development's administration of the competitive award process that allocates this funding has not been similarly celebrated. 
   The unfortunate experience of the State of Maine last year is illustrative of the problems in the distribution of funding. Maine submitted two Continuum of Care grant applications in 1998, one to address the needs of the City of Portland, and another to serve the needs of much of the remainder of the state. 
   In December 1998, HUD announced the Continuum of Care grant recipients and Maine was shocked to learn the State would receive no funding through the grant process. After some investigation, my office determined that the scores for both the Maine applications were within two points of a passing grade. Nevertheless, Continuum of Care HUD homeless assistance funding distributed to Maine went from $3.7 million to zero, despite the fact that in 1998 Secretary Cuomo had awarded programs which received funding through the Continuum of Care program the ``best practices'' award of excellence. 
   Following a vigorous public campaign by Maine residents, and the repeated intervention of Maine's congressional delegation, HUD provided a small portion of the original request to the City of Portland outside the competitive process. The money, though welcomed, was far from enough to allow Portland to meet the needs of its homeless population. 
   The human cost of this bureaucratic determination is immense. In light of the ongoing needs of the homeless in Maine, as well the often harsh weather conditions in our region of the country, HUD's decision was particularly troubling. 
   The experience of the state of Maine has convinced me not only of the critical need for funding of these projects, but also of the need to re-evaluate the process for distributing these funds. No state should be wholly shut out of the funding award process, because it is an unfortunate reality that all states have homeless people with significant needs. 
   In response to the unfortunate experience of the State of Maine last year, the legislation I am proposing specifically directs the Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide a minimum percentage of Continuum of Care competitive grant funding to each state. This will create a safety net for the homeless of each state, without ending the competitive process that recognizes programs of special merit or need. My legislation also directs HUD to distribute this funding to a state's priority programs should the state only receive this mandatory minimum. 
   This legislation is not only driven by basic questions of fairness to all states, but by the significant and often forgotten needs of homeless people living in rural America. 
   The problem of homelessness is often mischaracterized as an exclusive problem of urban areas. However, homelessness in Maine, and in many rural communities across our country, is a large and growing problem. From 1993 to 1996, Maine experienced an increase in its 
   homeless population of almost 20%--it is estimated that more than 14,000 people are homeless in my home state today. In a state of only 1.2 million people, this is a troubling percentage of the population. 
   A recent article in the Christian Science Monitor perhaps said it best: ``If the urban homeless are faceless and nameless..... then the rural homeless are practically invisible.'' However, Mr. President, that does not mean they do not exist. Unlike homeless individuals in urban areas who are seen on busy streets everyday, rural individuals living in poverty often subsist in relative isolation. 
   The 27,000 Maine households with incomes of less than $6,000 annually teeter on a shadowy brink where income cannot guarantee shelter. When fortune turns sour, it is these families who find themselves without decent shelter. When substance abuse or mental illness afflicts the parents, the likelihood of homelessness escalates. Indeed, in Maine, 24 percent of visitors to Maine homeless shelters are families with children. 
   The problem of providing services to homeless people is compounded by many challenges. In some areas of Maine, geographic isolation is the most critical obstacle to receipt of services; in others, rising housing costs makes obtaining housing exceedingly difficult for the marginally employed. Both these circumstances are compounded by the significant substance abuse and mental health problems prevalent among the homeless population in Maine as in all areas of the country.  
   I am proud to say that the people of Maine have developed many innovative programs to assist our homeless population. Through programs like the Bangor Area Homeless Shelter, which fills the immediate needs of outreach, shelter and counseling to area homeless, and more long term programs like Shalom House, which provides services and shelter for the mentally ill, the Preble Street Resource Center, which provides job training, social services and medical care among its many services, and the YWCA, which provides programs to assist teen age moms, Mainers have worked hard to reach out and assist those in need and to provide effective care and outreach for Maine's homeless people. 
   I recently had the opportunity to visit with the staff and clients of a shelter in Alfred, Maine, that is making a real difference in the lives of homeless men and women. As one man who has battled both severe alcoholism and mental illness told me, ``The people at this shelter saved my life. Without their help, I'd be dead on the street. But now, I can see a future for myself.'' Significantly, 90 percent of the homeless people served by this York County Shelter face serious problems with substance abuse or mental illness. 
   These programs, and others like them, depend on federal funding, and its unexpected loss last year has left my state scrambling to make up for this serious shortfall. I hope you will join me in supporting this legislation that will prevent other states from facing this same misfortune. All states deserve at least a minimum percentage of homeless funding available through the Continuum of Care grants, because no state has yet solved the problems faced by its homeless men, women and children.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of a Joint Resolution to reauthorize the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. I am proud to give my support to this measure and do so without hesitation because the New England Dairy Compact is a proven success that is critical to the survival of dairy farmers in Maine and New England. 
   First approved by Congress in the 1996 Farm Bill, the New England Dairy Compact already has a proven track record of quantifiable benefits to both consumers and farmers. The Compact works by simply evening out the peaks and valleys in fluid milk prices, providing stability to the cost of milk and ensuring a supply of fresh, wholesome, local milk. 
   Over the past eight months, in particular, the Compact has proven its worth. As prices climbed and farmers were receiving a sustainable price for milk, the Compact turned off, when prices dropped, the Compact was again triggered. The Compact simply softened and slowed the blow to farmers of an abrupt and dramatic drop in the volatile fluid milk market. 
   It is important to reiterate that consumers also benefit from the Compact. Not only does the Compact stabilize prices, thus avoiding dramatic fluctuation in the retail cost of milk, it also guarantees that the consumer is assured the availability of a supply of fresh, local milk. We've known for a long time that dairy products are an important part of a healthy diet, but recent studies are proving that dairy products provide a host of new nutritional benefits. Just as we are learning of the tremendous health benefits of dairy foods, however, milk consumption, especially among young people, is dropping. It is a crucial, common-sense, first step to reverse this trend, for milk to be available and consistently affordable for young families. 
   Finally, the Compact, while providing clear benefits to dairy producers and consumers in the Northeast, has proven it does not harm farmers or taxpayers from outside the region. A 1998 report by the Office of Management and Budget showed that, during the first six-months of the Compact, it did not adversely impact farmers from outside the Compact region and added no federal costs to nutrition programs. In fact, this legislation specifically excepts the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program from any costs related to the Compact. 
   I would like to thank the Senators from Vermont for their leadership on this critical issue. I look forward to working with them to see this important resolution passed.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Inspector General Act Amendments of 1999. I am very pleased to be joined by my colleagues, Senators ROTH, GRASSLEY, and BOND, who have demonstrated unparalleled leadership on IG issues in the Senate. Indeed, Senator ROTH is one of the architects of the inspector general law, having advocated its creation in 1978 and, in 1982, having introduced legislation that created IGs in the Departments of Defense, Justice, and the Treasury. In such distinguished company, I am confident that my legislation hits the mark of improving an already invaluable program. 
   As chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, one of my top priorities since coming to the Senate has been the seemingly never-ending fight against waste, fraud, and abuse. We have all heard the horror stories of $500 hammers and roads built to nowhere. The waste of scarce Federal resources not only picks the pockets of taxpayers, but also places severe financial pressures on already overburdened programs, in some cases forcing cutbacks in the delivery of vital Government services. 
   Over the past 2 years in my capacity as the subcommittee's chairman, I have seen disturbing fraud and waste firsthand in a wide variety of programs. Last year, for example, the subcommittee held several hearings to shine a spotlight on the massive fraud in the Medicare Program. To cite just one example of the subcommittee's findings, our investigation revealed that the Federal Government had been sending Medicare checks to 14 fraudulent health care companies. These companies provided absolutely no services to our senior citizens at all. Indeed, the address listed by one such company did not even exist, and if it had existed, it would have been located in the middle of the runway of the Miami International Airport. 
   The fraud we uncovered was stunning. It costs taxpayers millions of dollars each year, diverting scarce resources from the elderly and legitimate health care providers in a program already under enormous financial strain. 
   The Medicare fraud investigation and others like it were undertaken by my subcommittee working hand in hand with the inspectors general for a variety of Federal agencies. The inspectors general are charged with identifying and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in Federal programs administered by the agencies they monitor. 
   Last year marked the 20th anniversary of the IG Act, the law that Congress passed to create these guardians of the public purse. As we recognize this important milestone, it is important for Congress to take a close look at the IG system. We must build on its strengths and remedy its weaknesses. 
   Over the past 21 years, the inspector general community has grown from 12 in 1978 to 58 inspectors general today. Offices of Inspectors General receive more than a billion dollars in annual funding and employ over 12,000 auditors, criminal investigators, and support personnel. Each Office of Inspector General shoulders tremendous responsibilities and is given considerable power to uncover waste, fraud, and abuse within Federal programs. 
   By and large, the IG community has performed in an outstanding manner. IGs have made thousands of recommendations to Congress, ultimately saving taxpayers billions of dollars. Inspectors general have conducted investigations that have resulted in the recovery of hundreds of millions of dollars from companies and individuals who have defrauded the Federal Government. 
   The inspectors general have a demonstrated record of success over the past 20 years. But as with all Government entities, we must ensure that the IG community is as well-managed, accountable, and effective as possible. IGs are public watchdogs, but they, too, must be watched. With these principles in mind and drawing on my extensive work with the inspectors general over the past 2 years, I am today introducing legislation to improve the 
   accountability, independence, and efficiency of the inspectors general program. 
   The legislation I am introducing is designed to increase the accountability of inspectors general while retaining and, in some aspects, strengthening the provisions in law that guarantee their independence from the agencies they oversee. 
   My bill establishes a renewable 9-year term of office for each of the inspectors general who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Currently, Presidential IGs serve for an indeterminate term. 
   The IG community has testified that having a fixed term of office would provide them with the assurances they need to be able to perform their vital but, in some cases, unpopular oversight responsibilities in a more independent environment. 
   The 9-year term also would enhance IG autonomy because it would extend beyond two Presidential administrations. 
   There has been considerable turnover in some of the IG positions, and the establishment of a fixed term would also encourage inspectors general to serve for longer periods of time, thus, adding experience to the IG community. Finally, by providing a defined term of service, an appropriate framework is provided for the evaluation of the performance of each IG to determine if re-appointment is warranted. Thus, Mr. President, the 9-year term I am proposing would both enhance the independence of the IGs while improving their accountability. 
   My legislation also takes steps to streamline the IG offices themselves, making them more efficient and flexible, by consolidating existing offices and by reducing the frequency with which IGs must prepare and file resource-intensive reports. 
   Some of the IGs' offices that exist today are very small, with just a handful of employees. They could be made more efficient and effective by transferring their functions to larger IG offices that oversee similar programs. 
   For example, my legislation consolidates the current stand-alone office of the Federal Labor Relations Authority IG, which has just one employee, into the Office of Personnel Management, thus eliminating unnecessary overhead and bureaucracy but continuing the vital audit and oversight capacity of both agencies. In total, three existing small IGs' offices would be consolidated into the IG offices of major departments and two smaller IG offices would be consolidated into one office. 
   Currently, Mr. President, the Offices of Inspectors General are required by law to provide semiannual reports to Congress. To increase the value of these reports, I am reducing this requirement to a single annual report and streamlining the information presented. In this way, Congress can focus on high-risk areas before they get worse and before the problems become more difficult to solve. 
   Mr. President, the inspectors general have made very valuable contributions to the efficient operation of the Federal Government. Their record, however, is not without blemish. For example, the community's record was tarnished by the activities of the inspector general at the Department of Treasury. After an extensive investigation, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found this particular IG violated Federal contract laws in her award of two noncompetitive, sole source contracts. 
   These actions not only wasted thousands of dollars but also shook the confidence of Congress, the agency, and the public in the IG's ability to operate with the highest degree of integrity. It was extremely disturbing to find that this inspector general was herself guilty of wasting resources and abusing the public trust. At the conclusion of our investigation, one could not help but wonder, who is watching the watchdogs? 
   Let me emphasize, Mr. President, that in my view, problems like the ones we uncovered in the Treasury Department are very unusual. They are not characteristic of the IG community. They are not widespread. However, because the inspectors general are the very officials in the Government responsible for combating waste, fraud, and abuse, they should be held  to the very highest ethical standards. Even one example of impropriety is cause for concern. 
   To increase accountability, my legislation requires independent external reviews of each IG office every 3 years. It gives each office the flexibility to choose the most efficient method of review, but it does require that the watchdogs themselves submit to oversight by a qualified third party. This provision is intended to help ensure public confidence in the management and the efficiency of the IG offices and will provide valuable guidance to Congress in fulfilling our oversight responsibilities. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that the National Commission on the Separation of Powers has endorsed my recommendation that such an independent, external review be conducted of each IG office. The Commission is a bipartisan committee sponsored by the Miller Center for Public Affairs at the University of Virginia, and includes among its members former Senator Howard Baker, former White House Counsel Lloyd Cutler, former U.S. Attorney William Barr, former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, and former Director of Central Intelligence William Webster. I am very proud that my proposal has been endorsed by such an esteemed organization. 
   Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today represents a major step toward improving the effectiveness, the independence, and the accountability of the inspectors general program. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to strengthen and improve the inspectors general program as we approach the next century. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of the Education Flexibility Partnership Act to speak in support of the conference report on this important legislation designed to improve the quality of our children's education. 
   This is a straightforward, bipartisan proposal with no budgetary impact. It is endorsed by the governors of all fifty states. It will give to every state the flexibility that twelve states have had for the last five years--flexibility that will allow states and communities to pursue innovative efforts for the improvement of K-12 education. We should approve the conference report and take an important first step toward returning the control of education to our states and local communities. 
   Opponents of education flexibility claim that it reduces the accountability of the states and will divert federal funds away from programs that support low-income children. These arguments simply have no validity because of the safeguards we have written into the act. To be eligible to participate in Ed-Flex, a state must have made significant progress toward developing and implementing challenging standards for education content and performance for all of its students. Moreover, an Ed-Flex waiver can not exceed five years unless the Secretary of Education determines the waiver has been effective in assisting schools in implementing education reforms. 
   It is not accountability that Ed-Flex eliminates; what Ed-Flex does away with is the direct federal control of local decisionmaking. The objectives of federal education funding remain the same--improve the performance of all students and all schools. Ed-Flex encourages and supports the states and local school districts in developing innovative new approaches to education reform and improvement. The intent of existing education programs is preserved while the administrative burden on the states and local communities is lessened. States and communities will be allowed to tailor these programs to fit local needs and conditions. In short, the legislation we are now considering recognizes that the people closest to our schools--our school board members, teachers, principals, and parents--are the best able to craft reforms that respond to local needs. 
   As pleased as I am to support this conference report, I am very disappointed that it has eliminated the Senate's provision that would have afforded local schools the choice of using the funds appropriated for class-size reduction to pay for special education. Contrast the progressive objectives of the Ed-Flex bill with this decision. Some members insisted on placing new federal requirements on local schools through a new categorical program at the same time we are moving toward more local control through this bill. We need to move away from this ``Washington knows best'' approach. 
   I am a strong supporter of public education and believe that the federal government should increase its support for our schools. It should realize this goal first by meeting its commitment to pay the federal share of special education, not by creating new Washington-driven programs. If we meet our obligation to pay forty percent of the cost of special education, millions of dollars of local education dollars will become available for the needs of education in every state and in every school district. These are dollars that can be spent on more teachers--or on school construction, drop-out prevention, after school programs, or on any other need a local school establishes as its priorities. 
   Clearly, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act is only the starting point. We need to go much further in cutting the federal red tape that binds our local schools and hinders their ability to respond to the needs of their students. Giving schools greater flexibility must be a major priority as we proceed with the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I plan to take another step in the direction of less federal control by introducing a bill to give small, rural schools greater flexibility in the way they use federal education funding. 
   The federal government must help our local schools to improve their performance. But control and management from Washington are not what is needed. Extending the option of Ed-Flex to every state eases the federal hold on our local schools. I urge my colleagues to approve the conference report that is before us today and to move forward in supporting more local decision-making as we reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act later in this Congress.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, recently I introduced S. 684, the Fishermen's Bankruptcy Protection Act, a bill to provide family fishermen with the same protections and terms as those granted family farmers under Chapter 12 of our bankruptcy laws. I would like to take this opportunity to explain this legislation to my colleagues in anticipation of the Senate's upcoming debate on bankruptcy legislation. 
   Like many Americans, I'm appalled by those who live beyond their means, and use the bankruptcy code as a tool to cure their self-induced financial ills. I have supported and will continue to support reasonable reforms to the bankruptcy code that ensure the responsible use of its provisions. All consumers bear the burden of irresponsible debtors who abuse the system. Therefore, I believe bankruptcy should remain a tool of last resort for those in severe financial distress. 
   As those familiar with the bankruptcy code know, however, business reorganization in bankruptcy is a different creature than the forgiveness of debt traditionally associated with bankruptcy. Reorganization embodies the hope that by providing a business some relief, and allowing debt to be adjusted, the business will have an opportunity to get back on sound financial footing and thrive. In that vein, Chapter 12 was added to the bankruptcy code in 1986 by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. GRASSLEY, to provide for bankruptcy reorganization of the family farm and to give family farmers a fighting chance to reorganize their debts and keep their land. 
   To provide the fighting chance envisioned by the authors of Chapter 12, Congress provided a distinctive set of rules to govern effective reorganization of the family farm. In essence, Chapter 12 was a recognition of the unique situation of family-owned businesses and the enormous value of the family farmer to the American economy and to our cultural heritage. 
   Chapter 12 was modeled on bankruptcy Chapter 13 which governs the reorganization of individual debt. However, to address the unique problems encountered by farmers, Chapter 12 provided for significant advantages over the standard Chapter 13 filer. These advantages include a longer period of time to file a plan for relief, greater flexibility for the debtor to modify the debts secured by their assets, and the alteration of the statutory time limit to repay secured debts. The Chapter 12 debtor is also given the freedom to sell off parts of his or her property as part of a reorganization plan. 
   Unlike Chapter 13 which applies solely to individuals, Chapter 12 can apply to individuals, partnerships or corporations which fall under a $1.5 million debt threshold--a recognition of the common use of incorporation even among small family-held farms. 
   Chapter 12 has been an enormous success in the farm community. According to a recent University of Iowa study, 74 percent of family farmers who filed Chapter 12 bankruptcy are still farming, and 61 percent of farmers who went through Chapter 12 believe the law was helpful in getting them back on their feet. 
   Recognizing its effectiveness, my bill proposes that Chapter 12 should be made a permanent part of the bankruptcy code, and equally important, my legislation would extend Chapter 12's protections to family fishermen.  
   In my own state of Maine, fishing is a vital part of our economy and our way of life. The commercial fishing industry is made up of proud and fiercely independent individuals whose goal is simply to preserve their business, family income, and community. My legislation would afford fishermen the same protection of business reorganization as is provided to family farmers. 
   There are many similarities between the family farmer and the family fisherman. Like the family farmer, the fisherman should not only be valued as a businessman, but also for his or her contributions to our way of life and our economy. Like farmers, fishermen face perennial threats from nature and the elements, as well as laws and regulations which unfortunately threaten their existence. Like family farmers, fishermen are not seeking special treatment or a hand-out from the federal government, they seek only the fighting chance to remain afloat so that they can continue in their way of life. 
   Although fishermen do not seek any special treatment from the government, they play a special role in seafaring communities on our coasts, and they deserve protections granted others who face similar, often unavoidable, problems. Fishermen should not be denied the bankruptcy protections accorded to farmers solely because they harvest the sea and not the land. 
   I have proposed not only to make Chapter 12 a permanent part of the bankruptcy code, but also to apply its provisions to the family fisherman. The bill I have proposed mirrors Chapter 12 with very few exceptions. Its protections are restricted to those fishermen with regular income who have total debt less than $1.5 million, the bulk of which, eighty percent, must stem from commercial fishing. Moreover, families must rely on fishing income for these provisions to apply. 
   These same protections and flexibility we grant to farmers should also be granted to the family fisherman. By making this modest but important change to the bankruptcy laws, we will express our respect for the business of fishing, and our shared wish that this unique way of life--that embodies the state of Maine--should continue. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.

   Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, first, I commend the leadership of my good friend from Georgia in taking the initiative in this area. It is typical of his leadership on so many issues. I am very pleased to join him today on the Senate floor. 
   I rise today as a cosponsor of the Uniformed Services Filing Fairness Act of 1999 introduced by my good friend, Senator COVERDELL, and as a supporter of H.R. 1376, which we will vote on shortly. 
   These measures are intended to demonstrate concretely and clearly our support for the men and women serving our country in the region of Yugoslavia by providing them with tax relief on their hazardous duty pay, excise tax exemptions on their long-distance telephone calls, and an extension to allow them to file their tax returns after the April 15 deadline. 
   Today is tax day, a day when millions of Americans rush to their local Post Offices to mail their tax returns. However, today some brave Americans find themselves thousands of miles away from their hometowns engaged in a conflict rather than concerned with a tax filing deadline. Today and every day, our troops put their lives on the line. The sacrifices they make in serving our Nation both here at home and abroad prompt our gratitude. For those forces stationed overseas, the toll is especially great. Our troops now serving in the operations in Kosovo face tremendous burdens in trying to carry out their missions while protecting themselves and their comrades. Our service men and women abroad face the additional hardships and stress of being separated from their loved ones, their families, their homes, and their friends. These troops deserve the opportunity to concentrate on their dangerous mission without having to worry about government paperwork at home. 
   This legislation is an opportunity to demonstrate our support for our troops by our actions, not just with our words. My thoughts and my prayers are with those brave men and women and their families here at home. I urge my colleagues to support this modest but important measure. Again, I commend the Senator from Georgia for his leadership. 
   I yield the floor.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator TORRICELLI and myself, I am pleased to introduce today the Area Code Conservation Act. This legislation is designed to spare American businesses and households the expense and inconvenience of unnecessary changes in their area codes. 
   Mr. President, our current system for allocating numbers to local telephone companies is woefully inefficient. It leads to the exhaustion of an area code long before all the telephone numbers covered by that code are actually in use. My legislation will take steps to stop this wasteful practice and to bring some measure of sanity to our system of allocating telephone numbers. 
   When area codes were first introduced in 1947, 86 area codes covered all of North America. During the three-year period beginning on January 1, 1998, it is estimated that we will add 90 new area codes in the United States alone. In short, Mr. President, in only three years, we will add more codes than were originally required to cover the entire continent. And there does not seem to be an end in sight. 
   To the extent that additional area codes are needed to bring new telecommunications services to existing users or existing services to new users, they are a price we must pay. To the extent they are the result of inefficient practices, however, they are a price we must avoid. Unfortunately, the latter is far too frequently the case, as I shall explain. 
   The problem addressed by my legislation stems from a very simple fact. When a new carrier wishes to provide competitive telephone service in a community, it must obtain at least one central office code. Because it contains its own unique three-digit prefix within an area code, each central office code--and herein lies the crux of the problem--includes 10,000 telephone numbers. Thus, even if a telephone carrier expects to serve only five hundred customers in the community, it will exhaust 10,000 phone numbers in the process. And the ultimate effect of this occurring on a repeated basis is to exhaust all of the numbers in the area code, thereby requiring that a new area code be created. 
   Let me illustrate this further. Let's assume that a town of 12,000 households, each with one telephone line, is served by a single telephone carrier. The carrier will be able to meet the demand with only two central office codes and still have about 8,000 numbers for new customers. Assume further that three new competitors enter the market, which would be a welcome development and one that the 1996 Telecommunications Act was enacted to promote. Since central office codes are not shared by carriers, each new competitor would need its own code consisting of 10,000 telephone numbers. As you can see when you do the math, we would go from exhausting 20,000 numbers to exhausting 50,000 numbers to serve our town of just 12,000 households. 
   My own home state of Maine dramatically reflects the problem inherent in the current system. With a population of about 1.2 million people, we have 5.7 million unused telephone numbers out of the roughly 8 million usable  numbers in our area code 207. However, more than 3 million of the unused numbers are within central office codes that have already been assigned, making them unavailable for other carriers. Thus, despite the fact that more than 70% of the telephone numbers in the 207 area code are not in use, Maine has been notified by the 
   North American Numbering Plan Administrator that it will be forced to create a new area code by the Spring of the year 2000. 
   As one Maine commentator noted, even if every moose in Maine had a telephone number, we would still have plenty of numbers left over. Yet, we are told we will soon need another area code, something that probably make as much sense to our moose as to our people. 
   Mr. President, this paradigm of inefficiency in the midst of America's telecommunications revolution might almost be amusing were it not for the fact that it causes real hardships for many small businesses. With its great beauty, the Maine coast relies heavily on tourism for its economic health. We have heard from businesspeople throughout our coastal communities--a gallery owner in Rockport, an innkeeper in Bar Harbor, and a schooner captain in Rockland--who are among those who are rightly concerned about the cost of updating brochures, business cards, and other promotional literature, all of which will be necessitated by having a new area code. And as the innkeeper also told my office, it takes as long as 2 years to revise some guide books, the biggest source of information for many of his guests. Changing the area code could therefore lead to a significant loss of business and unneeded expenses for these small businesses. 
   Along with the economic cost, new area codes create tremendous disruption and confusion for consumers. With geographically split area codes, States, counties, and cities are split apart, creating new territorial boundaries that only serve to divide citizens. With overlay area codes, even more confusion can result. Just imagine having to dial up a different area code in order to order a pizza from a delivery service just down the street. 
   The legislation I am introducing today will resolve these problems and bring common sense to the process of allocating telephone numbers. The Area Code Conservation Act will set a date certain by which the Federal Communications Commission must develop a plan for the efficient allocation of telephone numbers. Consistent with the provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the plan must include measures to ensure that telephone numbers will be portable when customers change carriers and that unassigned numbers in a central office code will not be the exclusive property of a single carrier. 
   The Area Code Conservation Act would also give decision-making authority to the States, where officials know the best policies to promote competition while minimizing costs and confusion to businesses and consumers. Specifically, the Act would authorize State public utility commissions to implement area code conservation measures while the FCC is developing its plan and, I would hope, before a new area code is needlessly forced on the State. These conservation measures could include minimum fill rates for central office codes, mandatory 1,000-block pooling, individual number pooling, and interim unassigned number porting. 
   The legislation would also allow State commissions to require the return of unused or underused central office codes to the numbering administrator. 
   In developing this legislation, I received valuable assistance and technical advice from the Maine Public Utilities Commission. I have every confidence in the ability of the Maine PUC and, indeed, State commissions throughout this country to develop the best policy in this area. 
   The people of Maine welcome technological change and accept that it may come with a price. They are prepared to pay for innovation and progress, but they object--indeed, they should object--when they are asked to pay for inefficiency. When one looks behind its technical subject matter, this bill is about nothing more complicated than stopping a form of government waste. Such waste should not be tolerated by Members of this body, whether they come from States like Maine with a single area code or from States with cities already divided into different area codes. 
   I urge my colleagues to support my efforts to bring an end to this inefficiency and the unnecessary cost and inconvenience it will impose on our citizens, particularly our small businesses.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of Senator GREGG and myself to offer a Sense of the Senate Amendment to reaffirm the commitment of the United States government to make good on the promise it made in 1975 to fund special education and to reject the President's efforts to undermine this commitment. 
   When Congress passed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1975, the federal government promised states and local school districts that Washington would help them meet the cost of educating students with special needs. The federal government pledged to pay 40 percent of the average cost of providing elementary and secondary education for each student receiving special education. Unfortunately, the federal government has failed to meet this obligation, creating an unfunded mandate that must be borne by every state and community in America. 
   Due to the efforts of Senator GREGG and others, we are making progress. The appropriation for Fiscal Year 1999 contained a 13 percent increase in special education funding. As the Table behind me shows, the Budget Resolution before the Senate increases funding for K-12 education by $27.5 billion more than the President's budget over the next five years. This includes an increase of $2.5 billion dollars for special education over the next five years. 
   We must not retreat from our commitment to fund special education, as the President's budget proposes to do. This Sense of the Senate resolution will make clear that we reject the President's flat funding of special education grants to the states. Instead, it expresses the Senate's intention to fulfill the pledge made years ago. 
   What would this mean for our states and local school districts? Let's take my home State of Maine as an example. In the 1997-1998 school year, the total cost of special education was $189 million dollars. The Individuals with Disabilities Act promised Maine $2,318 per student receiving special education services, but the federal government only sent the states slightly more than $535 per student--which means that Maine received $57 million dollars less than what had been promised. 
   For the current school year, the increased appropriation for special education brings the federal payment to $638 per student but still leaves a shortfall that exceeds $55 million. The President's budget proposal for fiscal year 2000, however, reverses this progress and allows the federal shortfall in Maine alone to grow to almost $59 million. According the U.S. Department of Education, the unmet mandate will reach over $11 billion 
   nationally. We can not continue to shift this burden to our local communities. We must meet the federal commitment to help pay for special education and end this unfunded mandate. 
   I want to quote briefly from a letter I received last week from the Governor of Maine. In the letter, Governor Angus King describes the consequence of this mandate on Maine's communities.  
   The costs of special education (in Maine) ..... continue to grow dramatically, at nearly twice the rate of increase in overall education spending. The federal mandate to provide all children with a free and appropriate education is being met, but the rising costs of special education are borne by local property taxpayers. The fiscal pain of meeting this mandate is dividing our communities around an issue on which we should be united--helping every child meet this or her full potential, without regard to disability.  
   In Maine, meeting this mandate accounts for millions of dollars annually, dollars that otherwise could be used for school construction, teacher salaries, new computers, or any other state effort to improve the performance of our students. 
   We need to increase federal spending on education, but we do not need new federal categorical programs with more federal regulations and dollars wasted on administrative costs. Rather we need to meet our commitment to bear our fair share of special education costs. As Governor King told President Clinton several weeks ago, ``If you want to do something for schools in Maine, then fund special education and we can hire our own teachers and build our own schools.'' This is true for every state. The best thing this Congress can do for education is to move toward fully funding, the federal government's share of special education--not standing in place as the President's budget would have us do.  
   I urge my colleagues to support this commitment to give our states and local communities the financial help they have been promised and so desperately need. Let's finally keep the promise made more than 20 years ago.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr President, I rise to offer a Sense of the Senate amendment to express the commitment of the Senate to expand needs-based Federal student aid programs. I am joined in this effort by Senators JEFFORDS, REED, DODD, KENNEDY, and LIEBERMAN.  
   I am pleased by the large increase in funding for education included in the Budget Resolution and thank Senator DOMENICI and the other members of the Budget Committee for taking a forward-looking stance in favor of our children. I am offering this amendment to help ensure that as these increased funds for education are appropriated--and as the ``hard decisions'' are made about appropriations for specific programs--need-based student financial aid programs are given priority. 
    Although the federal government cannot guarantee that every American will complete a postsecondary education program, we can ensure that every qualified American has an equal opportunity to do so. This is the primary purpose of the student financial aid programs authorized by the Higher Education Act. 
   The evidence is overwhelming that individuals from low-income families pursue higher education at a significantly lower rate than individuals from middle- and upper-income families. This educational gap, which is rooted in economic disparity, threatens to divide our nation into two self-perpetuating classes: an educated class that participates fully in the tremendous economic opportunities that demand a postsecondary education and a class of ``have nots'' lacking the skills and education needed to be successful members of the modern work force. 
   Congress created need-based student financial aid programs to ensure that individuals from low-income families are not denied postsecondary education because they cannot afford it. These are the programs that assist the most disadvantaged Americans. They are the programs that help the students who come from families with no history of pursuing postsecondary education. They are the programs that will close the gap between educational ``haves'' and the ``have nots'' 
   Federal Pell Grants are the cornerstone of our country's need-based financial aid. These grants provide essential financial assistance to almost 4 million students a year. Eighty percent of the dependent students receiving Pell Grants come from families with annual family incomes of less than $30,000. Yet, over the last 20 years, while the cost of postsecondary education has grown at an unprecedented rate, the maximum Pell Grant has declined in constant dollars by 14 percent. This Sense of the Senate amendment states that we should increase the maximum Pell Grant 
   by $400 dollars to $3525. We still will not be back to the 1980 level in terms of purchasing power, but we will be getting closer. 
   This amendment also urges an increase in two other important grant programs. The Federal Supplementary Educational Opportunity Grant and the Leveraged Educational Assistance Program (formerly SSIG) are grant programs managed by schools and states respectively. These programs leverage federal dollars through matching funds from schools and states and provide additional assistance for those students most in need of financial aid. 
   In addition to these important educational grants, my amendment calls  for increased funding for two other need-based programs that assist students from low income families: the Federal Work Study Program and the Perkins Loan Program. These are campus-based programs in which the federal contribution is leveraged by matching funds from participating schools. Work Study is a self-help student aid program under which needy students pay some of the cost of their education through jobs that contribute to their education and often involve important community service. The Perkins Loan program allows schools to make low-interest loans to needy students. Both of these programs, along with the Supplementary Educational Opportunity Grants, give financial aid offices flexibility in creating individualized student aid packages that will minimize the student's debt burden upon graduation. 
   Unfortunately, during the last 20 years, funding for the work study program had declined by 25 percent in constant dollars and the capital contribution to Perkins Loans has declined by 78 percent. This Sense of the Senate Amendment expresses our support for these important programs, which aid our neediest students. 
   Providing financial aid is only one aspect of the challenge to equalize education opportunity. Before financial aid can help, a potential student must aspire to higher education. This is one of the goals of the TRIO programs. There is no question that thousands of individuals who would never have considered a college education have been identified by Talent Search and Upward Bound and gone on to college and successful careers. Thousands of other individuals have been assisted while in college by the Academic Support Services Program, while many non-traditional students have entered college because of the Educational Opportunity Centers. 
   Despite this strong record of success, the existing TRIO programs reach only a very small percentage of the individuals who are eligible for their services. The additional funds that this Sense of the Senate Amendments urges will extend the reach of these programs to more disadvantaged youth and adults who could so benefit from the support the TRIO programs provide. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so that more of our citizens can pursue the American dream of college education.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to start by commending the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee for his outstanding work in producing this budget. He has been such a leader in fiscal responsibility. Once again he has done an outstanding job in crafting this budget resolution. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the amendment offered by my friend and colleague from Michigan, Senator ABRAHAM. This amendment would preserve and protect Social Security. I also commend Senator DOMENICI for his very innovative work in crafting this very important amendment. 
   President Clinton has proposed devoting 62 percent of the surplus over the next 15 years to shoring up Social Security. On the surface, that sounds good. After all, we are all committed to protecting Social Security. But let's take a closer look at the President's proposal. 
   On closer examination, the President's plan is nothing but a shell game. First, he devotes to the Social Security trust fund trust fund payroll taxes that already belong to Social Security. Then he lends this money to the Federal Government for new programs. The bottom line is that instead of preserving the money for Social Security, President Clinton actually ends up spending $158 billion of Social Security's money for programs completely unrelated to Social Security. Both the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office have pointed out the double counting and the other significant flaws in the President's proposal. 
   Social Security is currently running a surplus because the program is taking in more in payroll taxes than it is paying out in benefits. But, as the Presiding Officer well knows, this will not always be the case. 
   In 2013, payroll taxes will not be sufficient to pay benefits and the Social Security program will either have to raise taxes, cut spending, go further into debt, or use more general fund money, if we are to continue to meet our full obligation to Social Security beneficiaries. By the year 2030, the trust fund will be completely exhausted if we do not take steps to save the program. We certainly, given this dire picture, cannot afford to squander the Social Security surpluses by spending them on other programs. 
   The current Social Security surplus conceals the true picture of our national budget. But for the temporary Social Security surplus, the Federal Government would actually be running a $6 billion deficit this year. I want to repeat that. There is a lot of misunderstanding. A lot of people think that we actually have a surplus in this upcoming year. The fact is, the surplus is due entirely to the surplus in the Social Security trust fund. If we take out the Social Security surplus, we would in fact be running a $6 billion deficit. 
   The fact is, there is no real surplus in fiscal year 2000. We do not start to see real surpluses in the rest of the Government programs until the fiscal year 2001. 
   The amendment that I have cosponsored, which is before us today, expresses the sense of the Senate that we pass legislation that would lock in Social Security surpluses by mandating that trust fund dollars could be spent only for the payment of Social Security benefits for Social Security reform or to pay down our national debt. Under this lockbox proposal, Social Security funds could not be spent on non-Social Security programs. They also could not be used to finance tax cuts. 
   This legislation would establish in law a declining limit on the level of debt held by the public. These limits would decline in 2-year intervals by an amount equal to the Social Security trust fund surpluses for those years. Under this proposal, trust fund balances could be used to retire the debt, but not for new spending on programs unrelated to Social Security. The result of this innovative program is that public debt would decline by $417 billion. That is 32 percent more than it would under the President's proposal. 
   Mr. President, in 1998 alone, the Federal Government spent nearly $162 billion to make interest payments on our national debt. That amounts to more than 6.7 percent of total Federal spending. In passing this important legislation, we would free up this money that otherwise would have to be spent on interest payments on our national debt. 
   This amendment clearly affirms our commitment to preserving and protecting Social Security. It safeguards the Social Security trust fund from spending raids. It reduces our public debt. It lowers our interest payments. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this very important initiative. 
   Once again, I commend the Senator from Michigan, Mr. ABRAHAM, and the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. DOMENICI, for their innovative approach in coming up with a program that will truly protect our Social Security surpluses. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to offer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to give the Senate the opportunity to express its clear commitment to ensuring that Federal gasoline tax revenues in fiscal year 2000 be distributed to the 50 States in accordance with the formula in the 1998 highway bill, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century--or TEA-21 bill, as it is frequently called. 
   Mr. President, let me explain the action that has prompted my amendment and my concern. President Clinton's fiscal year 2000 budget contains a proposal which essentially changes the gas tax rules in the middle of the game. The President would distribute approximately $1 billion in higher-than-expected Federal gas tax revenues to a variety of transportation projects, rather than following the formula in the current law. Instead of distributing these extra moneys to the States, as required by the 1998 highway bill, enacted only 9 months ago, the President would divert these funds to other projects. 
   To be precise, section 1105 of last year's highway bill expressly provides that any additional Federal gas tax revenues above the levels envisioned in the act should be distributed to 50 States under the highway bill's formulas. These funds are extremely important to the States. They support a variety of important transportation programs authorized by the TEA-21 bill. 
   It now appears that the Federal Government will receive roughly $1.5 billion in extra Federal gasoline tax revenues next year. The President, however, proposes to take $1 billion of these extra revenues and spend them on a variety of Federal transportation programs, contravening current Federal law. 
   Mr. President, if the full $1.5 billion were allocated to the States under existing law, the State of Maine would receive roughly $7 million in much needed additional highway funds in fiscal year 2000. Under the President's proposal, however, which diverts $1 billion of these gasoline tax funds, the State of Maine would receive only $3.4 million in extra highway funds. This is a reduction of more than 50 percent in the funds that would otherwise be allocated to the State of Maine. 
   In short, if President Clinton's proposal were implemented, the State of Maine would lose approximately $3.6 million in critically needed Federal highway funds next year. The President's plan is unfair to Maine, it is unfair to the other States, and it should not be implemented. It changes course midstream in a way that harms our States' ability to meet their transportation needs. States should be able to rely on the Federal Government to abide by the commitment that it made only last May.

Thick ice, in some cases up to ten inches thick, encased virtually every inch of the state and decimated our electric infrastructure. As a result of the Herculean efforts of hundreds of utility crews, power was restored to Maine after 17 long days. Like other Americans who have suffered natural disasters, Mainers need this assistance to recover from the costs incurred from the devastating blow nature dealt us.

    Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to make reorganization under Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code applicable to family fishermen. In brief, the bill would allow family fishermen the opportunity to apply for the protections of reorganization in bankruptcy and provide to them the same protections and terms as those granted the family farmer who enters bankruptcy. 
   Like many Americans, I'm appalled by those who live beyond their means, and use the bankruptcy code as a tool to cure their self-induced financial ills. I have supported and will continue to support alterations to the bankruptcy code that ensure the responsible use of its provisions. All consumers bear the burden of irresponsible debtors who abuse the system. Therefore, I believe bankruptcy should remain a tool of last resort for those in severe financial distress. 
   As those familiar with the bankruptcy code know, business reorganization in bankruptcy is a different creature than the forgiveness of debt traditionally associated with bankruptcy. Reorganization embodies the hope that by providing business a break from creditors, and allowing debt to be adjusted, the business will have an opportunity to get back on sound financial footing and thrive. In that vein, Chapter 12 was added to the bankruptcy code in 1986 by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. GRASSLEY, to provide for bankruptcy reorganization of the family farm and to give family farmers a ``fighting chance to reorganize their debts and keep their land''. 
   To provide the ``fighting chance'' envisioned by the authors of Chapter 12, Congress provided a distinctive set of substantive and procedural rules to govern effective reorganization of the family farm. In essence, Chapter 12 was a recognition of the unique situation of family owned businesses and the enormous value of the family farmer to the American economy and our cultural heritage. 
   Chapter 12 was modeled on bankruptcy Chapter 13 which governs the reorganization of individual debt. However, to address the unique problems encountered by farmers, Chapter 12 provided for significant advantages over the standard Chapter 13 filer. These advantages include a longer period of time to file a plan for relief, greater flexibility for the debtor to modify the debts secured by their assets, and alteration of the statutory time limit to repay secured debts. The Chapter 12 debtor is also given the freedom to sell off parts of his or her property as part of a reorganization plan. 
   Unlike Chapter 13, which applies solely to individuals, Chapter 12 can  apply to individuals, partnerships or corporations which fall under a $1.5 million debt threshold--a recognition of the common use of incorporation even among small family held farms. 
   Without getting too technical, I should also mention that Chapter 12 also contains 
   significant advantages over corporate reorganization which is governed by Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. For example, Chapter 12 creditors generally may not challenge a payment plan that is approved by the Court. 
   Chapter 12 has been considered an enormous success in the farm community. According to a recent University of Iowa study, 74 percent of family farmers who filed Chapter 12 bankruptcy are still farming, and 61 percent of farmers who went through Chapter 12 believe that Chapter 12 was helpful in getting them back on their feet. 
   Recognizing its effectiveness, my bill proposes that Chapter 12 should be made a permanent part of the bankruptcy code, and equally important, my bill would extend Chapter 12's protections to family fishermen. 
   In my own state of Maine, fishing is a vital part of our economy and our way of life. The commercial fishing industry is made up of proud and fiercely independent individuals whose goal is simply to preserve their business, family income and community. 
   In my opinion, for too long the fishing industry has been treated like an oddity, rather than a business through which courses the life's blood of families and communities. This bill attempts to bridge that gap and afford fishermen the protection of business reorganization as it is provided to family farmers. 
   There are many similarities between the family farmer and the family fisherman. Like the family farmer, the fisherman should not only be respected as a businessman, but for his or her independence in the best tradition of our democracy. Like farmers, fishermen face perennial threats from nature and the elements, as well as changes to laws which threaten their existence. Like family farmers, fishermen are not seeking special treatment or a hand-out from the federal government, they seek only ``the fighting chance'' to remain afloat so that they can continue in their way of life. 
   Although fishermen do not seek special treatment from the government, they play a special role in seafaring communities on our coasts, and they deserve protections granted others who face similar, often unavoidable, problems. Fishermen should not be denied the bankruptcy protections accorded to farmers solely because they harvest the sea and not the land. 
   I have proposed not only to make Chapter 12 a permanent part of the bankruptcy code, but also to apply its provisions to the family fisherman. The bill I have proposed mirrors Chapter 12 with very few exceptions. Its protections are restricted to those fishermen with regular income who have total debt less than $1.5 Million, the bulk of which, eighty percent, must stem from commercial fishing. Moreover, families must rely on fishing income for these provisions to apply. 
   Those same protections and flexibility we grant to farmers should also be granted to the family fisherman. By making this modest but important change to the bankruptcy code, we will express our respect for the business of fishing, and our shared wish that this unique way of life should continue.

    Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining my colleague from West Virginia, Senator ROCKEFELLER, in introducing the Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act, which is intended to improve the way we care for people at the end of their lives. 
   Noted health economist Uwe Reinhardt once observed that ``Americans are the only people on earth who believe that death is negotiable.'' Advancements in medicine, public health, and technology have enabled more and more of us to live longer and healthier lives. However, when medical treatment can no longer promise a continuation of life, patients and their families should not have to fear that the process of dying will be marked by preventable pain, avoidable distress, or care that is inconsistent with their values or wishes. 
   The fact is, dying is a universal experience, and it is time to re-examine how we approach death and dying and how we care for people at the end of their lives. Clearly, there is more that we can do to relieve suffering, respect personal choice and dignity, and provide opportunities for people to find meaning and comfort at life's conclusion. 
   Unfortunately, most Medicare patients and their physicians do not currently discuss death or routinely make advance plans for end-of-life care. As a result, about one-fourth of Medicare funds are now spent on care at the end of life that is geared toward expensive, high-technology interventions and ``rescue'' care. While most Americans say they would prefer to die at home, studies show that almost 80 percent die in institutions where they may be in pain, and where they are subjected to high-tech treatments that merely prolong suffering. 
   Moreover, according to a Dartmouth study conducted by Dr. Jack Wennberg, where a patient lives has a direct impact on how that patient dies. The study found that the amount of medical treatment Americans receive in their final months varies tremendously in the different parts of the country, and it concluded that the determination of whether or not an older patient dies in the hospital probably has more to do with the supply of hospital beds than the patient's needs or preference. 
   The Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act is intended to help us improve the way our health care system serves patients at the end of their lives. Among other provisions, the bill makes a number of changes to the Patient Self-Determination Act of 1990 to facilitate appropriate discussions and individual autonomy in making difficult discussions about end-of-life care. For instance, the legislation requires that every Medicare beneficiary receiving care in a hospital or nursing facility be given the opportunity to discuss end-of-life care and the preparation of an advanced directive with an appropriately trained professional within the institution. The legislation also requires that if a patient has an advanced directive, it must be displayed in a prominent place in the medical record so that all the doctors and nurses can clearly see it. 
   The legislation will expand access to effective and appropriate pain medications for Medicare beneficiaries at the end of their lives. Severe pain, including breakthrough pain that defies usual methods of pain control, is one of the most debilitating aspects of terminal illness. However, the only pain medication currently covered by Medicare in an outpatient setting is that which is administered by a portable pump. 
   It is widely recognized among physicians treating patients with cancer and other life-threatening diseases that self-administered pain medications, including oral drugs and transdermal patches, offer alternatives that are equally effective in controlling pain, more comfortable for the patient, and much less costly than the pump. Therefore, the Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act would expand Medicare to cover self-administered pain medications prescribed for the relief of chronic pain in life-threatening diseases or conditions. 
   In addition, the legislation authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to study end-of-life issues for Medicare and Medicaid patients and also to develop demonstration projects to develop models for end-of-life care for Medicare beneficiaries who do not qualify for the hospice benefit, but who still have chronic debilitating and ultimately fatal illnesses. Currently, in order for a Medicare beneficiary to qualify for the hospice benefit, a physician must document that the person has a life expectancy of six months or less. With some conditions--like congestive heart failure--it is difficult to project life expectancy with any certainty. However, these patients still need hospice-like services, including advance planning, support services, symptom management, and other services that are not currently available. 
   Finally, the legislation establishes a telephone hotline to provide consumer information and advice concerning advance directives, end-of-life issues and medical decision making and directs the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research to develop a research agenda for the development of quality measures for end-of-life care. In this regard,  Senator ROCKEFELLER and I are particularly appreciative that Senator BILL FRIST has incorporated our recommendation that end-of-life healthcare be added as a priority population in the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research's overall mission and duties in the bipartisan legislation he introduced last week to reauthorize the Agency. 
   The legislation we are introducing today is particularly important in light of the current debate on physician-assisted suicide. The desire for assisted suicide is generally driven by concerns about the quality of care for the terminally ill; by the fear of prolonged pain, loss of dignity and emotional strain on family members. Such worries would recede and support for assisted suicide would evaporate if better palliative care and more effective pain management were widely available. 
   Mr. President, patients and their families should be able to trust that the care they receive at the end of their lives is not only of high quality, but also that it respects their desires for peace, autonomy and dignity. The Advanced Planning and Compassionate Care Act that Senator ROCKEFELLER and I are introducing today will give us some of the tools that we need to improve care of the dying in this country, and I urge all of my colleagues to join us as cosponsors.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, diabetes is a serious and potentially life-threatening disease affecting more than 16 million Americans at a cost of more than $105 billion annually. Moreover, since 3 million elderly Medicare beneficiaries have been diagnosed with diabetes, and another 3 million are likely to have the disease but not know it, nowhere is the economic impact of diabetes felt more strongly than in the Medicare Program. 
   Treating these seniors for the often devastating complications associated with diabetes accounts for more than one-quarter of all Medicare expenditures. Therefore, helping diabetic seniors avoid the complications of their disease will not only improve the quality of their lives but also help reduce the economic burden that diabetes places on Medicare. While there is no known cure, diabetes is largely a treatable disease. Many people who have diabetes can often lead relatively normal, active lives as long as they stick to a proper diet, carefully monitor the amount of sugar or glucose in their blood and take their medication, which may or may not include insulin. 
   However, if these people with diabetes are unable to follow or do not follow this regimen, they put themselves at risk of blindness, loss of limbs and have an increased chance of heart disease, kidney failure and stroke. Therefore, preventive services for people with diabetes has the potential to save a great deal of money that would otherwise go for hospitalizations or acute care costs--not to mention a great deal of unnecessary pain and suffering. 
   Congress recently took a number of important steps to improve Medicare coverage of preventive care for diabetics. Prior to the enactment of the balanced budget amendment in 1997, Medicare covered diabetics' self-maintenance education services in inpatient or hospital-based settings and in limited outpatient settings, specifically hospital outpatient departments or rural health clinics. Medicare did not, however, cover education services if they were given in any other outpatient setting, such as a doctor's office. Moreover, while Medicare did cover the cost of blood-testing strips used to monitor the sugar in the blood, the program did so for only Type I diabetics who require insulin to control their disease. 
   The balanced budget amendment of 1997 rightly expanded Medicare to cover all outpatient self-management training services as well as providing uniform coverage of blood-testing strips for all persons with diabetes. With the enactment of the balanced budget amendment, we made significant progress toward improving care for our senior citizens with diabetes. However, there is more that we can do. 
   External insulin infusion pumps have proven to be much more effective in controlling blood glucose levels than conventional therapy injection therapy for insulin-dependent diabetics whose blood sugar levels are difficult to control. Such pumps help them to avoid the expensive complications and suffering resulting from uncontrolled diabetes. However, Medicare currently does not cover these pumps, even when they have been prescribed as medically necessary by a patient's physician. 
   I am, therefore, pleased to introduce today legislation, the Medicare Insulin Pump Coverage Act of 1999, that would expand Medicare coverage to include insulin infusion pumps for certain Type I diabetics. 
   External insulin pumps are neither investigational nor experimental. They are widely accepted by health care professionals involved in treating parties with diabetes. Moreover, studies such as the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial sponsored by the National Institutes of Health have established that maintaining blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible is the key to preventing devastating complications from this disease. For many patients, the use of an infusion pump is the only way that optimal blood glucose control can be safely achieved. That is why virtually all other third  party payers--including many State Medicaid Programs and CHAMPUS--cover the device. Moreover, there is precedent in Medicare since it currently does cover infusion pumps for numerous cancer drugs, as well as for pain control medications. 
   The need for this legislation became apparent to me based 
   on my attempts to help one of my constituents, Nona Frederich of Raymond, ME. She is an example of the Medicare patient who would benefit from the pump but who is currently being denied what is for her the most effective form of glucose control. Nona has been an insulin-dependent diabetic since 1962. Because of her extremely volatile insulin sensitivity, her diabetic specialists placed her on an insulin infusion pump in January 1982. Until she reached the age of 65, the cost of the pump and operating supplies were underwritten in large part by her insurer. 
   In March of 1995 it became necessary for Nona to purchase a new infusion pump. However, by this time, she was now on Medicare and Medicare refused to cover it, even though her doctor had prescribed it as clearly being medically necessary. With the help of my Portland office, the Frederichs worked their way through the Health Care Financing Administration system of appeals. Unfortunately, in January of last year, they received final notification of a negative decision. Their only remaining option is to file a civil suit which they are simply not in a position to pursue. 
   The Frederichs literally have notebooks filled with documentation of the procedures they followed and the evidence they submitted. Moreover, they personally paid close to $5,000 in original pump costs and supplies for which they received no reimbursement. For a Medicare beneficiary with a limited income, these kinds of costs would be devastating and would place the pump--the medically necessary pump--completely out of reach. In such a case, they would be forced to return to or to continue with conventional insulin therapy which simply just may not be as effective in controlling blood sugar. As a consequence, these patients are admitted to the hospital over and over again, and Medicare now picks up the bill--a far greater bill than if Medicare had simply paid for the pump in the first place. 
   While potentially devastating for an individual, the financial costs to Medicare of expanding coverage to include the insulin infusion pump will not be great. Under my bill, the pump would have to be prescribed by a physician and the beneficiary would have to be a Type I diabetic experiencing severe swings of high and low blood glucose levels. Of the estimated 3 million Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes, only about 5 percent are Type I, or insulin dependent; of these, it is estimated that the pump would be appropriate for only about 4 percent. Mr. President, what a difference it would make for those individuals. 
   The American Diabetes Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Association of Diabetes Educators, as well as officials at the Centers for Disease Control, all have advocated expanding Medicare to cover insulin infusion pumps for Type I diabetics who otherwise would have great difficulty in controlling their blood sugars. 
   I am pleased to introduce legislation today to do just that. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of this important legislation, legislation that would not cost much money but would enrich the lives of those diabetics who need these pumps immeasurably.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and again commend Senator FRIST, chief sponsor of this legislation, and the chairman of the committee. I am pleased to join with them in this effort. 
   Mr. President, the question before us is simple. This is not a question of who is for better schools; this is not a question of who is for putting more Federal resources in education; because both Democrats and Republicans alike share those two goals. The question before us is whom do you trust to make education decisions? Should education decisions be decided in Washington? Should every Federal dollar be attached to a string? Or should we trust the people at the local level--our school board members, our teachers, our parents, to make the best decisions for the students in local schools? To me, the answer is clear. We should increase the Federal commitment to education, but empower local school boards, teachers and parents to make the best decisions in keeping with the needs of their communities. That is the question before us. 
   The second question before us is, Is the Government, is Congress, going to keep its promise with regard to funding special education? I say the answer to that should be yes. Let's keep the promise that was made more than 20 years ago when Congress passed the legislation mandating special ed. Let's keep our promise. Let's fully fund that important program before creating a whole lot of new categorical grant programs with strings attached. That is the debate. 
   Everyone here is for better schools, better teachers, but that is not the issue.

   Mr. President, let's get on with the task before us. The Educational Flexibility Partnership Act is a straightforward bill. It is a bipartisan proposal. It has been endorsed by the Governors of all 50 States. It will make a positive difference in the lives of students throughout this Nation. It will give to every State the flexibility that 12 States have had for the past 5 years--flexibility that will allow our States and our local schools to pursue innovative efforts to improve K-through-12 education. We should invoke cloture and take this important step toward improving our schools. 
   In support of the need for this legislation, let me cite one example from my home State of Maine. Maine is one of the 38 States that are currently not eligible for Ed-Flex waivers. When Maine examined its educational system several years ago, the State found out that its schools had made significant progress in improving the achievement of Maine's students in K through 8. But in Maine, as in most of America, student achievement in secondary schools lagged far behind. Maine's schools simply were not sustaining the progress of the early years all the way until graduation. To the Maine commissioner of education, to local school boards, and to teachers and parents throughout the State, the need for change was clear. Maine needed to focus its efforts on improving secondary education; therefore, the commissioner of education applied to the 
   Federal Secretary of Education for waivers from Federal requirements in order to use Federal education funding to address the true needs facing our State. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, the Federal Department of Education did not share the conclusions of Maine's local educators; it resisted Maine's request for a waiver. 
   Eventually, the waivers were indeed granted, but only after a lengthy battle between Maine and the Washington education bureaucracy. Time, effort, resources, and money were needlessly wasted. This should not have occurred. Passing the Education Flexibility Partnership Act will prevent other States from enduring the same frustration and delay that Maine experienced. It will allow us to use education dollars to address real needs and not the priorities set in Washington, DC. 
   I thank the Chair and the sponsor of the bill.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the amendment offered by Senator JEFFORDS. The amendment would require the federal government to make good on its commitment to fund special education before it made any additional promises it might not keep. 
   When Congress passed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1975, the federal government made a commitment to the states and to the local school districts to help states meet the cost of special education. The federal government promised to pay each state 40 percent of the national average per capita cost of providing elementary and secondary education for each student receiving special education. For the school year 1996-1997, the national average expenditure was $5,913 per student. The federal payment to the states, however, was only $636 per student or slightly more than ten percent of the total cost and about one fourth of the $2,365 promised. 
   We must meet our commitment to special education and end this unfunded mandate. Maine is promised $80 million by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Yet, in 1998, it received less than $20 million toward the $200 million federal law requires the state to spend on special education. In short, special education is an unfunded federal mandate of $60 million that must be met by the citizens of Maine through already burdensome state income and local property taxes. This accounts for millions of dollars annually that can not be used for school construction, for teacher salaries, for new computers, or for any other state effort to improve the performance of our elementary and secondary school students. 
   We need to increase federal spending on education, but we do not need new federal categorical programs with more federal regulations and dollars wasted on administrative costs. Rather, we need to meet our commitment to bear our fair share of special education costs. As the Governor of Maine told President Clinton last week, ``If you want to do something for schools in Maine, then fund special education and we can hire our own teachers and build our own schools.'' This is true for every state. The best thing this Congress can do for education is to fully fund our share of special education and at the same time return control of the schools to the states and local communities by passing the Education Flexibility Act. 
   These two actions will empower our states and communities to meet the challenge of improving schools. Instead of presuming that we in Washington know what is best for every school across the country, let us acknowledge that each of our individual states and towns knows what is needed on a state-by-state and community-by-community basis. I urge my colleagues to give our states and local communities the financial support they have been promised and the freedom to educate our students as they see fit. We can do this by adopting this amendment to fully fund the federal share of special education and then passing the Local Control of Education Act.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining my colleague from Alaska, Senator MURKOWSKI, in introducing the Graduate Medical Education Technical Amendments Act of 1999, which is intended to address some of the problems that small family practice residency programs in Maine and elsewhere are experiencing as a result of provisions in the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 that were intended to control the growth in Medicare graduate medical education spending. 
   Of specific concern are the provisions in the BBA that cap the total number of residents in a program at the level included in the 1996 Medicare cost reports. Congress' goal in reforming Medicare's graduate medical education program was to slow down our nation's overall production of physicians, while still protecting the training of physicians who are in short supply and needed to meet local and national health care demands. While the BBA's provisions will indeed curb growth in the overall physician supply, they do so indiscriminately and are thwarting efforts in Maine and elsewhere to increase the supply of primary care physicians in underserved rural areas. 
   Because Maine has only one medical school--the University of New England, which trains osteopathic physicians--we depend on a number of small family practice residency programs to introduce physicians to the practice opportunities in the state. Most of the graduates of these residency programs go on to establish practices in Maine, many in rural and underserved areas of the state. The new caps on residency slots included in the BBA penalize these programs in a number of ways. 
   For instance, the current cap is based on the number of interns and residents who were ``in the hospital'' in FY 1996. Having a cap that is institution-specific rather than program-specific has caused several problems. For example, the Maine-Dartmouth Family Practice Residency Program had two residents out on leave in 1996--one on sick leave for chemotherapy treatments and one on maternity leave. Therefore, the program's cap was reduced by two, because it was based on the number of actual residents in the hospital in 1996 as opposed to the number of residents in the program. 
   Moreover, residents in this program have spent one to two months training in obstetrics at Dartmouth's Mary Hitchcock's Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire. Because the cap is based on a hospital's cost report, these residents are counted toward Dartmouth Medical School's cap instead of the Maine-Dartmouth Family Practice Residency Program's. Last  year, the Maine program was informed that Dartmouth would be cutting back the amount of time their residents are there. But the Maine-Dartmouth Family Practice Residency Program has no way of recouping the resident count from them in order to have the funds to support obstetrical training for their residents elsewhere. 
   Moreover, the cap does not include residents who continue to be part of the residency program, but who have been sent outside of the hospital for training. This penalizes all primary care specialties, but especially family medicine, where ambulatory training has historically been the hallmark of the specialty. This is particularly ironic since other specialty programs that now begin training in settings outside the hospital will, under the new rules, have those costs included in their Medicare graduate medical education funding. 
   All told, the Maine Dartmouth Family Practice Residency Program will see its graduate medical education funding reduced by over half a million dollars a year as a result of the cap established by the BBA. 
   The example I have just used is from Maine, but the problems created by the BBA's graduate medical education changes are national in scope. It has created disproportionately harmful effects on family practice residencies from Maine to Alaska. A recent survey of all family practice residency program directors has found that: 
   56 percent of respondents who were in the process of developing new rural training sites have indicated that they will either not implement those plans or are unsure about their sponsoring institutions' continued support. 
   21 percent of respondents report planning to decrease their family practice residency slots in the immediate future. The majority of those who are planning to decrease their slots are the sole residency program in a teaching hospital. This means that, under current law, they have no alternative way of achieving growth, such as through a reduction of other specialty slots in 
   order to stay within the cap. 
   And finally, the vast majority of family practice residencies did not have their full residency FTEs captured in the 1996 cost reports upon which the cap is based. 
   In addition to this survey, we have anecdotal information from residencies across the country detailing how they have lost funding either because of where they trained their residents or because their residents had been extended sick or maternity leave. For example, one family practice residency in Washington State last year had an equivalent of 14 residents training outside of the hospital and four in the hospital. Under the BBA, their cap would be four. By contrast, had all of their residents been trained in the hospital up to this point, their payment base would have been capped at 18, even if they trained residents in non-hospital settings in the future. 
   The Medicare Graduate Medical Education Technical Amendments Act we are introducing today will address these problems by basing the cap on the number of residents ``who were appointed by the approved medical residency training programs for the hospital'' in 1996, rather than on the number of residents who were ``in the hospital.'' 
   I am also concerned that the Balanced Budget Act and its accompanying regulations will severely hamper primary care residency programs that are expanding to meet local needs. Specifically, a new residency program that had not met its full complement of accredited residency positions until after the cutoff date of August 5, 1997, is precluded from increasing its number of residents unless the hospital decreases the number of residents in one of its other specialty programs. However, over forty percent of the nation's family practice residency programs are the only program sponsored by the hospital. This provision therefore completely precludes such a hospital from expanding its residency program to meet emerging primary care needs. 
   To address this problem, the legislation we are introducing today would allow the small number of programs at hospitals that sponsor just one residency program to increase their cap by one residency slot a year up to a maximum of three. In addition, to enable a number of family practice residency programs that are already in the pipeline to get accredited and grow to completion, the bill extends the cutoff date to September 1999. 
   And finally, the Balanced Budget Act gave the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to give ``special consideration'' to new facilities that ``meet the needs of underserved rural areas.'' The Health Care Financing Administration has interpreted this to mean facilities that are actually in underserved rural areas. There have been several recent expansions in family practice residency programs that include a rural training track, with residents located in outlying hospitals, or with satellite programs designed specifically to train residents to work with underserved populations. 
   Even though these new programs or satellites required accrediting body approval, they are still part of the ``mother'' residencies, which may not be physically located in an underserved rural area. While these are not technically new programs, I believe that the definition should be expanded to include such endeavors, given the value of these programs in addressing the needs of underserved populations. Therefore, the Medicare Graduate Medical Education Technical Amendments Act would expand the definition to include ``facilities which are not located in an underserved rural area, but which have established separately accredited rural training tracks.''

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Education Flexibility Partnership Act. This legislation will help States and local schools to pursue innovative efforts to improve K-12 education. I commend my colleagues, Senator FRIST and Senator WYDEN, for bringing forth this legislation. Senator WYDEN has very effectively demolished the myths about this legislation. The fact is, the goal of this legislation is to improve--to improve the education that we are providing to kids all over this country. It is that simple. The legislation would accomplish that goal by extending educational flexibility to all 50 States. 
   The public schools in this country have made an immeasurable contribution to the success of our society and our Nation. We need to assure that future generations of Americans receive the same excellent public education that many of us were so fortunate to receive while we were growing up. Unfortunately, as the Federal Government has imposed an alarming number of well-intended regulations on our public schools, we have seen a decline in the overall achievements of our students in our public school systems. 
   I am very proud of the progress that Maine schools have made in improving the performance of our students through a challenging curriculum. For example, Maine students rank highly in the National Assessment of Education Progress tests. This achievement reflects the efforts of the Maine Department of Education, our teachers, our principals, our school boards, our State's elementary and secondary schools, and the University of Maine, to design and use challenging statewide learning results. 
   The NAEP test results show that the efforts in Maine are in fact succeeding. They show that our K-12 education system can 
   produce high-achieving students when the standards, curriculum, and expectations are supported and designed by those closest to our schools. 
   The process that the State of Maine used was a burdensome one. It required seeking individual waivers from the Federal Department of Education. It was a lengthy process. It was one that involved a great deal of bureaucratic delay. It is that kind of process that would be changed by this legislation. 
   The fact is, Maine and the rest of our Nation still have a long way to go to improve the education of our students. America holds dear the tradition of State and local control of education. The basic responsibility for improving student achievement lies with the States, not the Federal Government. Indeed, perhaps a better name for this legislation would be ``The Return to Local Control Education Act.''  
   I believe that all of us, in all of our States, are trying to meet the challenge of greater student achievement. But our State administrators need help from the Federal Government. They do not need more dictates. They do not need more regulation. The Ed-Flex bill provides some of that help by reducing Federal intrusion into the local control of schools. 
   How will this legislation help? Let's look at the role of the Federal Government. Over the last 30 years, the Federal Government has layered new programs on top of old ones that themselves are not meeting their goals. This has been done with a blind commitment to the belief that yet another program devised in Washington will somehow reverse the decline in educational achievement. 
   We spend over $10 billion a year to support elementary and secondary education. This Federal money is spent through so many different programs that we can't even get an accurate count of how many there are. The General Accounting Office and the Congressional Research Service estimates range from 550 to 750 separate Federal education programs. Each of these programs comes with its own objectives, statutory requirements, and administrative regulations. Collectively, they create a huge administrative burden on local schools. Indeed, while the Federal Government funds only 7 percent of our public education system, it is responsible for 50 percent of the schools' paperwork. 
   By passing the Education Flexibility Act, we will allow States and local school districts the flexibility they need to pursue creative and innovative approaches in using Federal funds. And the Federal dollars that they do receive will become a genuine force for education improvement. Even more important, the bill will afford States and communities the flexibility that they need to craft local solutions. Instead of struggling to make programs designed in Washington fit local needs, States and localities will have the freedom to make the changes that they know are needed in each individual school. 
   Because, as the Senator from Oregon put it very well, the schools in an urban environment may be very different in their needs from a school in a rural community. 
   The Ed-Flex Act addresses the need for change within our public schools. It will provide a way for State and local education agencies to be freed from the multitude of Federal statutes and regulations that prevent them from breaking out of the Federal education mold and creating their own exciting programs. Expanding the opportunity for Ed-Flex to every State gives our school boards, teachers, parents, and State officials the opportunity to experiment and innovate, to chart a new path for better schools, and to provide Congress with the information it needs to help promote rather than hinder educational improvement. 
   In closing, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation. I would also like to clarify that I don't think Senator KENNEDY deliberately gave me his cold from the hearing yesterday so I would be less effective in debating him today, despite the rumor to the contrary. 
   With that, I yield the floor. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 314, the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act. The bill establishes a guaranteed loan program for small businesses in order to remediate existing computer systems or to purchase new Year 2000 compliant equipment. The loan program would be modeled after the Small Business Administration's popular 7(a) loan program, which has provided thousands of small businesses funding to grow their operations. 
   Many small businesses are having difficulty determining how they will be affected by the millennium bug and what they should do about it. Many of them face not only technological but also severe financial challenges in becoming Y2K-compliant. This legislation will help provide peace of mind to the small business community throughout the nation, which we must help prepare now for the coming crisis. 
   The Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act would encourage business to focus on Year 2000 computer problems before they are upon us. A successful program being operated in my State underscores the benefits to such forethought. 
   Through the efforts of the Maine Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), a program funded through the National Institutes of Science and Technology, small businesses have been successful in addressing their Y2K problems. With the use of an assessment tool, the Maine MEP is able to provide small business owners road maps for addressing critical Y2K issues concerning accounting systems, computerized production equipment, environmental management systems, and supplier vulnerabilities. 
   Once the Maine MEP completes an assessment of technical Y2K problems, it instructs the small business owner on how to apply for a loan from the Small Business Administration. As it turns out, this step is crucial. Small business owners have commented that, while they need help in determining their Y2K exposure, it is just as important to have a place to turn for funding so that they can take action to correct possible problems. Because businesses often do not budget for Y2K problems, it is vital to give businesses some assurance that they will be able to borrow the funds necessary to remediate their systems. The Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act does exactly that. 
   My home State of Maine has over 35,000 small businesses, which were responsible for all of the net new jobs created in our State from 1992 through 1996. With their diversity and innovation, small businesses are the backbone of our economy and the engine fueling job growth. 
   Mr. President, by their very definition entrepreneurs are risk managers. In the years that I have been working with small businesses, I am aware of countless experiences where the entrepreneurial spirit has propelled business owners to overcome major obstacles to succeed. With the financial assistance that this new SBA loan program will offer, it is my expectation that small businesses will indeed succeed in squashing their Y2K bug.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to those who are sponsoring the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 which would afford states important exemptions from burdensome federal regulations. Indeed, the bill would expand a 12-state demonstration program to all 50 states, and would allow for the waiver of statutes and regulations that hinder State and local educational improvement plans. I thank my colleagues, Senator FRIST and Senator WYDEN, for their leadership on this innovative legislation. It is, indeed, a landmark bill that I am confident will improve the performance of our Nation's public schools by placing the control back where it belongs--in the hands of teachers, parents, school board members and the administrators of local school districts. 
   I am delighted to join my colleagues as an original cosponsor of this legislation, because I am confident that it will improve the academic performance of students in my home State of Maine and in States across the Nation. Our Nation's public school system is the foundation upon which the American dream is built. Time and time again, we see that education is the difference between poverty and prosperity, ignorance and understanding. 
   There is no doubt that America's public schools are in need of a boost, but not one that is dictated by the Federal Government in a ``one size fits all'' approach. Rather, we need a boost for our Nation's schools; a boost conceived of and built from the bottom up by the people who know best what our students need; namely, educators and administrators at the State and local levels. 
   The Ed-Flex plan does just that by cutting the bureaucratic strings that now entangle Federal education dollars. It would allow local communities to spend Federal dollars as they think best, as long as their programs accomplish the objectives of Federal guidelines. 
   In short, the Ed-Flex bill will help our public schools attain and, indeed, in many cases exceed Federal standards without resorting to a ``Washington knows best'' approach. 
   I note, Mr. President, that this approach is totally contrary to that proposed by the Clinton administration. The President wants to be the Nation's principal. He wants to decide everything from promotion policies to curriculum standards. That is not the approach that this bill takes. Rather, this bill reflects our philosophy that those who are most committed and best able to improve education are found at the State and local level--our parents, our school board leaders, our principals, and our teachers. 
   In Maine, our students rank near the top in many national tests. The State Department of Education, the State's elementary and secondary schools and the University of Maine have worked diligently to design and use challenging statewide learning standards. 
   National test results show that these efforts have been successful. Even more important, they demonstrate that a strong K-12 education system designed and supported by State and local officials, school board members, teachers, and parents can produce first-rate students. 
   And, indeed, I am very proud of the accomplishments of Maine schools. 
   Dozens of schools across the country have participated in the current Ed-Flex Partnership Program. They have proven that test scores and learning increase most rapidly when guided by locally designed programs, not by Federal ones. We need to expand the Ed-Flex Program so that students in every State can reap these same benefits. 
   Public schools in Maine and across the Nation have made a good-faith effort to repair the deteriorated foundation of our system of public education. There is, however, much more that needs to be done. Our States cannot do it alone. They need assistance but not the dictates of Washington. 
   The Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 directly addresses the need for change within public schools by putting the power to plan, brainstorm, build, and implement back in the hands of State and local communities. Expanding the opportunity for the Ed-Flex Program will give every State the chance to experiment and innovate and to chart a path for better schools. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this very important initiative. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back the remainder of my time.

    Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to bring my colleagues' attention to the celebration of National TRIO Day on February 27th. The 99th Congress designated the last Saturday in February as the day to celebrate these very important and successful federal programs designed to raise the educational aspirations of students by providing services that help them overcome social, cultural, and other barriers to success in higher education. 
   Currently, two thousand colleges, universities, and community agencies sponsor TRIO programs. More than 780,000 lower-income middle school, high school, and adult students benefit from the services of such TRIO programs as Talent Search, Upward Bound, and Student Support Services. Not only do students personally benefit from their participation in higher education, but also our nation benefits from a better-educated population motivated to serve their communities and their country. 
   My home state of Maine has one of the country's lowest rates of participation in postsecondary education. The fifteen TRIO programs operating in Maine are working successfully to increase this number. Each year, these programs serve 6,000 students, building their aspirations for higher education and providing them the counseling, confidence, and academic support they need to pursue higher education. 
   Father James Nadeau, a native of my hometown in Aroostook County, is a graduate of the Bowdoin College Upward Bound program. His story tells why the TRIO programs are so important. His parents did not have the opportunity to pursue an education beyond the eighth grade. Father Jim's participation in Upward Bound changed his life and opened up a world of opportunity to him. 
   Beginning in 1977, Father Jim spent three summers enrolled in Upward Bound and then attended Dartmouth College and studied in France and Scotland. Subsequently, he studied for five years at the Gregorian University in Rome and received two graduate degrees in theology. His ministry has spanned from Mother Teresa in Calcutta to school children in Portland, Maine and continues to affect lives all over the world. He is an excellent role model for the youth of Maine and remains a terrific example of the success of the TRIO programs. There are many similar stories of TRIO graduates in all professions and walks of life. These are stories of successful, educated individuals who were introduced by a TRIO program to the endless possibilities that become attainable through education. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to visit TRIO programs in their states as I have done in Maine. You will see for yourselves why these programs are vital to our efforts to promote equal educational opportunity for all our citizens.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on behalf of my principal cosponsor, Senator INOUYE, and myself, I am proud to submit a resolution requesting that the United States Postal Service issue a commemorative postage stamp honoring the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (``VFW''), which will be celebrating its centennial in September of this year. We are pleased to be joined by 56 of our colleagues in support of this measure. 
   As a member of the VFW Ladies Auxiliary post in Caribou, ME, and as the daughter of a World War II veteran who was wounded twice in combat, I am honored to lead the charge for this worthwhile legislation. 
   This measure is intended to pay special tribute to all members of the VFW, past and present, who pledged their honor and their lives to defend the United States and who fought bravely in foreign lands so that we as a nation might live in freedom. These are our true American patriots, for they have demonstrated a profound commitment to the principles of our Founding Fathers not in mere words, but in their deeds. When their country called, they answered, and they fought to keep the American way of life safe and secure. 
   As an organization, the Veterans of Foreign Wars traces its roots back to 1899. Veterans of the Spanish-American War and the Philippine Insurrection returned home from intense fighting abroad and were greeted with a hero's welcome. Over time, the memory of wartime sacrifice faded in the minds of many Americans, but not for the men who carried with them permanent battle scars, prolonged illnesses, and other grim reminders of war. 
   Absent a single Government agency possessing responsibility for veterans, and facing neglect, these brave men banded together to establish a handful of local organizations intended to help secure medical care and pensions for their military service. These original foreign service organizations, located in Ohio, Colorado, and Pennsylvania, gradually grew in number and influence and in 1914 came to be known collectively as the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States. 
   Mr. President, it was several years later, on June 24, 1921, when the VFW's chapter in my home State of Maine was chartered. Today, there are 84 VFW posts in Maine to which over 16,000 veterans belong. 
   Those small groups of veterans who organized in 1899 have today grown to over 2 million strong. VFW members have fought and died in every war, conflict, and military intervention in which the United States has been engaged during this century. From factory workers to occupants of the White House, the VFW members and its Ladies Auxiliary have come to represent a cross section of American society, and each new generation of veterans has brought renewed strength and dedication to the VFW's founding principles. 
   As the 21st century approaches, the VFW's members continue to live by the organization's creed of ``Honor the dead by helping the living.'' They do so by representing the interests of veterans across the Nation through an established network of trained service officers who, at no charge, help millions of veterans and their dependents secure the educational benefits, disability compensation, pension, and health care services that they are rightfully entitled to as a result of their distinguished service to our Country. 
   The VFW also has a long and proud tradition of supporting troops deployed overseas. From letter-writing campaigns in World War I, to ``Welcome  home'' rallies after the Persian Gulf war, to providing care packages, to USO shows and, more recently, to providing free telephone cards enabling servicemen and women to call loved ones from their posts in Bosnia, the VFW continues to provide comfort and a touch of home to those men and women stationed far away. 
   The endeavors of the VFW, however, go well beyond the realm of ``veterans helping veterans.'' In fact, service to the broader American community has always been a pillar of the VFW foundation. 
   Through the VFW's Community Service Program, members of its 10,000 posts serve local communities, States, and the Nation with all of the integrity, ingenuity, and loyalty that have characterized the organization since its inception. During the past program year, for example, the VFW, working side by side with its Ladies Auxiliary, contributed nearly 13 million hours of volunteer service and donated nearly $55 million to a variety of community projects. Commitment to worthy causes such as the March of Dimes, the Keep America Beautiful campaign, and many other volunteer organizations also continues to be a hallmark of service among VFW members. 
   The promotion of patriotism is another hallmark of the VFW's history. Since the beginning of its Americanization Committee in 1921, the VFW has actively taught traditional values to Americans both young and old. Today, teaching respect for the flag is a primary activity, as is educating children in the classroom about the critical role that veterans have played throughout our history. 
   The interests of today's youth are also met by VFW posts around the Nation through active support for drug prevention programs, the Boy Scouts of America, the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, and sponsorship of competitors in both the Junior and Special Olympics. The VFW has also recently commemorated 50 years of helping high school students attend college. Because of VFW support, in fact, America's young people annually receive more than $2.6 million in scholarships. 
   The VFW deserves public national recognition for these efforts and for its many other contributions to improving the lives of our Nation's veterans and enhancing American society as a whole. Although as a country we can never fully repay the debt we owe to these brave men and women, we can certainly strive to honor the vision which led them into battle to protect the principles America holds dear. 
   We must uphold the memories of their heroic acts with respect, with reverence, and with our heartfelt admiration. By requesting that the U.S. Postal Service issue a commemorative stamp honoring the VFW's 100th anniversary, as was done for its 50th and 75th anniversaries, we can take a small step toward remembering their service and showing our deep appreciation for their unwavering commitment to our country, both in peacetime and in times of conflict. This, I believe, would be a much-deserved tribute to the VFW and its more than 2 million veterans of overseas service. 
   Mr. President, I am very pleased to note that you are a cosponsor of this important measure.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. Chief Justice, my colleagues, the issue now before the Senate may well be the most significant of our public careers. Other than declaring war, it is difficult to imagine a weightier decision that could come before us than whether to remove the President of the United States from office. 
   Our Founders designed impeachment to protect our system of government against officials who lose their moorings in the law or who endanger our most basic institutions. They designed it neither as a popular referendum nor as a mechanism by which--as in parliamentary systems--the legislature can remove the head of government based on nothing more than a policy difference. Instead, this process is a check upon rogue chief executives, designed equally to remove the politically popular malefactor and to protect the innocent, but unpopular, official. It is a vital, but extraordinary, remedy that should neither be shunned out of political expediency nor invoked for political gain. 
   The question before us is not whether President Clinton's conduct was contemptible or utterly unworthy of the great office he holds. It was. The question before us is whether the President has committed an impeachable offense for which he should be removed from that office. 
   The Framers thought carefully about where to vest the ultimate power to remove a president. They chose the United States Senate. This was not an obvious choice. The power to convict and remove could as easily have been assigned to a court of law, where a jury would apply the law to the facts in the ordinary way. 
   But the Framers gave the power to try impeachments to the Senate. They did so because they recognized that an impeachment trial should not be an ordinary trial, requiring an ordinary application of law to fact. The Framers wanted the Senate to make not only a determination of guilt, but also a judgment about what is best for our nation and its institutions. 
   Throughout this impeachment trial, in order to lessen the ambiguity in this  process, I have sought to find a way to allow the Senate to express its view of the facts we have so carefully considered for the past month. The vote we now approach is to convict or acquit. It is a blunt instrument that does not allow me to express clearly my belief that President Clinton willfully lied to a federal grand jury, and that he wrongfully tried to influence testimony and to conceal evidence related to Paula Jones' lawsuit. 
   As this case has been argued in this chamber, I have become convinced that the perjury charges of Article I are not fully substantiated by the record. The President's grand jury testimony is replete with lies, half-truths, and evasions. But significantly, not all evasion is lying, and not all lying is perjury. Even blatantly misleading testimony that all fair-minded people would consider dishonest may not actually constitute perjury, as the law defines it. 
   Time and time again, the attorneys questioning President Clinton before the grand jury--perhaps out of a misguided sense of deference--neglected to pin him down as he gave nonresponsive, evasive, confusing, or simply absurd responses. The only remedy for imprecise answers is more precise questioning. Unfortunately, this did not occur, and consequently, the record is too murky to require the President's removal based on Article I. 
   The evidence supporting Article II is more convincing. Indeed, the case presented by the House Managers proves to my satisfaction that the President did, in fact, obstruct justice in Paula Jones' civil rights case. While the circumstances surrounding Monica Lewinsky's filing of a false affidavit are unclear, there is no doubt in my mind that the frantic efforts to find Ms. Lewinsky a job, the retrieval and concealment of gifts under the bed of the President's secretary, and, most egregious, the President's blatant coaching of Betty Currie--not once, but twice--were clear attempts to tamper with witnesses and obstruct justice. Indeed, if I were a juror in an ordinary criminal case, I might very well vote to convict faced with these facts. 
   Nevertheless, I do not think that the President's actions constitute a ``high crime'' or ``misdemeanor'' as contemplated by Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution. This is, I readily acknowledge, a judgment that can neither be made nor explained with anything approaching scientific precision. But I can point to two factors that influence my conclusion. 
   First, obstruction of justice is generally more serious in a criminal case, as opposed to a civil case, as it interferes with the effective enforcement of our nation's laws and not solely with the adjudication of private disputes. Consistent with this conclusion, the vast majority of obstruction prosecutions involve underlying criminal actions, and the statutory penalties are more severe in the context of criminal trials. This is not to suggest for a moment that we should tolerate obstruction of justice in civil cases, but only to observe that our legal system treats it as a less serious offense. 
   Second, I believe that for impeachment purposes, obstruction of justice has more ominous implications when the conduct concealed, or the method used to conceal it, poses a threat to our governmental institutions. Neither occurred in this case. 
   Therefore, I will cast my vote not for the current President, but for the presidency. I believe that in order to convict, we must conclude from the evidence presented to us with no room for doubt that our Constitution will be injured and our democracy suffer should the President remain in office one moment more. 
   In this instance, the claims against the President fail to reach this very high standard. Therefore, albeit reluctantly, I will vote to acquit William Jefferson Clinton on both counts. 
   In voting to acquit the President, I do so with grave misgivings for I do not mean in any way to exonerate this man. He lied under oath; he sought to interfere with the evidence; he tried to influence the testimony of key witnesses. And, while it may not be a crime, he exploited a very young, star-struck employee whom he then proceeded to smear in an attempt to destroy her credibility, her reputation, her life. The President's actions were chillingly similar to the White House's campaign to discredit Kathleen Willey. 
   As much as it troubles me to acquit this President, I cannot do otherwise and remain true to my role as a Senator. To remove a popularly elected president for the first time in our nation's history is an extraordinary action that should be undertaken only when the President's misconduct so injures the fabric of democracy that the Senate is left with no option but to oust the offender from the office the people have entrusted to him. 
   President Clinton has written a shameful and permanent chapter of American history. He alone is responsible for this year of agony that the American people have endured. I do not, however, take solace in the prospect of a censure, nor do I take comfort in the possibility that the President may be prosecuted for his wrongdoing after he leaves office. Rather, I look to the verdict of history to provide the ultimate punishment for this president, a verdict that no public relations gloss or smear campaign can obscure. As Maine's great poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, wrote in 1874, ``Whatever hath been written shall remain, nor be erased, nor written o'er again.'' When the history of the Clinton presidency is written, every book will begin with the fact that William Jefferson Clinton was impeached, and that will be not only the ultimate censure but also the final verdict on this sad chapter in our nation's history.

    Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished senior Senator from the State of Maine, Senator SNOWE, in introducing private relief legislation for Nancy B. Wilson. 
   By way of background, Al Wilson worked for Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, and he and his wife Edna had two children. In 1945, tragedy stuck the family when Edna suffered a severe mental breakdown and was permanently placed in a mental institution, leaving Al to care for the children. 
   Five years later, Al met Nancy Butler, who immediately began caring for Al's two young children, as well as her son. Nancy took residence with Al and soon began to raise the children as her own. The eldest child has written that Nancy ``is the person who brought me up in place of my biological mother, who was institutionalized. I think of Nancy as my real mother.'' 
   Al and Nancy wanted to get married, but Al was prohibited from divorcing Edna by a Massachusetts state law. The law barred a divorce for reasons of insanity or institutionalization for insanity. The Congressional Research Service confirmed that a ``divorce could not have been granted under Massachusetts law during the 1960's and 1970's solely because one spouse was insane.'' 
   On April 12, 1969, Edna Wilson died. Twenty days later, on May 2, 1969, Nancy and Al were married. Al died of cancer seven months later on December 5, 1969. Nancy had lived with Al for 19 years. 
   Upon turning sixty-four years old on March 21, 1991, Nancy applied to the Social Security Administration for survivor insurance benefits from Al's wage earnings. She was refused benefits based upon the limited term of her legal marriage. According to Social Security regulations, a couple must be married for at least nine months for a spouse to collect survivor benefits. 
   Nancy has exhausted the available legal remedies, taking full advantage of the administrative appeals process. Nancy filed a request for reconsideration and appeared at a hearing before an administrative law judge. On January 28, 1992, the Social Security Administration issued its final decision denying her claim for benefits. 
   The private relief bill we are introducing would allow Nancy to receive widow's benefits from her husband's earnings. Nancy Wilson was, for all practical purposes, married to Al Wilson. She cohabited with him for nineteen years prior to their marriage. She raised his children, allowing him to work and accumulate a Social Security benefit. Nancy and Al were legally prevented from marrying by Massachusetts state law, even though his marriage with his first wife had essentially ended. 
   Mr. President, the unique circumstances of Mrs. Wilson epitomize why Congress has the power to enact private relief legislation. Her situation fulfills the intent of the Social Security Act. Al and Nancy were prohibited from marrying; clearly they would have if the law allowed them to do so. This unique situation is an exception that will not be repeated. Since their marriage, a no-fault divorce statute has been enacted in Massachusetts, which prevents this situation from occurring again. Mrs. Wilson's case is a compelling one which we believe the Senate should alleviate.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, during National Consumer Protection Week, I am introducing the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act, a comprehensive bill designed to stem the rising tide of deceptive mailings that are flooding the mailboxes of the people of Maine and people throughout the country. 
   I am very pleased to have the cosponsorship of a trio of distinguished Senators in this regard: Senator COCHRAN, the chairman of the subcommittee with legislative jurisdiction over these types of mailings, who has been a leader in the effort to curtail deceptive mailings and sweepstakes fraud; Senator LEVIN, who serves as the ranking minority member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and who has played an active role not only in the hearings held last year, but also in introducing his own legislation on this issue, which I am pleased to cosponsor. He has a longstanding interest in curtailing deceptive mailings. I am also pleased to have the support of Senator DURBIN, with whom I have worked very closely on many consumer issues. 
   Mr. President, several months ago, prompted by complaints that I have received from my constituents in Maine, I initiated an investigation into sweepstakes fraud and deceptive mailings. Over the course of this investigation, I have seen countless examples of mailings that deceptively promise extravagant prizes in order to entice consumers to make unnecessary and unneeded purchases. Unfortunately, this calculated confusion works far too often. In one particularly egregious example, one deceptive mailing prompted some of its victims to fly to Florida, believing that they then would be the first to claim the grand prize promised in a major sweepstakes. 
   Deceptive mailings take many forms. One such form that I find particularly offensive is ``Government look-alike mailings,'' which appear deceptively like a mailing from a Federal agency or other official entity. An example of such a deceptive mailing was recently sent to me by a woman from Machiasport, ME. The postcard that she received was marked ``Urgent Delivery, a Special Notification of Cash Currently Being Held by the U.S. Government is ready for shipment to you.'' I have blown up a copy of the postcard she received so you can see just how deceptive this mailing was. On the back of the postcard, the consumer was asked to send $9.97 to learn how to receive this cash. Of course, this was not a legitimate mailing from the Federal  Government, but simply a ploy used by an unscrupulous individual to trick an unsuspecting consumer into sending money. 
   Mr. President, millions of Americans have received sweepstakes letters that use deceptive marketing ploys to encourage the purchase of magazines and other products. A common tactic is a ``promise'' of winning printed in large type, such as this example: ``You Were Declared One of Our Latest Sweepstakes Winners and You're About to be Paid $833,337 in Cash.'' A constituent of mine from Portland, ME, received this mailing, but, of course, he wasn't really a winner. It takes an awfully sharp eye and very careful scrutiny to notice the very fine print that states that the money is won only ``if you have and return the grand prize-winning number in time.'' 
   Mr. President, thousands of consumers have made very frequent purchases, often of more than $1,000 a year, in response to deceptive sweepstakes mailings. I have heard sad stories from many people who have described personal horror stories caused by these deceptive mailings. Some people have told me of their elderly parents spending $10,000, $20,000, even as much as $60,000 in one case, hoping that their next purchase would result in a large prize. Senior citizens are particularly vulnerable, as they generally trust the statements made by these marketing appeals, particularly if they are pitched by celebrities, or if the mailing appears to be connected or in some way sanctioned by the Federal Government. 
   To increase consumer protections, and to punish those who use such deceptive mailings to prey on our senior citizens, the bill that I am introducing today, along with Senators COCHRAN, LEVIN and DURBIN, will attack sweepstakes fraud and deceptive mailings on four fronts. 
   First, the bill will prevent fraud and deception by requiring companies to be more honest with the American people when using sweepstakes and other promotional mailings. My legislation would establish new standards for sweepstakes, including clear disclosure. In addition, my legislation would strengthen the law against mailings that mimic Government documents. Mailings could not use any language or device that gives the appearance that the mailing is connected, approved, or endorsed by the Federal Government. 
   Second, this bill provides strong new financial penalties for sending mail that does not comply with these and existing standards. Civil penalties include fines ranging from $50,000 to $2 million would be allowed depending on the number of mailings sent. 
   Third, the bill strengthens Federal law enforcement efforts and makes them more effective by giving the U.S. Postal Inspection Service additional tools to combat these deceptive practices. 
   Fourth, my legislation would preserve the important role the States play in fighting this type of fraud and deception. Our bill would not preempt States and local laws protecting consumers from fraudulent and deceptive mailings. 
   Mr. President, hundreds of millions of these promotional materials are sent out each year to consumers across the country. By design, they are meant to confuse their recipients and to trick them into spending money needlessly under the false pretense that doing so will earn them huge rewards. 
   As the chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I will shortly be holding hearings on this issue in the coming months to document the nature and extent of the problem and how these deceptive mailings affect Americans, particularly our senior citizens. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues, particularly the subcommittee's ranking member, Senator LEVIN, who has been such a leader in this area. It is my hope that Congress will enact the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Improvement Act to increase consumer protections, to improve law enforcement efforts, and to provide effective penalties for those who deceive American consumers. 
   Mr. President, I yield any remaining time to the Senator from Michigan, Senator LEVIN.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators JEFFORDS, KENNEDY, ROTH, and MOYNIHAN in introducing this historic, bipartisan initiative that will help tear down the barriers that prevent Americans with disabilities who want to work from reaching their full potential and achieving economic independence. 
   Eight million Americans receive more than $50 billion a year in cash disability benefits under the Supplemental Security Income and Social Security Disability programs. While surveys show that the overwhelming majority of adults with disabilities want to work, fewer than 1/2 of 1 percent of them actually do. 
   Advances in medicine and technology coupled with tougher civil rights laws have made it possible for more and more people with physical and mental disabilities to enter the workforce. These are people who genuinely want to work. They have the skills and talents necessary to be productive members of the workforce. But they face a Catch-22. If they leave the disability rolls for a job, they risk losing the Medicare and Medicaid benefits that made it possible for them to enter the workforce in the first place. Moreover, many of these individuals' very lives depend on the prescription drugs, technology, personal assistance services, and medical care they receive. 
   Mr. President, no one should have to make a choice between a job and health care. The legislation we are introducing today will create and fund new options for States to encourage them to allow people with disabilities who enter the workforce to buy into the Medicaid program, so they can continue to receive the prescription drugs, personal assistance services, and medical care upon which they depend. It will also allow workers leaving the social Security Disability Insurance program to extend their Medicare coverage for ten years. This is tremendously important since many people returning to work after having been on SSDI either work part time and are therefore not eligible for employer-based insurance, or they work in jobs that do not offer health insurance. Allowing these disabled individuals to maintain their Medicare coverage will serve as a tremendous incentive for them to return to the workforce. 
   Other provisions of the legislation we are introducing today incorporate a more ``user-friendly'' approach in programs providing job training and placement assistance to individuals with disabilities who wants to work. Our bill gives disabled SSI and SSDI beneficiaries greater consumer choice by creating a ``ticket'' that enables them to choose whether they want to go to a public or private provider of vocational rehabilitation services. The bill also provides grants to States and organizations to help connect people with disabilities with appropriate services, and funds demonstrations and studies to better understand policies that will encourage and enable work. 
   Mr. President, the legislation we are introducing today is an investment in human potential that promises tremendous return. By ensuring that Americans with disabilities have access to affordable health insurance, we are removing the major barrier between them and the workplace. The Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 will both encourage and enable Americans with disabilities to be full participants in our nation's workforce and growing economy, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important legislation.

    Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining my colleagues in introducing this Patients' Bill of Rights, which is the product of more than a year's worth of intensive work and negotiations by the Senate Republican Health Care Task Force on which I serve. 
   This comprehensive legislation has three major purposes. First, it will protect patients' rights and hold HMOs accountable for providing the care they have promised. Second, it will expand consumer choice and access to affordable care. And third, it will improve health care quality and outcomes. 
   Mr. President, there is a growing unease across our country about changes in how we receive our health care. People worry that if they or their loved ones become seriously ill, their HMO will deny them coverage and force them to accept either inadequate care or financial ruin--or perhaps both. 
   They feel that vital decisions affecting their lives will be made, not by a supportive family doctor, but by an unfeeling bureaucracy. The American people, known for taking charge of their destiny, feel increasingly powerless about their health care. Our bill will ensure that medical decisions remain in the hands of patients and physicians, not HMO accountants and trial lawyers. 
   All of us agree that medically-necessary patient care should not be sacrificed to the bottom line. However, according to a 1997 study by Lewin, every one percent increase in health care premiums results in as many as 400,000 uninsured Americans. I have therefore been alarmed by reports that American businesses everywhere--from large multinational corporations to the corner store--are facing huge hikes in health insurance premiums in 1999, ranging from about 8 percent on average, to 20 percent or more. This is a remarkable contrast to the last few years, when premiums rose less than 2 or 3 percent, if at all. 
   We are engaged in an extremely delicate balancing act as we attempt to respond to concerns about quality, without resorting to unduly burdensome federal controls and mandates that will further drive up costs, causing thousands of Americans to lose their coverage and pushing health insurance further out of reach for many uninsured Americans. 
   Our Patients' Bill of Rights does not pre-empt, but rather builds upon the good work that states have done in the area of patients' rights and protections. Congress agreed that states should have primary responsibility for the regulation of health insurance when it passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945. And, as someone who has overseen a Bureau of Insurance in state government, I think state regulators have done a good job of responding to the needs and concerns of their citizens. For instance, at my last count, 44 states had passed laws prohibiting ``gag clauses'' that restrict communications between patients and their doctors, and the remaining six had bills pending in their legislatures. States acted without any mandate or prod from Washington to protect consumers. 
   Moreover, one size does not fit all, and what may be appropriate for one state may not be necessary in another. Florida, for instance, provides for direct access to a dermatologist, which is understandable, given the high rate of skin cancer in that state. But in a state like Maine this may not be so important. 
   So why does Congress need to act? The answer is that federal law prohibits states from regulating the self-funded, employer-sponsored health plans that cover 48 million Americans. 
   Our bill extends many of the same rights and protections to these individuals and their families that Americans  in state-regulated plans already enjoy. For the first time, they will be guaranteed the right to talk freely and openly with their doctors about their treatment options without being subject to ``gag clauses'' that limit communications. They will be guaranteed coverage for emergency room care that a ``prudent layperson'' would consider medically necessary without prior authorization from their health plan. They will be able to see their OB-GYN or pediatrician without a referral from their plan's ``gatekeeper,'' and they will have the option of seeing a doctor who is not a part of their HMO's network. They will also have some assurance of continuity of care if their health plan terminates its contract with their doctor or hospital. 
   Moreover, all patients will be given the right to review their medical records and will have added protections to ensure that this information will be kept confidential. Finally, insurers will be prohibited from collecting or using predictive genetic information about a patient to deny coverage or set premium rates. 
   Mr. President, the states are way ahead of the federal government in the area of insurance reform, and the State of Maine has already enacted many of these same consumer rights and protections--a ban on gag clauses, a prudent layperson definition for emergency care, and direct access to OB/GYNs. Our bill would extend these and other rights to the nearly 220,000 Maine citizens in health plans that are not subject to state regulation and who currently do not enjoy these protections. 
   A key provision of our bill would give all 125 million Americans in employer-sponsored plans assurance that they will get the care that they need, when they need it. This includes 535,735 people in Maine who are in fully-insured ERISA plans. For the first time, these individuals will be entitled to clear and complete information about their health plan--about what it does and does not cover, about any cost-sharing requirements, and about the plan's providers. Helping patients understand their coverage before they need to use it will help to avoid coverage disputes later. 
   The goal of any patient protection legislation should be to solve disputes about coverage up from, when the care is needed. Not months, or even years later, in a court room. 
   Our bill would accomplish this goal by creating both an internal and external review process. First, patients or doctors who are unhappy with an HMO's decision could appeal it internally through a review conducted by individuals with ``appropriate expertise'' who were not involved in the initial decision. Moreover, this review would have to be conducted by a physician if the coverage denial is based on a determination that the service is not medically necessary or is an experimental treatment. Patients could expect results from this review within 30 days, or 72 hours in cases when delay poses a serious risk to the patient's life or health. 
   Patients turned down by this internal review would then have the right to a free, external review by medical experts who are completely independent of their health plan. This review must be completed within thirty days--and even faster in a medical emergency or when delay would be detrimental to the patient's health. Moreover, the decision of these outside reviewers is binding on the health plan, but not on the patient. If the patient is not satisfied, they retain the right to sue in federal or state court for attorneys' fees, court costs, the value of the benefit and injunctive relief. 
   Our bill differs from the Democrats' bill in a fundamental respect: it places treatment decisions in the hands of doctors, not lawyers. If your HMO denies you treatment that your doctor believes is medically necessary, you should not have to resort to a costly and lengthy court battle to get the care you need. After all, doesn't it make more sense to put medical care in the hands of doctors, not lawyers? You should not have a resort to hiring a lawyer and filing an expensive lawsuit to get the treatment. You just can't sue your way to quality health care. 
   The purpose of our bill is to solve problems up-front when the care is needed, not months or even years later after the harm has occurred. According to the GAO, it takes an average of 33 months to resolve malpractice cases. One case in the study took 11 years. This does absolutely nothing to ensure a patient's right to timely and appropriate care. Moreover, patients only receive 43 cents out of every dollar awarded in malpractice cases. The rest winds up in the pockets of the trial lawyers and administrators of the court and insurance systems. 
   Finally, more lawsuits are certain to mean higher health care costs. According to the Barents Group of KPMG Peat Marwick, increased lawsuits could drive up premiums as much as 8.6 percent, forcing businesses to pay $94.1 billion ($1,284 per worker) in extra premiums over five years. Close to two million Americans could lose their health insurance next year as increased costs force many employers to eliminate coverage altogether, or to pass on higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs to employees who can't afford them. 
   Last fall I met with a group of Maine employers who expressed their serious concerns about the Democrats' proposal to expand liability for health plans and employers. The Assistant Director for Human Resources at Bowdoin College talked about how moving to a self-funded, ERISA plan enabled them to continue to offer affordable coverage to Bowdoin employees when premiums for their fully-insured plan skyrocketed in the late 1980s. Since they self-funded, they have actually been able to lower premiums for their employees, while at the same time, enhance their benefit designs with such features as well-baby care, free annual physicals, and prescription drug cards with low copayments. They told me that the Democrats' proposal to expand liability seriously jeopardizes their ability to offer affordable coverage for their employees. Similar concerns were expressed by the Maine Municipal Association, L.L. Bean, Bath Iron Works, and others. 
   Mr. President, our bill also contains important provisions to improve health care quality and outcomes for all Americans. 
   For example, I am particularly pleased that our bill contains the proposal introduced by my colleague from Maine, Senator SNOWE, that prohibits insurers from discriminating on the basis of predictive genetic information. 
   Genetic testing holds tremendous promise for individuals who have a genetic predisposition to beat cancer and other diseases and conditions with a genetic link. However, this promise is significantly threatened when insurance companies use the results of such testing to deny or limit coverage to consumers on the basis of genetic information. In addition to the potentially devastating consequences of being denied health insurance on the basis of genetic information, the fear of discrimination may discourage individuals who might benefit from having this information from ever getting tested. 
   And finally, our bill will make health insurance more affordable by allowing self-employed individuals to deduct the full amount of their health care premiums beginning not in 2003, as in current law, but next year. 
   Establishing parity in the tax treatment of health insurance costs between the self-employed and those working for large businesses is a matter of basic equity, and it will also help to reduce the number of uninsured, but working, Americans. It will make health insurance more affordable for the 82,000 people in Maine who are self-employed. They include our lobstermen, our hairdressers, our electricians, our plumbers, and the many owners of mom-and-pop stores that dot communities throughout the state. 
   Mr. President, I believe that our plan strikes the right balance as we effectively address concerns about quality and choice without resorting to unduly burdensome federal controls and mandates that would further drive up costs and cause some Americans to lose their health insurance altogether. I urge all of my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this proposal.

   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Telephone Services Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Act of 1999.'' I am pleased to have Senators DICK DURBIN and JIM JEFFORDS as cosponsors of this legislation. This bill is designed to curtail two telephone-related fraudulent practices: slamming--the unauthorized change of a consumer's long distance telephone service provider--and cramming--the billing of unauthorized charges on a consumer's telephone bill. This comprehensive bill is needed to ensure that consumers are adequately protected against these unfair practices. 
   Mr. President, telephone slamming and cramming are widespread problems, affecting consumers across the country. Nationwide, slamming is the number one telephone-related complaint to the Federal Communications Commission, and the number of such complaints has grown steadily over the past few years. In 1998, in fact, the FCC received more than 20,000 slamming complaints, a 900 percent increase over the number of complaints received in 1993. For fiscal year 1998 (from October 1, 1997 through September 1, 1998), telephone slamming was the number one complaint made by Maine consumers to the FCC's National Call Center. Since there is still no central repository for slamming complaints, the actual incidents of slamming are undoubtedly far more numerous. Estimates from phone companies indicated that perhaps as many as one million Americans were slammed last year alone. 
   Cramming complaints also remain at unacceptably high levels. In 1998, the FCC's National Call Center received over 15,000 cramming complaints from consumers, making it the 12th most common complaint received by the FCC. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission received over 6,000 cramming complaints from consumers in 1998, making it the FTC's 5th most common complaint. As with slamming, there is no central repository for cramming complaints, so the actual number of such complaints is probably much higher than those documented by the federal government. 
   In late 1997, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, began an extensive investigation into telephone-related fraud against consumers. The story of telephone services fraud, I soon discovered, is a great deal more than just an aggregate number of complaints. On February 18, 1998, I chaired a field hearing on slamming in Portland, Maine, where I heard first-hand from consumers about the problems they experienced when their long distance service was changed without their permission. Their sense of violation was evident. Witnesses used words such as ``stealing,'' ``criminal,'' and ``break-in'' to describe the practices used by unscrupulous telephone companies to boost profits by bouncing unsuspecting customers from carrier to carrier without their permission or even their knowledge. 
   One witness, for example, Pamela Corrigan from West Farmington, Maine, testified that she was sent an unsolicited mailing, which looked like any other letter in the stacks of junk mail that we all receive every day. This ``junk mail,'' however, was not what it appeared to be. This so-called ``welcome package'' automatically signed her up for a new long distance service unless she returned a card rejecting the change. She was amazed and appalled that it was possible for a 
   company to take over her long distance service simply because she did not respond that she did not want their service. 
   Building on this record, my Subcommittee held a second slamming hearing on April 23, 1998, in Washington, DC. This hearing exposed how certain fraudulent long distance switchless resellers (companies with no telephone equipment of their own that buy access to larger telephone companies' long distance lines and then ``resell'' that access to consumers) are responsible for a large proportion of the intentional slamming incidents. These  electronic bandits use deceptive marketing practices and often outright fraud to switch consumers' long distance service. The Subcommittee also learned how under current industry practices, many companies reap huge profits by taking advantage of consumers in such a fashion. 
   At my Subcommittee's April 1998 hearing, we examined a case study of telephone services fraud. A man named Daniel Fletcher fraudulently operated as a long distance reseller, using at least eight different company names. In these various guises, Fletcher slammed thousands of consumers, billing them for a total of at least $20 million in long distance charges. The impunity with which Mr. Fletcher deliberately slammed consumers for so long demonstrates the need to establish strong consumer protections to deter intentional slamming. 
   On July 23, 1998, I convened a hearing in Washington to explore the emerging problem of telephone cramming. At that hearing, we learned how cramming is a growing consumer fraud and how companies are using telephone bills to rip-off consumers by slipping unauthorized charges onto their statements without their consent and without proper notice. The National Consumers League testified that cramming has skyrocketed to first place among the more than 50 categories of telemarketing scams reported to its hotline. The FCC testified that it is relying on the telephone industry to voluntarily implement procedures to stop cramming. However, it was evident from the testimony that unless we establish a clear statutory and regulatory scheme and insist upon rigorous enforcement of these rules, cramming will continue to be a problem for consumers. 
   In May 1998, the Senate passed a strong anti-slamming bill by a unanimous vote. This bill contained strong consumer protection provisions and mandated aggressive enforcement by the FCC and other federal agencies. Unfortunately, the House retreated significantly from this strong anti-slamming legislation and sent us, at the very end of the legislative session, a bill significantly weaker than the one which passed the Senate--indeed, a bill so weak that it would provide consumers with less protection than they enjoy today, by preempting the important role states play in enforcing consumer anti-fraud protections. Last fall, in the final days of the session, the Congress was unable to agree to an acceptable compromise bill in the limited amount of time available to it. 
   I was pleased to see, however, that the FCC finally took action in December of last year to curb slamming. Among other measures, the FCC eliminated the ``welcome package'' as a verification method. This method was abused by many long distance carriers, facilitating widespread slamming. I urged the FCC last year to prohibit this practice, and I am glad to see that the Commission promulgated regulations banning the welcome package. 
   The FCC also made positive changes to the consumer liability rules, absolving consumers in certain circumstances from paying companies that slammed them. This provision is designed to take the profit out of slamming, to prevent this scam in the first place. I am pleased to see that the Commission adopted this principle which was a major finding of the Subcommittee's investigation of telephone slamming. 
   The FCC anti-slamming regulations are a step in the right direction, but we need to do more to protect consumers from these fraudulent activities. Today, to increase consumers protections, I am introducing a comprehensive telephone-related anti-fraud bill that will address both the slamming and cramming problems. I want to take this opportunity to explain several provisions in my bill, which is designed to increase consumer protections and to strengthen the enforcement tools available to federal and state regulators. 
   First, the bill enhances the states' ability to enact regulations and take enforcement actions against slamming and cramming. As the Subcommittee's investigation has revealed, the states have been admirably aggressive in taking enforcement action against companies that engage in telephone-related fraud. For example, in February 1998, the Florida Public Service Commission proposed a $500,000 fine against a company called Minimum Rate Pricing for slamming subscribers. The FCC, in contrast, fined the same company only $80,000. In the Fletcher case mentioned previously, the State of Florida fined one Fletcher 
   company $860,000, while the FCC originally fined one of them only $80,000. I am glad to say that since my subcommittee's investigation, the FCC has significantly increased its enforcement efforts, particularly against Mr. Fletcher. 
   For the most part, however, the states have been, and remain, the first line of defense against companies that repeatedly slam or cram consumers. This bill protects the states' ability to continue to fight those illegal practices. Specifically, this bill allows the states to impose tough requirements to protect consumers from those companies who continue to slam or cram American consumers. Moreover, states will be able to continue to obtain refunds for consumers who have been harmed by such fraudulent practices. 
   Second, this bill makes it clear that telephone companies that continue to slam or cram consumers will be subject to tough civil penalties. The bill will create new civil penalties for cramming, and authorize the imposition of stiff penalties by the FCC on those companies who violate FCC regulations against slamming or cramming. The FCC is currently authorized to assess forfeiture penalties of no more than $110,000 for each violation, for a total forfeiture not to exceed $1.1 million for a continuing violation. This bill sends a clear message to the FCC, however, that forfeiture penalties against companies that engage in telephone-related fraud should be large enough to deter such practices. These and other penalties the FCC will be authorized to impose ought to ensure that telephone companies follow proper procedures and refrain from slamming and cramming. If they break the rules by trying to cheat consumers, they will pay a steep price. 
   But prevention is better than punishment, and any effective enforcement program designed to reduce or eliminate telephone-related fraud must take the financial incentive for fraud away from companies who engage in these practices. The new FCC regulations go a long way to protecting consumers by absolving them from paying any charges for 30 days after they are slammed and by allowing consumers to pay their previously authorized carrier for telephone calls made in the period during which the slamming company fraudulently seized their long distance telephone service. Unfortunately, this FCC regulation does not apply to consumers who did not notice that they were slammed and consequently paid this long distance bill to the unauthorized carrier. The Commission apparently does not have the authority to mandate this requirement. My bill would change the law to allow all consumers to get refunds from unauthorized carriers. Under this plan, all consumers will be treated equally. The bill will also require telephone billing agents to make it clear to consumers that their telephone service will not be terminated when consumers dispute unauthorized charges that are crammed onto their telephone bills. 
   Finally, the bill will protect a consumer's right to a ``freeze option.'' This provision makes it clear that consumers have the right to stop slammers from changing their long distance service without their authorization. By invoking the freeze option, consumers can retain control over their telephone service by prohibiting any change in a consumers choice of telephone service provider, unless that change is expressly authorized by the consumer. This provision, I should also note, does not in any way prevent the FCC from regulating the marketing practices of telephone companies that use the freeze option in an unfair or deceptive manner. The Commission will be fully empowered to guarantee that consumers' right to protect their choice of local or long distance telephone service is not abridged or diminished. In sum, this language should increase consumers' right to prevent unauthorized changes in their telephone service. 
   This bill will go a long way to provide strong consumer protection against telephone-related fraud. It preserves the important role states play in protecting consumers and enforcing tough sanctions against unscrupulous  carriers; it authorizes tough federal civil penalties against those companies that continue to slam and cram consumers; and it protects consumers' right to a freeze option so that they--and not the telephone companies--have control over their long distance services. 
   Mr. President, this bill will provide the federal government and the states with the statutory tools to fight the practices of slamming and cramming and to end the systematic defrauding of countless thousands of consumers every year. I urge my colleagues to join me in the fight against telephone-related fraud by supporting this bill.
