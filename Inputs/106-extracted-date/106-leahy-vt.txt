   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, during the past year there has been an extraordinary amount written and spoken in this country about the death penalty--actually more than I can recollect having seen before. We have learned that the system of administering capital punishment is gravely flawed, and that scores of people have ended up on death row, often for many years, even though they were completely innocent of the crime for which they were sentenced to death. 
   We have seen how the justice system has serious flaws at every stage, and especially if the accused is poor, as are most criminal defendants who are sentenced to death. Lawyers defending people whose lives are at stake are often inexperienced or incompetent, and poorly paid. Two thirds of death penalty trials nationwide are marred by serious constitutional errors, according to reviewing courts. 
   We have seen public support for the death penalty decrease significantly. It is still over 50 percent nationally, but it falls below 50 percent if the alternative is life in prison with no opportunity for parole. 
   We have seen Governor Ryan of Illinois appoint a commission of experts, both supporters and opponents of capital punishment, to determine whether the death penalty can, under any circumstances, be administered reliably so innocent people will never be executed. The findings and recommendations of that commission will be important for the entire country. 
   In Virginia, a State with many people on death row, the legislature recently took note of the growing concerns surrounding capital punishment, and decided to review the administration of the death penalty in Virginia where there have been serious mistakes. 
   In October, the Virginia Governor pardoned Earl Washington, a mentally retarded farmhand, after new DNA tests cleared him of the rape and murder that once brought him within 9 days of execution. 
   Just this morning, the Washington Post reported that DNA tests had cleared another death row inmate--unfortunately, too late to be of any help. Before dying of cancer earlier this year, Frank Lee Smith spent 14 years on Florida's death row for a rape and murder that it now appears he did not commit. 
   I have introduced legislation with Senators GORDON SMITH, SUSAN COLLINS, and 12 other Senators, to address some of these most egregious flaws. I have spoken many times about our bill, the Innocence Protection Act, which we plan to pursue in the 107th Congress. 
   Our legislation addresses the horrendous problem of innocent people being condemned to death. But today I want to mention briefly a related issue which is illustrated by a case in Texas, the State which this year has executed more people than any other State in the post-war era. 
   The Supreme Court stayed the execution of Johnny Paul Penry on November 16, 2000, less than four hours before he was scheduled to die by lethal injection in Texas. The Court has now scheduled the case for argument.  
   Johnny Penry, who in 1979 raped and murdered a 22 year old woman, has been on death row for twenty years. He committed a terrible crime; there has never been any doubt about that. But besides the crime itself, what makes Johnny Penry's case so disturbing is that he has an IQ of 56. What that means is that he has the intelligence of a 6-year old child. 
   Mr. President, 11 years ago the Supreme Court ruled that it is not cruel and unusual punishment to execute the mentally retarded. I disagree with that decision. But more importantly, despite the Supreme Court ruling, 13 States with capital punishment and the Federal Government have forbidden execution of the mentally retarded, and a clear majority of Americans oppose the practice. 
   The State Senator who in 1998 sponsored Nebraska's bill to prohibit execution of the mentally retarded later said that it should not have been necessary because ``no civilized, mature society would ever entertain the possibility of executing anybody who was mentally retarded.'' 
   Executing the mentally retarded is wrong; it is immoral. People with mental retardation have a diminished capacity to understand right from wrong. As Justice Brennan wrote:  
   The impairment of a mentally retarded offender's reasoning ability, control over impulsive behavior, and moral development ..... limits his or her culpability so that, whatever other punishment might be appropriate, the ultimate penalty of death is always and necessarily disproportionate to his or her blameworthiness.  
   Proponents of the death penalty argue that it ``saves lives,'' but executing the mentally retarded cannot be justified on the grounds of deterrence. Let me again quote Justice Brennan, writing in 1989:  
   The very factors that make it disproportionate and unjust to execute the mentally retarded also make the death penalty of the most minimal deterrent effect so far as retarded potential offenders are concerned. Intellectual impairments in logical reasoning, strategic thinking, and foresight, the lack of the intellectual and developmental predicates of an ability to anticipate consequences, and impairment in the ability to control impulsivity, mean that the possibility of receiving the death penalty will not in the case of a mentally retarded person figure in some careful assessment of different courses of action. In these circumstances, the execution of mentally retarded individuals is nothing more than the purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering.  
   People with mental retardation are also more prone to make false confessions simply to please their interrogators, and they are often unable to assist their lawyer in preparing a defense. 
   We saw this with Earl Washington, who had an IQ of 69. Arrested for breaking into a neighbor's home during a drinking spree and hitting her with a chair, Washington readily confessed to a series of unsolved murders that he could not have committed. 
   Beyond all of this, executing the mentally retarded severely damages the standing of the United States in the international community. The United Nations has long condemned this practice. Just last year, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights called on nations ``not to impose the death penalty on a person suffering from any form of mental disorder.'' We should join the overwhelming majority of nations who do not execute the mentally retarded. 
   Johnny Penry suffered relentless and severe physical and psychological abuse as a child, spends his time in prison coloring with crayons and looking at comic books he cannot read, and still believes in Santa Claus. I remember reading that when they stayed his execution he said, ``Does this mean I'm not allowed to have the special meal I was supposed to have?''--The last meal of the condemned man. He could not possibly have assisted meaningfully in his own defense. 
   No one can excuse Johnny Penry's crime, and no one suggests that he should be set free. But the question is what is the appropriate punishment for a defendant who is mentally retarded. 
   Neither our Constitution nor our national conscience permits the execution of a 6-year-old child for committing a heinous crime, and neither should we execute a person with the mental capacity of a 6-year-old. It offends the very idea of justice. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is with great sorrow, but also great pride, that this Senate retires one of its most eloquent, learned, and successful Members--the senior Senator from New York, DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN. 
   I have known my distinguished colleague for over two decades, admiring his compassion, his dedication, and his acumen on key issues, from environmental protection to social, racial, and economic justice for all. It has been an honor and education to have worked with him on the critical issues of eradicating poverty, elevating human rights, and promoting peace around the world. He and I have also worked together closer to home, protecting and restoring the precious waters of Lake Champlain--a glacially-carved jewel of New England that spans 120 northern miles between our neighboring states, half claimed on my side, half claimed on his. 
   Twenty-four years of distinguished service in the United States Senate would be a legacy in and of itself for any man. Yet my colleague, Senator MOYNIHAN, has done so much more. He served our country for a full twenty years in the Naval Reserve, with three years of active Navy duty at the end of the second World War. He has been a Fulbright Scholar and a professor of government at Harvard University. He has the unique distinction of serving in four successive Presidential administrations--the only person in American history to have ever done so. He represented our country as a distinguished Ambassador to India, a representative to the United Nations, and President of the U.N. Security Council. He has served on countless public and private sector commissions, committees, and panels, addressing issues from education to science to finance. Most recently, he chaired the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy--a key commission that examined our nation's secrecy laws and led to his authorship of ``Secrecy: The American Experience.'' This book joins the seventeen other works of literature that my friend and colleague has written or edited. 
   What I will miss in many ways are those special times we would have when some Members would gather in the Senate dining room and a person would bring up a question of history; then we would receive a tutorial from Professor MOYNIHAN. I see my good friend, the deputy Democratic leader, on the floor, the Senator from Nevada, smiling because he knows what those were like. I recall a couple times when we had so many Democrats and Republicans crowded into the Democratic part of the dining room to hear Senator MOYNIHAN tie together something from the time of Franklin Roosevelt through Ronald Reagan, to the current time, and show what the connection was, somebody would have to call up to the Senate Chamber and explain, keep the rollcall going a bit longer; at least a quorum of the Senate has to hear the end of this story before we can come to vote. 
   My good friend will be missed in the Senate, but I wish him well and envy him the time he will now have to spend with his lovely wife of 44 years, Liz, his three wonderful children, and his precious grandchildren. I join the entire Senate and this Nation in wishing Senator MOYNIHAN well in his new life and commending him for his tireless dedication and service to the people of this country and our world.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier today Senator CHUCK ROBB of Virginia spoke on this floor. I worked with him. I have admired him since he came to the Senate over 12 years ago. I talked with this former marine at the time my own son joined the Marine Corps and was touched that he always asked for progress reports on his career in the Marines. 
   He is only the fourth person from the State of Virginia to serve as both Governor and U.S. Senator, and he came to Washington ready to build on a distinguished career in public service. In 1961, he joined the Marines as an infantry company commander in Vietnam, saw combat, and was in harm's way time and time again. He demonstrated the kind of determination and stamina that would characterize his political career. In Vietnam, people depended on his leadership for their life, literally. He then served Virginia as Lieutenant Governor and Governor before being elected to the U.S. Senate. In fact, it is fair to say his tenure as Governor laid the basis for Virginia to become such a leader today in the high-tech industry. 
   During his time here in Washington, he has shown his dedication and concern for our men and women in the military, fighting for a strong defense  while advocating fiscal responsibility. He has been a proponent for improvement in our Nation's public schools, fighting for more teachers, increased school construction, and school safety. He has also been a champion against discrimination. He led the fight to end injustice to African American farmers who faced discrimination by the Agriculture Department and voted against moves to end affirmative action programs by the Federal Government. In all these things, he showed the same dedication to his country in a legislative position that he had shown to his State in his executive position as Governor, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, Foreign Relations and Finance Committees, and the Joint Economic Committee and Select Committee on Intelligence. He served this body, the Senate, so well, and in turn our whole Nation. 
   I think of the tough political battles he has faced. I think of the difficult votes during his time in office, how he had to balance the interests of his State with the well-being of the Nation. But I can remember so many times on this floor when a vote would come up where, politically, CHUCK ROBB could have ducked and ran and voted a different way. He did not, anymore than he would have when he was in combat in Vietnam. He would stay on the floor, he would state his position, and you would see the marine; you would see the character; you would see the steel. He would stand up and do what his conscience told him was the right thing. 
   Mr. President, I pay tribute to a man I have worked with and admired since he came to the Senate over twelve years ago. As only the fourth person from the state of Virginia to serve as both Governor and U.S. Senator CHUCK ROBB came to Washington ready to build on a distinguished career in public service. Beginning in 1961 when he joined the Marines, and through his days as an infantry company commander in Vietnam, CHUCK ROBB demonstrated the kind of determination and stamina that would characterize his political career. He later served Virginia as Lieutenant Governor and Governor before being elected to the United States Senate. 
   During his time here in Washington he has shown his dedication and concern for our men and women in the military, fighting for a strong defense while advocating fiscal responsibility. He has been a proponent for improving our nation's public schools, fighting for more teachers, increased school construction and school safety. He has also been a champion in the battle to end discrimination. He led the fight to bring justice to African American farmers who had faced discrimination by the Agriculture Department, and he voted against a move to end affirmative action programs by the federal government. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, Foreign Relations, Finance Committee, the Joint Economic Committee and the Select Committee on Intelligence he has served the Senate well. 
   Senator ROBB has faced several tough political battles and cast many difficult votes during his time in office--all the while he has been determined to balance the interests of his state with the well-being of the nation. 
   It has been an honor and privilege to work with him over the last years. I know he is going to be sorely missed by our colleagues in the Senate. 
   I will miss having the chance to get advice and encouragement from him on the Senate floor, but I know I will still have that available to me throughout the remaining years of my Senate career. 
   Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation now, as we go down to these waning hours and we hear the choral group downstairs practicing Christmas carols?

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, you know I think the world of all my colleagues. The distinguished Chair right now is one of my best friends in the Senate and one who deserves congratulations on--actually, they didn't have to have an election in his State; he wins by so much. I love being with him, as I do my dear friend from Nevada, the deputy Democratic whip. But I hope that neither of my colleagues takes it at all personally when I say I would probably rather be at home with my family at this time of the year. But then I suspect they would, too. I hope this means we are soon to wrap things up, possibly this evening or Sunday or Monday or sometime. We seem to be in a situation where wrapping up the session is like wrapping up the Presidential election this year. I am beginning to feel a little bit like a hanging chad of some sort. 
   I thought of some of the other terms that have been used, but I am afraid sometime somebody might pull that out of context and I will be reminded that I will not be forgiven for what I may say because of my Irish nature. 
   Let us hope we can wrap it up. I say that also for the sake of the President-elect and the leadership, both Republican and Democrat, in the Senate. All of us have a lot of work to do before January 3 when the Senate comes back into session with a number of new Senators and in a unique situation of a 50-50 Senate. 
   Governor Bush and former Secretary Cheney need time to work with the Republicans in the Senate and the House as they put together their administration. Of course, I hope and expect they will also be in contact with those of us on this side of the aisle. There is a lot facing this Nation, and we have to work on that.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with my dear friend from Nevada, Senator REID, on the floor, I want to talk about his colleague, also my friend, RICHARD BRYAN, who announced his plans to retire from the Senate. When he did, he said very simply and earnestly: It's time to come home. 
   I have known DICK and Bonnie BRYAN since they came here. I say DICK and Bonnie BRYAN because, like Marcelle and me, we think of them as one person because usually at events outside work, when you see one you see the other. In fact, that is what I cherish about both my colleagues from Nevada. I cherish their family life. 
   DICK said it is time to go home, and I am disappointed to learn we are going to lose a good humored and skillful colleague. As a Vermonter, I have to empathize with that deep-rooted impulse to go home. Everything DICK BRYAN has accomplished here paves the way for his return to a better Nevada, something all of us hope for because all of us will leave this body at one time or another. 
   Most of the time, the strength of our Nation stood resolutely with the welfare of Nevada in Senator BRYAN's mind. As Democratic cochair of the Senate National Guard Caucus, he blocked unwise and unjustifiable cuts in our citizen-soldier force. He brought us together so the Guard's voice could be heard, and his persistence has positioned this invaluable force to prepare for the new, continually emerging strategic landscape. Under his watch, Nellis Air Force Base became a national treasure, where our best, most skilled pilots mastered the art of war so that our country would never have to call on them for the real thing. 
   Senator BRYAN guaranteed the credibility of the institution of the Senate. I think of the Senate as being the conscience of the Nation, and we should be the guardians of it. Those who abused the public's trust and the powers of office, as Senators knew they would, received intense scrutiny when Senator BRYAN chaired the Ethics Committee in 1993 and 1994. None of us will forget his calm and dexterous handling of numerous sensitive investigations, something he could do because he was trusted by both Republicans and Democrats to do the right thing. 
   It had to be one of the most difficult times, requiring arduous work by any Senator, but never once did any of us hear Senator BRYAN complain about the difficult task, nor did he swerve from the steady course toward fairness and justice. 
   Indeed, in so many areas, RICHARD BRYAN made a difference whether in preserving the fragile desert environment or modernizing our commercial aviation system. The list is long, and if he stayed, he would have accomplished even more. 
   Senator BRYAN has made a choice that deserves only accolades and respect. He is going home, and Nevada is a fortunate State for it. It is also fortunate that he has left his partner, HARRY REID, here to carry on his battles. My wife Marcelle and I wish DICK and his wife Bonnie all the best, but I am going to miss some of our late night conversations and some of the humor and good will he has shown to all Senators. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the greatest pleasures of being a Senator is working with fellow-members like FRANK LAUTENBERG. Few Senators have brought more dedication and experience to their service in this body. 
   I will never forget how excited my father was to meet Senator LAUTENBERG when he first came here almost 18 years ago. My father of proud Irish decent followed FRANK's first campaign. There was a wonderful connection between the two of them, and I am forever grateful to Senator LAUTENBERG for the lovely letter of condolence that he sent me when my father passed away. FRANK LAUTENBERG is first and foremost a good friend. 
   Of course, Senator LAUTENBERG is also a skilled legislator. We served together for years on the Appropriations Committee. Recently, the committee debated an amendment to the Defense bill that would lead to the withdrawal of U.S. troops to Kosovo. A veteran of the European theater in World War II and the builder of a data processing empire, Senator LAUTENBERG understood that democratic stability could come only through a long-term and patient investment in peace. 
   What made Senator LAUTENBERG's argument so effective was not just the ideas he possessed but the way he delivered them. He has a rhetorical force that I have always admired, and I think that this ability to marry sound ideas with effective speech-making is what makes him such a stellar member. 
   Of course, Senator LAUTENBERG had a number of legislative accomplishments. He helped make our democracy more transparent, opposing confusing smoke and mirrors as a Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee. He promoted international justice, fervently urging the prosecution of war criminals. Senator LAUTENBERG understood that reconciliation and economic growth could not come until these perpetrators are held responsible and punished for their actions. At home, Senator LAUTENBERG laid the foundation for our strong economic growth of the last decade. Amtrak and commercial aviation had no greater friend than Senator LAUTENBERG, who confidently chaired the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation. And he has improved the public's health, encouraging restrictions on tobacco use and ensuring the cleanup of hazardous waste sites. 
   In his 18 years here, Senator LAUTENBERG had an impact that goes beyond his important votes and the bills he sponsored. Through his experience and knowledge, he was steadfast advocate for freedom, fairness, and responsibility. He kept these ideal on an unalterable course, and we are all in his debt for it.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we consider three bipartisan measures offered together as a package: the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor Act, H.R. 46; the Computer Crime Enforcement Act, which I introduced as S. 1314, on July 1, 1999, with Senator DEWINE and is now also co-sponsored by Senators ROBB, HATCH and ABRAHAM; and a Hatch-Leahy-Schumer ``Internet Security Act'' amendment. I thank my colleagues for their hard work on these pieces of legislation, each of which I will discuss in turn. 
   I support the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor Act. I cosponsored the Stevens bill, S. 39, to establish a Public Safety Medal of Valor. In April and May, 1999, I made sure that the Senate acted on Senator STEVENS' bill, S. 39. 
   On April 22, 1999, the Senate Judiciary Committee took up that measure in regular order and reported it unanimously. At that time I congratulated Senator STEVENS and thanked him for his leadership. I noted that we had worked together on a number of law enforcement matters and that the senior Senator from Alaska is a stalwart supporter of the men and women who put themselves at risk to protect us all. I said that I looked forward to enactment of this measure and to seeing the extraordinary heroism of our police, firefighters and correctional officers recognized with the Medal of Valor. 
   On May 18, 1999, I was privileged to be on the floor of the Senate when we proceeded to consider S. 39 and passed it unanimously. I took that occasion to commend Senator STEVENS and all who had worked so hard to move this measure in a timely way. That was over one year ago, during National Police Week last year. The measure was sent to the House where it lay dormant for the rest of last year and most of this one. 
   The President of the United States came to Capitol Hill to speak at the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Service on May 15, 2000, and said on that occasion that if Congress would not act on the Medal of Valor, he was instructing the Attorney General to explore ways to award such recognition by Executive action. 
   Unfortunately, these calls for action did not waken the House from its slumber on this matter and the House of Representatives refused to pass the Senate-passed Medal of Valor bill. Instead, over the past year, the House has insisted that the Senate take up, fix and pass the House-passed version of this measure if it is to become law. House members have indicated that they are now prepared to accept most of the Senate-passed text, but insist that it be enacted under the House bill number. In order to get this important measure to the President, that is what we are doing today. We are discharging the House-passed version of that bill, H.R. 46, from the Judiciary Committee, adopting a complete substitute, and sending it back to the House. 
   I have worked with Senator HATCH, Senator STEVENS and others to perfect the final version of this bill. We have crafted bipartisan improvements to ensure that the Medal of Valor Board will worked effectively and efficiently with the National Medal of Valor Office within the Department of Justice. Our legislation establishes both of these entities and it is essential that they work well together to design the Medal of Valor and to create the criteria and procedures for recommendations of nominees for the award. The men and women who will be honored by the Medal of Valor for their brave deeds deserve nothing less. 
   The information age is filled with unlimited potential for good, but it also creates a variety of new challenges for law enforcement. A recent survey by the FBI and the Computer Security Institute found that 62 percent of information security professionals reported computer security breaches in the past year. These breaches in computer security resulted in financial losses of more than $120 million from fraud, theft of  information, sabotage, computer viruses, and stolen laptops. Computer crime has become a multi-billion dollar problem. 
   Many of us have worked on these issues for years. In 1984, we passed the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to criminalize conduct when carried out by means of unauthorized access to a computer. In 1986, we passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), which I was proud to sponsor, to criminalize tampering with electronic mail systems and remote data processing systems and to protect the privacy of computer users. In 1994, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act included the Computer Abuse Amendments which I authored to make illegal the intentional transmission of computer viruses. 
   In the 104th Congress, Senators KYL, GRASSLEY and I worked together to enact the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act to increase protection under federal criminal law for both government and private computers, and to address an emerging problem of computer-age blackmail in which a criminal threatens to harm or shut down a computer system unless their extortion demands are met. In the 105th Congress, Senators KYL and I also worked together on criminal copyright amendments that became law to enhance the protection of copyrighted works online. 
   The Congress must be constantly vigilant to keep the law up-to-date with technology. The Computer Crime Enforcement Act, S. 1314, and the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer ``Internet Security Act'' amendment are part of that ongoing effort. These complementary pieces of legislation reflect twin-track progress against computer crime: More tools at the federal level and more resources for local computer crime enforcement. The fact that this is a bipartisan effort is good for technology policy. 
   But make no mistake about it: even with passage of this legislation, there is more work to be done--both to assist law enforcement and to safeguard the privacy and other important constitutional rights of our citizens. I wish that the Congress had also tackled online privacy in 
   this session, but that will now be punted into the next congressional session. 
   The legislation before us today does not attempt to resolve every issue. For example, both the Senate and the House held hearings this session about the FBI's Carnivore program. Carnivore is a computer program designed to advance criminal investigations by capturing information in Internet communications pursuant to court orders. Those hearings sparked a good debate about whether advances in technology, like Carnivore, require Congress to pass new legislation to assure that our private Internet communications are protected from government over-reaching while protecting the government's right to investigate crime. I look forward to our discussion of these privacy issues in the next Congress. 
   The Computer Crime Enforcement Act is intended to help states and local agencies in fighting computer crime. All 50 states have now enacted tough computer crime control laws. They establish a firm groundwork for electronic commerce, an increasingly important sector of the nation's economy. 
   Unfortunately, too many state and local law enforcement agencies are struggling to afford the high cost of enforcing their state computer crime statutes. Earlier this year, I released a survey on computer crime in Vermont. My office surveyed 54 law enforcement agencies in Vermont--43 police departments and 11 State's attorney offices--on their experience investigating and prosecuting computer crimes. The survey found that more than half of these Vermont law enforcement agencies encounter computer crime, with many police departments and state's attorney offices handling 2 to 5 computer crimes per month. 
   Despite this documented need, far too many law enforcement agencies in Vermont cannot afford the cost of policing against computer crimes. Indeed, my survey found that 98 percent of the responding Vermont law enforcement agencies do not have funds dedicated for use in computer crime enforcement. My survey also found that few law enforcement officers in Vermont are properly trained in investigating computer crimes and analyzing cyber-evidence. 
   According to my survey, 83 percent of responding law enforcement agencies in Vermont do not employ officers properly trained in computer crime investigative techniques. Moreover, my survey found that 52 percent of the law enforcement agencies that handle one or more computer crimes per month cited their lack of training as a problem encountered during investigations. Without the necessary education, training and technical support, our law enforcement officers are and will continue to be hamstrung in their efforts to crack down on computer crimes. 
   I crafted the Computer Crime Enforcement Act, S. 1314, to address this problem. The bill would authorize a $25 million Department of Justice grant program to help states prevent and prosecute computer crime. Grants under our bipartisan bill may be used to provide education, training, and enforcement programs for local law enforcement officers and prosecutors in the rapidly growing field of computer criminal justice. Our legislation has been endorsed by the Information Technology Association of America and the Fraternal Order of Police. This is an important bipartisan effort to provide our state and local partners in crime-fighting with the resources they need to address computer crime. 
   The Internet Security Act of 2000 makes progress to ensure that we are properly dealing with the increase in computer crime. I thank and commend Senators HATCH and SCHUMER for working with me and other Members of the Judiciary Committee to address some of the serious concerns we had with the first iteration of their bill, S. 2448, as it was originally introduced. 
   Specifically, as introduced, S. 2448 would have over-federalized minor computer abuses. Currently, federal jurisdiction exists for a variety of computer crimes if, and only if, such criminal offenses result in at least $5,000 of damage or cause another specified injury, including the impairment of medical treatment, physical injury to a person or a threat to public safety. S. 2448, as introduced, would have eliminated the $5,000 jurisdictional threshold and thereby criminalized a variety of minor computer abuses, regardless of whether any significant harm resulted. 
   For example, if an overly-curious college sophomore checks a professor's unattended computer to see what grade he is going to get and accidently deletes a file or a message, current Federal law does not make that conduct a crime. That conduct may be cause for discipline at the college, but not for the FBI to swoop in and investigate. Yet, under the original S. 2448, as introduced, this unauthorized access to the professor's computer would have constituted a federal crime. 
   Another example is that of a teenage hacker, who plays a trick on a friend by modifying the friend's vanity Web page. Under current law, no federal crime has occurred. Yet, under the original S. 2448, as introduced, this conduct would have constituted a federal crime. 
   As America Online correctly noted in a June, 2000 letter, ``eliminating the $5,000 threshold for both criminal and civil violations would risk criminalizing a wide range of essentially benign conduct and engendering needless litigation.......'' Similarly, the Internet Alliance commented in a June, 2000 letter that ``[c]omplete abolition of the limit will lead to needless federal prosecution of often trivial offenses that can be reached under state law.......'' 
   Those provisions were overkill. Our federal laws do not need to reach each and every minor, inadvertent and harmless computer abuse--after all, each of the 50 states has its own computer crime laws. Rather, our federal laws need to reach those offenses for which federal jurisdiction is appropriate. 
   Prior Congresses have declined to over-federalize computer offenses as originally proposed in S. 2448, as introduced, and sensibly determined that not all computer abuses warrant federal criminal sanctions. When the computer crime law was first enacted in 1984, the House Judiciary Committee reporting the bill stated:  
   The Federal jurisdictional threshold is that there must be $5,000 worth of benefit to the defendant or loss to another in order to concentrate Federal resources on the more substantial computer offenses that affect  interstate or foreign commerce. (H.Rep. 98-894, at p. 22, July 24, 1984).  
   Similarly, the Senate Judiciary Committee under the chairmanship of Senator THURMOND, rejected suggestions in 1986 that ``the Congress should enact as sweeping a Federal statute as possible so that no computer crime is potentially uncovered.'' (S. Rep. 99-432, at p. 4, September 3, 1986). 
   The Hatch-Leahy-Schumer substitute amendment to S. 2448, which was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee on October 5th, addresses those federalism concerns by retaining the $5,000 jurisdictional threshold in current law. That Committee-reported substitute amendment, with the additional refinements reflected in the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security Act amendment to H.R. 46, which the Senate considers today, makes other improvements to the original bill and current law, as summarized below. 
   First, titles II, III, IV and V of the original bill, S. 2448, about which various problems had been raised, are eliminated. For example, title V of the original bill would have authorized the Justice Department to enter into Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLAT) with foreign governments that would allow the Attorney General broad discretion to investigate lawful conduct in the U.S. at the request of foreign governments without regard to whether the conduct investigated violates any Federal computer crime law. In my view, that discretion was too broad and troubling. 
   Second, the amendment includes an authorization of appropriations of $5 million to the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property (CCIP) section within the Justice Department's Criminal Division and requires the Attorney General to make the head of CCIP a ``Deputy Assistant Attorney General,'' which is not a Senate-confirmed position, in order to highlight the increasing importance and profile of this position. This authorized funding level is consistent with an amendment I sponsored and circulated to Members of the Judiciary Committee to improve S. 2448 and am pleased to see it incorporated into the Internet Security Act amendment to H.R. 46. 
   Third, the amendment modifies section 1030 of title 18, United States Code, in several important ways, including providing for increased and enhanced penalties for serious violations of federal computer crime laws, clarifying the definitions of ``loss'' to ensure that the full costs to a hacking victim are taken into account and of ``protected computer'' to facilitate investigations of international computer crimes affecting the United States, and preserving the existing $5,000 threshold and other jurisdictional prerequisites for violations of section 1030(a)(5)--i.e., no Federal crime has occurred unless the conduct (1) causes loss to 1 or more persons during any 1-year period aggregating at least $5,000 in value, (2) impairs the medical care of another person, (3) causes physical injury to another person, (4) threatens public health or safety, or (5) causes damage affecting a computer system used by or for a government entity in furtherance of the administration of justice, national defense, or national security. 
   The amendment clarifies the precise elements of the offense the government must prove in order to establish a violation by moving these prerequisites from the current definition of ``damage'' to the description of the offense. In addition, the amendment creates a new category of felony violations where a hacker causes damage to a computer system used by or for a government entity in furtherance of the administration of justice, national defense, or national security. 
   Currently, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act provides for federal criminal penalties for those who intentionally access a protected computer or cause an unauthorized transmission to a protected computer and cause damage. ``Protected computer'' is defined to include those that are ``used in interstate or foreign commerce.'' See 18 U.S.C. 1030(e)(2)(B). The amendment would clarify the definition of ``protected computer'' to ensure that computers which are used in interstate or foreign commerce but are located outside of the United States are included within the definition of ``protected computer'' when those computers are used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or communication of this country. This will ensure that our government will be able to conduct domestic investigations and prosecutions against hackers from this country who hack into foreign computer systems and against those hacking though the United States to other foreign venues. Moreover, by clarifying the fact that a domestic offense exists, the United States will be able to use speedier domestic procedures in support of international hacker cases, and create the option of prosecuting such criminals in the United States. 
   The amendment also adds a definition of ``loss'' to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Current law defines the term ``damage'' to include impairment of the integrity or availability of data, programs, systems or information causing a ``loss aggregating at least $5,000 in value during any 1-year period to one or more individuals.'' See 18 U.S.C. &#167;1030(e)(8)(A). The new definition of ``loss'' to be added as section 1030(e)(11) will ensure that the full costs to victims of responding to hacking offenses, conducting damage assessments, restoring systems and data to the condition they were in before an attack, as well as lost revenue and costs incurred because of an interruption in service, are all counted. This statutory definition is consistent with the definition of ``loss'' appended by the U.S. Sentencing Commission to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines (see U.S.S.G. &#167;2B1.1 Commentary, Application note 2), and will help reconcile procedures by which prosecutors value loss for charging purposes and by which judges value loss for sentencing purposes. Getting this type of true accounting of ``loss'' is important because loss amounts can be used to calculate restitution and to determine the appropriate sentence for the perpetrator under the sentencing guidelines. 
   Fourth, section 303(e) of the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security Act amendment to H.R. 46 clarifies the grounds for obtaining damages in civil actions for violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Current law authorizes a person who suffers ``damage or loss'' from a violation of section 1030 to sue the violator for compensatory damages or injunctive or other equitable relief, and limits the remedy to ``economic damages'' for violations ``involving damage as defined in 
   subsection (e)(8)(A),'' relating to violations of 1030(a)(5) that cause loss aggregating at least $5,000 during any 1-year period. Current law does not contain a definition of ``loss,'' which is being added by this amendment. 
   To take account of both the new definition of ``loss'' and the incorporation of the requisite jurisdictional thresholds into the description of the offense (rather than the current definition of ``damage''), the amendment to subsection (g) makes several changes. First, the amendment strikes the reference to subsection (e)(8)(A) in the current civil action provision and retains Congress' previous intent to allow civil plaintiffs only economic damages for violations of section 1030(a)(5) that do not also affect medical treatment, cause physical injury, threaten public health and safety or affect computer systems used in furtherance of the administration of justice, the national defense or national security. 
   Second, the amendment clarifies that civil actions under section 1030, and not just 1030(a)(5), are limited to conduct that involves one of the factors enumerated in new subsection (a)(5)(B), namely, the conduct (1) causes loss to 1 or more persons during any 1-year period aggregating at least $5,000 in value, (2) impairs the medical care of another person, (3) causes physical injury to another person, (4) threatens public health or safety, or (5) causes damage affecting a computer system used by or for a government entity in furtherance of the administration of justice, national defense, or national security. This clarification is consistent with judicial constructions of the statute, requiring proof of the $5,000 loss threshold as a prerequisite for civil suit, for example, under subsection 1030(a)(2)(C). See, e.g., America Online, Inc. v. LCGM, Inc., 46 F.Supp. 2d 444, 450 (E.D. Va. 1998) (court granted summary judgment on claim under 1030(a)(2)(C), stating, ``[p]laintiff asserts that as a result of defendants' actions, it suffered damages exceeding $5,000, the statutory threshold requirement'').  
   While proof of ``loss'' is required, this amendment preserves current law that civil enforcement of certain violations of section 1030 is available without requiring proof of ``damage,'' which is defined in the amendment to mean ``any impairment to the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system, or information.'' In fact, only subsection 1030(a)(5) requires proof of ``damage''; civil enforcement of other subsections of this law may proceed without such proof. Thus, only the factors enumerated in new subsection (a)(5)(B), and not its introductory language referring to conduct described in subsection (a)(5)(A), constitute threshold requirements for civil suits for violations of section 1030 other than subsection 1030(a)(5). 
   Finally, the amendment adds a new sentence to subsection 1030(g) clarifying that civil actions may not be brought ``for the negligent design or manufacture of computer hardware, computer software, or firmware.'' 
   The Congress provided this civil remedy in the 1994 amendments to the Act, which I originally sponsored with Senator Gordon Humphrey, to enhance privacy protection for computer communications and the information stored on computers by encouraging institutions to improve computer security practices, deterring unauthorized persons from trespassing on computer systems of others, and supplementing the resources of law enforcement in combating computer crime. [See The Computer Abuse Amendments Act of 1990: Hearing Before the Subcomm. On Technology and the Law of the Senate Comm. On the Judiciary, 101st Cong., 2nd Sess., S. Hrg. 101-1276, at pp. 69, 88, 92 (1990); see also Statement of Senator Humphrey, 136 Cong. Rec. S18235 (1990) (``Given the Government's limited capacity to pursue all computer crime cases, the existence of this limited civil remedy will serve to enhance deterrence in this critical area.'')]. The ``new, civil remedy for those harmed by violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act'' was intended to ``boost the deterrence of the statute by allowing aggrieved individuals to obtain relief.'' [S. Rep. No. 101-544, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 6-7 (1990); see also Statement of Senator LEAHY, 136 Cong. Rec. S18234 (1990)]. We certainly and expressly did not want to ``open the floodgates to frivolous litigation.'' [Statement of Senator LEAHY, 136 Cong. Rec. S4614 (1990)]. 
   At the time the civil remedy provision was added to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, this Act contained no prohibition against negligently causing damage to a computer through unauthorized access, reflected in current law, 18 U.S.C.  1030(a)(5)(C). That prohibition was added only with subsequent amendments made in 1996, as part of the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. Nevertheless, the civil remedy has been interpreted in some cases to apply to the negligent manufacture of computer hardware or software. See, e.g., Shaw v. Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc., NEC, 91 F.Supp. 2d 926 (E.D. TX 1999) (court interpreted the term transmission to include sale of computers with a minor design defect). 
   The Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security Act amendment to subsection 1030(g) is intended to ensure that the civil remedy is a robust option for private enforcement actions, while limiting its applicability to negligence cases that are more appropriately governed by contractual warranties, state tort law and consumer protection laws. 
   Fifth, sections 304 and 309 of the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security Act amendment to H.R. 46 authorize criminal forfeiture of computers, equipment, and other personal property used to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as well as real and personal property derived from the proceeds of computer crime. Property, both real and personal, which is derived from proceeds traceable to a violation of section 1030, is currently subject to both criminal and civil forfeiture. See 18 U.S.C.  981(a)(1)(C) and 982(a)(2)(B). Thus, the amendment would clarify in section 1030 itself that forfeiture applies and extend the application of forfeiture to property that is used or intended to be used to commit or to facilitate the commission of a computer crime. In addition, to deter and prevent piracy, theft and counterfeiting of intellectual property, the section 309 of the amendment allows forfeiture of devices, such as replicators or other devices used to copy or produce computer programs to which counterfeit labels have been affixed. 
   The criminal forfeiture provision in section 304 specifically states that only the ``interest of such person,'' referring to the defendant who committed the computer crime, is subject to forfeiture. Moreover, the criminal forfeiture authorized by Sections 304 and 309 is made expressly subject to Section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, but 
   subsection (d) of section 413 is expressly exempted from application to Section 304 and 309. That subsection (d) creates a rebuttable presumption of forfeiture in favor of the government where a person convicted of a felony acquired the property during the period that the crime was committed or within a reasonable time after such period and there was no likely source for such property other than the criminal violation. Thus, by making subsection (d) inapplicable, Sections 304 and 309 make it more difficult for the government to prove that the property should be forfeited. 
   Sixth, unlike the version reported by the Judiciary Committee, the amendment does not require that prior delinquency adjudications of juveniles for violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act be counted under the definition of ``conviction'' for purposes of enhanced penalties. This is an improvement that I urged since juvenile adjudications simply are not criminal convictions. Juvenile proceedings are more informal than adult prosecutions and are not subject to the same due process protections. Consequently, counting juvenile adjudications as a prior conviction for purposes of the recidivist sanctions under the amendment would be unduly harsh and unfair. In any event, prior juvenile delinquency adjudications are already subject to sentencing enhancements under certain circumstances under the Sentencing Guidelines. See, e.g., U.S.S.G.  411.2(d) (upward adjustments in sentences required for each juvenile sentence to confinement of at least sixty days and for each juvenile sentence imposed within five years of the defendant's commencement of instant offense). 
   Seventh, the amendment changes a current directive to the Sentencing Commission enacted as section 805 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, P.L. 104-132, that imposed a 6-month mandatory minimum sentence for any conviction of the sections 1030(a)(4) or (a)(5) of title 18, United States code. The Administration has noted that ``[i]n some instances, prosecutors have exercised their discretion and elected not to charge some defendants whose actions otherwise would qualify them for prosecution under the statute, knowing that the result would be mandatory imprisonment.'' Clearly, mandatory imprisonment is not always the most appropriate remedy for a federal criminal violation, and the ironic result of this ``get tough'' proposal has been to discourage prosecutions that might otherwise have gone forward. The amendment eliminates that mandatory minimum term of incarceration for misdemeanor and less serious felony computer crimes. 
   Eighth, section 310 of the amendment directs the Sentencing Commission to review and, where appropriate, adjust sentencing guidelines for computer crimes to address a variety of factors, including to ensure that the guidelines provide sufficiently stringent penalties to deter and punish persons who intentionally use encryption in connection with the commission or concealment of criminal acts. 
   The Sentencing Guidelines already provide for enhanced penalties when persons obstruct or impede the administration of justice, see U.S.S.G. 3C1.1, or engage in more than minimal planning, see U.S.S.G. 2B1.1(b)(4)(A). As the use of encryption technology becomes more widespread, additional guidance from the Sentencing Commission would be helpful to determine the circumstances when such encryption use would warrant a guideline adjustment. For example, if a defendant employs an encryption product that works automatically and transparently with a telecommunications service or software product, an enhancement for use of encryption may not be appropriate, while the deliberate use of  encryption as part of a sophisticated and intricate scheme to conceal criminal activity and make the offense, or its extent, difficult to detect, may warrant a guideline enhancement either under existing guidelines or a new guideline. 
   Ninth, the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security Act amendment to H.R. 46 would eliminate certain statutory restrictions on the authority of the United States Secret Service ("Secret Service''). Under current law, the Secret Service is authorized to investigate offenses under six designated subsections of 18 U.S.C.  1030, subject to agreement between the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General: subsections (a)(2)(A) (illegally accessing a computer and obtaining financial information); (a)(2)(B) (illegally accessing a computer and obtaining information from a department or agency of the United States); (a)(3) (illegally accessing a non-public computer of a department or agency of the United States either exclusively used by the United States or used by the United States and the conduct affects that use by or for the United States); (a)(4) (accessing a protected computer with intent to defraud and thereby furthering the fraud and obtaining a thing of value, unless the object of the fraud and the thing obtained consists only of the use of the computer and the value of such use is not more than $5,000 in a one-year period); (a)(5) (knowingly causing the transmission of a program, information, code or command and thereby intentionally and without authorization causing damage to a protected computer; and illegally accessing a protected computer and causing damage recklessly or otherwise); and (a)(6) (trafficking in a password with intent to defraud). 
   Under current law, the Secret Service is not authorized to investigate offenses under subsection (a)(1) (accessing a computer and obtaining information relating to national security with reason to believe the information could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of a foreign nation and willfully retaining or transmitting that information or attempting to do so); (a)(2)(C) (illegally accessing a protected computer and obtaining information where the conduct involves an interstate or foreign communication); and (a)(7) (transmitting a threat to damage a protected computer with intent to extort). 
   The Internet Security Act removes these limitations on the authority of the Secret Service and authorizes the Secret Service to investigate any offense under Section 1030 relating to its jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C.  3056 and subject to agreement between the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General. This provision also makes clear that the FBI retains primary authority to investigate offenses under subsection 1030(a)(1). 
   Prior to 1996 amendments to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Secret Service was authorized to investigate all violations of Section 1030. According to the 1996 Committee Reports of the 104th Congress, 2nd Session, the 1996 amendments attempted to concentrate the Secret Service's jurisdiction on certain subsections considered to be within the Secret Service's 
   traditional jurisdiction and not grant authority in matters with a national security nexus. According to the Administration, which first proposed the elimination of these statutory restrictions in connection with transmittal of its comprehensive crime bill, the ``21st Century Law Enforcement and Public Safety Act,'' however, these specific enumerations of investigative authority ``have the potential to complicate investigations and impede interagency cooperation.'' (See Section-by-section Analysis, SEC. 3082, for ``21st Century Law Enforcement and Public Safety Act''). 
   The current restrictions, for example, risk hindering the Secret Service from investigating ``hacking'' into White House computers or investigating threats against the President that may be delivered by such a ``hacker,'' and fulfilling its mission to protect financial institutions and the nation's financial infrastructure. The provision thus modifies existing law to restore the Secret Service's authority to investigate violations of Section 1030, leaving it to the Departments of Treasury and Justice to determine between them how to allocate workload and particular cases. This arrangement is consistent with other jurisdictional grants of authority to the Secret Service. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C.  1029(d), 3056(b)(3). 
   Tenth, section 307 of the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security Act amendment would provide an additional defense to civil actions relating to preserving records in response to government requests. Current law authorizes civil actions and criminal liability for unauthorized interference with or disclosures of electronically stored wire or electronic communications under certain circumstances. 18 U.S.C.  2701, et seq. A provision of that statutory scheme makes clear that it is a complete defense to civil and criminal liability if the person or entity interfering with or attempting to disclose a communication does so in good faith reliance on a court warrant or order, grand jury subpoena, legislative or statutory authorization. 18 U.S.C.  2707(e)(1). 
   Current law, however, does not address one scenario under which a person or entity might also have a complete defense. A provision of the same statutory scheme currently requires providers of wire or electronic communication services and remote computing services, upon request of a governmental entity, to take all necessary steps to preserve records and other evidence in its possession for a renewal period of 90 days pending the issuance of a court order or other process requiring disclosure of the records or other evidence. 18 U.S.C.  2703(f). Section 2707(e)(1), which describes the circumstances under which a person or entity would have a complete defense to civil or criminal liability, fails to identify good faith reliance on a governmental request pursuant to Section 2703(f) as another basis for a complete defense. Section 307 modifies current law by addressing this omission and expressly providing that a person or entity who acts in good faith reliance on a governmental request pursuant to Section 2703(f) also has a complete defense to civil and criminal liability. 
   Finally, the bill authorizes construction and operation of a National Cyber Crime Technical Support Center and 10 regional computer forensic labs that will provide education, training, and forensic examination capabilities for State and local law enforcement officials charged with investigating computer crimes. The section authorizes a total of $100 million for FY 2001, of which $20 million shall be available solely for the 10 regional labs and would complement the state computer crime grant bill, S. 1314, with which this bill is offered.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support for the International Criminal Court, ICC. Like all Senators, indeed like all Americans, I understand the need to safeguard innocent human life in wartime, at the same time that we ensure that the rights of our military personnel are protected. The Rome Treaty establishing the International Criminal Court will achieve both those goals, and I urge President Clinton to sign the Treaty before the December 31 deadline. 
   The Treaty was approved overwhelmingly two years ago by a vote of 120 to 7. Since then, 117 nations have signed the Treaty--including every one of our NATO allies except Turkey, all of the European Union members, and Russia. Regrettably, the U.S. joined a handful of human rights violators like Libya and Iraq in voting against it. Only one of our democratic allies voted with us, and it is quite possible that we will end up as the only democratic country that is not a party to the Court. 
   During the last century, an estimated 170 million civilians were the victims of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Despite this appalling carnage, the response from the international community has been, at best, sporadic, and at worst, nonexistent. 
   While there was progress immediately following World War II at Nuremberg and Tokyo, the Cold War saw the international community largely abdicate its responsibility and fail to bring to justice those responsible for unspeakable crimes, from Cambodia to Uganda to El Salvador. 
   In the 1990s, there was renewed progress. The U.N. Security Council established a tribunal at The Hague to prosecute genocide and other atrocities committed in the Former Yugoslavia. A second tribunal was formed in response to the horrific massacre of more than 800,000 people in Rwanda. 
   In addition, individual nations have increasingly taken action against those who have committed these crimes. 
   Spain pursued General Pinochet, and he may yet be prosecuted in Chile. The Spanish Government has requested Mexico to extradite Richardo Miguel Cavallo, a former Argentine naval officer who served under the military junta, on charges that include the torture of Spanish citizens. 
   A number of human rights cases have also been heard in U.S. civil courts. In August, 2000, $745 million was awarded to a group of refugees from the Balkans who accused Radovan Karadzic of conducting a campaign of genocide, rape, and torture in the early 1990s. Also that month, an organization representing Chinese students who are suing the Chinese Government for its brutality during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, successfully served papers on Li Peng, the former Chinese Premier, as part of an ongoing lawsuit. 
   They are important steps towards holding individuals accountable, deterring future atrocities, and strengthening peace. But the ICC would fill significant gaps in the existing patchwork of ad hoc tribunals and national courts. For example: 
   A permanent international court sends a clear signal that those who commit war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide will be brought to justice. 
   By eliminating the uncertainty and protracted negotiations that surround the creation of ad hoc tribunals, the Court will be more quickly available for investigations and justice will be achieved sooner. 
   International crimes tried in national courts can result in conflicting decisions and varying penalties. Moreover, sometimes governments take unilateral actions, even including kidnaping, to enforce prosecutorial and judicial decisions. The Court will help to avoid these problems. 
   The Court will act in accordance with fundamental standards of due process, allowing the accused to receive fairer trials than in many national courts. 
   In the past, when the international community established war crimes tribunals, the United States was at the forefront of those efforts. The performance of the U.S. delegation at Rome was no different. The U.S. ensured that the Court will serve our national interests by being a strong, effective institution and one that will not be prone to frivolous prosecutions. 
   Why then did the United States oppose the Treaty, despite getting almost everything it wanted in the negotiations? Many observers feel that it was because the Administration could not get iron-clad guarantees that no American servicemen and women would ever, under any circumstances, come before the Court. A related concern was that the Treaty empowers the Court to indict and prosecute the nationals of any country, even countries that are not party to the Treaty. 
   The legitimate concern about prosecutions of American soldiers by the Court, while not trivial, arises from a misunderstanding of the Court's role.  The U.S. has been successful in obtaining important safeguards to prevent political prosecutions: 
   First, the ICC is neither designed nor intended to supplant independent and effective judicial systems such as the U.S. courts. Under the principle of ``complementarity'', the Court can act only when national courts are either unwilling or unable to prosecute. 
   Second, the Court would only prosecute the most atrociousinternational crimes such as genocide and crimes against humanity. The U.S. was instrumental in defining the elements of these crimes and in establishing high thresholds to ensure that the Court would deal with only the most egregious offenses. 
   Third, the Court incorporates the rigorous criteria put forth by the United States for the selection of judges, ensuring that these jurists will be independent and among the most qualified 
   in world. Further, the Rome Treaty provides for high standards for the selection of the prosecutor and deputy prosecutor, who can be removed by a vote of the majority of states parties. 
   Finally, the Court provides for several checks against spurious complaints, investigations, and prosecutions. Before an investigation can occur, the prosecution must get approval from a three-judge pre-trial chamber, which is then subject to appeal. Moreover, the U.N. Security Council can vote to suspend an investigation or prosecution for up to one year, on a renewable basis, giving the Security Council a collective veto over the Court. 
   Because of these safeguards, our democratic allies--Canada, England, France, Ireland--with thousands of troops deployed overseas in international peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, have signed the Treaty. 
   The Pentagon has, from day one, argued that the United States should not sign the Treaty unless we are guaranteed that no United States soldier will ever come before the Court. In other words ``we will sign the Treaty, as long as it does not apply to us.'' That is a totally untenable position, which not surprisingly has not received a shred of support from other governments, including our allies and friends. 
   There is no doubt that further negotiations can improve the ICC, but it is unrealistic to expect to single out one's own citizens for immunity, in every circumstance, from the jurisdiction of an international court. If that were possible, what would prevent other nations from demanding similar treatment? The Court's effectiveness would be undermined. 
   Moreover, as the United States--which has refused to sign the treaty banning landmines, or to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty, or to pay our U.N. dues--is perceived as acting as if it is above the law, nations may begin to think ``why should we honor our international commitments?'' If the U.S. becomes increasingly isolated, our soldiers will face greater, not less, risk. 
   Such increasing risk is wholly unnecessary. Our Armed Forces are known globally for their strict adherence to international humanitarian law and conventions governing the conduct of a military in wartime. Signing the Rome Treaty would be the clearest indication possible that we are proud of this record, and are working every day to uphold it. 
   Mr. President, I too am troubled by the precedent of exerting jurisdiction over non-party nationals. While this is a key component of the Treaty which prevents rogue nations from shielding war criminals from the Court's jurisdiction by refusing to become a party, it could also invite mischief in the future. What if, for example, a dozen states were to join in a treaty that asserts jurisdiction over non-parties for the explicit purpose of targeting the citizens of the United States and its allies? Will the Rome Treaty set a precedent that could make this more likely? 
   In fact, there is nothing to prevent that from happening today, and it is highly unlikely that such treaties would achieve legitimacy. They would almost certainly not become recognized parts of international law and convention. While it is essential that we do everything possible to protect the rights of American citizens, we also want an effective Court. Indeed, there are almost certainly to be circumstances when we would support ICC jurisdiction over non-party nationals. 
   Critics argue that the United States should ``block'' the ICC. They are misinformed. That is not an option. The requisite 60 countries are going to ratify the Treaty, and the Court will have jurisdiction over citizens of non-parties, whether or not the U.S. signs. 
   The real issue is whether we sign the Treaty and enable the U.S. to continue to play a crucial role in shaping the ICC, ensuring that it serves its intended purpose of prosecuting the most heinous crimes--not the U.S. Air Force pilot who mistakenly bombs the wrong target, a tragic but inevitable consequence of war. It is instructive, for those who raise the specter of political prosecutions, that the Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia--which, like the ICC, the U.S. had a key role in shaping--declined to investigate allegations of war crimes resulting from NATO bombing of Serbia. We will be in a far better position to protect the rights of American citizens if the Court must answer to the U.S. for its actions. 
   We can sign the Treaty and make clear that if the Court strays from its intended purpose, we will take what steps are needed, from refusing to ratify to withdrawing from the Treaty. I sincerely doubt, however, that will become necessary. A key part of the Court's ability to function is its legitimacy. As others have said, ``the politicization of the Court would quickly end its relevance.'' 
   We all know that it is simply not possible to be part of an international regime and get absolutely everything one wants. Nay sayers can always invent implausible scenarios that pose some risk. The key question is: do the benefits of signing the Rome Treaty and throwing our weight and influence behind it, outweigh the risks? I believe the answer is clearly yes. 
   Mr. President, the Treaty provides an adequate balance of strength and discretion to warrant signature by the United States. On the one hand, the Court is strong enough to bring war criminals to justice and provide a deterrent against future atrocities. On the other, there are important checks in place to minimize the risks of sham prosecutions of American troops. Yet, without the active participation and support of the United States--the oldest and most powerful democracy on Earth committed to the rule of law--the Court will never realize its potential. 
   I agreed with President Clinton when he stated that, ``nations all around the world who value freedom and tolerance [should] establish a permanent international court to prosecute, with the support of the United Nations Security Council, serious violations of humanitarian law.'' 
   Those words reminded me of the President's speech at the United Nations six years ago, when he called for an international treaty banning anti-personnel landmines. Two years later, when many of our allies and friends were negotiating such a treaty, the Administration, bowing to the Pentagon, chose to sit on the sidelines. They assumed, wrongly, that without U.S. support the process would run out of steam, and they even tried, at times, to undermine it. 
   Only in the final days, when the Administration finally realized the mine treaty was going to happen with or without the U.S., did they make several ``non-negotiable'' demands. Essentially, they said ``okay, we will sign the treaty, as long as it does not apply to our landmines.'' Predictably, that was rejected. Today, 138 nations have signed that treaty and 101 have ratified, including every NATO member except the United States and Turkey, and every Western Hemisphere nation except the United States and Cuba. 
   One would have thought we would have learned from that experience. The fact is that the United States can no longer singlehandedly determine whether an international treaty comes into force. If we do not sign the Rome Treaty, there is a strong possibility that the Court, its prosecutors and judges will develop from the beginning an unsympathetic view towards the United States and its official personnel. That is especially so if we end up opposing the Court and its legitimacy. Do we want a Court that views itself in opposition to the United States? Or do we want a Court whose prosecutors and judges are selected  with the influence of the United States, and a Court that must answer to the United States, as its most significant state party, for its actions? The answer should be obvious to anyone. 
   Mr. President, it is unacceptable that the world's oldest democracy--the nation whose Bill of Rights was a model for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the nation that called for the creation of a permanent, international criminal court and did so much to make it a reality, has shrunk from this opportunity. The President should sign the Rome Treaty.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing the Computer Crime Enforcement Act, which is now headed to President Clinton for his signature into law. I introduced the Senate version of this bill, S. 1314, on July 1, 1999, with Senator DEWINE and is now also co-sponsored by Senators ROBB, HATCH and ABRAHAM. This legislation also passed the Senate as part of H.R. 46, the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor Act. I thank my colleagues for their hard work on the Computer Crime Enforcement Act, especially Representative MATT SALMON, the House sponsor. 
   The information age is filled with unlimited potential for good, but it also creates a variety of new challenges for law enforcement. A recent survey by the FBI and the Computer Security Institute found that 62 percent of information security professionals reported computer security breaches in the past year. These breaches in computer security resulted in financial losses of more than $120 million from fraud, theft of information, sabotage, computer viruses, and stolen laptops. Computer crime has become a multi-billion dollar problem. 
   The Computer Crime Enforcement Act is intended to help states and local agencies in fighting computer crime. All 50 states have now enacted tough computer crime control laws. They establish a firm groundwork for electronic commerce, an increasingly important sector of the nation's economy. 
   Unfortunately, too many state and local law enforcement agencies are struggling to afford the high cost of enforcing their state computer crime statutes. 
   Earlier this year, I released a survey on computer crime in Vermont. My office surveyed 54 law enforcement agencies in Vermont--43 police departments and 11 State's attorney offices--on their experience investigating and prosecuting computer crimes. The survey found that more than half of these Vermont law enforcement agencies encounter computer crime, with many police departments and state's attorney offices handling 2 to 5 computer crimes per month. 
   Despite this documented need, far too many law enforcement agencies in Vermont cannot afford the cost of policing against computer crimes. Indeed, my survey found that 98 percent of the responding Vermont law enforcement agencies do not have funds dedicated for use in computer crime enforcement. My survey also found that few law enforcement officers in Vermont are properly trained in investigating computer crimes and analyzing cyber-evidence. 
   According to my survey, 83 percent of responding law enforcement agencies in Vermont do not employ officers properly trained in computer crime investigative techniques. Moreover, my survey found that 52 percent of the law enforcement agencies that handle one or more computer crimes per month cited their lack of training as a problem encountered during investigations. Without the necessary education, training and technical support, our law enforcement officers are and will continue to be hamstrung in their efforts to crack down on computer crimes. 
   I crafted the Computer Crime Enforcement Act, S. 1314, to address this problem. The bill would authorize a $25 million Department of Justice grant program to help states prevent and prosecute computer crime. Grants under our bipartisan bill may be used to provide education, training, and enforcement programs for local law enforcement officers and prosecutors in the rapidly growing field of computer criminal justice. Our legislation has been endorsed by the Information Technology Association of America and the Fraternal Order of Police. This is an important bipartisan effort to provide our state and local partners in crime-fighting with the resources they need to address computer crime.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today, as Chairman of the Senate Democratic Privacy Task Force, to speak about the privacy rights of all American citizens and the failure of this Congress to address the important issues threatening these fundamental rights of the American people. 
   When he announced the creation of the Democratic Privacy Task Force earlier this year, the Senate Democratic Leader, Senator TOM DASCHLE, said, ``The issue of privacy touches virtually every American, often in extremely personal ways. Whether it is bank records or medical files or Internet activities, Americans have a right to expect that personal matters will be kept private.'' Yet, our laws have not kept pace with sweeping technological changes, putting at risk some of our most sensitive, private matters, which may be stored in computer databases that are available for sale to the highest bidder. As Senator DASCHLE stated, ``That is wrong, it's dangerous, and it has to stop.'' 
   In leading the Democratic Privacy Task Force, I took this charge to heart and determined that an important first step in formulating workable and effective privacy safeguards was to make sure we understood the scope of the problem, both domestically and internationally, the status of industry self-regulatory efforts and the need for legislative solutions. At the announcement of the Privacy Task Force, I noted that we would focus on Internet, financial and medical records privacy, explaining that, ``It is important to come to grips with the erosion of our privacy rights before it becomes too late to get them back. We need to consider a variety of solutions, including technological one, and we need to look at the appropriate roles for private as well as public policy answers.'' 
   To this end, the Senate Democratic Privacy Task Force sponsored several member meetings and briefings on administrative steps underway in the Clinton-Gore Administration to protect people's privacy, industry self-regulatory efforts, and other specific privacy issues. These meetings included a discussion with White House privacy experts Peter Swire, Chief Counselor for Privacy at the Office of Management and Budget, and Sally Katzen, Counselor to the Director at the Office of Management and Budget, on the status of multilateral negotiations on implementation of the EU Privacy Directive and the effects on U.S. business. At another meeting, officials from OMB and the Department of Treasury described financial privacy issues. Yet another meeting provided a public forum for industry executives representing various seal programs to describe the successes and pitfalls of internet privacy self-regulatory activities. These task force meetings focused on relevant and pressing issues affecting consumer privacy in this country, prompting many Democratic members to look at legislative solutions. 
   Democrats have worked to enhance consumer privacy protections through the introduction of several legislative proposals--some with bipartisan support-- regarding medical, financial, and online privacy and identity theft. Democratic Senators who have sponsored privacy legislation this Congress include, Senators BOXER, BREAUX, BRYAN, BYRD, CLELAND, DASCHLE, DORGAN, DODD, DURBIN, EDWARDS, FEINSTEIN, FEINGOLD, HARKIN, HOLLINGS, INOUYE, JOHNSON, KENNEDY, KERRY, KOHL, LAUTENBERG, MIKULSKI, MURRAY, ROBB, ROCKEFELLER, SARBANES, SCHUMER, TORRICELLI, and WELLSTONE. 
   Despite the best efforts of Democratic Senators to heed the public call for greater privacy protection and to bring privacy issues to the forefront of our legislative agenda, the Republican majority has failed to bring all sides and stakeholders together to craft workable and effective safeguards in any of the areas where privacy rights are most at risk, namely, for internet activities, medical records or financial information. 
   During this Congress, for example, instead of focusing on ways to enhance privacy safeguards, the largest number of hearings (thirteen) and innumerable briefings held by the Senate Judiciary Committee or its subcommittees were directed at dissecting the manner in which the Department of Justice handled the investigation and prosecution of certain cases involving national security-related information and campaign financing. In the eyes of some members, the convictions obtained were proof of success, and in the eyes of others they were not. In our next Congress, it is my hope that we will not be distracted by such partisan pursuits, but that our time will be better spent on crafting privacy legislation that will make a real difference in the lives of every American. This is no easy task and will require both hard work and the commitment of member and staff time, but the next Congress should not shy away from this important issue, as has this one. 
   The right to privacy is a personal and fundamental right protected by the Constitution of the United States. The digitalization of information and the explosion in the growth of computing and electronic networking offer tremendous potential benefits to the way Americans live, work, conduct commerce, and interact with their government. Yet, new technologies, new communications media, and new business services created with the best of intentions and highest of expectations challenge our ability to keep our lives to ourselves, and to live, work and think without having personal information about us collected and disseminated without our knowledge or consent. Indeed, personal information has become a valuable and widely traded commodity by both government and private sector entities, which may used the information for purposes entirely unrelated to its initial collection. Moreover, this information may be stolen, sold or mishandled and find its way into the wrong hands with the push of a button or click of a mouse. 
   The American people are becoming more aware of this problem and are growing increasingly concerned with expanding encroachments on their personal privacy. American consumers are demanding better privacy protection and simply avoiding those markets perceived to pose the most risk to privacy interests. 
   New technologies bring with them new opportunities, both for the businesses that develop and market them, and for consumers. It does not do anyone any good for consumers to hesitate to use any particular technology because they have concerns over privacy.  That is why I believe that good privacy policies make good business policies. Consumer concerns can be a serious drag on the marketplace, and the Congress may 
   help bolster consumer confidence by putting in place the appropriate legislative privacy safeguards. Let me outline some of the areas in which I have introduced privacy legislation and will continue to work for constructive solutions. 
   While many emerging technologies challenge privacy protection, the greatest modern threat may be found online. Concerns over the privacy of online interaction easily dominate both the media and the public. The American public has a number of concerns when they go online. They worry whether their privacy will be protected, whether a damaging computer virus will attack their computer, whether a computer hacker will steal their personal information, adopt their identity and wreak havoc with their credit, whether their kids will meet a sexual predator and whether government or private sector entities are surreptitiously monitoring their online activities and communications. 
   Unfortunately, these concerns are merited, and will continue to increase as online technology evolves. As the recent popularity of peer-to-peer sharing software, used in the Napster service, demonstrates, the way in which people use the personal computer is changing. Increasingly, personal information, such as diaries, finances, and schedules, will not be stored on hard drives, but instead on Internet-based files. Combined with the reality that a substantial amount of our information is being carried over the ``Wireless Web,'' access to our personal information--by private and by public snoopers--is also growing exponentially. 
   I proposed S. 854, the Electronic Rights for the 21st Century Act or the E-Rights bill, to address these concerns. This legislation would have modified the blanket exception in current law allowing electronic communications service providers to disclose a record or other information pertaining to a subscriber to any non-governmental entity for any purpose or use. Due to this exemption, ISPs and OSPs may sell their subscriber lists or track the online movements of their subscribers and sell that information--all without the subscribers' knowledge or consent. The E-RIGHTS Act would have cut back on this exemption by requiring ISPs to give subscribers an opportunity to prohibit disclosure of their personal information and enumerating the situation in which the information may be used or disclosed without subscriber approval. Serious consideration of this proposal would have provided a constructive basis for discussion of online privacy, a discussion that has been postponed until the next Congress. 
   Enhanced privacy protection for confidential information held by bankrupt firms is necessary. Internet users are often promised basic privacy protection, only to have their expectations disappointed and their personal information put up for sale or disseminated in ways to which they never consented. Sadly, expectations and assumptions are not always safe online. For example, Toysmart.com, an online toy store, recently filed for bankruptcy and its databases and customer lists were put up for sale as part of the liquidation of the firm's assets. This personal customer information was put on the auction block even though Toysmart.com's privacy statement promised that ``[w]hen you register with toysmart.com, you can rest assured that your information will never be shared with a third party.'' 
   The Toysmart.com situation exemplifies the need for our privacy laws to recognize the dangers online services pose and to keep pace with the Internet's increased usage and ever evolving technology. I introduced, along with Senators TORRICELLI, KOHL and DURBIN, S. 2758, ``The Privacy Policy Enforcement in Bankruptcy Act of 2000'' specifically to address the problems created by Toysmart.com. Currently, the customer databases of failed Internet firms can be sold during bankruptcy, even in violation of the firm's stated privacy policy. This is unacceptable. The Act would prohibit the sale of personally identifiable information held by a failed business if the sale or disclosure of the personal information would violate the privacy policy of the debtor in effect when the personal information was collected, providing at least a modicum of protection for privacy rights online. It was my hope that the majority would support this legislation and effect swift passage so that we could at least make some progress in the protection of important privacy rights. Unfortunately the majority has chosen to ignore this legislation, along with other numerous privacy initiatives, with the consequence that is has gone nowhere. 
   Enhanced privacy protection from unreasonable government searches and surveillance is another area that requires attention. Internet users are concerned about whether their privacy rights are threatened by prodding surveillance technology, as demonstrated by the public outcry over the ``Carnivore'' program. Carnivore is used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to monitor the Internet activity of suspected criminals and is completely undetectable as it intercepts the suspect's email, web, and chat-room activity. Fortunately, the ``Carnivore'' program is capable of filtering protected or unnecessary information from that which should be intercepted. Nevertheless, concerns persist over the capabilities represented by this electronic surveillance technology and its potential invasiveness. 
   The E-RIGHTS Act, S. 854, which I introduced in April, 1999, contains a number of provisions designed to update our fourth amendment rights in the face of technological advances and new surveillance technologies. This legislation enhances privacy protections in several areas by strengthening procedures for law enforcement access to private information stored on Internet networks, location information for cellular telephones, decryption assistance for encrypted intercepted communications and stored data, communications occurring over conference calls when the target of a wiretap order has dropped off the call, and information obtained under pen register and trap and trace orders. Once again, no action was taken on this legislation despite my continued efforts to urge the Judiciary Committee to take it up. 
   Just as the widespread dissemination of personal information through online services deserves Congressional attention, the rapid expansion of the financial services industry requires affirmative action to protect private, financial information. In November 1999, President Clinton signed into law the landmark Financial Modernization Act of 1999, which updated our financial laws and opened up the financial services industry to become more competitive, both at home and abroad. I supported this legislation because I believed it would benefit businesses and consumers. It makes it easier for banking, securities, and insurance firms to consolidate their services, cut expenses and offer more products at a lower cost to all. But it also raises new concerns about our financial privacy. 
   In the financial services industry, conglomerates are offering a wide variety of services, each of which requires a customer to provide financial, medical or other personal information. And nothing in the law prevents subsidiaries within the conglomerate from sharing this information for uses other than the use the customer thought he or she was providing it for. In fact, under current Federal law, a financial institution can sell, share, or publish savings account balances, certificates of deposit maturity dates and balances, stock and mutual fund purchases and sales, life insurance payouts and health insurance claims. 
   As President Clinton recently warned: ``Although consumers put a great value on privacy of their financial records, our laws have not caught up to technological developments that make it possible and potentially profitable for companies to share financial data in new ways. Consumers who undergo physical exams to obtain insurance, for example, should not have to fear the information will be used to lower their credit card limits or deny them mortgages.'' I strongly agree. 
   Senators BOXER, BRYAN, DURBIN, FEINGOLD, HARKIN, MIKULSKI and ROBB, and I introduced the Financial Information Privacy and Security Act of 1999, S. 1924, to give this Congress the historic opportunity to provide for the privacy of every American's personal financial information in the wake of  enactment of the financial modernization legislation. Our legislation was designed to protect the privacy of financial information by directing the Federal Reserve Board, Office of Thrift Supervision, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Securities and Exchange Commission to jointly promulgate rules requiring financial institutions they regulate to: (1) inform their customers what information is to be disclosed, and when, to whom and for what purposes the information is to be disclosed; (2) allow customers to review the information for accuracy; and (3) for new customers, obtain the customers' consent to disclosure, and for existing customers, give the customers a reasonable opportunity to object to disclosure. These financial institutions could use confidential customer information from other entities only if the entities had given their customers similar privacy protections. 
   In addition, the bill would have provided individuals the civil right of action to enforce their financial privacy rights and to recover punitive damages, reasonable attorneys fees, and other litigation costs. Privacy rights must be enforceable in a court of law to be truly effective. 
   I also joined with Senators SARBANES, BRYAN, DODD, DURBIN, EDWARDS, FEINSTEIN, HARKIN, KERRY and ROBB to introduce the Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2000, S. 2513. This bill was the Clinton Administration's proposal to give consumers real control over the use and disclosure of their financial and health-related information held by financial institutions. 
   I had hoped that these efforts would be just the beginning of this Congress's efforts to address the many financial privacy issues raised by ultra competitive marketplaces in the information age. It is clear that Congress needs to update our privacy laws in the evolving financial services industry to protect the personal, confidential financial information of all American citizens. 
   Unfortunately, our Republican colleagues on the Senate Banking Committee did not feel the same way. This important financial privacy protection never saw the Senate floor, leaving confidential financial information disturbingly vulnerable. 
   Just as troubling as the rejection of financial information protections is this Congress' failure to establish safeguards for the privacy of medical records. Undoubtably, maintaining the confidentiality of medical records is of the utmost importance. Medical records contain the most intimate, sensitive information about a person. For the past three Congresses, I have introduced comprehensive medical privacy legislation. In March 1999, I introduced S. 573, the Medical Information Privacy and Security Act, with Senators KENNEDY, DASCHLE, DORGAN, INOUYE, JOHNSON, KERRY and WELLSTONE, to establish the first comprehensive federal medical privacy law. This bill would close the existing gaps in federal privacy laws to ensure the protection of personally identifiable health information. Sadly, this legislation has gone nowhere, like all medical privacy legislation this Congress. 
   In fact, Congress gave itself three years to establish medical records privacy legislation, but by the August 21, 1999 deadline, comprehensive medical records privacy rules did not exist. Instead the Department of Health and Human Services, as directed by Congress, drafted its own version. These placeholder privacy rules are better than no rules at all, but in the long run, Congress--not a federal agency--should set the basic standards on medical privacy, so that different administrations do not keep reducing the protections. I had hoped that the administrative rule-making process may finally prod Congress into action on a full-fledged policy, but as this Congress nears its conclusion, my optimism is waning. 
   Even this past summer, when the Senate had an opportunity to protect the privacy of genetic information, it failed to do so. Senator DASCHLE introduced an amendment, which I supported, to the FY 2001 Labor HHS Appropriations bill that would have protected private genetic information from insurance companies and employers using such information to discriminate against individuals or raise insurance premiums. The Senate failed to adopt the amendment and failed, once again, to protect essential privacy rights. 
   Congress has spent too long defining the problem instead of fixing it. We have not moved tangibly toward solutions in the six years since I convened the first hearings on technology and medical records in 1993. Since then a number of bills have been introduced--by myself and others--but we have been unable to get the attention of the majority to move this legislation. 
   In 1996 we tried to include medical privacy protections in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, HIPAA. Majority Leader Bob Dole at the time agreed with us that ``a compromise of privacy'' that sends information about health and treatment to a national data bank, without a person's approval, would be something that none of us would accept. What we settled for in 1996 was a provision requiring Congress to enact medical privacy legislation by August 21 of 1999. If the deadline was not met, which it was not, the Administration then would be required to issue regulations by February 21, 2000, to protect the privacy of electronic records, but not paper-based medical records. This is the current, pitiful state of medical records privacy protection and it is clearly unacceptable. 
   The inexcusable failure to provide comprehensive medical records privacy for three-years and the obstruction of the Financial Information Privacy Act of 1999 are just two examples of this Congress' failure to affirmatively and aggressively protect the fundamental privacy rights of American citizens. 
   I regret that this Republican-led Congress has not chosen to act on even one of the multiple legislative proposals protecting consumer privacy during the 106th Congress. It is my hope that we put partisan politics aside in the 107th Congress and take a hard look at how we can and should protect the fundamental right of privacy in the 21st Century. As each day passes, new financial services, new online services, and new medical data bases are taking shape and institutional practices employing these new technologies are taking root. Unless we decide that privacy is worth protecting--and soon--the erosion of our privacy rights will become irreversible.

   Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. I like to see him back. I wish we were not still in session, but I suspect the Presiding Officer probably had things he might have planned to be doing during this time, as did my distinguished friend from Iowa. 
   My distinguished friend from Iowa and I have been here for numerous lame duck sessions. After 26 years here, I have yet to see what good was ever accomplished in one of these lame duck sessions. I think the statement made by my distinguished friend from Minnesota just now emphasizes the kind of mischief that sometimes happens in lame duck sessions, when people want to leave, yet we have, as in this case, a  bankruptcy bill that none of the Democrats had a chance, really, to do much about. It gets put in--what was it, I ask my friend from Minnesota, a bill on embassies? 
   Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

   Mr. LEAHY. I thank my friend from Minnesota. I appreciate his pointing this out. I just want students who might look at this afterward and wonder what bankruptcy has to do with embassies to go back and read what the distinguished Senator from Minnesota says, which is, of course, that it has absolutely nothing to do with embassies. It is a parliamentary trick to get a piece of special interest legislation through. 
   It is unfortunate this kind of trick had to be carried out because the Republican majority could have worked with the President, they could have worked with the Democrats, to pass bankruptcy legislation that is more balanced and more fair. We did this 2 or 3 years ago. I remember Senator GRASSLEY, Senator DURBIN, others, worked together and we passed a piece of bankruptcy legislation that was here in the Senate. It was strongly backed by both Democrats and Republicans. I think we passed it by 97 or 98 votes. There was only one vote against it. It was overwhelmingly passed. It shows what happens when Republicans and Democrats work together. 
   Mr. President, I am disappointed that the majority refuses to work with the President and us to pass bankruptcy legislation that is better balanced and more fair. Despite the President's repeated attempts to offer reasonable compromises for the last six months, the majority is continuing to push this unfair and unbalanced bill. It appears that the same mistakes that killed a chance for passage of the bipartisan balanced bankruptcy reform 2 years ago, in the last Congress, are being repeated in this Congress. We should work together to finish the work of the 106th Congress. Instead, there seems to be this effort to pass flawed legislation that virtually guarantees a Presidential veto. 
   I had hoped we would have acted on the administration's four letters on the resolution of key issues needed for the President to sign a fair and balanced bill, that we could have at least met to discuss them so we could have a bill the President could sign. 
   I am the ranking Democrat currently on the Senate Judiciary 
   Committee. I was not a conferee of the conference report. Instead, the Republican leadership created a sham conference to create and file this flawed bankruptcy bill to make sure the Democrats would not have any say over it. It might be a nice exercise. It might look good in fundraising letters. But when you have a Democratic President, it is obvious we are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of time, effort, and taxpayer money up here to pass something that is not going to be signed into law. It may help for the next fundraiser, but it does not help bringing about the kind of bankruptcy reform we actually need in this country. 
   The Senate had requested a conference in August 1999 on legislation to enhance security of U.S. missions and the security of personnel overseas and to authorize appropriations for the State Department, what the distinguished Senator from Minnesota was just talking about. That did not proceed. 
   On October 11, 2000, the House appointed conferees not from the committee with jurisdiction over any embassy security issues, but from the House Judiciary Committee. Then a few hours later, out of nowhere, the leadership filed a conference report that strikes every aspect of the underlying legislation on which the two Houses had gone to conference and put in this wholly unrelated matter with reference to a bankruptcy bill that had not even passed. It had only been introduced that day. There was no debate, nothing. It is like: Whoops, open the closet door, let the special interests out, slam it down, and please pass it. 
   We Americans are great at telling other countries how to run democracies. We each tell them how to run elections. I hope in the last couple of years those countries that get lectures from us about how to run their democracies have not been watching how matters have slipped before the U.S. Senate. Matters of great consequence are slipped before the U.S. Senate without any votes, with the hope they will slip through in the dark of night. I hope those countries, when we tell them how to run elections, are not watching--I don't know--Presidential elections or anything like that in our country. 
   I look at Canada. I come from the State of Vermont. I think of Canada as that giant to the north. I look at Canada. The whole country votes with paper ballots. Two hours later, they have them all hand counted with no mistakes and the country accepts the result. I hope we won't lecture them as we often do. 
   But I hope we will not tell people this is the way to pass legislation. I hope we will not tell countries how to do it based on this bill. It is an autocratic, behind-closed-doors, undemocratic process, and it makes a mockery of the legislative process. 
   This is unfortunate, since both Democrats and the administration have been trying to negotiate in good faith with the Republicans to achieve fair and balanced bankruptcy legislation. Everyone in this Chamber knows we have to have some bankruptcy reform legislation. But it cannot be one sided to any one special interest, it has to be balanced. 
   There was not even a meeting of the sham conference committee, as far as I can tell. And the House had passed--talk about a CYA; that means ``carefully you're allowed,''--but, in an effort to make sure nobody questions them about this sham process that has slipped through behind closed doors, the House passed a 398-1 vote to instruct conferees to insist on a public meeting of the conference with open debate. By God, we are for government in the sunshine, 398-to-1. Are we not virtuous people in the other body? 
   And the press releases went out. Of course, 2 hours later, the sham conference report was filed, the one that was done behind closed doors, not done in the open. But everybody could say: Why, I voted to have that open, 398-1. 
   The bipartisan informal process that produced many improvements to the Senate-passed bill with respect to its bankruptcy provisions was for nought in the end. We worked in an informal bipartisan conference and made these improvements. We dropped the controversial nonrelevant amendments on the 3-year minimum wage increase, regressive tax cuts, mandatory minimum sentences for certain drug offenses, and private school vouchers. 
   We added a new provision to include a $6,000 floor in the means test to protect low-income debtors. 
   We added a new provision to take into account up to 10 percent of the debtor's administrative expenses in the means test calculations. 
   We added a new provision to allow for adjustments of up to 5 percent from the IRS standards for reasonable food and clothing expenses in the means test calculations to take into account the regional difference in costs. 
   We struck the provision that exempted creditors with small claims from sanctions against creditors who file abusive motions, and, thus, we made all creditors subject to these sanctions for coercive behavior. 
   We expanded the eligibility for the waiver of filing fees to debtors with income less than 150 percent of the poverty line. 
   All of these things we did with Democrats and Republicans working together, each side giving some things, each side adding things. We had a better bill. We even added a new temporary bankruptcy judgeship for the following courts: the District of Delaware, the Southern District of Georgia, the Eastern District of North Carolina, and the District of Puerto Rico. 
   Finally, we added privacy protections for the financial information of debtors to protect patient medical records in  bankruptcy health care businesses, to destroy all debtors' tax returns after 3 years of the close of the case, to provide Congress with the authority to add appropriate privacy safeguards to protect electronic bankruptcy data, and to add safeguards for the collection of bankruptcy data. 
   That was a good bipartisan start with Republicans and Democrats working together. We could have a fair and balanced final bankruptcy reform bill. It was something people on all sides of the issue were applauding. They were saying: Finally, Republicans and Democrats are working together. 
   Do you know what happened? Some in the Republican majority found this was going on and said: We can't have it; we can't have that balance; it has to be one sided; it has to be our way or no way, and they stopped those meetings. 
   We actually resolved most of the issues between the two bills. There were two key issues outstanding. We could have brought it back for a vote. One was discharge of penalties for violence against family planning clinics, medical clinics, and the other was a problem with wealthy debtors who used overly broad homestead exemptions to shield assets from creditors by putting money into multimillion-dollar houses, declaring bankruptcy, and thumbing their nose at their creditors. 
   Everything I heard told me we could have reached bipartisan agreement on these matters, too. Now this backdoor conference report does not adequately address either of these two abuses currently in the bankruptcy system. 
   The Senate passed the Schumer amendment to prevent the discharge of penalties for violence against family planning clinics. This was not a partisan vote. It was 80-17. People said, no matter how you feel about abortion, no matter how you feel about medical matters or family planning, we are not going to 
   condone violence against legitimate medical clinics. 
   Does the conference report reflect this? No. There is not a single provision to end abusive bankruptcy filings used to avoid the legal consequences of violence, vandalism, and harassment to deny access to legal health services. As a result, we could have all kinds of clinic violence. If you are sued for it, just declare bankruptcy and get away with it. That is wrong. 
   The administration made it crystal clear in four letters to congressional leaders that an end to this abuse of the current bankruptcy system was needed to gain the President's signature. Four times they said they were not going to allow people to firebomb clinics, harass people, assault people, and if they are sued, to simply say: We will declare bankruptcy. Four times. 
   The OMB Director Jack Lew wrote to Congressional leaders on May 12, 2000:  
   The abuses of the bankruptcy system must be stemmed, including abuse by those who would use bankruptcy to avoid penalties for violence against family planning clinics.  
   The President wrote congressional leaders on June 9:  
   I am deeply disturbed that some in Congress still object to a reasonable provision that would end demonstrated abuse of the bankruptcy system. We cannot tolerate abusive bankruptcy filings to avoid the legal consequences of violence, vandalism, and harassment used to deny access to legal health services. An effective approach, such as the one offered by Senator SCHUMER's amendment, should be included in the final legislation.  
   A few weeks later the President again wrote to congressional leaders to reiterate his position saying:  
   I cannot support a bankruptcy bill that fails to require accountability and responsibility from those who use violence, vandalism, intimidation, and harassment to deny others access to legal health services. ..... The final legislation must include an effective approach to this problem, such as the one contained in the amendment by Senator SCHUMER, which passed the Senate by a vote of 80-17.  
   This is a no-brainer. We already debated it and voted on it 80-17. We have a hard time getting an 80-17 vote here to support the bean soup in the Senate cafeteria. 
   Gene Sperling, national economic adviser to the President, in his letter of September 22, made it clear that President Clinton would veto any bankruptcy reform legislation that did not end this abuse of bankruptcy law. He said:  
   Our society should not tolerate those who develop a strategy to first threaten and intimidate doctors, health care professionals, or their patients and then turn to the bankruptcy courts to avoid legal liability for their actions. I reiterate that the President will not sign any legislation that does not contain effective means to ensure accountability and responsibility of perpetrators of clinic violence.  
   Mr. President, how much time is still available to the Senator from Vermont?

   Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. 
   We should not use the bankruptcy law to shield purveyors of violence. We should close this loophole. 
   Six defendants in the Nuremberg files web site case filed bankruptcy to avoid their debts under the law. This web site depicted murder weapons with dripping blood and advocated the killing of pro-choice physicians and public figures. Indeed, as some of these people were killed, their names were crossed out on the web site. Why should somebody who is sued for this kind of violence, purveying this kind of violence, be allowed to go to bankruptcy court and say, ``See ya, I'm home free''? 
   Dr. Barnett Slepian, who was murdered 2 years ago in Buffalo on October 23, 1998, was on this heinous Internet site. After he was murdered, his name was crossed out. 
   If I can make a personal note, when Dr. Slepian was murdered in upstate New York because his name was on the Nuremberg files web site, within days they determined the chief suspect was a man from Vermont. In fact, there is now an arrest warrant out for him. 
   I mention that also not just because I am from Vermont, but when I checked the Internet file, I found that along with this man's name, my name was there. I was listed as one of the people who should be shot and killed. I take that a little bit personally, especially when the FBI are now looking for a man from my State who is suspected of shooting and killing one of the people whose name was on that list with mine. Dr. Slepian's name has been crossed out. Mine has been left on the list of those who should be shot and killed. 
   Frankly, I find it a little bit difficult to think, when these people are sued for this kind of thing, and judgments are rendered against them, that they can just go into bankruptcy court and say: See ya. 
   So nobody will think that there is any kind of conflict of interest, I am not part of any suit against them. I am not going to do that. But for those who have, they ought to at least get their settlement or other judgment, win or lose, in the courts. But we should not let anybody walk into our Federal bankruptcy court--because of a huge loophole that this Congress does not have the guts to close--and just walk home scot-free. 
   It is hypocrisy at the worst, when we voted 80-17 in this body to close the loophole, and when all but one Member of the other body voted to have an open conference on this, that both bodies ignored that. That is hypocrisy. It is wrong. 
   If anybody thinks they do not know the reason why some people in this country look at the Congress and ask what is going on, there is one of your reasons right there. Maybe we ought to look at some of the elections this year and say: Our people are saying they are fed up with this. 
   In fact, this suspect is still at large, and with a reward of $1 million for his arrest. 
   You tell me--anybody in this body--you tell me--anybody who is listening to this debate--that somehow it is fair to let people such as that escape because of a loophole that we do not have the guts to close in our bankruptcy law. 
   Clearly, the perpetrators of violence and illegal intimidation should not be able to abuse the bankruptcy laws to avoid responsibility for their actions. Bankruptcy should not be used to avoid the legal consequence of clinic violence, harassment, and intimidation. 
   If we do not want to do something against violence, apparently we do not want to do anything in bankruptcy to offend those who have multimillion-dollar estates in the right States. 
   In the Senate, we passed, by a vote of 76-22, an amendment to create a $100,000 nationwide cap on any homestead exemption. Again, we could say we are only concerned about the little people. We are concerned about people paying the debt. All people--we want  everybody to pay their bills. Whether they are rich or poor, we want them to pay their bills. We are equal to everybody. 
   Of course, that would have eliminated one of the most flagrant abuses in bankruptcy laws--debtors moving to expensive homes in a handful of States with unlimited exemptions, declaring bankruptcy, and then keeping their millions of dollars in the homes that they have in those States. 
   Senator KOHL, along with Senator SESSIONS, put together an amendment that the Senate overwhelmingly adopted. I am beginning to see why everybody voted for it. Some must have gotten word that it would be gutted as soon as it got off the floor, gutted behind closed doors, where nobody votes and nobody's fingerprints are on them. Even to talk about: OK, you want to raise it to $100,000? Raise it to $500,000. Then all of a sudden we find it is gutted. It is going to build a lot of homes in Texas and Florida. It is an amazing coincidence those two States are going to have the advantage of not having that provision. If you want to declare bankruptcy, just put your millions of dollars in a house in Texas or Florida, and under this you are safe. 
   Again, the Administration made it crystal clear in four letters to congressional leaders that the President would not sign any bankruptcy reform bill that did not end the abuse of unlimited homestead exemptions. In fact, the Republican leadership reached an agreement with Democrats and the Administration to include a nationwide $500,000 cap on homestead exemptions in bankruptcy, but then the majority changed its mind. Why? I do not understand why the majority then reverted to a flawed homestead provision in this 
   conference report. 
   As early as May 12, 2000, OMB Director Jack Lew made clear the Administration's position. Director Lew wrote to Congressional leaders: It is fundamentally unfair to ask low- and moderate-income debtors to devote future income to repay the debts that they can, while leaving loopholes that allow the wealthy to shield income and assets from their creditors. High or unlimited homestead exemptions allow people with expensive homes to avoid their responsibility to repay a significant portion of their debts. 
   On June 9, 2000, the President, himself, wrote to congressional leaders about the need to end abusive homestead exemptions in any final bankruptcy reform bill. President Clinton wrote: I am concerned, for example, that the final bill may not adequately address the problem of wealthy debtors who use overly broad homestead exemptions to shield assets from their creditors. 
   Again, a few weeks later on June 29th, the President reiterated his position by writing to congressional leaders: The proposed limitation on State homestead exemptions will address, for the first time, those who move their residence shortly before bankruptcy to take advantage of large State exemptions to shield assets from their creditors. But the proposal does not address a more fundamental concern: unlimited homestead exemptions that allow wealthy debtors in some States to continue to live in lavish homes. In light of how other provisions designed to stem abuse will affect moderate-income debtors, it is unfair to leave this loophole for the wealthy in place. 
   A few weeks ago, it appeared the majority was finally beginning to understand and accept the President's commonsense approach by agreeing to a federal cap on homestead exemptions. On September 22, Gene Sperling, National Economic Advisor to the President, wrote to Majority Leader LOTT: The President appreciates your significant movement on the homestead issue. We realize that the offer goes against strongly held views of some members of your caucus, and we are grateful for the effort. While we had proposed placing a cap of $250,000 on the size of state homestead exemptions, we could accept a homestead cap of $500,000, were we to reach agreement on other issues. 
   It does not take a rocket scientist to understand that the President would veto a bankruptcy conference report that did not adequately address the discharge of penalties for violence against family planning clinics and the problem of wealthy debtors who use overly broad homestead exemptions to shield assets from their creditors. Four times the Administration wrote to congressional leaders about the need to address these two areas of bankruptcy abuse. Four times. 
   But this conference report fails adequately to address either of these two abuses of the current bankruptcy system. 
   Unfortunately, the majority is repeating the same mistakes that killed bankruptcy reform in the last Congress. Instead of keeping on the track of bipartisan compromise that was headed toward enacting a fair and balanced bill, the majority veered off course on behalf of special interests. The result is an unfair and unbalanced bankruptcy conference report. 
   Fortunately, bankruptcy filings have been declining for the last couple of years. In 1999, the per capita personal bankruptcy rate dropped by more than 9 percent. In the 2000 fiscal year, the decline continued. According to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, bankruptcy filings for fiscal year 2000 are down 6.8 percent for personal filings, down 6.6 percent for business filings and down 9.2 percent for chapter 7 filings. Over the last two years, Chapter 7 filings have dropped 15 percent and personal bankruptcy filings overall have declined by 12 percent. 
   In my home state of Vermont, the recent decline in personal bankruptcy filings is even more dramatic. In 1999 consumer bankruptcy filings in the District of Vermont dropped 11 percent 
   compared to 1998 and fell an additional 20 percent so far this year as compared to last year that is approximately a one-third decrease over the last two years. 
   Clearly, the justification that we must pass this flawed measure now because of a bankruptcy crisis rings hollow given the latest bankruptcy filing facts across the nation. There is no need to rush a bad bill into law. 
   On June 9, 2000, President Clinton wrote to congressional leaders that: I have long made clear my support for legislation that would encourage responsibility and reduce abuses of the bankruptcy system on the part of debtors and creditors alike. We also must ensure that a reasonable fresh start is available for those who turn to bankruptcy as a last resort when facing divorce, unemployment, illness, and uninsured medical expenses. Bankruptcy reform legislation should strike the right balance. 
   Unfortunately, this conference report fails to strike that right balance. The President will and should veto it. 
   The administration has helped to make the economy a lot better. We can take a moment. Let us wait until next year and pass a good bill. Let us take care of those problems that are in there, but let's not allow the haters, the crime inciters, the murderers, and the firebombers to go free. For Pete's sake, let's not let somebody who has amassed millions of dollars of assets, and even more millions of debt, to say: I will go buy a house in Texas or Florida because then I can escape my creditors. 
   Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Vermont have remaining?

   Mr. LEAHY. I congratulate Senator GRASSLEY, the Chairman of the Administrative Oversight Subcommittee and my good friend Senator HATCH, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee for their work on this measure. They doggedly pursued this passage here today. They showed leadership and we made some progress. 
   I only wish we could have completed our work on this bill and resolved the remaining important issues in a way that I could have supported and the President could sign.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over the past decade DNA analysis has emerged as the most reliable forensic technique for identifying criminals when biological material is left at a crime scene. Because of its scientific precision, DNA testing can, in some cases, conclusively establish a suspect's guilt or innocence. In other cases, DNA testing may not conclusively establish guilt or innocence, but may have significant probative value for investigators. 
   While DNA's power to root out the truth has been a boon to law enforcement, it has also been the salvation of law enforcement's mistakes--those who for one reason or another, are prosecuted and convicted of crimes that they did not commit. In more than 75 cases in the United States and Canada, DNA evidence has led to the exoneration of innocent men and women who were wrongfully convicted. This number includes at least 9 individuals sentenced to death, some of whom came within days of being executed. In more than a dozen cases, moreover, post-conviction DNA testing that has exonerated an innocent person has also enhanced public safety by providing evidence that led to the apprehension of the real perpetrator. 
   Clearly, DNA testing is critical to the effective administration of justice in 21st century America. 
   As DNA testing has moved to the front lines of the war on crime, our Nation's forensic labs have experienced a significant increase in their caseloads, both in number and complexity. In the six years since Congress established the Combined DNA Index System. States have been busy collecting DNA samples from convicted offenders for analysis and indexing. Increased Federal funding for State and local law enforcement programs has resulted in more and better trained police officers who are collecting immense amounts of evidence that can and should be subjected to crime laboratory analysis. 
   Funding has simply not kept pace with this increasing demand, and State crime laboratories are now seriously bottlenecked. Backlogs have impeded the use of new technologies like DNA testing in solving cases without suspects--and reexamining cases in which there are strong claims of innocence --as laboratories are required to give priority status to those cases in which a suspect is known. In some parts of the country, investigators must wait several months--and sometimes more than a year--to get DNA test results from rape and other violent crime evidence. Solely for lack of funding, critical evidence remains untested while rapists and killers remain at large, victims continue to anguish, and statutes of limitation on prosecution expire. 
   Let me describe the situation in my home State. The Vermont Forensics Laboratory is currently operating in an old Vermont State Hospital building in Waterbury, Vermont. Though it is proudly one of only two fully-accredited forensics labs in New England, it is trying to do 21st century science in a 1940's building. The lab has very limited space and no central climate control--both essential conditions for precise forensic science. It also has a large storage freezer full of untested DNA evidence from unsolved cases, for which there are no other leads besides 
   the untested evidence. The evidence is not being processed because the lab does not have the space, equipment or manpower. 
   I commend the scientists and lab personnel at the Vermont Forensics Laboratory for the fine work they do everyday under difficult circumstances. But the people of the State of Vermont deserve better. This is our chance to provide them with the resources they deserve. 
   Passage of the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000, H.R. 4640, will give States like Vermont the help they desperately need to reduce the backlog of untested crime scene evidence from unsolved crimes and untested convicted offender samples. It allocates $170 million over the next four years for grants to States to increase the capacity of their forensic laboratories and carry out DNA analyses of backlogged evidence. Senator SCHUMER and  I have pressed for increased appropriations for these purposes. This authorization bill is a step in the right direction. 
   In addition to the problem of unanalyzed crime scene and convicted offender evidence, there is an urgent need to address the gap in coverage of the national DNA index that has left out Federal, military, and District of Columbia offenders. The inability to include these offenders in the national index has seriously frustrated efforts to solve crimes and prevent further crimes. The bill that the Senate passes today eliminates the gap in coverage by authorizing the Bureau of Prisons and other Federal agencies to collect, analyze, and index DNA samples from individuals who have been convicted of Federal offenses of a violent or sexual nature. The bill also authorizes needed funding for these purposes, which Senator SCHUMER and I have been working to include in this years' appropriations bills. 
   While I support H.R. 4640, I believe it falls short in one critical respect: It fails to address the urgent need to increase access to DNA testing for prisoners who were convicted before this truth-seeking technology became widely available. Prosecutors and law enforcement officers across the country use DNA testing to prove guilt, and rightly so. By the same token, however, it should be used to do what is equally scientifically reliable to do--prove innocence. 
   I was greatly heartened earlier this month when the Governor of Virginia finally pardoned Earl Washington, after new DNA tests confirmed what earlier DNA tests had shown: He was the wrong guy. He was the 88th wrong guy discovered on death row since the reinstatement of capital punishment. His case only goes to show that we cannot sit back and assume that prosecutors and courts will do the right thing when it comes to DNA. It took Earl Washington years to convince prosecutors to do the very simple tests that would prove his innocence, and more time still to win a pardon. And he is still in prison today. 
   States like Virginia continue to stonewall on requests for DNA testing. They continue to hide behind time limits and procedural default rules to deny prisoners the right to present DNA test results in court. They are still destroying the DNA evidence that could set innocent people free. These sorts of practices must stop. We should not pass up the promise of truth and justice for 
   both sides of our adversarial system that DNA evidence offers. 
   By passing H.R. 4640, we substantially increase funding to increase the capacity of State and local forensic labs to carry out DNA analysis of crime scene evidence and convicted offender samples. That is an appropriate use of Federal funds. But we at least ought to require that this truth-seeking technology be made available to both sides. 
   I proposed a modest Sense of Congress amendment to H.R. 4640, which the Senate is passing today. It describes how DNA testing can and has resulted in the post-conviction exoneration of scores of innocent men and women, including some under sentence of death, and expresses the sense of Congress that we should condition forensic science-related grants to a State or State forensic facility on the State's agreement to ensure post-conviction DNA testing in appropriate cases. Because post-conviction DNA testing has shown that innocent people are sentenced to death in this country with alarming frequency, and because the most common constitutional error in capital cases is egregiously incompetent defense lawyering, my amendment also calls on Congress to work with the States to improve the quality of legal representation in capital cases through the establishment of counsel standards. 
   I introduced legislation in this Congress that would have accomplished both of these things. The Innocence Protection Act of 2000 contains meaningful reforms that I believe could save innocent lives. As the 106th Congress winds down, we have 14 cosponsors in the Senate, and about 80 in the House. We have Democratic and Republican cosponsors, supporters of the death penalty and opponents. President Clinton, Vice President GORE, and Attorney General Reno have all expressed support for the bill. 
   Tragically, real reform of our nation's capital punishment system foundered on the shoals of election-year politics. But with the Sense of Congress provision that we pass today, at least we have agreed on a blueprint for effective reform legislation in the 107th Congress. 
   The law enforcement issues addressed by H.R. 4640 are important, but as FBI Director Louis Freeh has acknowledged, ``Post-conviction relief is an equally important issue that requires a solution.'' In a recent letter, Director Freeh pledged to work with me on post-conviction relief issues in the next Congress and I look forward to working with the Director. 
   Each day that DNA evidence goes uncollected and untested, solvable crimes remain unsolved, and people across the country are needlessly victimized. I hope that the House will move quickly to pass H.R. 4640 as amended before it winds up its work for the year.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, The Presidential Threat Protection Act, H.R. 3048, is a high priority for the Secret Service and the Service's respected Director, Brian Stafford, and I am pleased that this legislation is passing the Senate today, along with legislation that Senators THURMOND, HATCH  and I have crafted to establish task forces, under the direction of the U.S. Marshals Service, to apprehend fugitives. 
   H.R. 3048 would expand or clarify the Secret Service's authority in four ways. First, the bill would amend current law to make clear it is a federal crime, which the Secret Service is authorized to investigate, to threaten any current or former President or their immediate family, even if the person is not currently receiving Secret Service protection and including those people who have declined continued protection, such as former Presidents, or have not yet received protection, such as major Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates and their families. 
   Second, the bill would incorporate in statute certain authority, which is currently embodied in a classified Executive Order, PDD 62, clarifying that the Secret Service is authorized to coordinate, design, and implement security operations for events deemed of national importance by the President ``or the President's designee.'' 
   Third, the bill would establish a ``National Threat Assessment Center'' within the Secret Service to provide training to State, local and other Federal law enforcement agencies on threat assessments and public safety responsibilities. 
   Finally, the bill authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue administrative subpoenas for investigations of ``imminent'' threats made against an individual whom the Service is authorized to protect. The Secret Service has requested that the Congress grant this administrative subpoena authority to expedite investigation procedures particularly in situations where an individual has made threats against the President and is en route to exercise those threats. 
   ``Administrative subpoena'' is the term generally used to refer to a demand for documents or testimony by an investigative entity or regulatory agency that is empowered to issue the subpoena independently and without the approval of any grand jury, court or other judicial entity. I am generally skeptical of administrative subpoena power. Administrative subpoenas avoid the strict grand jury secrecy rules and the documents provided in response to such subpoenas are, therefore, subject to broader dissemination. Moreover, since investigative agents usually issue such subpoenas directly, without review by a judicial officer or even a prosecutor, fewer ``checks'' are in place to ensure the subpoena is issued with good cause and not merely as a fishing expedition. 
   Current law already provides for administrative subpoena authority in certain types of cases. Specifically, the FBI has been granted authority granted to issue administrative subpoenas to obtain information that may be relevant in investigations of child abuse, child sexual exploitation, or Federal health care offenses. See 18 U.S.C.  3486 and 3486A. In child abuse and child exploitation cases, the FBI is authorized to use an administrative subpoena to require an Internet Service Provider to disclose the name, address, local and long distance telephone toll billing records, telephone number or other subscriber number or identity, length of service of a subscriber to or customer of the service and the types of services used by the subscriber or customer. 18 U.S.C.  3486A(a)(1)(A). Pursuant to those provisions in current law, the Attorney General is authorized to compel compliance with the administrative subpoena in federal court and any failure to obey is punishable as contempt of the court. Current law also provides blanket immunity from civil liability to any person who complies with the administrative subpoena and produces documents, without disclosing that production to the customer to whom the documents pertain. 
   I have over the years resisted persistent law enforcement requests for additional administrative subpoena authority. The House bill grants the request of the Secret Service for new, limited administrative subpoena authority and simultaneously imposes the following new procedural safeguards on both the FBI's current administrative subpoena authority and the Secret Service's new authority: 
   The new administrative subpoena authority in threat cases may only be exercised by the Secretary of the Treasury upon determination of the Director of the Secret Service that the threat is ``imminent,'' and the Secret Service must notify the Attorney General of the issuance of each subpoena. I should note that these requirements will help ensure that administrative subpoenas will be used in only the most significant Secret Service investigations. In most cases, for which the threshold showing of ``imminent'' threat cannot be established, the Secret Service will not be authorized to use administrative subpoenas and will instead simply go to the local U.S. Attorney's office to get a grand jury subpoena, as is current practice and law. 
   The bill would allow a person who receives an administrative subpoena to contest the subpoena in court by petitioning a federal judge to modify or set aside the subpoena and any order of nondisclosure of the production. 
   The bill would authorize a court to order nondisclosure of the administrative subpoena to for up to 90 days (and up to a 90 day extension) upon a showing that disclosure would adversely affect the investigation in enumerated ways. 
   Upon written demand, the agency must return the subpoenaed records or things if no case or proceedings arise from the production of records ``within a reasonable time.'' 
   The administrative subpoena may not require production in less than 24 hours after 
   service so agencies may have to wait for at least a day before demanding production. 
   As originally passed by the House of Representatives, H.R. 3048 provided that violation of the administrative subpoena is punishable by fine or up to five years' imprisonment. The Senate eliminated this provision in an amendment that passed the Senate on October 13, 2000 and I am glad to see that the House has approved that Senate amendment in the version of this bill returned by the House and considered by the Senate today. This penalty provision in the House version of the bill was both unnecessary and excessive since current law already provides that failure to comply with the subpoena may be punished as a contempt of court--which is either civil or criminal. See 18 U.S.C.  3486(c). Under current law, the general term of imprisonment for some forms of criminal contempt is up to six months. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C.  402. 
   The House has approved the part of the Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment to H.R. 3048 requiring the Attorney General to report for the next three years to the Judiciary Committees of both the House and Senate on the following information about the use of administrative subpoenas, including information on the number of such subpoenas issued and by which agency. In this way, the Congress will be able to monitor the use by federal law enforcement officials within the Justice and Treasury Departments of administrative subpoenas. 
   Finally, the House has approved the part of the Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment to H.R. 3048 requiring the Attorney General to provide a report on the use of administrative subpoenas by executive branch agencies. I am not aware of any recent effort to compile an overview or inventory of the current administrative subpoena powers in the Federal government, but understand that the United States Code contains more then 700 references to subpoena powers, many subject to various forms of administrative delegation. In addition, there are various commissions and other independent and quasi-judicial components of the federal government, which are also vested with subpoena powers not requiring grand jury or federal court involvement. In short, a variety of administrative subpoena authorities exist in multiple forms in multiple agencies, without uniform rules on scope, enforcement, or other due process safeguards. It is time for the Congress to review this situation, and this report by the Attorney General will be a good start. 
   On the fugitive apprehension task forces, the House has approved in the version of H.R. 3048, which the Senate considers today, parts of the Thurmond-Biden-Leahy amendment that passed the Senate on October 13, 2000. 
   As a former prosecutor, I am well aware that fugitives from justice are an important problem and that their capture is an essential function of law enforcement. According to the FBI, nearly 550,000 people are currently fugitives from justice on federal, state, and  local felony charges combined. This means that there are almost as many fugitive felons as there are citizens residing in my home state of Vermont. 
   The fact that we have more than one half million fugitives from justice, a significant portion of whom are convicted felons in violation of probation or parole, who have been able to flaunt court order and avoid arrest, breeds disrespect for our laws and poses undeniable risks to the safety of our citizens. 
   Our Federal law enforcement agencies should be commended for the job they have been doing to date on capturing Federal fugitives and helping the States and local communities bring their fugitives to justice. The U.S. Marshals Service, our oldest law enforcement agency, has arrested over 120,000 Federal, State and local fugitives in the past four years, including more Federal fugitives than all the other Federal agencies combined. In prior years, the Marshals Service spearheaded special fugitive apprehension task forces, called FIST Operations, that targeted fugitives in particular areas and was singularly successful in arresting over 34,000 fugitive felons. 
   Similarly, the FBI has established twenty-four Safe Streets Task Forces exclusively focused on apprehending fugitives in cities around the country. Over the period of 1995 to 1999, the FBI's efforts have resulted in the arrest of a total of 65,359 state fugitives. Nevertheless, the number of outstanding fugitives is too large. 
   The House has approved in the version of H.R. 3048, which the Senate considers today the Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment authorizing the Attorney General to establish fugitive task forces. This amendment would authorize $40,000,000 over 3 years for the Attorney General to establish multi-agency task forces, which will be coordinated by the Director of the Marshals Service, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the States, so that the Secret Service, BATF, the FBI and the States are able to participate in the Task Forces to find their fugitives. 
   The Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment to H.R. 3048 will help law enforcement with increased resources for regional fugitive apprehension task forces to bring to justice both federal and state fugitives who, by their conduct, have demonstrated a lack of respect for our nation's criminal justice system. 
   Regarding the Secret Service protective function privilege, while passage of this legislation will assist the Secret Service in fulfilling its critical mission, this Congress is unfortunately coming to a close without addressing another significant challenge to the Secret Service's ability to fulfill its vital mission of protecting the life and safety of the President and other important persons. I refer to the misguided and unfortunately successful litigation of Special Counsel Kenneth Starr to compel Secret Service agents to answer questions about what they may have observed or overheard while protecting the life of the President. 
   As a result of Mr. Starr's zealous efforts, the courts refused to recognize a protective function privilege and required that at least seven Secret Service officers appear before a federal grand jury to respond to questions regarding President Clinton, and others. In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 1998 W.L. 272884 (May 22, 1998 D.C.), affirmed 1998 WL 370584 (July 7, 1998 
   D.C. Cir)(per curiam). These recent court decisions, which refused to recognize a protective function privilege, could have a devastating impact upon the Secret Service's ability to provide effective protection. The Special Counsel and the courts ignored the voices of experience--former Presidents, Secret Service Directors, and others--who warned of the potentially deadly consequences. The courts disregarded the lessons of history. We cannot afford to be so cavalier; the stakes are just too high. 
   In order to address this problem, I introduced the Secret Service Protective Privilege Act, S. 1360, on July 13, 1999, to establish a Secret Service protective function privilege so Secret Service agents will not be put in the position of revealing private information about protected officials as Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr compelled the Secret Service to do with respect to President Clinton. Unfortunately, the Senate Judiciary Committee took no action on this legislation in this Congress. 
   Few national interests are more compelling than protecting the life of the President of the United States. The Supreme Court has said that the Nation has ``an overwhelming interest in protecting the safety of its Chief Executive and in allowing him to perform his duties without interference from threats of physical violence.'' Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705, 707 (1969). What is at stake is not merely the safety of one person: it is the ability of the Executive Branch to function in an effective and orderly fashion, and the capacity of the United States to respond to threats and crises. Think of the shock waves that rocked the world in November 1963 when President Kennedy was assassinated. The assassination of a President has international repercussions and threatens the security and future of the entire Nation. 
   The threat to our national security and to our democracy extends beyond the life of the President to those in direct line of the Office of the President--the Vice President, the President-elect, and the Vice President elect. By Act of Congress, these officials are required to accept the protection of the Secret Service--they may not turn it down. This statutory mandate reflects the critical importance that Congress has attached to the physical safety of these officials. 
   Congress has also charged the Secret Service with responsibility for protecting visiting heads of foreign states and foreign governments. The assassination of a foreign head of state on American soil could be catastrophic from a foreign relations standpoint and could seriously threaten national security. 
   The bill I introduced, S. 1360, would enhance the Secret Service's ability to protect these officials, and the nation, from the risk of assassination. It would do this by facilitating the relationship of trust between these officials and their Secret Service protectors that is essential to the Secret Service's protective strategy. Agents and officers surround the protectee with an all-encompassing zone of protection on a 24-hour-a-day basis. In the face of danger, they will shield the protectee's body with their own bodies and move him to a secure location. 
   That is how the Secret Service averted a national tragedy on March 30, 1981, when John Hinckley attempted to assassinate President Reagan. Within seconds of the first shot being fired, Secret Service personnel had shielded the President's body and maneuvered him into the waiting limousine. One agent in particular, Agent Tim McCarthy, positioned his body to intercept a bullet intended for the President. If Agent McCarthy had been even a few feet farther from the President, history might have gone very differently. 
   For the Secret Service to maintain this sort of close, unremitting proximity to the President and other protectees, it must have their complete, unhesitating trust and confidence. Secret Service personnel must be able to remain at the President's side even during confidential and sensitive conversations, when they may overhear military secrets, diplomatic exchanges, and family and private matters. If our Presidents do not have complete trust in the Secret Service personnel who protect them, they could try to push away the Secret Service's ``protective envelope'' or undermine it to the point where it could no longer be fully effective. 
   This is more than a theoretical possibility. Consider what former President Bush wrote in April, 1998, after hearing of the independent counsel's efforts to compel Secret Service testimony:  
   The bottom line is I hope that [Secret Service] agents will be exempted from testifying before the Grand Jury. What's at stake here it the protection of the life of the President and his family and the confidence and trust that a President must have in the [Secret Service]. If a President feels that Secret Service agents can be called to testify about what they might have seen or heard then it is likely that the President will be uncomfortable having the agents near by. I allowed the agents to have proximity first because they had my full confidence and secondly because I knew them to be totally discreet and honorable. . . . I can assure you that had I felt they would be compelled to testify as to what they had seen or heard, no matter what the subject, I would not have felt comfortable having them close in. . . . I feel very  strongly that the [Secret Service] agents should not be made to appear in court to discuss that which they might or might not have seen or heard. What's at stake here is the confidence of the President in the discretion of the [Secret Service]. If that confidence evaporates the agents, denied proximity, cannot properly protect the President.  
   As President Bush's letter makes plain, requiring Secret Service agents to betray the confidence of the people whose lives they protect could seriously jeopardize the ability of the Service to perform its crucial national security function. 
   The possibility that Secret Service personnel might be compelled to testify about their protectees could have a particularly devastating affect on the Service's ability to protect foreign dignitaries. The mere fact that this issue has surfaced is likely to make foreign governments less willing to accommodate Secret Service both with respect to the protection of the President and Vice President on foreign trips, and the protection of foreign heads of state traveling in the United States. 
   The security of our chief executive officers and visiting foreign heads of state should be a matter that transcends all partisan politics and I regret that this legislation does not do more to help the Secret Service by providing a protective function privilege.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I congratulate all those who participated in our recent Federal and State elections. In Vermont 63 percent of registered voters went to the polls and voted. In other States it was a bit more, in some a bit less. 
   The 2000 presidential election reminds us all that every vote counts. State electoral votes for President and Vice President may be decided in some States by the fewest in history, literally a handful of votes. In New Mexico, the counting continues and the outcome is very close. In Florida, the counting continues and the outcome is very close. 
   Likewise in Washington State, the vote for the Senator from Washington is still being counted and is very close. A number of House congressional races remain very close and final results may have to await recounts and the outcome of protests and challenges. The results of the Senate and House elections are such that the House and Senate themselves will have equal numbers or almost equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans. 
   I want to commend all those who participated. I welcome our newest Senators-elect. Many are in town this week. I welcome JEAN CARNAHAN, DEBBIE STABENOW, TOM CARPER, JON CORZINE, MARK DAYTON, BEN NELSON, BILL NELSON, and HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON. In addition, we may be joined by Maria Cantwell. We will be joined by GEORGE ALLEN, and JOHN ENSIGN. All will add greatly to our ranks and, I hope, to the Senate's ability to find answers to the problems of the American people. 
   The Congress will be confronted with a number of challenges. We will need to find ways to work together. In the Senate, the possibility of a Senate equally divided among Democrats and Republicans has prompted the Democratic Leader to make the suggestion that we consider new and less confrontational organizational principles that would include equal membership ratios on our Committees and equal staffing and equitable sharing of resources. Those are suggestions that should be seriously considered. I look forward to working with all Senators in the coming days: Senators in this Congress as we complete our work before adjourning sine die and Senators in the next Congress as we organize for our work in January.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senators KYL and FEINSTEIN introduced S. 3205, the Counterterrorism Act of 2000, on October 12, 2000. They base their bill on recommendations made in a report called ``Countering the Changing Threat of International Terrorism,'' issued on June 5, 2000 by the National Commission on Terrorism chaired by former Ambassador L. Paul Bremer III and Maurice Sonnenberg. The sponsors seek to have the Senate consider and pass the bill unanimously without hearings on its legislative language, without Committee consideration, without Senate debate and without amendment. In my efforts to be supportive of them I have shared with them concerns I have had about earlier versions of this legislation. In light of the improvements and corrections that the sponsors have now made, I am pleased to remove my objection to passage of the bill. I commend the sponsors for heeding constructive comments to improve the bill. 
   At the outset, I note that I have worked to help Senator KYL clear a number of matters of importance to him in this Congress. Most recently, the Senate passed on November 19, 1999, S. 692, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act, and on September 28, 2000, repassed S. 704, the Federal Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act. Moreover, in the past few months, we have worked together to confirm three more judges for Arizona. 
   In past Congresses, I have also worked closely with Senator KYL. For example, in the 104th Congress, Senators KYL, GRASSLEY and I worked together to enact the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. This law increased protection under federal criminal law for both government and private computers, and addressed the emerging problem of computer-age blackmail in which a criminal threatens to harm or shut down a computer system unless certain extortion demands are met. 
   The NII Protection Act that I worked on with Senator KYL was intended to help law enforcement better address the problem of computer crime, in which cyber attacks are an important component. The Bremer-Sonnenberg Commission noted that, ``[r]easonable experts have published sobering scenarios about the potential impact of a successful cyber attack on the United States. Already, hackers and criminals have exploited some of our vulnerabilities.'' In short, the Commission found that, ``cyber security is a matter of grave importance.'' 
   As technology advances, the Congress must remain vigilant to ensure that our laws remain up to date and our local, State and federal law enforcement resources are up to the job posed by new technological challenges. That is why I have continued to work over this Congress with the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and Senator SCHUMER on S. 2448, which the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously reported favorably on October 5th for consideration by the Senate as the Internet Security Act amendment on another bill. This legislation would make changes to the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse statute and provide significant new resources to federal law enforcement for forensic computer crime work. 
   I have also been pleased to work with Senator DEWINE on S. 1314, the Computer Crime Enforcement Act, to help provide the necessary funding for training and equipment for state and local law enforcement to deal with computer crimes. The Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously reported this bill favorably to the Senate on September 21, 2000. Although he is not a cosponsor of these bills, I appreciate Senator KYL's support for both S. 2448 and S. 1314 as those bills moved through Committee. These complementary pieces of legislation reflect twin-track progress against computer crime: More tools at the federal level and more resources for local computer crime enforcement. 
   In addition, the Senate Judiciary Committee has considered and reported unanimously on May 18, 2000, S. 2089, the Counterintelligence Reform Act, which I was pleased to cosponsor with Senators SPECTER, TORRICELLI, and others. Senator KYL did not cosponsor this bill. 
   The Counterintelligence Reform Act is intended to improve the coordination within and among federal agencies investigating and prosecuting espionage cases and other cases affecting national security. Specifically, this legislation amends the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to state explicitly that past activities of a target may be considered in determining whether there is probable cause to believe that the target of electronic surveillance is an ``agent of a foreign power.'' This particular provision appears to address a criticism subsequently raised in the Bremer-Sonnenberg Commission report that the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review, which is the Justice Department unit responsible for preparing and presenting FISA applications to the FISA court, ``does not generally consider the past activities of the surveillance target relevant in determining whether the FISA probable cause test is met.'' 
   The Bremer-Sonnenberg Commission report recommended that ``the Attorney General should substantially expand'' OIPR in order ``[t]o ensure timely review of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications.'' I concur with this recommendation. In fact, even before the Commission report was released and during Judiciary Committee consideration of S. 2089, I offered an amendment to S. 2089, which was approved by the Judiciary Committee, that would authorize an increase in the budget for OIPR from its current funding level of $4,084,000 to $7,000,000 for FY 2001, with increases up to $8,000,000 over the following two years, for expanded personnel and technology resources. The Select Committee on Intelligence also approved this budget increase for OIPR upon consideration of S. 2089, which subsequently was passed by the Congress as part of the Intelligence Authorization Act, S. 2507. 
   Recently, the Congress passed as part of the conference report on the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, H.R. 3244, the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act with an amendment that Senator FEINSTEIN and I authored dealing with support for victims of international terrorism. Senator KYL did not cosponsor this amendment. This amendment is intended to enable the Office for Victims of Crime to provide more immediate and effective assistance to Americans who are victims of terrorism abroad--Americans like those killed or injured in the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, and in the Pan Am 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. These victims deserve help, and the Leahy-Feinstein amendment will permit the Office for Victims of Crime to 
   serve these victims better by expanding the types of assistance for which the VOCA emergency reserve fund may be used, and the range of organizations to which assistance may be provided. The amendment allows OVC greater flexibility in  using existing reserve funds to assist victims of terrorism abroad, including the victims of the Lockerbie and embassy bombings. 
   This provision will also authorize OVC to raise the cap on the VOCA emergency reserve fund from $50 million to $100 million, so that the fund is large enough to cover the extraordinary costs that would be incurred if a terrorist act caused massive casualties, and to replenish the reserve fund with unobligated funds from its other grant programs. 
   At the same time, the provision will simplify the presently-authorized system of using VOCA funds to provide victim compensation to American victims of terrorism abroad, by permitting OVC to establish and operate an international crime victim compensation program. This program will, in addition, cover foreign nationals who are employees of any American government institution targeted for terrorist attack. The source of funding is the VOCA emergency reserve fund, which we authorized in an amendment I offered to the 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. 
   The Leahy-Feinstein provision also clarifies that deposits into the Crime Victims Fund remain available for intended uses under VOCA when not expended immediately. 
   As is apparent from the work we have done both in this Congress and in prior Congresses, we all share the interest and concern of the sponsors of S. 3205 in protecting our national security from the threat and risks posed by terrorists determined to harm this country and its citizens and helping victims of terrorist acts. Yet, I have been concerned that earlier versions of this bill posed serious constitutional problems and risks to important civil liberties we hold dear. Unlike the secret holds that often stop good bills from passing often for no good reason, I have had no secret holds on S. 3205 or earlier versions of this legislation. On the contrary, when asked, I have made no secret about the concerns I had with this legislation. 
   An earlier version of this legislation, which Senator KYL tried to move as part of the Intelligence Authorization bill, S. 2507, prompted a firestorm of controversy from civil liberties and human rights organizations, as well as the Department of Justice. For example, the Department of Justice opposed the amendment on myriad grounds, including that (1) the provision amending the wiretap statute to permit law enforcement officers to share foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information obtained under a title III wiretap with the intelligence community ``could have significant implications for prosecutions and the discovery process in litigation''; (2) the provision giving the FBI sixty days to report on the feasibility of establishing a dissemination center within the FBI on international terrorism raised sufficiently significant issues that ``do not avail themselves of resolution in this very short time frame''; (3) the provision requiring the creation of a task force to disrupt the fundraising activities of international terrorist organizations would impose a ``rigid, statutory mandate" that ``would interfere with the need for flexibility in tailoring enforcement strategies and mechanisms to fit the enforcement needs of the particular moment''; and (4) the provision requiring the Attorney General to make legislative language recommendations on matters relating to biological pathogens were ``invalid under the Recommendations Clause'' and ``interferes with the President's efforts to formulate and present his own recommendations and proposals and to control the policy agenda of his Administration.'' 
   Similarly, the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Center for National Security Studies and the American Civil Liberties Union, described in detail their concerns that ``provisions in the Act pose grave threats to constitutional rights.'' 
   I shared many of the concerns of those organizations and the Justice Department, and note that the version of S. 3205 that we consider today addresses those concerns with substantial revisions to the original legislation. For example, no longer does the bill require a change in the wiretap statute allowing the permissive disclosure of information obtained in a title III wiretap to the intelligence agencies. No longer does the bill direct the Central Intelligence Agency to make legislative recommendations to enhance the recruitment of terrorist informants, without any countervailing considerations. Instead, the bill now requests a more balanced picture of the policy considerations that prompted the 1995 guidelines on the use of terrorists as informants and the limitations that may be necessary to assure that the United States does not encourage human rights abuse abroad. 
   After the bill was introduced, I first advised the sponsors of the bill and then the Senate about the remaining areas of concern that should be fixed in the bill before Senate passage. 
   In this regard, I note that Senator KYL suggested to the Senate on October 25th that if the Justice Department was satisfied with his legislation, I or my staff had earlier indicated that I would be satisfied. I respect the expertise of the Department of Justice and the many fine lawyers and public servants who work there and, where appropriate, seek out their views, as do many Members. That does not mean that I always share the views of the Department of Justice or follow the Department's preferred course and recommendations without exercising my own independent judgment. I would never represent that if the Justice Department were satisfied with his bill, I would automatically defer to their view. Furthermore, my staff has advised me that no such representation was ever made. 
   I am pleased that the further corrections to and refinements of this bill have now been made and that the version of the bill that the Senate is now being asked to consider and pass has been improved. First, the bill now contains the correct numbers of sailors killed and injured in the sense of the Congress concerning the tragic bombing attack on the U.S.S. Cole. I believe that each of the 17 sailors killed and 39 sailors injured deserve recognition and that the full scope of the attack should be properly reflected in this Senate bill. I commend the sponsors of the bill for correcting this part of the bill. 
   Second, the sense of the Congress originally urged the United States Government to ``take immediate actions to investigate rapidly the unprovoked attack on the'' U.S.S. Cole, without acknowledging the fact that such immediate action has been taken. In fact, the Navy began immediate investigative steps shortly after the attack occurred, and the FBI established a presence on the ground and began investigating within 24 hours. The Director himself went to 
   Yemen to guide this investigation. That investigation is active and ongoing, and no Senate bill should reflect differently, as this one originally did. The corrected bill now urges the government ``to continue to take strong and effective actions'' to investigate this attack. I commend the Administration for the swift and immediate actions it has taken to investigate this attack and the strong statements made by the President making clear that no stone will be left unturned to find the criminals who planned this bloody attack. 
   Third, the ``Findings'' section of this bill contained several factual errors or inaccuracies that are now corrected. For example, the original bill stated that there are ``38 organizations'' designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) when there are currently 29, which has been corrected. The original bill stated that ``current practice is to update the list of FTOs every two years'' when in fact the statute requires redesignation of FTOs every two years. This statement has been corrected. The original bill stated that current controls on the transfer and possession of biological pathogens were ``designed to prevent accidents, not theft,'' which according to the Justice Department is simply not accurate. This inaccurate statement has been eliminated. 
   Fourth, the original bill required reports on issues within the jurisdiction of the Senate Judiciary Committee without any direction that those reports be submitted to that Committee. For example, section 9 of the bill required the FBI to submit to the Select Committees on Intelligence of the Senate and the House a feasibility report on establishing a new capability within the FBI for the dissemination of law enforcement information to the Intelligence community. My suggestion that these reports also be required to  be submitted to the Judiciary Committees has been adopted. 
   Fifth, the bill requires reports, with recommendations for appropriate legislative or regulation changes, by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services on safeguarding biological pathogens at research labs, pharmaceutical companies and other facilities in the United States. No definition of ``biological pathogen'' is included in the bill and the scope of these reports could therefore cover a vast array of biological materials. To address this concern over the potentially broad focus of this provision, the bill has been amended to include a direction to the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to define and determine the type and classes of pathogens that should be covered by any recommendations. 
   Finally, the bill would require reimbursement for professional liability insurance for law enforcement officers performing official counterterrorism duties and for intelligence officials performing such duties outside the United States. I scoured the record in vain for explanatory statements by the sponsors of this bill about their views on the need for this provision. Current law curiously provides for payments of only half the costs of professional liability insurance for law enforcement officers and federal judges to cover the costs of legal liability for damages resulting from any tortious act, error of omission while in the performance of the employee's duties and the costs of legal representation in connection with any administrative or judicial proceeding relating to such act, error or omission. 5 U.S.C.  5941 prec. note. The Bremer-Sonnenberg Commission report recommended that the Congress amend current law to mandate full reimbursement of the costs of personal liability insurance for FBI and CIA counterterrorism agents. In light of this explanation, I am prepared to proceed while noting that this is an area that deserves more comprehensive review. The same reasons for providing full reimbursement for counterterrorism officers may apply to other law enforcement and intelligence officers. 
   The bill has been greatly improved since its first iteration, and I am pleased to withdraw my objection.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, of the 105 judicial vacancies that have occurred so far this year, the Senate has acted to fill only 39. The last year of the Bush Administration, a presidential year in which we had the reverse situation with a Republican President and a Democratic Senate, the Senate confirmed 66 judges--70 percent more than the number confirmed this year. Over the 2-year span of this Congress, the Senate will have confirmed only 73 judges. By contrast, the Democratic Senate in the last two years of President Bush's Administration confirmed 124 judges--70 percent more judges than the number confirmed by this Congress. Indeed, in the last eleven weeks of Congress in 1992, a Democratic Senate held four judicial nominations hearings and confirmed 29 judges. In the last eleven weeks of this Congress, Republicans will have managed to hold no hearings and confirm no judges. 
   President Clinton has tried to make progress on bringing greater diversity to our federal courts. He has been successful to some extent. With our help, he could have done so much more. We will end this Congress without having acted on any of the African American nominees sent to us to fill vacancies on the Fourth Circuit and finally integrate the Circuit with the highest percentage of African American population in the country, but the one Circuit that has never had an African American judge. We could have acted on the nomination of Kathleen McCree Lewis and confirmed her to the Sixth Circuit to be the first African American woman to sit on that Court. Instead, we will end the year without having acted on any of the outstanding nominees to the Sixth Circuit pending before us. 
   This Judiciary Committee reported only three nominees to the Courts of Appeals all year. We held hearings without even including a nominee to the Courts of Appeals and denied a Committee vote to two outstanding nominees who succeeded in getting hearings. I certainly understand the frustration of those Senators who know that Roger Gregory, Judge James Wynn, Kathleen McCree Lewis, as well as Judge Helene White, Bonnie Campbell and others should have been considered by this Committee and voted on by the Senate this year. 
   There continue to be multiple vacancies on the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, Tenth and District of Columbia Circuits. With 24 current vacancies, our appellate courts have nearly half of the total judicial emergency vacancies in the federal court system. I note that the vacancy rate for our Courts of Appeals is more than 12 percent nationwide. If we were to take into account the additional appellate judgeships included in the Hatch-Leahy Federal Judgeship Act of 2000, S. 3071, a bill that was requested by the Judicial Conference to handle current workloads, the vacancy rate on our federal courts of appeals would be more than 17 percent. 
   The Chairman declares that ``there is and has been no judicial vacancy crisis'' and that he calculates vacancies at ``less than zero.'' The extraordinary service that has been provided by our corps of senior judges does not mean there are no vacancies. In the federal courts around the country there remain 66 current vacancies and 12 more on the horizon. With the judgeships included in the Hatch-Leahy Federal Judgeship Act of 2000, there would be over 135 vacancies across the country. That is the truer measure of vacancies, many of which have been long-standing judicial emergency vacancies in our southwest border states. The Chief Judges of both the Fifth and Sixth Circuits have had to declare their entire courts in emergencies since there are too many vacancies and too few Circuit judges to handle their workload. 
   After creating 85 additional judgeships in 1990, Congress reduced the vacancies from 131 in 1991, to 103 in 1992, to 112 in 1993, to 63 in 1994. Vacancies were going down and we were acting with Republican and Democratic Presidents to fill the 85 judgeships created  by a Democratic Congress under a Republican President in 1990. We will end this session with more vacancies than at the end of the session in 1994, without having added the judgeships requested by the Judicial Conference. Since Republicans assumed control of the Senate in the 1994 election, the Senate has not closed the vacancy gap at all and the workloads in many of our courts have gotten significantly worse. More vacancies are continuing longer, and it has taken longer to confirm nominees to existing vacancies. We have lost ground and squandered opportunities for progress in the past six years. 
   As I have pointed out, the vacancies are most acute among our Courts of Appeals and in our southwest border States. We have not acted to add the judgeships requested by the Judicial Conference to meet increased workloads over the last decade. According to the Chief Justice's 1999 year-end report, the filings of cases in our Federal courts have reached record heights. In fact, the filings of criminal cases and defendants reached their highest levels since the Prohibition Amendment was repealed in 1933. Also in 1999, there were 54,693 filings in the 12 regional Courts of Appeals. Overall growth in appellate court caseload last year was due to a 349 percent upsurge in original proceedings. This sudden expansion resulted from newly implemented reporting procedures, which more accurately measure the increased judicial workload generated by the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, both passed in 1996. 
   I regret to report again today that the last confirmation hearing for federal judges held by the Judiciary Committee was in July, as was the last time the Judiciary Committee reported any nominees to the full Senate. Throughout August, September, October, and now into November, there were no additional hearings held or even noticed, and no executive business meetings included any judicial nominees on the agenda. By contrast, in 1992, the last year of the Bush Administration, a Democratic majority in the Senate held three confirmation hearings in August and September and continued to work to confirm judges up to and including the last day of the session. During that presidential election year the Senate confirmed 66 judges; this year the Senate will not reach 40. 
   I continue to urge the Senate to meet its responsibilities to all nominees, including women and minorities. That highly-qualified nominees are being needlessly delayed is most regrettable. The Senate should have joined with the President to confirm well-qualified, diverse and fair-minded nominees to fulfill the needs of the federal courts around the country. 
   I regret that the Judiciary Committee did not hold additional hearings after July, that the Senate only acted on 39 nominees all year, and that we took so long on so many of them. I deeply regret the lack of a hearing and a vote on so many qualified nominees, including Roger Gregory, Judge James Wynn, Judge Helene White, Bonnie Campbell, Enrique Moreno and Allen Snyder. The Senate squandered a number of important opportunities to help our courts and should have accorded these qualified and outstanding nominees fair up or down votes.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Internet False Identification Prevention Act, S. 2924, is intended to provide additional tools to law enforcement to combat the theft of, and fraud associated with, identification documents and credentials. I share the concerns of the sponsors of this legislation over this matter. In fact, in the last Congress, I sponsored, along with Senators KYL, HATCH, FEINSTEIN and others, legislation to prohibit fraud in connection with identification information, not just physical documents. We recognized that criminals do not necessarily need a physical identification document to create a new identity; they just need the information itself to facilitate the creation of false identification documents. 
   I note that improvements to the bill as originally introduced were made during consideration of the legislation by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Specifically, as originally introduced this bill would have made it a crime to possess with intent to use or transfer any false identification document, rather than ``five or more'' as required under current law. See 18 U.S.C. 1028(a)(3). I raised concern that the scope of this proposed offense would have resulted in the federalization of the status offenses of an underage teenager using a single fake ID card. The substitute bill reported by the Judiciary Committee eliminated this change in current law. 
   The substitute amendment that the Senate considers today would require the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury to coordinate through a ``coordinating committee'' the investigation and prosecution of offenses related to false identification documents, and report to the Judiciary Committees of the House and the Senate on the number and results of prosecutions. In addition, the substitute amendment amends 18 U.S.C. 1028 in a number of ways, including by creating a new criminal prohibition on the knowing production or transfer of a document-making implement designed for use in the production of false identification documents. A new definition is provided for the term ``transfer'' to include ``making available for acquisition or use by others.'' To address the concerns of internet service providers that the combination of the new crime and the new definitions would expose them to criminal liability, the bill also includes an exemption from the new crime for an interactive computer service. 
   In addition, the bill repeals 18 U.S.C. 1738, which allows businesses that sell identification documents bearing the birth date or age of the person being identified to avoid criminal liability by printing clearly and indelibly on both the front and the back ``Not a Government Document.'' 
   While I do not object to moving this bill at this time, I must note two lingering concerns that we have to revisit. First, I appreciate that the sponsors wish to repeal 18 U.S.C. 1738 to stop the practice of selling counterfeit identification products with disclaimers that are intentionally fashioned to be easily removable on both computer templates and counterfeit identification documents but that nevertheless avoid criminal liability by displaying the disclaimer. This is a 
   practice that deserves congressional attention, but I am concerned that repeal of this section may go too far, since it may remove legal protection for some legitimate businesses that  sell identification documents for legitimate reasons, such as for security or private guard services. 
   The legislative history of section 1738 makes clear that this provision was considered necessary when passed because private identification documents ``are used by many persons who have no official record of their date of birth and are unable to obtain official identification cards for that reason. The conferees determined that to simply require privately issued identification cards to carry a prominent disclaimer that they are not government documents would adequately protect the public interest.'' Conference Report on False Identification Crime Control Act of 1982 (H.R. 6946), 97th Cong., 2d Sess., Rpt. 97-975, at p. 4 (December 17, 1982). It remains unclear to me how many legitimate uses and businesses will be affected by repeal of this section, and the manner in which this repeal is being enacted makes it impossible to know in advance. 
   Second, the substitute amendment contains an exemption for interactive computer services that was added after consideration by the Judiciary Committee. Representatives of internet service providers expressed concern that the breadth of the intent standard in the bill, which provides that a defendant need only knowingly transfer or make available by electronic means an illegal document-making implement, such as computer template, to risk criminal liability. They contend that this scienter requirement could put at risk ISPs that simply offer a third party the ability to communicate or locate material that is otherwise illegal, even though the ISP does not know that the document-making implement can be or will be used to make false identification documents and does not intend to be facilitating an illegal transaction. 
   The ISPs may have correctly pointed out a problem in the scope of the criminal liability but the cure should not be to grant a blanket exemption for service providers. There is no comparable exemption anywhere else in the federal criminal code. A better cure would have been to clarify the scope of the criminal prohibition and to define more precisely the scienter requirement for criminal liability. Instead of making the new crime applicable to anyone who ``knowingly produces or transfers a document-making implement that is designed for use in the production of a false identification document,'' the bill could have been more precisely drawn to cover only a person who ``knowingly produces or transfers a document-making implement with the intent that it be used in the production of a false identification document.'' This would have avoided the necessity of carving out exemptions for innocent ISPs that merely facilitate the transfer of illegal document-making implements, without knowing the nature of the what is being transferred. 
   Moreover, including an immunity provision in this bill for ISPs raises a question about their criminal liability exposure under many other criminal statutes that make illegal the knowing transfer of illegal materials without requiring specific knowledge on the part of the transferor that the material is illegal. For example, federal law prohibits the knowing distribution, including by computer, of any material that contains child pornography. 18 U.S.C. 2251A(a)(2)(B). There is no blanket immunity for ISPs for facilitating the distribution of such illegal material. Will inclusion of a blanket immunity provision in this bill encourage courts to construe broadly the prohibitions in other statutes to cover innocent ISPs? This is a matter that could benefit from additional scrutiny.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to commend Senator BAYH for his efforts on S. 3164, the Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act, which the House passed today. This bill, which I cosponsored along with Senators GRAMS and CLELAND, will greatly assist federal, state, and local efforts to crack down on crime committed against older Americans. Although I wish the Congress had also acted on additional proposals to protect elderly Americans, including S. 751, the Seniors Safety Act, I am glad that we were at least able to pass this legislation. 
   I have been concerned for some time that even as the general crime rate has been declining steadily over the past eight years, the rate of crime against the elderly has remained unchanged. That is why I introduced the Seniors Safety Act with Senators DASCHLE, KENNEDY, and TORRICELLI over a year ago. The Judiciary Committee refused to hold hearings on this bill, which provides a comprehensive approach to a variety of problems affecting seniors today. 
   Thankfully, the Republican majority was less hostile to S. 3164, which includes one of the titles from the Seniors Safety Act. This title does two things. First, it instructs the Attorney General to conduct a study relating to crimes against seniors, so that we can develop a coherent strategy to prevent and properly punish such crimes. Second, it mandates the inclusion of seniors in the National Crime Victimization Study. Both of these are important steps. 
   The Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act includes important proposals for addressing the problem of crimes against the elderly, especially fraud crimes. In addition to the provisions described above, this bill authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to establish local programs to prevent fraud against seniors and educate them about the risk of fraud, as well as to provide information about telemarketing and sweepstakes fraud to seniors, both directly and through State Attorneys General. These are two common-sense provisions that will help seniors protect themselves against crime. 
   I hope that when Congress reconvenes in January, we will consider the rest of the Seniors Safety Act, and enact even more comprehensive protections for our seniors. The Seniors Safety Act offers a comprehensive approach that would increase law enforcement's ability to battle telemarketing, pension, and health care fraud, as well as to police nursing homes with a record of mistreating their residents. The Justice Department has said that the Seniors Safety Act would ``be of assistance in a number of ways.'' I have urged the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on the Seniors Safety Act as long ago as October 1999, and again this past February, but my requests have not been granted. Now, as the session is coming to a close, we are out of time for hearings on this important and comprehensive proposal and significant parts of the Seniors Safety Act remain pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee as part of the unfinished business of this Congress. 
   Let me briefly summarize the parts of the Seniors Safety Act that the majority in the Congress has declined to consider. First, the Seniors Safety Act provides additional protections to nursing home residents. Nursing homes  provide an important service for our seniors--indeed, more than 40 percent of Americans turning 65 this year will need nursing home care at some point in their lives. Many nursing homes do a wonderful job with a very difficult task--this legislation simply looks to protect seniors and their families by isolating the bad providers in operation. It does this by giving federal law enforcement the authority to investigate and prosecute operators of those nursing homes that engage in a pattern of health and safety violations. This authority is all the more important given the study prepared by the Department of Health and Human Services and reported this summer in the New York Times showing that 54 percent of American nursing homes fail to meet the Department's ``proposed minimum standard'' for patient care. The study also showed that 92 percent of nursing homes have less staff than necessary to provide optimal care. 
   Second, the Seniors Safety Act helps protect seniors from telemarket fraud, which costs billions of dollars every year. This legislation would give the Attorney General the authority to block or terminate telephone service where that service is being used to defraud seniors. If someone takes your money at gunpoint, the law says we can take away their gun. If someone uses their phone to take away your money, the law should allow us to protect other victims by taking their phone away. In addition, this proposal would establish a Better Business Bureau-style clearinghouse that would keep track of complaints made about telemarketing companies. With a simple phone call, seniors could find out whether the company trying to sell to them over the phone or over the Internet has been the subject of complaints or been convicted of fraud. 
   Third, the Seniors Safety Act punishes pension fraud. Seniors who have worked hard for years should not have to worry that their hard-earned retirement savings will not be there when they need them. The bill would create new criminal and civil penalties for those who defraud pension plans, and increase the penalties for bribery and graft in connection with employee benefit plans. 
   Finally, the Seniors Safety Act strengthens law enforcement's ability to fight health care fraud. A recent study by the National Institute for Justice reports that many health care fraud schemes ``deliberately target vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or Alzheimer's patients, who are less willing or able to complain or alert law enforcement.'' This legislation gives law enforcement the additional investigatory tools it needs to uncover, investigate, and prosecute health care offenses in both criminal and civil proceedings. It also protects whistle-blowers who alert law enforcement officers to examples of health care fraud. 
   I commend Senators BAYH, GRAMS, and CLELAND for working to take steps to improve the safety and security of America's seniors. We have done the right thing in passing this bipartisan legislation and beginning the fight to lower the crime rate against seniors. I urge consideration of the Seniors Safety Act. It would provide a comprehensive approach toward giving law enforcement and older Americans the tools they need to prevent crime.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is not often that the President of the United States, the editorial board of the Washington Times, People for the American Way and Gary Bauer all agree. They all do about the importance of the upcoming election to the rights of Americans in the decades ahead because of its impact on the third branch of the Federal Government, our federal judiciary. 
   This first national election of this new century will give the American people a choice--a clear choice for President and for Congress. Also at stake is the third branch of our Federal Government, the judiciary. It is this branch of government, headed by the Supreme Court, that is the guardian of our rights under the Constitution. 
   The next President is likely to nominate not only the next Justice on the United States Supreme Court, but possibly as many as four of the nine members of the Supreme Court over the course of his term. The next Senate will be called upon to vote to confirm or reject the President's nominations to the Supreme Court and the federal courts throughout the country. 
   These are the judges who can give meaning to the Bill of Rights in cases they decide every day or who can take away our rights and the authority of our elected representatives and impose their own narrow view of our Constitution. The rights of free speech, to practice any religion or no religion as we choose, the right to be treated equally by the government, the right to privacy and a woman's right to choose are fundamental rights that require constant vigilance and protection. This new century will pose challenges to our fundamental rights. Will we have a President and a Senate who will combine to provide judges to protect those rights, or ideologues who will erode them? 
   Nothing is more sharply at stake this November than the future of our constitutional rights. 
   Five-to-four--five-to-four is how closely the Supreme Court is now dividing on fundamental issues. One or two votes on the Supreme Court can, for the next half century, tip the balance away from the right to choose,  away from rights of privacy, away from equal rights and toward government establishment of religion and government orthodoxy over free expression. One or two votes could make it much harder to protect the environment or pass meaningful campaign finance reform. 
   This last year by a five-to-four majority the Supreme Court held that a rape victim can bring no claim in federal court and that Congress was wrong to provide that remedy in the Violence Against Women Act. By five-to-four majorities the Supreme Court held that state employees have no rights to be paid for overtime work and have no protection from age discrimination, in spite of the laws passed by Congress. What will this mean for other laws prohibiting discrimination in the workplace, regulating wages and hours and health and providing safety standards for working Americans? And by a mere five-to-four vote, the Supreme Court decided that a Nebraska law imposed an undue burden on a woman's right to choose when it sought to prohibit medical procedures by vague language and without regard to the health of the woman. 
   I am confident that AL GORE and JOE LIEBERMAN will nominate women and men who understand the proper role of judges as protectors of our rights and the proper limits on judicial power. On Tuesday evening the President of the United States spoke about the importance of the election to the Supreme Court, to the federal courts generally, to our rights and to the distribution of power in our country. The President noted that ``the American people will make a decision in this election which will shape the Supreme Court and the other federal courts, and the range of liberty and privacy, and the range of acceptable national action for years to come'' and that ``whether we have a new form of ultra-conservative judicial activism that rejects the government's authority to protect the rights of our citizens and interests of our citizens'' is at stake in the November election. As the President explained:  
   Now we're just a vote or two away from reversing Roe v. Wade in the United States Supreme Court, and I think it's inevitable that the next President will have two appointments to the Supreme Court, could be more. Beyond that, as I intimated in my opening remarks, there has already been a majority in this Court for restricting the ability of Congress, even a bipartisan majority in Congress, to get the states to help implement public interest legislation that protects people.  
   There is much at state in the next election and in the appointment of our Supreme Court Justices and other federal judges. In June, the People for the American Way Foundation published an extensive report called ``Courting Disaster: How a Scalia-Thomas Supreme Court Would Endanger Our Rights and Freedoms'' that considered the future makeup of the Supreme Court and its likely effects on our fundamental rights. In his message accompanying that report, Ralph Neas observed:  
   The United States Supreme Court is just one or two new Justices away from curtailing or abolishing fundamental rights that millions of Americans take for granted.  
   The Washington Times lead editorial on Thursday noted pointedly:  
   Before the Supreme Court could overturn Roe vs. Wade, it would take the appointment of two pro-life justices to replace two pro-choice jurists--and their successful confirmation in what would undoubtedly be among the most explosive battles in U.S. Senate history.  
   Mr. Bauer made much the same point in a recent appearance on NBC's Today Show, in which he said: ``I think if Governor Bush gets to put a couple of justices on the court, we will be more likely to protect our unborn children under the Constitution.'' 
   The Republican party platform talks of ideological litmus tests for judges and the end of a woman's right to choose. The Republican candidate for President says that his models for judicial nominees are the most conservative current Justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. If they formed the majority in the years ahead, our rights would be greatly diminished, protections approved by Congress would be routinely invalidated and our Constitution would be harshly reinterpreted. 
   While the other party's platform is filled with calls for rewriting the Constitution, we Democrats seek to preserve the Constitution and protect our fundamental rights as the guaranties of our freedoms. While the Republican Senate has delayed and dissembled over judicial nominations during the last six years--to the point that the Chief Justice of the United States chastised them for refusing to vote up or down--Vice President GORE, Senator DASCHLE and I have pressed for action on outstanding judicial nominees, including historic levels of women and minorities. 
   While Republican Senators all voted lockstep against the confirmation of the first African-American Justice on the Missouri Supreme Court to become a federal judge, Democrats voted for Ronnie White of Missouri, for Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon of California, for Sonia Sotomayor of New York, for Julio Fuentes of New Jersey, and for Barbara Lynn and Hilda Tagle of Texas. 
   While the Republican leadership of the Congress sought to intimidate federal judges, Vice President GORE and Democrats have been working for fair up or down votes on the nominations of qualified women and minorities such as Enrique Moreno of Texas, Judge James Wynn of North Carolina, Roger Gregory of Virginia, Judge Helene White and Kathleen McCree Lewis of Michigan, Judge Legrome Davis of Philadelphia, Dolly Gee of California, and Rhonda Fields of the District of Columbia. 
   While the Republican candidate for President made a fine statement in which he called for votes on judicial nominations within 60 days, he has not prevailed upon the Senate Republican majority to treat nominees fairly now. Instead of 60 days, we see Judge Helene White's nomination to the Sixth Circuit pending more than 1400 days; Elena Kagan, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, pending 500 days; Judge James Wynn, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, pending more than 440 days; Kathleen McCree Lewis, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, pending more than 400 days; Enrique Moreno, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, pending more than 400 days; Bonnie Campbell, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, pending more than 240 days; Roger Gregory, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, pending more than 115 days; Lynette Norton, U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, pending more than 1300 days; Judge Legrome Davis, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, pending more than 800 days; Patricia Coan, U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, pending more than 500 days; Dolly Gee, U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, pending more than 500 days; Rhonda Fields, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, pending more than 350 days; Linda Riegle, U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, pending more than 180 days; Ricardo Morado, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, pending more than 165 days. The Senate is adjourning leaving 33 judicial nominees whose nominations have been pending without Senate action for more than 60 days. 
   And while the Republican majority in the Senate refused for over three years to vote up or down on the confirmation of Bill Lann Lee to head the Civil Rights Division, this outstanding American continued to do his job on behalf of all Americans. With Vice President Gore's support, this Senate slight has finally been made right by the recess appointment of the first Asian-Pacific American to lead the Civil Rights Division. 
   The election next month presents a clear choice. The choice the American people make will determine what kind of judges sit on the Supreme Court and on federal courts all across the country. Those elected by the American people in November will select the judicial guardians of our liberties and the enforcers of our constitutional protections next year and in the decades to come. The future for our children and grandchildren hangs in the balance. I am proud that to support AL GORE and JOE LIEBERMAN. They will nominate judges who understand the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, recently the Burlington Free Press had an article about Ann Kriesel of Burlington, VT and praised her as the volunteer of the week. 
   The Leahy family has known Ann Trueblood Kriesel almost from the time she came to Burlington. She is an extraordinary person, loved and respected by all who know her. She and her husband, Peter, are dear friends of Marcelle's and mine, and she has made her mark on our community in a way that would bring great pride and credit to anyone. 
   As an exemplary teacher, as a mother and grandmother, her intelligence, quiet wit and grace has helped Vermonters of all ages. 
   It is with pride that I ask the article about her be included in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, so that all Senators might know this exemplary woman and how much she and Peter mean to all of us.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senator KYL spoke on the floor yesterday about the Counterterrorism Act of 2000, S. 3205, which he introduced two weeks ago on October 12, 2000. I had planned to speak to him directly about this legislation when I got into the office yesterday, but before I had the opportunity to speak to him, even by telephone, my colleague instead chose to discuss this matter on the Senate floor. 
   I have worked with Senator KYL to pass a number of matters of importance to him in past Congresses and in this one. Most recently, for example, the Senate passed on November 19, 1999, S. 692, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act, and on September 28, 2000, S. 704, the Federal Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act. Moreover, in the past few months, we have worked together to get four more judges in Arizona. I was happy to help Senator KYL clear each of those matters. 
   Unlike the secret holds that often stop good bills from passing often for no good reason, I have had no secret hold on S. 3205. On the contrary, when asked, I have made no secret about the concerns I had with this legislation. 
   An earlier version of this legislation, which Senator KYL tried to move as part of the Intelligence Authorization bill, S. 2507, prompted a firestorm of controversy from civil liberties and human rights organizations, as well as the Department of Justice. I will include letters from the Department of Justice, the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Center for National Security Studies and the American Civil Liberties Union for the RECORD at the end of my statement. I shared many of the concerns of those organizations and the Justice Department. 
   I learned late last week that Senator KYL was seeking to clear S. 3207 for passage by the Senate, even though it had been introduced only the week before. I do not believe the Senate should move precipitously to pass a bill that has garnered so much serious opposition before having the opportunity to review it in detail and ensure that earlier pitfalls had been addressed. Let me say that having reviewed the bill introduced by Senator KYL, it is apparent that he has made efforts to address some of those serious and legitimate concerns. 
   Senator KYL has suggested that if the Justice Department was satisfied with his legislation, I or my staff had earlier indicated that I would be satisfied. I respect the expertise of the Department of Justice and the many fine lawyers and public servants who work there and, where appropriate, seek out their views, as do many Members. That does not mean that I always share the views of the Department of Justice or follow the Department's preferred course and recommendations without exercising my own independent judgment. I would never represent that if the Justice Department were satisfied with his bill, I would automatically defer to their view. Furthermore, my staff has advised me that no such representation was ever made. 
   That being said, I should note that the Department of Justice has advised me about inaccurate and incorrect statements in Senator KYL's bill, S. 3205, which are among the items that should be fixed before the Senate takes up and passes this measure. 
   I have shared those items and other suggestions to improve this legislation with the cosponsor of the bill, Senator FEINSTEIN, whose staff requested our comments earlier this week. My staff provided comments to Senator FEINSTEIN, and understood that at least in the view of that cosponsor of this bill, some of those comments were well-taken and would be discussed with Senator KYL and his staff. Indeed, my staff received their first telephone call about S. 3205 from Senator KYL's staff just yesterday morning, returned the call without finding Senator KYL's  staff available, and hoped to have constructive conversations to resolve our remaining differences. Yet, before these conversations could even begin, Senator KYL chose to conduct our discussions on the floor of the Senate. There may be more productive matters on which the Senate should focus its attention, but I respect my colleague's choice of forum and will lay out here the continuing concerns I have with his legislation. 
   First, the bill contains a sense of the Congress concerning the tragic attack on the U.S.S. Cole that refers to out-dated numbers of sailors killed and injured. I believe that each of the 17 sailors killed and 39 sailors injured deserve recognition and that the full scope of the attack should be properly reflected in this Senate bill. I have urged the sponsors of the bill to correct this part of the bill. I note that last week the Senate passed at least two resolutions on this matter, expressing the outrage we all feel about the bombing attack on that Navy ship. 
   Second, this sense of the Congress urges the United States Government to ``take immediate actions to investigate rapidly the unprovoked attack on the'' U.S.S. Cole, without acknowledging the fact that such immediate action has been taken. The Navy began immediate investigative steps shortly after the attack occurred, and the FBI established a presence on the ground and began investigating within 24 hours. The Director himself went to Yemen to guide this investigation. That investigation is active and ongoing, and no Senate bill should reflect differently, as this one does. We should be commending the Administration for the swift and immediate actions taken to this attack and the strong statements made by the President making clear that no stone will be left unturned to find the criminals who planned this bloody attack. 
   Third, as I previously indicated, the Department of Justice has suggested several corrections to the ``Findings'' section of this bill. For example, the bill suggests there are ``38 organizations'' designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) when there are currently 29. The bill also states that ``current practice is to update the list of FTOs every two years'' when in fact the statute requires redesignation of FTOs every two years. The bill also states that current controls on the transfer and possession of biological pathogens were ``designed to prevent accidents, not theft,'' which according to the Justice Department is simply not accurate. 
   Fourth, the bill requires reports on issues within the jurisdiction of the Senate Judiciary Committee without any direction that those reports be submitted to that Committee. For example, section 9 of the bill would require the FBI to submit to the Select Committees on Intelligence of the Senate and the House a feasibility report on establishing a new capability within the FBI for the dissemination of law enforcement information to the Intelligence community. I have suggested that this report also be required to be submitted to the Judiciary Committees. As the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism and Government Information, I would have expected that Senator KYL would support this suggested change. 
   Fifth, the bill would require reports, with recommendations for appropriate legislative or regulation changes, by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services on safeguarding biological pathogens at research labs and other facilities in the United States. No definition of ``biological pathogen'' is included in the bill and the scope could therefore cover a vast array of biological materials. I have suggested that the focus of these requested reports could be better directed by more carefully defining this term. 
   Finally, the bill would require reimbursement for professional liability insurance for law enforcement officers performing official counterterrorism duties and for intelligence officials performing such duties outside the United States. I have asked for an explanation for this provision. I have scoured the record in vain for explanatory statements by the sponsors of this bill for this provision. It is unclear to me why law enforcement officers conducting investigations here in the United States need such insurance, let alone intelligence officers acting overseas. There may be a good reason why these officers need this special protection, beyond the limited immunity they already have and beyond what other law enforcement and intelligence officers are granted. I need to know the reason for this special protection before any of us are able to evaluate the merits of this proposal. 
   I stand ready, as I always have, to work with the sponsors of S. 3205 to improve their bill. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD the two letters to which I referred.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the ``Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act'' passed the Senate. I was an original cosponsor of this bill, S. 3164, which Senator BAYH introduced on October 5, 2000, with Senators GRAMS and CLELAND. I have been concerned for some time that even as the general crime rate has been declining steadily over the past eight years, the rate of crime against the elderly has remained unchanged. That is why I introduced the Seniors Safety Act, S. 751, with Senators DASCHLE, KENNEDY, and TORRICELLI over a year ago. 
   The Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act includes one of the titles from the Seniors Safety Act. This title does two things. First, it instructs the Attorney General to conduct a study relating to crimes against seniors, so that we can develop a coherent strategy to prevent and properly punish such crimes. Second, it mandates the inclusion of seniors in the National Crime Victimization Study. Both of these are important steps, and they should be made law. 
   The Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act also includes important proposals for addressing the problem of crimes against the elderly, especially fraud crimes. In addition to the provisions described above, this bill authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to establish local programs to prevent fraud against seniors and educate them about the risk of fraud, as well as to provide information about telemarketing and sweepstakes fraud to seniors, both directly and through State Attorneys General. These are two common-sense provisions that will help seniors protect themselves against crime. 
   I hope that we can also take the time to consider the rest of the Seniors Safety Act, and enact even more comprehensive protections for our seniors. The Seniors Safety Act offers a comprehensive approach that would increase law enforcement's ability to battle telemarketing, pension, and health care fraud, as well as to police nursing homes with a record of mistreating their residents. The Justice Department has said that the Seniors Safety Act would ``be of assistance in a number of ways.'' I have urged the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on the Seniors Safety Act as long ago as October 1999, and again this past February, but my requests have not been granted. Now, as the session is coming to a close, we are out of time for hearings on this important and comprehensive proposal and significant parts of the Seniors Safety Act remain pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee as part of the unfinished business of this Congress. 
   Let me briefly summarize the parts of the Seniors Safety Act that the majority in the Congress declined to consider. First, the Seniors Safety Act provides additional protections to nursing home residents. Nursing homes provide an important service for our seniors--indeed, more than 40 percent of Americans turning 65 this year will need nursing home care at some point in their lives. Many nursing homes do a wonderful job with a very difficult task--this legislation simply looks to protect seniors and their families by isolating the bad providers in operation. It does this by giving federal law enforcement the authority to investigate and prosecute operators of those nursing homes that engage in a pattern of health and safety violations. This authority is all the more important given the study prepared by the Department of Health and Human Services and reported this summer in the New York Times showing that 54 percent of American nursing homes fail to meet the Department's ``proposed minimum standard'' for patient care. The study also showed that 92 percent of nursing homes have less staff than necessary to provide optimal care. 
   Second, the Seniors Safety Act helps protect seniors from telemarketing fraud, which costs billions of dollars every year. This legislation would give the Attorney General the authority to block or terminate telephone service where that service is being used to defraud seniors. If someone takes your money at gunpoint, the law says we can take away their gun. If someone uses their phone to take away your money, the law should allow us to protect other victims by taking their phone away. In addition, this proposal would establish a Better Business Bureau-style clearinghouse that would keep track of complaints made about telemarketing companies. With a simple phone call, seniors could find out whether the company trying to sell to them over the phone or over the Internet has been the subject of complaints  or been convicted of fraud. Senator BAYH has recently introduced another bill, S. 3025, the Combating Fraud Against Seniors Act, which includes the part of the Seniors Safety Act that establishes the clearinghouse for telemarketing fraud information. 
   Third, the Seniors Safety Act punishes pension fraud. Seniors who have worked hard for years should not have to worry that their hard-earned retirement savings will not be there when they need them. The bill would create new criminal and civil penalties for those who defraud pension plans, and increase the penalties for bribery and graft in connection with employee benefit plans. 
   Finally, the Seniors Safety Act strengthens law enforcement's ability to fight health care fraud. A recent study by the National Institute for Justice reports that many health care fraud schemes ``deliberately target vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or Alzheimer's patients, who are less willing or able to complain or alert law enforcement.'' This legislation gives law enforcement the additional investigatory tools it needs to uncover, investigate, and prosecute health care offenses in both criminal and civil proceedings. It also protects whistle-blowers who alert law enforcement officers to examples of health care fraud. 
   I commend Senators BAYH, GRAMS and CLELAND for working to take steps to improve the safety and security of America's seniors. We have done the right thing in passing this bipartisan legislation and beginning the fight to lower the crime rate against seniors. I also urge my colleagues to consider and pass the Seniors Safety Act. Taken together, these two bills would provide a comprehensive approach toward giving law enforcement and older Americans the tools they need to prevent crime.

   Mr. LEAHY. Thank you, Senator SESSIONS. Mr. President, I too, want to congratulate and commend my distinguished colleague from Alabama for his leadership and perseverance in getting this legislation passed. I fully support S. 768, which I believe was significantly improved with this most recent substitute amendment. The due process considerations regarding appearances before U.S. Magistrates before removing civilians from overseas were added after earlier Senate consideration and, I believe, improve the bill. This important legislation will close a gap in Federal law that has existed for many years. With foreign nations often not interested in prosecuting crimes against Americans, particularly when committed by an American, the result is a jurisdictional gap that allows some civilians to literally get away with murder. The House Report 106-778, which Senator SESSIONS just referred to a moment ago, outlines many of the problems resulting from this loophole. I agree with Senator SESSIONS with respect to the report. I am glad this legislation will pass this Congress because the gap that has allowed individuals accompanying our military personnel overseas to go unpunished for heinous crimes must be closed. That is why I have been a strong proponent and co-sponsor of this legislation. I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is voting on final passage of S. 768, the Military and Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act. I have worked on this issue for some time now and believe that the Congress should promptly move forward with this important legislation. 
   Specifically, in the last Congress, I originally introduced most of the provisions in this bill as part of the comprehensive crime bill, S. 2484, the Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of 1998. On the first day of this Congress, I again included these provisions in S. 9, the Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of 1999. Last year, I was pleased to join Senators SESSIONS and DEWINE in supporting the Sessions-Leahy-DeWine substitute amendment to S. 768, which was reported favorably by the Senate Judiciary Committee and then passed unanimously by the Senate on July 1, 1999, over a year ago. The bill then sat in a House subcommittee for almost one year until the House of Representatives finally took action in late July, 2000 to consider and pass an amended version of S. 768.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on June 9, 1999, our departed friend and colleague, the former senior Senator from Georgia, introduced the National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act of 1999. This important legislative initiative called for an infusion of Federal funds to improve the quality of State and local forensic science services. I am pleased that Senator SESSIONS has revived the bill, and that we are passing it today as the Paul Coverdell National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act of 2000, S. 3045. 
   The use of quality forensic science services is widely accepted as a key to effective crime-fighting, especially with advanced technologies such as DNA testing. Over the past decade, DNA testing has emerged as the most reliable forensic technique for identifying criminals when biological material is left at a crime scene. Because of its scientific precision, DNA testing can, in some cases, conclusively establish a suspect's guilt or innocence. In other cases, DNA testing may not conclusively establish guilt or innocence, but may have significant probative value for investigators. 
   While DNA's power to root out the truth has been a boon to law enforcement, it has also been the salvation of law enforcement's mistakes--those who for one reason or another, are prosecuted and convicted of crimes that they did not commit. In more than 75 cases in the United States and Canada, DNA evidence has led to the exoneration of innocent men and women who were wrongfully convicted. This number includes at least 9 individuals sentenced to death, some of whom came within days of being executed. In more than a dozen cases, moreover, post-conviction DNA testing that has exonerated an innocent person has also enhanced public safety by providing evidence that led to the apprehension of the real perpetrator. 
   Clearly, forensic science services like DNA testing are critical to the effective administration of justice in 21st century America. 
   Forensic science workloads have increased significantly over the past five years, both in number and complexity. Since Congress established the Combined DNA Index System in the mid-1990s, States have been busy collecting DNA samples from convicted offenders for analysis and indexing. Increased Federal funding for State and local law enforcement programs has resulted in more and better trained police officers who are collecting immense amounts of evidence that can and should be subjected to crime laboratory analysis. 
   Funding has simply not kept pace with this increasing demand, and State crime laboratories are now seriously bottlenecked. Backlogs have impeded the use of new technologies like DNA testing in solving cases without suspects--and reexamining cases in which there are strong claims of innocence--as laboratories are required to give priority status to those cases in which a suspect is known. In some parts of the country, investigators must wait several months--and sometimes more than a year--to get DNA test results from rape and other violent crime evidence. Solely for lack of funding, critical evidence remains untested while rapists and killers remain at large, victims continue to anguish, and statutes of limitation on prosecution expire. 
   Let me describe the situation in my home State. The Vermont Forensics Laboratory is currently operating in an old Vermont State Hospital building in Waterbury, Vermont. Though it is proudly one of only two fully-accredited forensics labs in New England, it is trying to do 21st century science in a 1940's building. The lab has very limited space and no central climate control--both essential conditions for precise forensic science. It also has a large storage freezer full of untested DNA evidence from unsolved cases, for which there are no other leads besides the untested evidence. The evidence is not being processed because the lab does not have the space, equipment or manpower. 
   I commend the scientists and lab personnel at the Vermont Forensics Laboratory for the fine work they do everyday under difficult circumstances. But the people of the State of Vermont deserve better. This is our chance to provide them with the facilities and equipment they deserve. 
   Passage of the Paul Coverdell National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act will give States like Vermont the help they desperately need to handle the increased workloads placed upon their forensic science systems. It allocates $738 million over the next six years for grants to qualified forensic science laboratories and medical examiner's offices for laboratory accreditation, automated equipment, supplies, training, facility improvements, and staff enhancements. 
   I have worked with Senator SESSIONS to revise the bill's allocation formula to make it fair for all States. We have agreed to add a minimum allocation of .06 percent of the total appropriation for each fiscal year for smaller states and have increased the maximum percentage of federal funds available for facility costs from 40 percent to 80 percent for these smaller states. This is only fair for smaller States with limited tax bases and other finite resources, such as my home State of Vermont. 
   The bill we pass today also authorizes $30 million for fiscal year 2001 for the elimination of DNA convicted offender database sample backlogs and other related purposes. I support this provision, although I regret that it does not go further. Senator SCHUMER and I have proposed increasing this authorization by $25 million, which is the amount needed to eliminate the backlog of untested crime scene evidence from unsolved crimes. This backlog is as serious a problem as the convicted offender sample backlog, and we should take the opportunity to address it now. 
   I am also deeply disappointed that S. 3045 fails to address the urgent need to increase access to DNA testing for prisoners who were convicted before this truth-seeking technology became widely available. Prosecutors and law enforcement officers across the country use DNA testing to prove guilt, and rightly so. By the same token, however, it should be used to do what is equally scientifically reliable to do--prove innocence. 
   I was greatly heartened earlier this month when the Governor of Virginia finally pardoned Earl Washington, after new DNA tests confirmed what earlier DNA tests had shown: He was the wrong guy. He was the 88th wrong guy discovered on death row since the reinstatement of capital punishment. His case only goes to show that we cannot sit back and assume that prosecutors and courts will do the right thing  when it comes to DNA. It took Earl Washington years to convince prosecutors to do the very simple tests that would prove his innocence, and more time still to win a pardon. And he is still in prison today. 
   States like Virginia continue to stonewall on requests for DNA testing. They continue to hide behind time limits and procedural default rules to deny prisoners the right to present DNA test results in court. They are still destroying the DNA evidence that could set innocent people free. These sorts of practices must stop. We should not pass up the promise of truth and justice for both sides of our adversarial system that DNA evidence offers. 
   By passing S. 3045, we substantially increase funding to improve the quality and availability of DNA analysis for law enforcement purposes. That is an appropriate use of Federal funds. But we at least ought to require that this truth-seeking technology be made available to both sides. 
   I proposed a modest Sense of Congress amendment to S. 3045, which the Senate is passing today. It describes how DNA testing can and has resulted in the post-conviction exoneration of scores of innocent men and women, including some under sentence of death, and expresses the sense of Congress that we should condition forensic science-related grants to a State or State forensic facility on the State's agreement to ensure post-conviction DNA testing in appropriate cases. Because post-conviction DNA testing has shown that innocent people are sentenced to death in this country with alarming frequency, and because the most common constitutional error in capital cases is egregiously incompetent defense lawyering, my amendment also calls on Congress to work with the States to improve the quality of legal representation in capital cases through the establishment of counsel standards. 
   I introduced legislation in this Congress that would have accomplished both of these things. The Innocence Protection Act of 2000 contains meaningful reforms that I believe could save innocent lives. As the 106th Congress winds down, we have 14 cosponsors in the Senate, and about 80 in the House. We have Democratic and Republican cosponsors, supporters of the death penalty and opponents. President Clinton, Vice-President GORE, and Attorney General Reno have all expressed support for the bill. 
   Tragically, real reform of our nation's capital punishment system foundered on the shoals of election-year politics. But with the Sense of Congress provision that we pass today, at least we have agreed on a blueprint for effective reform legislation in the 107th Congress. 
   Finally, I want to discuss another amendment that I proposed, together with Senator SESSIONS, and that the Senate passes today. It concerns the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000, which the Senate passed on March 27, 2000. 
   The Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act was an important step forward, and I want to thank Mr. HYDE, Mr. CONYERS and Senators SESSIONS, SCHUMER, BIDEN, and all others who worked with us in good faith to enact these long overdue reforms. At the same time, there was some unfinished business in connection with this legislation that my amendment completes.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad we are here. I commend Senator MCCONNELL and also our counterparts in the House, Chairman Callahan and Mrs. Pelosi. The chairman, Senator MCCONNELL, and I have worked closely together on this bill. In the same way I tried to accommodate those concerns of his side of the aisle, he has tried to do the same on our side. As a result, we have a good bipartisan bill. 
   We tried to meet everyone's concerns without putting in unnecessary earmarks or taking away the appropriate flexibility the President should have. We funded the President's important priorities, and I note that both sides of the aisle supported those. 
   I am disappointed, of course, as I am sure the Senator from Kentucky is, with the amount of time it took to get here. Finally, we are here. Had it been left to the two of us, we could have finished this bill before the August recess, but while we were told to make sure the cars in the train would follow, we were not allowed in the engineer's seat to get it down the track. It is here now, and it is a good result. 
   I am glad that we found an acceptable compromise on family planning that does not restrict what private organizations can do with their own private funds. That is only wise. After all, we have heard speeches forever from people here about how the government should get off the backs of individuals. We have finally agreed to do that. It was not easy. I give very high praise to Congresswoman Pelosi for her work on this. 
   I am also pleased that we include $425 million, the Senate funding level for family planning. This is not money for abortions. No funds in this bill can be used for abortions. This is money for family planning. So many countries I have visited are among the poorest of the poor, and they tell me that reducing the rate of population growth is one of their highest priorities but they lack the money to do so. They also say that when they have money for family planning, the number of abortions in their country goes down.  
   We provide adequate authority and funding for debt forgiveness. That had overwhelming support at the meeting the President had with Republicans and Democrats, members of the clergy across the ideological spectrum, representing all faiths and persuasions. I felt honored to be in that meeting. 
   One of our Senate guest Chaplains that week, Father Claude Pomerleau of the University of Portland, accompanied me there. I thank him for his advice and help on this. I should also say that Father Pomerleau is my wife's brother, my brother-in-law. Even the President said that it was probably Father Pomerleau's recommendation that got me into the White House, rather than my position that got him in. 
   In seriousness, on the issue of debt forgiveness, we want to help the world's poorest countries get out of debt. We also want to be sure they make the necessary economic reforms so they can stay out of debt in the future. It is not enough to say, look, we are going to pay your bills so you can get out of debt. It does nothing if then within a few years they are back in debt. 
   We provided aid to Serbia, subject to important conditions relating to Serbia's cooperation with the War Crimes Tribunal. Chairman MCCONNELL, myself, as well as Senator BIDEN and others, strongly support these conditions. 
   The conditions do not take effect until March 31, 2001, and we do not intend the aid spigot to be opened wide before then. We expect the administration--this administration and the next one--to proceed cautiously. 
   We will be watching, as appropriators, just how cautious they are. After all, administrations come and go, but the Appropriations Committee stays here, and we will be here to watch what is done next year. 
   We want to support the new Serbian Government, but only if it is truly democratic and respects the rights of its neighbors and also the rights of minorities. We expect the administration to treat the apprehension and prosecution of war criminals as a priority. 
   I am pleased with the amount of funds for HIV/AIDS. It is a $100 million increase above last year's level. We provided up to $50 million for child immunization, and substantial increases for programs to combat TB, malaria, and other infectious diseases. 
   There are a lot of other provisions I could mention, from restrictions on assistance for Peru--we did that because of the recent efforts to subvert democracy there. We hear the President of Peru make promises, but then take actions that belie what he has said. We put in additional funding for refugees. Unfortunately, we know that the reality throughout the world today is that there are more and more refugees. However, I strongly object to one House provision that was included. And I told the conferees that I objected. It is a $5.2 million earmark for AmeriCares. This is a private organization that does work in Latin America and other places. I cannot recall a single instance--certainly not since 1989, when I became chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee; nor in the 5 years I have been ranking member, and the Senator from Kentucky has been chairman--when we have earmarked funds for a private organization such as this. 
   It was done here, as I understand it, because a 6-year, $5.2 million proposal of AmeriCares was rejected by AID. According to AID, the proposal was too high-tech to be sustainable in the country in question, and because some of the work was already being done by others. I suspect it was a proposal which would buy a lot of expensive equipment from some manufacturer somewhere but might not be something appropriate for that country. 
   Although AID suggested to AmeriCares that they submit a revised proposal, AmeriCares opted instead to seek a congressional earmark, ignoring the usual practice, and basically saying: Just give us the money. We will decide what to do with it. 
   I have no opinion on the merits of their proposal. But if you are going to be applying for Federal funds, you ought to follow the same rules everybody else does. 
   There are literally hundreds of PVOs that submit requests to AID, and many are rejected--some because they do not make sense, and others because there is not the money to fund them. Are we now going to give those other dissatisfied PVOs their own earmarks? It is a terrible precedent. It does not belong in this bill. 
   I will give you an example. I have fought to ban landmines all over the world. We have the Leahy War Victims Fund that spends millions of dollars every year for landmine victims. I wrote the legislation that was the first piece of legislation ever in any country to ban the export of landmines. 
   There are many NGOs and PVOs--that is, nongovernmental organizations and private voluntary organizations--that have come in and worked to get rid of landmines and care for landmine victims. Some are funded through the foreign aid bill or the defense appropriations bill. Some are funded through private donations that they raise. Many contact me because of my identification with this and say: Could I get Federal funding? 
   One of the nice things is that a lot of these--they are screened just before the money goes out. But can you imagine how it would be if we simply gave them the money just because it was requested by a Senator who wants to eradicate landmines? 
   It has always been my view we should let the experts judge the merits of these proposals, rather than just hand over the money to whichever organizations have the most political clout. 
   Some have complained--and I heard this morning--that this is a Republican bill. Others have said it is a Democratic bill. They are both wrong. Neither side got everything they wanted. There were significant compromises on funding and on policy by both sides. That is as it should be, especially for a bill that deals with foreign policy. And that is why I am proud to be here with the Senator from Kentucky, because we should not have a Republican foreign policy or a Democratic foreign policy. We should have a foreign policy that represents the interests of the United States. 
   We have had somewhat of an uneven record since the time when Senator Vandenberg spoke about ``politics ending at the water's edge.'' But on this bill, at least, Republicans and Democrats have come together. 
   It is interesting, too, because the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations of the Appropriations Committee has probably the smallest staff of any committee around here--on the Republican side, with Robin Cleveland, and Tim Rieser on our side, aided by just a couple of people whom I will mention later--to put this together. We don't have huge armies of people to help us, but maybe that is just as well because as a result, in the end, Senators talk to Senators. That is the best way to do things around here. 
   I see the Senator from Utah is on the floor. 
   I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.

   Mr. LEAHY. I am pleased that the House of Representatives tonight approved the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, S. 2413, and sent it to the president for his signature. President Clinton has already endorsed this legislation to support our nation's law enforcement officers and is eager to sign it into law. 
   Senator CAMPBELL and I introduced this bipartisan bill on April 12, 2000. The Senate Judiciary Committee passed our bill unanimously on June 29. For the past four months, we have been urging passage of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000. The Senate finally passed our bipartisan bill on October 11, 2000 by unanimous consent. 
   I want to thank Senators HATCH, SCHUMER, KOHL, THURMOND, REED, JEFFORDS, ROBB, REID, SARBANES, BINGAMAN, ASHCROFT, EDWARDS, BUNNING, CLELAND, HUTCHISON, ABRAHAM and GRAMS for cosponsoring and supporting our bipartisan bill. 
   To better protect our Nation's law enforcement officers, Senator CAMPBELL and I introduced the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998. President Clinton signed our legislation into law on June 16, 1998, pubic law 105-181. That law created a $25 million, 50 percent matching grant program within the Department of Justice to help state and local law enforcement agencies purchase body armor for fiscal years 1999-2001. 
   According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, more than 40 percent of the 1,182 officers killed by a firearm in the line of duty since 1980 could have been saved if they had been wearing body armor. Indeed, the FBI estimates that the risk of fatality to officers while not wearing body armor is 14 times higher than for officers wearing it. 
   In its two years of operation, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program funded more than 325,000 new bulletproof vests for our nation's police officers, including more than 536 vests for Vermont police officers with federal grant funds of $140,253 for Vermont law enforcement agencies. More information about the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program is available at the program's web site at http://vests.ojp.gov/. The entire process of submitting applications and obtaining federal funds is completed through this web site. 
   The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 builds on the success of this program by doubling its annual funding to $50 million for fiscal years 2002-2004. It also improves the program by guaranteeing jurisdictions with fewer than 100,000 residents receive the full 50-50 matching funds because of the tight budgets of these smaller communities. In addition, under the Leahy-Campbell floor amendment to this bill, the purchase of stab-proof vests will be eligible for grant awards to protect corrections officers and sheriffs who face violent criminals in close quarters in local and county jails. 
   More than ever before, police officers in Vermont and around the country  face deadly threats that can strike at any time, even during routine traffic stops. Bulletproof vests save lives. It is essential the we update this law so that many more of our officers who are risking their lives everyday are able to protect 
   themselves. 
   In the last Congress, we created the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program in part in response to the tragic Drega incident along the Vermont and New Hampshire border. On August 19, 1997, Federal, State and local law enforcement authorities in Vermont and New Hampshire had cornered Carl Drega, after hours of hot pursuit. This madman had just shot to death two New Hampshire state troopers and two other victims earlier in the day. In a massive exchange of gunfire with the authorities, Drega lost his life. 
   During that shootout, all federal law enforcement officers wore bulletproof vests, while some state and local officers did not. For example, Federal Border Patrol Officer John Pfeifer, a Vermonter, who was seriously wounded in the incident. If it was not for his bulletproof vest, I would have been attending Officer Pfeifer's wake instead of visiting him, and meeting his wife and young daughter in the hospital a few days later. I am relieved that Officer John Pfeifer is doing well and is back on duty today. 
   The two New Hampshire state troopers who were killed by Carl Drega were not so lucky. They were not wearing bulletproof vests. Protective vests might not have been able to save the lives of those courageous officers because of the high-powered assault weapons used by this madman. We all grieve for the two New Hampshire officers who were killed. Their tragedy underscore the point that all of our law enforcement officers, whether federal, state or local, deserve the protection of a bulletproof vest. With that and lesser-known incidents as constant reminders, I will continue to do all I can to help prevent loss of life among our law enforcement officers. 
   The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 will provide state and local law enforcement agencies with more of the assistance they need to protect their officers. Our bipartisan legislation enjoys the endorsement of many law enforcement organizations, including the Fraternal Order of Police and the National Sheriffs' Association. In my home State of Vermont, the bill enjoys the strong support of the Vermont State Police, the Vermont Police Chiefs Association and many Vermont sheriffs, troopers, game wardens and other local and state law enforcement officials. 
   Since my time as a State prosecutor, I have always taken a keen interest in law enforcement in Vermont and around the country. Vermont has the reputation of being one of the safest states in which to live, work and visit, and rightly so. In no small part, this is due to the hard work of those who have sworn to serve and protect us. And we should do what we can to protect them, when a need like this one comes to our attention. 
   Our Nation's law enforcement officers put their lives at risk in the line of duty everyday. No one knows when danger will appear. Unfortunately, in today's violent world, even a traffic stop may not necessarily be ``routine.'' Each and every law enforcement officer across the nation deserves the protection of a bulletproof vest. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to President Clinton signing this life-saving legislation into law.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I come to the floor once again to announce that Big Oil is beginning to release its third quarter profit reports and while the news is great for investors, it's not so great for American consumers. As American families have been paying sky-high prices at the gas pump and are bracing for record-high home heating costs this winter, the oil industry has been savoring phenomenal profits. Something is wrong when working families are struggling to pay for basic transportation and home heat while Big Oil rakes in obscene amounts of cash by the barrel. 
   The overall net income for major petroleum companies more than doubled in the third quarter of 2000 relative to the third quarter of 1999. Let me illustrate the phenomenal profits of the oil industry for the past year when gasoline prices soared and heating oil stocks fell.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, all of us who knew him during his decade of service in Congress, and others who knew him only by reputation, mourn the recent passing of Gunn McKay. 
   Gunn McKay was a leading member of the Committee on Appropriations in the other body and chaired the Subcommittee on Military Construction. He was effective. He knew how to lead and how to legislate. His voice was an influential voice on energy issues and military readiness and Federal land policy. And he knew how to bring people together to get things done. 
   It was not politics that motivated Gunn McKay in his public service; it was people. He thrived in being able to help people get and keep good-paying jobs. He deeply, unequivocally believed that there is a role for government, through programs like Medicare and Social Security and in other ways, in helping those who struggle. 
   Gunn achieved all of the good he accomplished in life through a deep-down and infectious optimism about people and about the future. More than being a great public servant, he was a good man. Those who worked with him will tell you that Gunn did not have a mean bone in his body. When he left public life Gunn and his wife, Donna, devoted much of their time to church service abroad. 
   The Nation and its Congress are better for the fact that Gunn McKay served here. And so, certainly, are the people of his beloved State of Utah.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing S. 3137, the James Madison Commemoration Commission Act. I was an original cosponsor of this legislation, which will establish a bipartisan commission to recognize the life and accomplishments of James Madison on the 250th anniversary of his birth, March 16, 2001. 
   Among his many accomplishments, James Madison was the primary author of the U.S. Constitution, a document so brilliantly constructed that it has been amended only 27 times in our Nation's history. The first 10 amendments were ratified as our Bill of Rights in 1791, over two centuries ago. There have been just 17 additional amendments. 
   Our tribute to the Father of the Constitution comes in the same year that the Senate defeated no less than three ill-conceived proposals to amend his handiwork. I am proud that we were good stewards of the Constitution, and that the anniversary of Madison's birth will truly be a cause for celebration.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for S. 1898, the Interstate Transportation of Dangerous Criminals Act, also known as ``Jeanna's bill.'' I worked with Senator DORGAN in developing this legislation, which passed the Judiciary Committee in September with unanimous bipartisan support. I praise Senator DORGAN's leadership, and am proud to be an original cosponsor. 
   Kyle Bell was sentenced to life in prison for the brutal murder of 11-year old Jeanna North. On October 13, 1999, Bell escaped, while being transferred interstate by a private prisoner transport company. He picked the locks on his handcuffs and leg irons, and slipped off the bus while it was stopped for gas in New Mexico. He was wearing his own street clothes and shoes. The guards did not notice that Bell was missing until nine hours later, and then delayed in notifying New Mexico authorities. 
   Kyle Bell's escape is not an isolated case. In recent years, there have been several escapes by violent criminals when vans operated by private prisoner transport companies broke down or guards fell asleep on duty. There have also been an alarming number of traffic accidents in which prisoners were seriously injured or killed because drivers were tired, inattentive or poorly trained. 
   Privatization of prisons and prisoner transportation services may be cost efficient, but public safety must come first. Jeanna's bill, S.1898, requires the Attorney General to establish some basic, common-sense guidelines for private companies that transport violent criminals across State lines, including: 
   minimum standards for pre-employment background checks; 
   minimum standards for training employees; 
   minimum standards for the identification, restraint, and safety of violent prisoners; and 
   a requirement that private prisoner transport companies notify local law enforcement in advance of any stops in their jurisdiction. 
   A violation is punishable by a $10,000 fine, plus restitution for the cost of re-capturing any violent prisoner who escapes as the result of such violation. This should create a healthy incentive for companies to abide by the regulations and operate responsibly. 
   As Senator DORGAN has pointed out, a company hauling hazardous waste, cattle, or even circus animals has to meet certain minimum standards. Yet there are no requirements for hauling violent criminals around the country. 
   Jeanna's bill has been endorsed by a wide range of law enforcement and victims' rights groups, including the National Sheriff's Association, the National Association of Police Organizations, the Fraternal Order of Police, the California Correctional Peace Officers Association, the New York Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association, the National Organization of Parents of Murdered Children, the KlassKids Foundation, and many others. It will go a long way toward preventing more violent criminals from escaping. I am pleased that the Senate is finally passing this important legislation, and urge the House of Representatives to do the same.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we consider four bipartisan bills offered together as a package: the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor Act, H.R. 46, the Computer Crime Enforcement Act, which I introduced as S. 1314, on July 1, 1999, with Senator DEWINE and is now also co-sponsored by Senators ROBB, HATCH and ABRAHAM; a Hatch-Leahy-Schumer ``Internet Security Act'' amendment; and a Bayh-Grams-Leahy-Cleland ``Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act'' amendment. I thank my colleagues for their hard work on these pieces of legislation, each of which I will discuss in turn. 
   I support the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor. I cosponsored the Stevens bill, S. 39, to establish a Public Safety Medal of Valor Act. In April and May, 1999, I made sure that the Senate acted on Senator STEVENS' bill, S. 39. 
   On April 22, 1999, the Senate Judiciary Committee took up that measure in regular order and reported it unanimously. At that time I congratulated Senator STEVENS and thanked him for his leadership. I noted that we had worked together on a number of law enforcement matters and that the senior Senator from Alaska is a stalwart supporter of the men and women who put themselves at risk to protect us all. I said that I looked forward to enactment of this measure and to seeing the extraordinary heroism of our police, firefighters and correctional officers recognized with the Medal of Valor. 
   In May, 1999, I was privileged to be on the floor of the Senate when we proceeded to consider S. 39 and passed it unanimously. I took that occasion to commend Senator STEVENS and all who had worked so hard to move this measure in a timely way. That was over one year ago, during National Police Week last year. The measure was sent to the House where it lay dormant for over the rest of last year and most of this one. 
   The President of the United States came to Capitol Hill to speak at the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Service on May 15, 2000, and said on that occasion that if Congress would  not act on the Medal of Valor, he was instructing the Attorney General to explore ways to award such recognition by Executive action. 
   Unfortunately, these calls for action did not waken the House from its slumber on this matter and the House of Representatives refused to pass the Senate-passed Medal of Valor bill. Instead, over the past year, the House has insisted that the Senate take up, fix and pass the House-passed version of this measure if it is to become law. House members have indicated that they are now prepared to accept the Senate-passed text, but insist that it be enacted under the House bill number. In order to get this important measure to the President, that is what we are doing today. We are discharging the House-passed version of that bill, H.R. 46, from the Judiciary Committee, adopting a complete substitute to bring it into conformance with the Stevens bill, S. 39, and sending it back to the House. 
   Senator STEVENS' version of this bill which I cosponsored is preferable to the House-passed bill, H.R. 46, and I am pleased that the version we pass today conforms to the Senate version. 
   For example, the House-passed version would limit the number of possible recipients of the Medal of Valor to 5 in any given year. The Stevens bill had allowed for up to 10 in any year. There is no requirement that the Board select the maximum possible recipients in any year, but I fear that 5 may be an artificially low ceiling for extraordinary valor across this country. I would not want officers from rural areas to be slighted because of such a low number. I would not want firefighters or correctional officers to be slighted. In addition, I can imagine a year where an incident involves a group of officers, maybe even a group numbering more than 5, and recognition of those involved in a single incident could consume all 5 of the awards allowed by the substitute that year and leave others, even others from that incident, without recognition. I believe that the Senate had it right the first time and is getting it right in the version we pass today. 
   In addition, the House-passed version omits any reference to a role for the Board in the creation of criteria and procedures for recommendations of nominees. The Senate-passed bill would have required the concurrence of the Board in the National Medal of Valor Office's establishing of those criteria. Again, I believe the Senate had it right and that is the version we pass today. 
   I hope that the proponents of proceeding in this manner and of making these changes in the language of the bill will explain to the Senate and the American people why we have had to wait over a year for action, why the Senate is being asked to act a second time on a bill strikingly similar to S. 39 but under a House number, and why each of these changes are necessary. I wish the House would have just passed S. 39. 
   The information age is filled with unlimited potential for good, but it also creates a variety of new challenges for law enforcement. A recent survey by the FBI and the Computer Security Institute found that 62 percent of information security professionals reported computer security breaches in the past year. These breaches in computer security resulted in financial losses of more than $120 million from fraud, theft of information, sabotage, computer viruses, and stolen laptops. Computer crime has become a multi-billion dollar problem. 
   Many of us have worked on these issues for years. In 1984, we passed the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to criminalize conduct when carried out by means of unauthorized access to a computer. In 1986, we passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, ECPA, which I was proud to sponsor, to criminalize tampering with electronic mail systems and remote data 
   processing systems and to protect the privacy of computer users. In 1994, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act included the Computer Abuse Amendments which I authored to make illegal the intentional transmission of computer viruses. 
   In the 104th Congress, Senators KYL, GRASSLEY and I worked together to enact the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act to increase protection under federal criminal law for both government and private computers, and to address an emerging problem of computer-age blackmail in which a criminal threatens to harm or shut down a computer system unless their extortion demands are met. In the 105th Congress, Senators KYL and I also worked together on criminal copyright amendments that became law to enhance the protection of copyrighted works online. 
   The Congress must be constantly vigilant to keep the law up-to-date with technology. The Computer Crime Enforcement Act, S. 1314, and the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer ``Internet Security Act'' amendment are part of that ongoing effort. These complementary pieces of legislation reflect twin-track progress against computer crime: More tools at the federal level and more resources for local computer crime enforcement. The fact that this is a bipartisan effort is good for technology policy. 
   But make no mistake about it: even with passage of this legislation, there is more work to be done--both to assist law enforcement and to safeguard the privacy and other important constitutional rights of our citizens. I wish that the Congress had also tackled online privacy in this session, but that will now be punted into the next congressional session. 
   The legislation before us today does not attempt to resolve every issue. For example, both the Senate and the House held hearings this session about the FBI's Carnivore program. Carnivore is a computer program designed to advance criminal investigations by capturing information in Internet communications pursuant to court orders. Those hearings sparked a good debate about whether advances in technology, like Carnivore, require Congress to pass new legislation to assure that our private Internet communications are protected from government over-reaching while protecting the government's right to investigate crime. I look forward to our discussion of these privacy issues in the next Congress. 
   The Computer Crime Enforcement Act is intended to help states and local agencies in fighting computer crime. All 50 states have now enacted tough computer crime control laws. They establish a firm groundwork for electronic commerce, an increasingly important sector of the nation's economy. 
   Unfortunately, too many state and local law enforcement agencies are struggling to afford the high cost of enforcing their state computer crime statutes. 
   Earlier this year, I released a survey on computer crime in Vermont. My office surveyed 54 law enforcement agencies in Vermont--43 police departments and 11 State's attorney offices--on their experience investigating and prosecuting computer crimes. The survey found that more than half of these Vermont law enforcement agencies encounter computer crime, with many police departments and state's attorney offices handling 2 to 5 computer crimes per month. 
   Despite this documented need, far too many law enforcement agencies in Vermont cannot afford the cost of policing against computer crimes. Indeed, my survey found that 98 percent of the responding Vermont law enforcement agencies do not have funds dedicated for use in computer crime enforcement. My survey also found that few law enforcement officers in Vermont are properly trained in investigating computer crimes and analyzing cyber-evidence. 
   According to my survey, 83 percent of responding law enforcement agencies in Vermont do not employ officers properly trained in computer crime investigative techniques. Moreover, my survey found that 52 percent of the law enforcement agencies that handle one or more computer crimes per month cited their lack of training as a problem encountered during investigations. Without the necessary education, training and technical support, our law enforcement officers are and will continue to be hamstrung in their efforts to crack down on computer crimes. 
   I crafted the Computer Crime Enforcement Act, S. 1314, to address this problem. The bill would authorize a $25 million Department of Justice grant program to help states prevent and prosecute computer crime. Grants under our bipartisan bill may be used to provide education, training, and enforcement programs for local law enforcement officers and prosecutors in  the rapidly growing field of computer criminal justice. Our legislation has been endorsed by the Information Technology Association of America and the Fraternal Order of Police. This is an important bipartisan effort to provide our state and local partners in crime-fighting with the resources they need to address computer crime. 
   The Internet Security Act of 2000 makes progress to ensure that we are properly dealing with the increase in computer crime. I thank and commend Senators HATCH and SCHUMER for working with me and other Members of the Judiciary Committee to address some of the serious concerns we had with the first iteration of their bill, S. 2448, as it was originally introduced. 
   Specifically, as introduced, S. 2448 would have over-federalized minor computer abuses. Currently, federal jurisdiction exists for a variety of computer crimes if, and only if, such criminal offenses result in at least $5,000 of damage or cause another specified injury, including the impairment of medical treatment, physical injury to a person or a threat to public safety. S. 2448, as introduced, would have eliminated the $5,000 jurisdictional threshold and thereby criminalized a variety of minor computer abuses, regardless of whether any significant harm resulted. 
   For example, if an overly-curious college sophomore checks a professor's unattended computer to see what grade he is going to get and accidently deletes a file or a message, current Federal law does not make that conduct a crime. That conduct may be cause for discipline at the college, 
   but not for the FBI to swoop in and investigate. Yet, under the original S. 2448, as introduced, this unauthorized access to the professor's computer would have constituted a federal crime. 
   Another example is that of a teenage hacker, who plays a trick on a friend by modifying the friend's vanity Web page. Under current law, no federal crime has occurred. Yet, under the original S. 2448, as introduced, this conduct would have constituted a federal crime. 
   As America Online correctly noted in a June, 2000 letter, ``eliminating the $5,000 threshold for both criminal and civil violations would risk criminalizing a wide range of essentially benign conduct and engendering needless litigation.......'' Similarly, the Internet Alliance commented in a June, 2000 letter that ``[c]omplete abolition of the limit will lead to needless federal prosecution of often trivial offenses that can be reached under state law. .....'' 
   Those provisions were overkill. Our federal laws do not need to reach each and every minor, inadvertent and harmless computer abuse--after all, each of the 50 states has its own computer crime laws. Rather, our federal laws need to reach those offenses for which federal jurisdiction is appropriate. 
   Prior Congresses have declined to over-federalize computer offenses as proposed in S. 2448, as introduced, and sensibly determined that not all computer abuses warrant federal criminal sanctions. When the computer crime law was first enacted in 1984, the House Judiciary Committee reporting the bill stated:  
   the Federal jurisdictional threshold is that there must be $5,000 worth of benefit to the defendant or loss to another in order to concentrate Federal resources on the more substantial computer offenses that affect interstate or foreign commerce. (H. Rep. 98-894, at p. 22, July 24, 1984).  
   Similarly, the Senate Judiciary Committee under the chairmanship of Senator THURMOND, rejected suggestions in 1986 that ``the Congress should enact as sweeping a Federal statute as possible so that no computer crime is potentially uncovered.'' (S. Rep. 99-432, at p. 4, September 3, 1986). 
   The Hatch-Leahy-Schumer substitute amendment to S. 2448, which was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee on October 5th, addresses those federalism concerns by retaining the $5,000 jurisdictional threshold in current law. That Committee-reported substitute amendment, with the additional refinements reflected in the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security Act amendment to H.R. 46, which the Senate considers today, makes other improvements to the original bill and current law, as summarized below. 
   First, titles II, III, IV and V of the original bill, S. 2448, about which various problems had been raised, are eliminated. For example, title V of the original bill would have authorized the Justice Department to enter into Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLAT) with foreign governments that would allow the Attorney General broad discretion to investigate lawful conduct in the U.S. at the request of foreign governments without regard to whether the conduct investigated violates any Federal computer crime law. In my view, that discretion was too broad and troubling. 
   Second, the amendment includes an authorization of appropriations of $5 million to the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property (CCIP) section within the Justice Department's Criminal Division and requires the Attorney General to make the head of CCIP a ``Deputy Assistant Attorney General,'' which is not a Senate-confirmed position, in order to highlight the increasing importance and profile of this position. This authorized funding level is consistent with an amendment I sponsored and circulated to Members of the Judiciary Committee to improve S. 2448 and am pleased to see it incorporated into the Internet Security Act amendment to H.R. 46. 
   Third, the amendment modifies section 1030 of title 18, United States Code, in several important ways, including providing for increased and enhanced penalties for serious violations of federal computer crime laws, clarifying the definitions of ``loss'' to ensure that the full costs to a hacking victim are taken into account and of ``protected computer'' to facilitate investigations of international computer crimes affecting the United States, and preserving the existing $5,000 threshold and other jurisdictional prerequisites for violations of section 1030(a)(5)--i.e., no Federal crime has occurred unless the conduct (1) causes loss to 1 or more persons during any 1-year period aggregating at least $5,000 in value, (2) impairs the medical care of another person, (3) causes physical injury to another person, (4) threatens public health or safety, or (5) causes damage affecting a computer system used by or for a government entity in furtherance of the administration of justice, national defense, or national security. 
   The amendment clarifies the precise elements of the offense the government must prove in order to establish a violation by moving these prerequisites from the current definition of ``damage'' to the description of the offense. In addition, the amendment creates a new category of felony violations where a hacker causes damage to a computer system used by or for a government entity in furtherance of the administration of justice, national defense, or national security. 
   Currently, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act provides for federal criminal penalties for those who intentionally access a protected computer or cause an unauthorized transmission to a protected computer and cause damage. ``Protected computer'' is defined to include those that are ``used in interstate or foreign commerce.'' See 18 U.S.C. 1030(e)(2)(B). The amendment would clarify the definition of ``protected computer'' to ensure that computers which are used in interstate or foreign commerce but are located outside of the United States are included within the definition of ``protected computer'' when those computers are used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or communication of this country. This will ensure that our government will be able to conduct domestic investigations and prosecutions against hackers from this country who hack into foreign computer systems and against those hacking through the United States to other foreign venues. Moreover, by clarifying the fact that a domestic offense exists, the United States will be able to use speedier domestic procedures in support of 
   international hacker cases, and create the option of prosecuting such criminals in the United States. 
   The amendment also adds a definition of ``loss'' to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Current law defines the term ``damage'' to include impairment of the integrity or availability of data, programs, systems or information causing a ``loss aggregating at least $5,000 in value during any 1-year period to one or more individuals.'' See 18 U.S.C.  1030(e)(8)(A). The new definition of ``loss'' to be added as section 1030(e)(11) will ensure that the full  costs to victims of responding to hacking offenses, conducting damage assessments, restoring systems and data to the condition they were in before an attack, as well as lost revenue and costs incurred because of an interruption in service, are all counted. This statutory definition is consistent with the definition of ``loss'' appended by the U.S. Sentencing Commission to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines (see U.S.S.G. &#167;2B1.1 Commentary, Application note 2), and will help reconcile procedures by which prosecutors value loss for charging purposes and by which judges value loss for sentencing purposes. Getting this type of true accounting of ``loss'' is important because loss amounts can be used to calculate restitution and to determine the appropriate sentence for the perpetrator under the sentencing guidelines. 
   Fourth, subsection 3(e) of the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security Act amendment to H.R. 46 clarifies the grounds for obtaining damages in civil actions for violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Current law authorizes a person who suffers ``damage or loss'' from a violation of section 1030 to sue the violator for compensatory damages or injunctive or other equitable relief, and limits the remedy to ``economic damages'' for violations ``involving damage as defined in subsection (e)(8)(A),'' relating to violations of 1030(a)(5) that cause loss aggregating at least $5,000 during any 1-year period. To take account of both the new definition of ``loss'' and the incorporation of this jurisdictional threshold into the description of the offense (rather than the current definition of ``damage''), the amendment strikes the reference to subsection (e)(8)(A) in the current civil action provision and retains Congress' previous intent to allow civil plaintiffs only economic damages for violations of section 1030(a)(5) that do not also affect medical treatment, cause physical injury, threaten public health and safety or affect computer systems used in furtherance of the administration of justice, the national defense or national security. 
   The Congress provided this civil remedy in the 1994 amendments to the Act, which I originally sponsored with Senator Gordon Humphrey, to enhance privacy protection for computer communications and the information stored on computers by encouraging institutions to improve computer security practices, deterring unauthorized persons from trespassing on computer systems of others, and supplementing the resources of law enforcement in combating computer crime. [See The Computer Abuse Amendments Act of 1990: Hearing Before the Subcomm. On Technology and the Law of the Senate Comm. On the Judiciary, 101st Cong., 2nd Sess., S. Hrg. 101-1276, at pp. 69, 88, 92 (1990); see also Statement of Senator Humphrey, 136 Cong. Rec. S18235 (1990) (``Given the Government's limited capacity to pursue all computer crime cases, the existence of this limited civil remedy will serve to enhance deterrence in this critical area.'')]. The ``new, civil remedy for those harmed by violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act'' was intended to ``boost the deterrence of the statute by allowing aggrieved individuals to obtain relief.'' [S. Rep. No. 101-544, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 6-7 ( 1990); see also Statement of Senator LEAHY, 136 Cong. Rec. S18234 (1990)]. We certainly and expressly did not want to ``open the floodgates to frivolous litigation.'' [Statement of Senator LEAHY, 136 Cong. Rec. S4614 (1990)]. 
   At the time the civil remedy provision was added to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, this Act contained no prohibition against negligently causing damage to a computer through unauthorized access, reflected in current law, 18 U.S.C. &#167;1030(a)(5)(C). That prohibition was added only with subsequent amendments made in 1996, as part of the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. Nevertheless, the civil remedy has been interpreted in some cases to apply to the negligent manufacture of computer hardware or software. Most notably See, e.g., Shaw v. Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc., NEC, 91 F. Supp. 2d 926 (E.D. TX 1999) (court interpreted the term transmission to include sale of computers with a minor design defect). 
   The Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security Act amendment adds a new sentence clarifying that civil actions may not be brought ``for the negligent design or manufacture of computer hardware, computer software, or firmware.'' This change should ensure that the civil remedy is a robust option for private enforcement actions, while limiting its applicability to cases that are more appropriately governed by contractual warranties, state tort law and consumer protection laws. 
   Fifth, sections 104 and 109 of the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security Act amendment to H.R. 46 authorize criminal and civil forfeiture of computers, equipment, and other personal property used to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as well as real and personal property derived from the proceeds of computer crime. Property, both real and personal, which is derived from proceeds traceable to a violation of section 1030, is currently subject to both criminal and civil forfeiture. See 18 U.S.C. &#167;981(a)(1)(C) and 982(a)(2)(B). Thus, the amendment would clarify in section 1030 itself that forfeiture applies and extend the application of forfeiture to property that is used or intended to be used to commit or to facilitate the commission of a computer crime. In addition, to deter and prevent piracy, theft and counterfeiting of intellectual property, the section 109 of the amendment allows forfeiture of devices, such as replicators or other devices used to copy or produce computer programs to which counterfeit labels have been affixed. 
   The forfeiture amendments are based on the procedures set forth in section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. &#167;853) and chapter 46 of title 18, as revised this year by the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000, and thereby build in all of the existing due process protections in existing law. 
   In particular, these provisions protect innocent property owners. Sections 104 and 109 subject to forfeiture only property which belongs to the person who knowingly violated the law, not innocent third parties whose property unbeknownst to them was used to violate the law. Under existing law, for example, a drug trafficker may avail herself of the facilities of a telephone 
   company to communicate with her source of narcotics, send pager messages to drug confederates and signal the buyer by beeper when the sale is ready to be consummated, but the law does not authorize forfeiture of the facilities of the telephone company which was neither aware of nor intended the drug deal. Likewise, a rogue employee of an Internet access provider or other computer hacker or cyber-criminal will almost necessarily use the facilities of an Internet access provider to commit her violation, but Sections 104 and 109 do not authorize forfeiture of the provider's facilities simply because its facilities were used. 
   The criminal forfeiture provision in section 104 specifically states that only the ``interest of such person,'' referring to the defendant who committed the computer crime, is subject to forfeiture. Moreover, the criminal forfeiture authorized by Sections 104 and 109 is made expressly subject to Section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, but subsection (d) of section 413 is expressly exempted from application to Section 104 and 109. That subsection (d) creates a rebuttable presumption of forfeiture in favor of the government where a person convicted of a felony acquired the property during the period that the crime was committed or within a reasonable time after such period and there was no likely source for such property other than the criminal violation. Thus, by making subsection (d) inapplicable, Sections 104 and 109 make it more difficult for the government to prove that the property should be forfeited. 
   Chapter 46 of title 18, to which the civil forfeiture provision of section 104 is expressly made subject, provides property owners with important safeguards from unwarranted forfeitures and government overreaching. First, the civil forfeiture law states that ``[n]o property shall be forfeited ..... to the extent of the interest of an owner or lien holder by reason of any act or omission ..... to have been committed without the knowledge of that owner or lien holder.'' 18 U.S.C.  981(a)(2).  Furthermore, the chapter puts the burden on the government to prove forfeiture by a preponderance of the evidence, permits courts to appoint counsel to represent indigent owners where the owner is represented by a court-appointed attorney in a related federal criminal case, and permits recovery of attorney fees and costs for property owners not appointed counsel if they substantially prevail on their claim. 
   Sixth, the amendment contains certain provisions intended to deter computer crimes by juveniles. The amendment would permit federal prosecution, under 18 U.S.C.  5032, of juveniles as juveniles upon certification by the Attorney General, after investigation, that the offense charged is one of the most serious felonious violations of our federal computer crime laws and that there is a substantial Federal interest in the case or the offense to warrant the exercise of Federal jurisdiction. The computer crime offenses that would qualify for federal prosecution of a juvenile offender as a juvenile are: violations of 1030(a)(1) (accessing a computer and obtaining information relating to national security with reason to believe the information could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of a foreign nation and willfully retaining or transmitting that information or attempting to do so); (a)(2)(B) (intentionally accessing without authorization a federal government computer and obtaining information); (a)(3) (intentionally accessing without authorization a federal government computer and affecting the use by or for the government); and (a)(5)(A)(i) (knowingly causing the transmission of a program to intentionally cause damage without authorization to a protected computer). 
   The amendment would also authorize a judge to exercise discretion and impose as part of a sentence for a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act termination of or ineligibility for federal financial assistance for education at a post-secondary institution. The court is expressly authorized to reinstate such eligibility upon motion of the defendant. 
   Unlike the version reported by the Judiciary Committee, the amendment does not require that prior delinquency adjudications of juveniles for violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act be counted under the definition of ``conviction'' for purposes of enhanced penalties. This is an improvement that I urged since juvenile adjudications simply are not criminal convictions. Juvenile proceedings are more informal than adult prosecutions and are not subject to the same due process protections. Consequently, counting juvenile adjudications as a prior conviction for purposes of the recidivist sanctions under the amendment would be unduly harsh and unfair. In any event, prior juvenile delinquency adjudications are already subject to sentencing enhancements under certain circumstances under the Sentencing Guidelines. See, e.g., U.S.S.G.  411.2(d) (upward adjustments in sentences required for each juvenile sentence to confinement of at least sixty days and for each juvenile sentence imposed within five years of the defendant's commencement of instant offense). 
   Seventh, section 108 of the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security Act amendment to H.R. 46 would authorize the interception of wire and oral communications relating to computer fraud and abuse violations by expanding the enumerated list of predicate offenses that may support such authority to include felony violations of section 1030. Under current law, federal investigators and prosecutors have the authority to obtain an order for interception of electronic communications, such as e-mail, when investigating any felony, including a felony violation of Section 1030. Current law, however, does not permit federal investigators and prosecutors to intercept wire or oral communications in investigations of such crimes. 
   Section 108 addresses this anomaly by adding felony violations of Section 1030 to the list of federal crimes for which federal law enforcement officials may seek evidence by intercepting wire or oral communications. Applications for such interception are to be governed by the same stringent Title III requirements that govern all such applications. See 18 U.S.C.  2510 et seq. 
   Some have objected to this provision, questioning the necessity of adding computer crimes to the list of crimes for which interception of wire and oral communications are authorized since this provision would, for example, permit government wiretapping for some relatively minor computer felonies. I disagree. We have come to rely on computers for everything from banking and stock-trading to travel reservations to our most intimate personal conversations with friends and family. Opportunists are exploiting our reliance on computers to advance fraudulent schemes or just for the sport of disruption. We have seen the global havoc that is threatened by a lone hacker transmitting a single virus. Giving law enforcement a full complement of tools to 
   fight computer crime serves to protect the security, confidentiality and privacy of our computer communications and stored electronic information. That there are some computer felonies that are less serious than other computer felonies that might not be as worthy of a wiretap is true of all felonies. The stringent procedural requirements for wiretaps and the investment in time and resources necessary to execute a wiretap within the bounds of the law provide incentive for law enforcement to make prudent use of this important investigative tool in computer fraud and abuse cases. 
   Developments in technology have placed wire, oral and electronic communications on more equal footing in terms of frequency of use, expectation of privacy, and exploitation for criminal purposes. The law should recognize that more equal footing, particularly for electronic messages, and accord the same privacy safeguards to electronic communications as apply to both oral and wire communications. In fact, the Administration has proposed such changes in the legislation transmitted to the Congress in July, 2000 called the ``Enhancement of Privacy and Public Safety in Cyberspace Act.'' For example, the Administration's proposal would apply existing prerequisites for court-authorized wire communications, such as high-level official approval and investigation of an enumerated predicate offense (rather than any felony), to most electronic communications, such as e-mails and fax transmissions. Unfortunately, as I have noted, we have been unable to reach a consensus on privacy legislation in general or on this more specific instance where additional legislative attention is needed. These are matters that should be addressed. 
   Eighth, the amendment changes a current directive to the Sentencing Commission enacted as section 805 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, P.L. 104-132, that imposed a 6-month mandatory minimum sentence for any conviction of the sections 1030(a)(4) or (a)(5) of title 18, United States code. The Administration has noted that ``[i]n some instances, prosecutors have exercised their discretion and elected not to charge some defendants whose actions otherwise would qualify them for prosecution under the statute, knowing that the result would be mandatory imprisonment.'' Clearly, mandatory imprisonment is not always the most appropriate remedy for a federal criminal violation, and the ironic result of this ``get tough'' proposal has been to discourage prosecutions that might otherwise have gone forward. The amendment eliminates that mandatory minimum term of incarceration for misdemeanor and less serious felony computer crimes. 
   Ninth, section 110 of the amendment directs the Sentencing Commission to review and, where appropriate, adjust sentencing guidelines for computer crimes to address a variety of factors, including to ensure that the guidelines provide sufficiently stringent penalties to deter and punish persons who intentionally use encryption in connection with the commission or concealment of criminal acts. 
   The Sentencing Guidelines already provide for enhanced penalties when persons obstruct or impede the administration of justice, see U.S.S.G. 3C1.1, or engage in more than minimal planning, see U.S.S.G. 2B1.1(b)(4)(A). As the use of encryption technology becomes more widespread, additional guidance from the Sentencing Commission would be helpful to determine the circumstances when such encryption use would warrant a guideline adjustment. For example, if a defendant employs an encryption product that  works automatically and transparently with a telecommunications service or software product, an enhancement for use of encryption may be not be appropriate, while the deliberate use of encryption as part of a sophisticated and intricate scheme to conceal criminal activity and make the offense, or its extent, difficult to detect, may warrant a guideline enhancement either under existing guidelines or a new guideline. 
   Tenth, section 105 of the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security Act amendment to H.R. 46 would eliminate certain statutory restrictions on the authority of the United States Secret Service (``Secret Service''). Under current law, the Secret Service is authorized to investigate offenses under six designated subsections of 18 U.S.C. &#167;1030, subject to agreement between the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General: subsections (a)(2)(A) (illegally accessing a computer and obtaining financial information); (a)(2)(B) (illegally accessing a computer and obtaining information from a department or agency of the United States); (a)(3) (illegally accessing a non-public computer of a department or agency of the United States either exclusively used by the United States or used by the United States and the conduct affects that use by or for the United States); (a)(4) (accessing a protected computer with intent to defraud and thereby furthering the fraud and obtaining a thing of value, unless the object of the fraud and the thing obtained consists only of the use of the computer and the value of such use is not more than $5,000 in a one-year period); (a)(5) (knowingly causing the transmission of a program, information, code or command and thereby intentionally and without authorization causing damage to a protected computer; and illegally accessing a protected computer and causing damage recklessly or otherwise); and (a)(6) (trafficking in a password with intent to defraud). 
   The Secret Service is not authorized to investigate offenses under subsection (a)(1) (accessing a computer and obtaining information relating to national security with reason to believe the information could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of a foreign nation and willfully retaining or transmitting that information or attempting to do so); (a)(2)(C) (illegally accessing a protected computer and obtaining information where the conduct involves an interstate or foreign communication); and (a)(7) (transmitting a threat to damage a protected computer with intent to extort). 
   Section 105 of the Internet Security Act removes these limitations on the authority of the Secret Service and authorizes the Secret Service to investigate any offense under Section 1030 subject to agreement between the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General. Section 105 also makes a stylistic change, describing the inter-agency agreement as ``between'' the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General rather than one ``which shall be entered into by'' them. 
   Prior to 1996 amendments to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Secret Service was authorized to investigate all violations of Section 1030. According to the 1996 Committee Reports of the 104th Congress, 2nd Session, the 1996 amendments attempted to concentrate the 
   Secret Service' s jurisdiction on certain subsections considered to be within the Secret Service's traditional jurisdiction and not grant authority in matters with a national security nexus. According to the Administration, which first proposed the elimination of these statutory restrictions in connection with transmittal of its comprehensive crime bill, the ``21st Century Law Enforcement and Public Safety Act,'' however, these specific enumerations of investigative authority ``have the potential to complicate investigations and impede interagency cooperation.'' (See Section-by-section Analysis, SEC. 3082, for ``21st Century Law Enforcement and Public Safety Act''). 
   The current restrictions, for example, risk hindering the Secret Service from investigating ``hacking'' into White House computers or investigating threats against the President that may be delivered by such a ``hacker,'' and fulfilling its mission to protect financial institutions and the nation's financial infrastructure. The provision thus modifies existing law to restore the Secret Service's authority to investigate violations of Section 1030, leaving it to the Departments of Treasury and Justice to determine between them how to allocate workload and particular cases. 
   Eleventh, section 107 of the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer Internet Security Act amendment would provide an additional defense to civil actions relating to preserving records in response to government requests. Current law authorizes civil actions and criminal liability for unauthorized interference with or disclosures of electronically stored wire or electronic communications under certain circumstances. 18 U.S.C.  2701, et seq. A provision of that statutory scheme makes clear that it is a complete defense to civil and criminal liability if the person or entity interfering with or attempting to disclose a communication does so in good faith reliance on a court warrant or order, grand jury subpoena, legislative or statutory authorization. 18 U.S.C.  2707(e)(1). 
   Current law, however, does not address one scenario under which a person or entity might also have a complete defense. A provision of the same statutory scheme currently requires providers of wire or electronic communication services and remote computing services, upon request of a governmental entity, to take all necessary steps to preserve records and other evidence in its possession for a renewal period of 90 days pending the issuance of a court order or other process requiring disclosure of the records or other evidence. 18 U.S.C.  2703(f). Section 2707(e)(1), which describes the circumstances under which a person or entity would have a complete defense to civil or criminal liability, fails to identify good faith reliance on a governmental request pursuant to Section 2703(f) as another basis for a complete defense. Section 107 modifies current law by addressing this omission and expressly providing that a person or entity who acts in good faith reliance on a governmental request pursuant to Section 2703(f) also has a complete defense to civil and criminal liability. 
   Finally, the bill authorizes construction and operation of a National Cyber Crime Technical Support Center and 10 regional computer forensic labs that will provide education, training, and forensic examination capabilities for State and local law enforcement officials charged with investigating computer crimes. The section authorizes a total of $100 million for FY 2001, of which $20 million shall be available solely for the 10 regional labs and would complement the state computer crime grant bill, S. 1314, with which this bill is offered. 
   I am pleased to see the ``Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act'' pass as an amendment to this legislation. I was an original cosponsor of this bill, S. 3164, which Senator BAYH introduced on October 5, 2000, with Senators GRAMS and CLELAND. I have been concerned for some time that even as the general crime rate has been declining steadily over the past eight years, the rate of crime against the elderly has remained unchanged. That is why I introduced the Seniors Safety Act, S. 751, with Senators DASCHLE, KENNEDY, and TORRICELLI over a year ago. 
   The Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act includes one of the titles from the Seniors Safety Act. This title does two things. First, it instructs the Attorney General to conduct a study relating to crimes against seniors, so that we can develop a coherent strategy to prevent and properly punish such crimes. Second, it mandates the inclusion of seniors in the National Crime Victimization Study. Both of these are important steps, and they should be made law. 
   The Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act also includes important proposals for addressing the problem of crimes against the elderly, especially fraud crimes. In addition to the provisions described above, this bill authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to establish local programs to prevent fraud against seniors and educate them about the risk of fraud, as well as to provide information about telemarketing and sweepstakes fraud to seniors, both directly and through State Attorneys General. These are two common-sense provisions that will help seniors protect themselves against crime.  
   I hope that we can also take the time to consider the rest of the Seniors Safety Act, and enact even more comprehensive protections for our seniors. The Seniors Safety Act offers a comprehensive approach that would increase law enforcement's ability to battle telemarketing, pension, and health care fraud, as well as to police nursing homes with a record of mistreating their residents. The Justice Department has said that the Seniors Safety Act would ``be of assistance in a number of ways.'' I have urged the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on the Seniors Safety Act as long ago as October 1999, and again this past February, but my requests have not been granted. Now, as the session is coming to a close, we are out of time for hearings on this important and comprehensive proposal and significant parts of the Seniors Safety Act remain pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee as part of the unfinished business of this Congress. 
   Let me briefly summarize the parts of the Seniors Safety Act that the majority in the Congress declined to consider. First, the Seniors Safety Act provides additional protections to nursing home residents. Nursing homes provide an important service for our seniors--indeed, more than 40 percent of Americans turning 65 this year will need nursing home care at some point in their lives. Many nursing homes do a wonderful job with a very difficult task--this legislation simply looks to protect seniors and their families by isolating the bad providers in operation. It does this by giving federal law enforcement the authority to investigate and prosecute operators of those 
   nursing homes that engage in a pattern of health and safety violations. This authority is all the more important given the study prepared by the Department of Health and Human Services and reported this summer in the New York Times showing that 54 percent of American nursing homes fail to meet the Department's ``proposed minimum standard'' for patient care. The study also showed that 92 percent of nursing homes have less staff than necessary to provide optimal care. 
   Second, the Seniors Safety Act helps protect seniors from telemarketing fraud, which costs billions of dollars every year. This legislation would give the Attorney General the authority to block or terminate telephone service where that service is being used to defraud seniors. If someone takes your money at gunpoint, the law says we can take away their gun. If someone uses their phone to take away your money, the law should allow us to protect other victims by taking their phone away. In addition, this proposal would establish a Better Business Bureau-style clearinghouse that would keep track of complaints made about telemarketing companies. With a simple phone call, seniors could find out whether the company trying to sell to them over the phone or over the Internet has been the subject of complaints or been convicted of fraud. Senator BAYH has recently introduced another bill, S. 3025, the Combating Fraud Against Seniors Act, which includes the part of the Seniors Safety Act that establishes the clearinghouse for telemarketing fraud information. 
   Third, the Seniors Safety Act punishes pension fraud. Seniors who have worked hard for years should not have to worry that their hard-earned retirement savings will not be there when they need them. The bill would create new criminal and civil penalties for those who defraud pension plans, and increase the penalties for bribery and graft in connection with employee benefit plans. 
   Finally, the Seniors Safety Act strengthens law enforcement's ability to fight health care fraud. A recent study by the National Institute for Justice reports that many health care fraud schemes ``deliberately target vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or Alzheimer's patients, who are less willing or able to complain or alert law enforcement.'' This legislation gives law enforcement the additional investigatory tools it needs to uncover, investigate, and prosecute health care offenses in both criminal and civil proceedings. It also protects whistle-blowers who alert law enforcement officers to examples of health care fraud. 
   I commend Senators BAYH, GRAMS and CLELAND for working to take steps to improve the safety and security of America's seniors. We are doing the right thing today in passing this bipartisan legislation and beginning the fight to lower the crime rate against seniors. I also urge my colleagues to consider and pass the Seniors Safety Act. Taken together, these two bills would provide a comprehensive approach toward giving law enforcement and older Americans the tools they need to prevent crime. 
   On March 27, 2000, the Senate passed H.R. 1658, the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000. This was an important step forward and I want to thank Mr. HYDE, Mr. CONYERS and Senators SESSIONS, BIDEN, SCHUMER and all others who worked with us in good faith to enact these long overdue reforms. At the same time, there was some unfinished business in connection with this legislation that a Hatch-Leahy amendment to H.R. 46 completes.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last Thursday, the Senate passed the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine-Kohl substitute amendment to S. 1854, the ``Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act,'' that will make significant improvements to this important antitrust law. Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976 (HSR), requires companies that plan to merge to notify the Justice Department's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission of their intention and submit certain information. HSR pre-merger notifications provide advance notice of potentially anti-competitive transactions and allow the antitrust agencies to block mergers before they are consummated, which is easier than undoing them after-the-fact. 
   Since passage of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, this law has worked well to help the American economy flourish, despite larger and more complex mergers and consolidations within and among different industries. The Hatch-Leahy-DeWine-Kohl substitute amendment to S. 1854, the ``Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act,'' will update this law and make it work even better. 
   Specifically, the substitute would raise the minimum threshold for the ``size of the transaction'' required to provide HSR notifications from $15,000,000 to $50,000,000. Thus, no pre-merger filing will be required if the transaction is valued at less than $50,000,000. A pre-merger filing would always be required if the size of the transaction is valued at more than $200,000,000. With regard to transactions valued at between $50,000,000 and $200,000,000, the amendment would require pre-merger filing if the total assets or net annual sales of one party are over $100,000,000 annually while the other party's total assets or net annual sales are over $10,000,000 annually. The thresholds may be adjusted by the FTC every three years to reflect the percentage change in the gross national product for that period. These threshold changes are supported by the antitrust agencies. 
   The remaining part of the substitute directs the Federal Trade Commission and the DOJ's Antitrust Division to implement regulations to improve the manner in which these agencies obtain information as part of the review of a proposed merger. The antitrust agencies do not object to these parts of the substitute amendment. 
   As explained in more detail below, this substitute addresses the most significant flaws in the original bill. 
   To appreciate the issues addressed in the bill, the pre-merger review procedures currently in effect must be understood. Upon receipt of the merger notification, the agency takes a ``quick look'' and determines whether to open a Preliminary Investigation, PI. A PI may take from a few weeks to several months to determine whether to close the PI or proceed with a Second Request or Civil Investigative Demand, CID, for additional information. Second Requests were issued in only 2.5 percent of reported transactions in 1999. 
   Under statutory time limits, the Second Request must be made within 30 days from the initial filing. In addition, only a single Second Request is allowed so it must be complete. This Second Request extends the waiting period before the merger may be completed for up to 20 days from the time that all responsive documents are submitted to the agency. Second requests for voluminous documents, combined with the requirement that ``all responsive documents'' have been supplied by the companies to the agency, can cause substantial delays in the waiting period and the time when a merger may be completed. 
   To address business concerns over broad second requests and the delay such requests may cause, the original bill substantially limited the scope of agencies' second requests and authorized judicial review of both the scope of and compliance with these critical requests, as detailed below. 
   First, the original bill would have limited the scope of second requests to information or documents ``not unreasonably cumulative or duplicative'' and that ``do not impose a burden or expense that substantially outweighs the likely benefit of the information to the agency.'' The antitrust agencies raised significant, valid questions about whether these limitations were workable. In particular, at the time a second request is issued, an agency generally cannot evaluate the cost/benefit tradeoff because it does not know the costs of production, and has only limited knowledge about the potential benefits of the information for the investigation (in part because the anticompetitive issues are often still indefinite). The documents themselves provide this information. 
   The bill would also have required the antitrust agency to provide, with each second request, a specific summary of the competitive concerns presented by the proposed acquisition and the relation between such concerns and the second request specifications. The antitrust agencies questioned this requirement because anticompetitive concerns are still often general and evolving at the time a second request is issued. Consequently, a specific summary may not be possible at that time and would likely be incomplete since additional competitive concerns may be discovered during the investigation. Furthermore, according to the agencies, this requirement was unnecessary since they ordinarily provide a general explanation of their concerns and provide more specific information as it develops, in face-to-face conferences between parties (or their counsel) and investigating staff. 
   Second, the original bill would have limited the agencies' ability to claim that the production of documents in response to a second request is deficient only if the deficiency ``materially impairs the ability of the agency to conduct a preliminary antitrust review.'' This proposed standard for claiming deficiency (that is, for requiring further document production) is higher than the ordinary standard for discovery and would limit the agency's 
   ability to investigate, especially given HSR's stringent time frames and the fact that the second request is the single opportunity to seek information in a premerger review. This could have seriously harmed the agency's posture in court, as courts often examine the entire substance of the agency's case even in a preliminary injunction action. 
   Finally, the original bill would have authorized a merging company to seek review by a magistrate judge of both the scope of the second request and any claim of deficient production. The magistrate was required to apply the scope and deficiency standards described above, which impose more limits on antitrust agencies than general civil discovery rules. Moreover, magistrates were unlikely to be familiar with the types of information that form the basis for the complex antitrust analysis required in predicting likely future competitive effects of a proposed transaction--a shortcoming with possible adverse consequences for antitrust agencies seeking relevant information for an investigation since  this experience is particularly important in light of HSR's special time constraints and the agencies' single opportunity to seek documents prior to the merger. 
   The substitute amendment eliminates these three problematic procedural limitations on the second request investigation process contained in the original bill. Instead, the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine-Kohl substitute amendment directs the agencies to reform the merger review process to eliminate unnecessary delay, costly duplication and undue delay. In addition, the agencies are directed to designate senior officials within the agencies to review the second requests to determine whether the requests are burdensome or duplicative and whether the request has been substantially complied with by the merging companies. 
   These changes are consistent with reforms that the FTC and Antitrust Division already have underway. Indeed, the FTC on April 5, 2000, and the Antitrust Division the next day, announced their adoption of new procedures and other initiatives to improve the premerger ``second request'' investigation process to make the process more efficient for both businesses and the agencies. I commend both agencies for their efforts in this regard and look forward to working with them to ensure that implementation of their regulations proceeds smoothly. 
   The Hatch-Leahy-DeWine-Kohl substitute amendment also imposes a reporting requirement on the FTC to provide the Congress with information on the number of HSR notices filed and on the reviews conducted by the antitrust agencies. 
   The antitrust agencies did not support the fee structure in the Committee reported bill since, in their view, the level of fees authorized in the substitute amendment would not provide them with the ability to collect sufficient fees to meet their budget request for FY 2001. Although these agencies are funded by direct appropriations and not by their fees, the reality is that the appropriations to these agencies usually corresponds to the level of the fees collected. Nevertheless, the Committee reported bill authorized the collection of sufficient fees to be revenue neutral and at a level that would enable the agencies, according to the CBO, to collect fees at a level amounting to an increase of ten percent over the agencies' last year's budget. 
   The Hatch-Leahy-DeWine-Kohl substitute amendment eliminates reference to the revised fee structure. I intend to work with my colleagues and the antitrust agencies, as I have in the past, to ensure that they receive all the funding necessary to support their mission and carry out their important work through the appropriations process.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, during the last presidential debate, Governor Bush told the American people, as he has frequently during the campaign, that if he and Republicans are in control, there will be a more even-handed, cordial and respectful atmosphere in Washington and less partisan politics. I know that Governor Bush has tried to cast himself as a Washington outsider, so maybe he has not been paying attention to how the Republican majority here in Washington has been doing things these past few years. A resolution on the agenda for the final two meetings of the Judiciary Committee in this Congress might help bring Governor Bush up to speed. 
   That resolution proposed by the Republican leadership of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts sought to authorize issuance of a subpoena compelling Department of Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to testify before the Subcommittee about the investigation and prosecution of Wen Ho Lee and provide thirteen different categories of documents. Under the proposed resolution, if by November 8, 2000, Secretary Richardson did not agree to testify and provide the demanded documents, the subpoena would be authorized. This resolution was ultimately not brought to a vote due to the lack of the requisite quorum, sparing the Judiciary Committee from making an unnecessary and embarrassing demand for which the only enforcement mechanism is a contempt trial in the Senate. 
   It might appear from the targets of this subpoena resolution, namely, Secretary Richardson and the Department of Energy, that the Judiciary Committee and the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts are charged with oversight of the Department of Energy (DOE). In fact, the Republicans have proposed this resolution as part of the Subcommittee's oversight of the Justice Department. While the Department of Energy may have information helpful to an understanding of the Justice Department's handling of the Lee case, the manner in which the Republican majority has chosen to proceed both with regard to Secretary Richardson and other matters before the Subcommittee have been marked by an unprecedented political intervention in pending criminal matters and second-guessing of the handling of certain cases by federal agencies. 
   For example, the majority on the Senate Judiciary Committee has broken from tradition and called line assistants to testify before the Subcommittee, questioned federal judges about pending cases over which they are presiding, attempted to exact assurances that particular cases will be handled particular ways, and made public internal and confidential recommendations by senior prosecutors to the Attorney General on how to proceed in ongoing investigations. The Subcommittee's earlier intervention in the Waco matter prompted a rebuke from Special Counsel Jack Danforth, who wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee twice in September, 1999, requesting that the Committee ``conduct its inquiries in a way that does not undermine the work of the Special Counsel.'' I should note that the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts persisted in seeking documents from the Department of Justice on the Waco matter, and that 250 boxes of Waco documents produced by the Department of Justice sit largely unopened in Judiciary Committee offices.  
   Let me help bring Governor Bush up to speed with the most recent example of how the majority is conducting itself. Sponsors of this subpoena resolution made it sound as if a subpoena were necessary because Secretary Richardson had been dodging a discussion of the Lee case since March 2000. Indeed, a sponsor of the subpoena resolution stated at a Judiciary Committee meeting on October 5, 2000, that ``[t]he efforts to secure Secretary Richardson's attendance go back to March of this year when we requested his appearance and he declined, with comments about his unavailability on a specific date.'' 
   Yet, as some Republicans have even acknowledged, from December 1999 until just six weeks ago when Dr. Lee pled guilty, the Committee was honoring FBI Director Freeh's urgent request that the Committee suspend review of Dr. Lee's case during the pendency of the criminal prosecution so as not to compromise the case. 
   When former Senator Danforth testified to Congress about his independent investigation of the tragic raid on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, he commented that, ``We have totally overblown our willingness to just trash people.'' Senator Danforth said about those who make reckless claims of government misconduct and who grandstand on matters of public importance: ``The wrong information was presented to the American people and it caused a real shaking of confidence of people in their government ..... When people make dark charges--I mean really, really serious charges--the people who make the charges should bear some kind of burden of proof before we all buy into them.'' His words have not been sufficiently heeded by the majority in this Congress, as this unwarranted and scurrilous subpoena resolution directed at Secretary Richardson makes clear. 
   Governor Bush may also not be aware of the following: Despite Director Freeh's request that the Congress suspend the Lee hearings during pendency of the case, and the Judiciary Committee's honoring of that request, an interim report on the Lee matter was issued by a Republican Member in March 2000. He did so over the written objections of a Member of his own party, who expressed concern about the haste of issuing the report despite an incomplete investigation and the lack of a consensus in the Judiciary Committee about key matters. 
   The Committee's suspension of its inquiry into this matter was lifted only six weeks ago, September 13, 2000, when Dr. Lee pled guilty and was sentenced. The March 2000 hearing to which Secretary Richardson was invited, but for which he had a conflict, was not about the facts of Dr. Lee's case, but legislation on which the Judiciary Committee was then working. 
   It might help Governor Bush size up the source of partisan bickering in Washington if he were aware of how the Senate Judiciary Committee was rushing to issue a subpoena to a cabinet secretary, even though Members of his own party acknowledge that the complete story of the Lee matter will not and cannot come out for some time. I concur with Senator GRASSLEY's comments 
   on October 3, 2000, at a hearing conducted by the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts on the Lee matter: ``For now, Dr. Lee's side of the story is on hold. That is because his attorneys have asked that his side be told only after he is debriefed by the government. We also asked to interview Judge Parker about his views of the case but Judge Parker declined our invitations, so the public is not going to get the full picture, which may not come into view for some time yet.'' 
   Nonetheless, for Secretary Richardson, a high-ranking member of this Administration, the Judiciary Committee was asked to authorize a subpoena and get him before Congress immediately in an apparent effort to make it seem as though he is dodging congressional oversight, even though by Senator GRASSLEY's candid admission that Congress will not have the full picture of Dr. Lee's case ``for some time.'' 
   In fact, the investigation of Dr. Lee remains open with intense debriefings ongoing. The agencies involved are rightfully sensitive that the debriefings of Dr. Lee are not complete and concerned that public discussion of the case not jeopardize the debriefings or future steps in the case. 
   Republicans have not shown similar interest in oversight of other open criminal matters about which the American people might truly want all the facts immediately and certainly before Election Day. For example, no effort by the majority has been made to get to the bottom of ``Debategate,'' the mailing of Bush debate preparation materials to the Gore campaign. That incident might be a third-rate mail fraud, but it might also be serious campaign misconduct of the type we saw during the Watergate scandal. Some have speculated that it was a dirty trick by the Bush campaign to set up the Vice President. I have heard nothing from the Republicans about the matter. I have heard no outrage that Governor Bush and his campaign aides are not being put under oath or dragged before grand juries to get to the bottom of the scandal. In contrast to the majority's preference to investigate rather than legislate, their silence on the Debategate case is deafening. On that investigation, the Republicans are happy to allow the ongoing criminal investigation to take its course. But not here, where the important debriefings of Dr. Lee are sensitive and ongoing. 
   The fact is that in the six short weeks since Dr. Lee pled guilty, the Department of Energy has been extremely cooperative, just as the Department of Energy was cooperative with other committees' previous reviews of the Lee matter. 
   At the first hearing on the matter after Dr. Lee pled guilty, the Judiciary Committee's joint hearing with the Senate Committee on Intelligence on September 26th, Deputy Secretary T.J. Glauthier of the Department of Energy appeared to testify in place of Secretary Richardson because the Secretary was testifying before another committee. Secretary Richardson agreed to testify at that afternoon's closed session when he would be available, but no such afternoon session was conducted. At the second hearing on September 27th, DOE Security Chief Edward Curran appeared to testify. 
   At the third hearing on October 3rd, DOE computer specialist Ronald Wilkins appeared to testify. In addition, the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts heard from Los Alamos officials Dr. Stephen Younger and former officials Robert Vrooman and Notra Trulock. In sum, Department of Energy has provided witnesses before a total of 11 House and Senate committees and has provided testimony 37 times in hearings and briefings on the Lee case and related espionage and security matters in the past two years. 
   Moreover, the thirteen categories of documents called for in the subpoena resolution-- to the extent not already produced--were requested only a few days before the subpoena was sought. A chronology of the relevant events shows that the Department of Energy has made and is making every effort to produce documents. 
   On November 17, 1999, the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee approved a resolution to issue subpoenas to five cabinet secretaries, including Secretary Richardson, containing a general request for all documents related to Wen Ho Lee and three other matters. Because the Judiciary Committee a few short weeks later, in December 1999 honored Director Freeh's request that the Committee suspend inquiry of the Lee matter, no subpoena was ever issued and forwarded, and it is unclear whether that document request was ever communicated to the Department of Energy. 
   On September 13, 2000, Dr. Lee pled guilty and was sentenced. 
   On September 28, 2000, Senator SPECTER wrote to DOE requesting that five pages of a DOE Inspector General report be declassified, but making no other request for documents. My understanding is that the request was honored. 
   On September 29, 2000, Senator SPECTER wrote a letter directly to Secretary Richardson enclosing follow-up written questions to DOE's Security Chief Edward Curran, who testified before the subcommittee on September 27th. Neither the letter to Secretary Richardson nor the questions to Mr. Curran contained any request for documents. 
   On October 3, 2000, Senator SPECTER wrote to both Secretary Richardson and the Attorney General requesting  documents relating to Dr. Lee's claim of racial profiling that the prosecution would have been required to submit to Judge Parker for in camera review had Dr. Lee not pled guilty. DOE has produced materials in response to that request. 
   On October 5, 2000, Secretary Richardson met with Senator SPECTER and discussed the case. My understanding is that Senator SPECTER's staff thereafter orally requested five documents or files from DOE Chief Larry Sanchez. 
   On October 12, 2000, Senator SPECTER asked the Judiciary Committee to approve a 
   resolution authorizing a subpoena for Secretary Richardson's testimony. That resolution contained no request for documents. 
   Finally, on the evening of October 16, 2000, Senator SPECTER wrote a letter to Secretary Richardson listing the thirteen categories of documents sought by the subpoena resolution. 
   Despite that record of the DOE's good faith, on October 19, 2000, less than two weeks since Senator SPECTER's office made an oral request of Mr. Sanchez for five documents or files and just three days since Senator SPECTER submitted his list of thirteen categories of documents, the Republicans sought a resolution seeking issuance of a subpoena. The Department of Energy has made three deliveries of materials over the past two weeks, and I have no doubt that the Department of Energy will continue to comply with these document requests and act in good faith. Moreover, I understand that Secretary Richardson has met recently with Senator SPECTER and with Chairman HATCH to discuss the facts of the case. Far from dodging congressional oversight, the Secretary has made himself available for such meetings in the midst of recent crises over the price of oil. 
   The sponsors of the subpoena resolution advanced three reasons to justify its issuance. They claimed that the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts needs to hear immediately from Secretary Richardson so that he may (1) respond to allegations that the Department of Energy was to blame for the delay between April 1999, when Dr. Lee's residence was searched and evidence of his downloading was seized, and December 1999, when he was indicted; (2) explain why his signature was purportedly on the order to put Dr. Lee in leg irons; and (3) respond to allegations made by DOE's former intelligence chief Notra Trulock at an earlier Congressional hearing that he had been told by New York Times reporter James Risen that Secretary Richardson had leaked Dr. Lee's name. Based on the record, as I understand it, these three claims are unsupportable. First, between April and December 1999, numerous agencies participated in sorting out a hugely complex case, analyzing a million computer files, interviewing a thousand people, and assessing the sensitive question of how to prosecute Dr. Lee in a public courtroom without publicly disclosing the nuclear secrets that he downloaded. 
   As to the second claim, Secretary Richardson wrote to the Attorney General certifying, as required by a federal regulation, that national security would be threatened if Dr. Lee communicated classified information to a confederate, and requesting that she direct prison authorities to implement whatever measures might be appropriate to prevent such communication while Dr. Lee was in custody. Secretary Richardson did not order leg irons. To the contrary, Secretary Richardson noted his understanding that ``the conditions of [Dr. Lee's] confinement are in no respect more restrictive than those of others in the segregation unit of the detention facility,'' and he emphasized his concern that Dr. Lee's civil rights be scrupulously honored. 
   As to the third claim, my understanding is that, immediately after the hearing at which Mr. Trulock testified, Mr. Risen walked up to Mr. Trulock and said that he had never told Mr. Trulock any such thing about Secretary Richardson. In addition, Secretary Richardson has already categorically denied the allegation. 
   These reasons are hardly a basis for taking the extraordinary step of authorizing the issuance of a subpoena for a member of the President's cabinet. 
   At the Judiciary Committee's meeting on October 19, 2000, it was suggested that Chairman HATCH might have the authority to issue a subpoena for Secretary Richardson pursuant to a resolution which the Republicans on the Committee approved in November 1999. The Democrats opposed that resolution in part because a subpoena might interfere with the ongoing investigation of Dr. Lee. Over the Democrats' objection, that partisan resolution was rushed through the Judiciary Committee by the majority precipitously and was never executed. Indeed, just a few weeks later, Director Freeh made his urgent request that the Committee suspend its inquiry into the Lee matter during the pendency of the criminal case. 
   As it related to the Department of Energy, the partisan resolution authorized issuance of a subpoena to Secretary Richardson for documents, not his personal appearance. As for the documents, the resolution authorized issuance of a subpoena for all documents related to DOE's investigation of Dr. Lee and identified just two particular documents that were sought. That resolution did not identify the thirteen categories of documents for which authorization was sought in the last meetings of the Judiciary Committee. 
   Since the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts began its oversight of the Justice Department, no fewer than nine subpoenas have been authorized for cabinet secretaries, not including a subpoena for Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in connection with Elian Gonzalez which was authorized and later rescinded. 
   If the American people want to test the credibility of Governor Bush's claim about the kinder and gentler America that he claims only a Republican-led government can bring to our nation, they should examine the record of the oversight efforts by Republican-led Judiciary Committee and its Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an outstanding history education program in Vermont and throughout the United States. National History Day is a year-long nonprofit program through which students in grades 6-12 research and create historical projects related to a broad theme, culminating in an annual contest. This year's National History Day theme, Frontiers in History: People, Places, Ideas, encompasses endless possibilities for exploration. Each year more than 500,000 students participate in this nationwide event that encourages students to delve into various facets of world, national, regional, or local history and to produce original research projects. 
   By encouraging young Vermonters to take advantage of the wealth of primary historical resources available to them, students are able to gain a richer understanding of historical issues, ideas, people and events. Students in this program learn how to analyze a variety of primary sources such as photographs, letters, posters, maps, artifacts, sound recordings and motion pictures. This significant academic exercise encourages intellectual growth while helping students to develop critical thinking and problem solving skills that will help them manage and use information. 
   In June I had the pleasure of meeting with the 25 winners of this year's Vermont History Day contest here in Washington as they participated in the national contest held at the University of Maryland. These impressive students represent the great benefit of fostering and encouraging academic curiosity in our youth. Every student in Vermont should have the opportunity to participate in this enriching experience. I commend the coordinator of our state program, the Vermont Historical Society, for its commitment to expanding History Day in Vermont. The National History Day program is a truly great asset to Vermont educators and students in their quest for educational excellence.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for the Rural Rental Housing Act of 2000. This bill takes a much needed step toward reestablishing the federal government's commitment to quality affordable housing in rural areas and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation. 
   The need for a new federal matching grant program to encourage the production, rehabilitation and acquisition of rural rental housing has never been more evident than it is today. Families across the country in small towns, where property is often high and resources scarce, are finding themselves with fewer and fewer options for a safe and affordable place to live. In my home state of Vermont, like many other states across the country, we are in the middle of an affordable housing crisis. Housing costs are soaring and rental vacancy rates are alarmingly low. For those fortunate enough to find an apartment it is increasingly difficult to afford the rent that the market demands. Recent studies suggest that while the need for rental units continues to grow in Vermont, estimated production levels are drastically inadequate to meet demand. 
   Despite this trend, the federal government has consistently scaled back their commitment to production and rehabilitation of rental housing. Rural rental production has dropped nearly 88% since 1990, and the funding for subsidized housing has fallen by 73% since 1994. This decline has made it difficult to produce new housing and maintain the current obligations and existing stock. In Vermont roughly 4,091 rental units were produced with federal assistance between 1976 and 1985, but during the next ten years this number fell to under two thousand--nearly half of what was produced the decade before, despite the rising need. 
   Nationally it is estimated that 2.6 million households live in substandard housing with severe structural damage or without indoor plumbing, heat, or electricity. Unfortunately, rural areas often have less appeal for investment from financial institutions and are often isolated from social services that are more accessible in urban areas to help address these problems. 
   The Rural Rental Housing Act will provide $250 million dollars for a matching federal grant program to be administered by the United States Department of Agriculture to address this situation. These funds will complement existing programs run by the Rural Housing Service at USDA and will be used in a variety of ways to increase the supply, the affordability, and the quality of housing for the most needy residents, the lowest income families and the elderly. Most importantly the program is designed to be administered at the state and local level and to encourage public-private partnerships to best address the unique needs of each state. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation and am committed to work with Senator EDWARDS to reintroduce this bill in the 107th Congress.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have spoken several times this year about the so-called McDade law, which was slipped into the omnibus appropriations bill at the end of the last Congress, without the benefit of any hearings or debate in the Senate. I have described the devastating effects that this ill-considered law is having on Federal law enforcement efforts across the country. Recent articles in the Washington Post, the Washington Times and U.S. News & World Report also describe how the McDade law has impeded Federal criminal investigations. 
   For over a year, I have been proposing legislation to address the problems caused by the McDade law. My corrective legislation would preserve the traditional role of the State courts in regulating the conduct of attorneys licensed to practice before them, while ensuring that Federal prosecutors and law enforcement agents will be able to use traditional Federal investigative techniques. Although the bill does not go as far as the Justice Department would like--it does not establish a Federal code of ethics for government attorneys, nor does it authorize the Justice Department to write its own ethics rules--nevertheless, the Justice Department has supported the bill as a reasonable, measured alternative to the McDade law. 
   Congress's failure to act on this or any other corrective legislation this year means more confusion and uncertainty, more stalled investigations, and less effective enforcement of the Federal criminal laws. I regret that we  have not made more progress, and hope that we can work together in the next Congress, on a bipartisan and bicameral basis, to resolve the situation.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor several times this year to focus attention on the national crisis in the administration of the death penalty. I rise today, in what I hope are the closing days of the 106th Congress, to report on how far we have come on this issue in Congress and across the country, and to discuss the important work that is yet to be done. 
   In recent years, many grave flaws in the capital punishment system nationwide have come to light. Time and again, across the nation, we have heard about racial disparities, incompetent counsel who make a mockery of our adversarial process, testimony and scientific evidence that is hidden from the court, and the ultimate injustice, the conviction and sentencing to death of innocent people. 
   In the last quarter century, some 88 people have been released from death row, not on technicalities, but because they were innocent. Those people were the ``lucky'' ones; we simply do not know how many innocent people remain on death row, and how many have been executed. 
   Earlier this year, after it came to light that his State had sent more innocent people to death row than it had executed guilty people, Governor Ryan announced a moratorium on executions in Illinois and launched a systematic inquiry into the crisis and to consider possible reforms. 
   At around the same time, along with colleagues from both sides of the aisle, from the Senate and from the House, I introduced the Innocence Protection Act as a first step to stimulate a national debate and inquiry and begin work on national reforms on what is a nationwide problem. 
   Almost a year later, our informal national public inquiry has yielded a wealth of evidence. The American people have reached some compelling findings. And our reform effort has gained the endorsement, and--more important--the wisdom and insight, of Republicans and Democrats, of judges, law enforcers and defense attorneys, and of scholars and ordinary people who have experienced the system first hand. 
   The evidence has shown that the system is broken, and the American people are demanding that it be fixed or scrapped. We have meaningful, carefully considered reforms ready to be put into place. It is now time for Congress to act. 
   Let me first review just a few highlights of the evidence that has mounted since we first introduced the bill. 
   On June 12, Professor James Liebman of the Columbia Law School released the most comprehensive statistical study ever undertaken of modern American capital appeals. This rigorous study, which was nine years in the making, revealed a death penalty system fraught with error reaching crisis proportions. It revealed a system that routinely makes grave errors, and then hopes haphazardly and belatedly to correct them years later by a mixture of state court review, federal court review and a large dose of luck. 
   During the 23-year study period, courts across the country threw out nearly seven out of every ten capital sentences because of serious errors that undermined the reliability of the outcome. The single most common error, the study showed, was egregiously incompetent defense lawyering.  
   Before the Columbia study came out, there was speculation that the problems in the administration of the death penalty were confined to a few atypical States with lax procedures. That is clearly not the case. The study documented high error rates across the country, in nearly every death penalty State. It left no room for doubt: This is not a local problem, this is a national problem, and it requires a national response. 
   Shortly after the Columbia study issued, the Senate and House Judiciary Committees held hearings to consider some of the issues raised by the Innocence Protection Act. I had hoped that these hearings would be the first in a series of hearings that would help focus the Congress' attention on steps we can take to help restore public confidence in our death penalty system. 
   The Committees heard from judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys about when and how post-conviction DNA testing should be required by law, and about the overwhelming importance of providing the accused with qualified and adequately funded defense counsel. 
   We also heard from two men who between them spent over 20 years in prison for crimes they did not commit before being cleared by DNA evidence and freed. One of these men, Dennis Fritz, was represented at trial by a civil liability lawyer who had never handled any type of criminal case, much less a capital murder case. When Mr. Fritz finally got access to the crime scene evidence for DNA testing, the results not only cleared him, they also cleared his codefendant, who had come within five days of being executed. The tests also established the identity of the real killer. 
   Now, hardly a month goes by that we do not hear about more wrongfully convicted people who owe their freedom to DNA testing. 
   Most recently, on October 2, 2000, the Governor of Virginia finally pardoned Earl Washington, after new DNA tests confirmed what earlier DNA tests had shown: He was the wrong guy. Earl Washington's case only goes to show that we cannot sit back and assume that prosecutors and courts will do the right thing when it comes to DNA. It took 
   Earl Washington years to convince prosecutors to do the very simple tests that would prove his innocence, and more time still to win a pardon. And he is still in prison today. 
   Several other recent reports have provided additional evidence of a system in crisis. The Justice Department released a report in September concerning the administration of the Federal death penalty. The report revealed dramatic racial and geographic disparities in the Federal death penalty system. Of the 682 cases submitted to the Justice Department in the last five years for approval to seek the death penalty, 80 percent involved defendants who were black, Hispanic, or another racial minority, and five jurisdictions accounted for about 40 percent of the submissions. 
   Also in September, the Charlotte Observer published a study of capital cases in the Carolinas, which found that those who are on trial for their lives are often represented by the legal profession's worst attorneys. The high stress and low pay of capital trials limits the pool of lawyers willing to take them on. Some lawyers abuse drugs and alcohol, some fail to investigate evidence that could clear their client. Judges in the Carolinas have overturned at least 15 death verdicts because of serious errors made by defense lawyers, and another 16 death row inmates were represented at trial by lawyers who were later disbarred or disciplined for unethical conduct. 
   Much has been written about the appalling state of affairs in the State of Texas. The Dallas Morning News reported on September 10 that more than 100 prisoners awaiting execution in Texas as of May 1--about one in four convicts on Texas's death row--has been defended by court-appointed lawyers who have been reprimanded, placed on probation, suspended, or banned from practicing law by the State Bar of Texas. 
   The infractions that triggered the extraordinary step of bar discipline included failing to appear in court, falsifying documents, failing to present key witnesses, and allowing clients to lie. In about half of these instances, the misconduct occurred before the attorney was appointed to handle the capital case. 
   Just this week, a comprehensive new report by the Texas Defender Service described that State's death penalty system as thoroughly flawed and in dire need of change because of problems like racial bias, prosecutorial misconduct and incompetent defense counsel. The report, which reviews hundreds of cases and appeals, confirmed that indigent defendants in Texas are routinely represented in trials and during appeals by underpaid court-appointed lawyers who are inexperienced, inept, or uninterested. 
   These lawyers spend little time on the cases and present inadequate arguments and flawed defenses. In several notorious cases, defense lawyers slept in court, drank heavily, or used illegal drugs during a death penalty case. 
   Time and again, we hear defenders of the status quo say that as long as an accused person has access to the courts, the system is working properly. Statements of this sort reflect either ignorance or worse. The question we must ask is whether the promise of access to the courts is real, or just a cruel joke. Does access mean meaningful access, with qualified defense counsel who know what they are doing and have the resources to do the job properly, or does it mean merely token access. The evidence shows that it is too often the latter. 
   The evidence is overwhelming that the capital punishment system is broken--not just in Illinois, where the high error rate has prompted a moratorium on executions--not just in Texas, with its sleeping lawyers and racial biases--but across the Nation. 
   The people have heard this evidence, and they know this. A recent poll conducted by Peter D. Hart Research, a Democratic research firm, and American Viewpoint, a Republican research firm, shows that the public discourse on the death penalty has matured from a debate over whether the death penalty system is broken into a constructive dialogue on how broken it is, and about how much reform we need to fix it--if indeed it can be fixed at all. 
   New developments in DNA technology have helped expose some of the flaws in the system, and they have been invaluable in freeing innocent Americans like Dennis Fritz. But the public knows that the injustices revealed by DNA testing are just the tip of the iceberg. The central theme running through the vast majority of the tragedies we have seen has been incompetent, under-funded trial counsel making a mockery of our adversarial system. 
   Any reform that does not deal with the counsel issue is inadequate. The American people understand this. When it comes to matters of life and death, most Americans--55 percent of those surveyed--believe that it is not enough to ensure access to DNA testing without also ensuring access to competent and experienced defense counsel. 
   There is one more key lesson to be learned from listening to the American people. We are a nation founded on tolerance, but not tolerance of incompetence and failure. When there's a broken product out there endangering innocent lives, Americans rightly demand that it be fixed or recalled. Some irresponsible corporations are currently learning what comes of those who continue to put more and more broken, dangerous products into circulation. 
   As conservatives like George Will have pointed out, there is a parallel American tradition that we here in Washington know well of demanding that incompetent officials and broken government programs shape up or face the scrap heap. 
   Now that they have heard the evidence, Americans are ready to apply that same common sense to the government program known as the death penalty. Americans may be divided on whether the capital punishment system needs to be recalled, but there is a clear and growing consensus that the system needs to be reformed. An overwhelming majority--some 80 percent of those surveyed--want to see concrete measures to ensure competent and adequately funded counsel. 
   An even larger majority--nearly 90 percent of those surveyed--want to ensure that death row inmates can obtain DNA testing. 
   When a government program has a record of incompetence, failure, and  harming innocent lives, ordinary Americans say fix it or scrap it; do not under any circumstances expand it. In the past few years, as the defects of our capital punishment system have become more and more obvious, the States have largely ignored the problem, while they have expanded the program, executing more and more people. Neither history, nor the American people, will be kind to a Congress that stands by and does nothing while this trend continues. 
   The evidence has shown that the death penalty is broken; the American people know the death penalty is broken; and they are calling upon us, their elected representatives, to fix it or scrap it. 
   The bipartisan Innocence Protection Act is a real, practical response to that demand. Of critical importance, it meaningfully addresses not just the tip of the iceberg--DNA testing--but also the bulk of the problem--ineffective and under-funded defense counsel. 
   Our bill does not go as far as some Americans would like. It does not scrap the death penalty; it does not place a moratorium on executions; and it does not tackle all the injustices inflicted upon racial minorities and the mentally retarded by the present capital punishment system. Rather, it embodies a consensus approach, informed by the wisdom of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and House, the Department of Justice and experts and ordinary Americans on all sides of our criminal justice system. 
   Because of this, it has been gaining ground. We now have 14 cosponsors in the Senate, and about 80 in the House. We have Democratic and Republican cosponsors, supporters of the death penalty and opponents. President Clinton, Vice-President GORE, and Attorney General Reno have all expressed support for the bill. 
   I had hoped that my colleagues would heed the American people's call for practical, bipartisan reform and expedite passage of this important legislation. Unfortunately, every opportunity for progress has been squandered. Even with respect to post-conviction DNA testing, where there is strong bipartisan consensus that federal legislation is appropriate and necessary, we could not even manage to report a bill out of committee. 
   While our lack of progress on Federal legislation is regrettable, there have been some positive developments that may facilitate broader access to post-conviction DNA testing. On September 29, a federal district judge in Virginia held that State prisoners may file federal civil rights suits seeking DNA testing, reasoning that the denial of possibly exculpatory evidence states a claim of denial of due process. If this decision is upheld, it could go a long way toward persuading State prosecutors and courts to stop stonewalling on requests for postconviction DNA testing. 
   I was also greatly heartened this week to read that the Virginia Supreme Court has moved to eliminate that State's shortest-in-the-nation deadline for death row inmates to introduce new evidence of their innocence. Currently, inmates in Virginia have only 21 days after their sentencing to ask for a new trial based on new information. The proposed rule change would re-open Virginia's courts to inmates like Earl Washington, who had to wait six years for a Governor to order additional DNA tests and grant a pardon. 
   Outside of Virginia, some State legislatures have begun considering the need for criminal justice reforms. Since the initial introduction of the Innocence Protection Act early this year, Arizona, California, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Washington have passed laws providing prisoners greater access to post-conviction DNA testing, and other States are considering similar measures. I am especially pleased that California's legislators saw fit to model their law in part on the Innocence Protection Act. 
   By contrast, Tennessee's statute allows post-conviction DNA testing only to prisoners under sentence of death, leaving the vast majority of prisoners without access to what could be the only means of demonstrating their innocence. And neither of these laws addresses the larger and more urgent problem of ensuring that capital defendants receive competent legal representation. There is still much to do. 
   There can no longer be any doubt that our nation's capital punishment system is in crisis. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, those who support the death penalty, and those who oppose it, let us work together to find solutions.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to call on the Senate to support H.R. 4068, which will extend the religious worker visa for an additional three years. I am a cosponsor and strong supporter of Senate legislation that would make permanent the provisions of our immigration law that provide for special immigrant visas for religious workers sponsored by religious organizations in the United States. These visas allow religious denominations or organizations in the United States to bring in foreign nationals to perform religious work here. This modest program--which provides for up to 5,000 religious immigrant visas a year--was created in the Immigration Act of 1990, and has been extended ever since. Although I believe the program should be made permanent, I am willing to support a three-year extension given the lateness of the session and the fact that the program expired upon last week's end of the fiscal year. 
   The importance of this program to America's religious community has been demonstrated by the fact that leaders from a variety of faiths have come to Congress both this year and in past years to testify on its behalf. It is also important to note, however, that these religious workers contribute significantly not just to their religious communities, but to the community as a whole. They work in hospitals, nursing homes, and homeless shelters. They help immigrants and refugees adjust to the United States. In other words, they perform vital tasks that too often go undone. 
   I have worked on this issue consistently over the years. Most recently, I cosponsored a bill in 1997 that would have made this program permanent. We were forced in that year as well to settle for a 3-year extension of the program. It is my hope and expectation that this will be the last short-term extension of this program, and that the substantial benefit that our country has derived from this program will lead us to make the program permanent 3 years from now.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will vote for the Agriculture appropriations conference report. I want to support our farmers. They deserve our support. But I will do so with a great deal of reluctance because of what the House of Representatives did. They inserted a provision which goes directly counter to the views that were expressed in rollcall votes of a bipartisan majority of both the House and the Senate. 
   I probably shouldn't be that surprised that the House of Representatives, under the Republican leadership, has, once again, abused the legislative process. It has occurred too often. We had very strong votes in both the House and the Senate to lift sanctions on the sale of food and medicine to Cuba. After we had those votes, the House Republican leadership included a provision which prohibits any kind of public financing. What they have said is: Sure, you can have these sales. But we are going to make sure there is no way to pay for them. 
   We go back home and say how generous we are and how we are helping our farmers, at the same time chuckling all the way out, saying it will never happen. 
   That is bad for America's farmers. It is very bad for the Cuban people. It is certainly bad foreign policy. 
   In fact, they even went so far as to codify the restrictions on travel to Cuba. This strikes at the fundamental right of every American to travel freely. Some of the same people who jingoistically say we are Americans; we can go wherever we want, will say, but not to Cuba. 
   Senator DODD and I introduced legislation to lift this ban. He spoke eloquently about this. It is ironic, actually outrageous, that Americans can travel to North Korea or Syria or Vietnam but not to Cuba. What a hypocritical, self-defeating, and anachronistic policy. What a policy so beneath a great, good nation as ours, a nation of a quarter billion people, the most powerful, wealthiest nation on Earth. How small-minded. How petty. How beneath this great Nation. 
   It is a terrible decision, a blatantly partisan decision, a decision driven by politics, and one of the many reasons why the elections on November 7 are so important. It is time we inject intelligence and bipartisanship into our foreign policy. Congress has had its chance, but it has fallen short in too many ways to count. The decision on Cuba is another example of the failure of the 106th Congress to do what is right for America, what is right for America's farmers, what is right for the majority of the American people. 
   As one who opposes the dictatorial policies of Fidel Castro, I also oppose anybody telling me as an American, or my family, or the people of my State, that we cannot travel anywhere in the world where we might be accepted. It is so beneath a great and good nation. I hope this is something we will correct next year. The majority of Senators and House Members, Republicans and Democrats, have already voted. A small band of the Republican leadership should not be able to thwart that. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Presidential Threat Protection Act, H.R. 3048, is a high priority for the Secret Service and the Service's respected Director, Brian Stafford, and I am pleased that this legislation is passing the Senate today, along with legislation that Senators THURMOND, HATCH and I have crafted to assist the U.S. Marshals Service in apprehending fugitives. 
   The Presidential Threat Protection Act, H.R. 3048, would expand or clarify the Secret Service's authority in four ways. First, the bill would amend current law to make clear it is a federal crime, which the Secret Service is authorized to investigate, to threaten any current or former President or their immediate family, even if the person is not currently receiving Secret Service protection and including those people who have declined continued protection, such as former Presidents, or have not yet received protection, such as major Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates and their families. 
   Second, the bill would incorporate in statute certain authority, which is currently embodied in a classified Executive Order, PDD 62, clarifying that the Secret Service is authorized to coordinate, design, and implement security operations for events deemed of national importance by the President ``or the President's designee.'' 
   Third, the bill would establish a ``National Threat Assessment Center' within the Secret Service to provide training to State, local and other Federal law enforcement agencies on threat assessments and public safety responsibilities. 
   Finally, the bill authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue administrative subpoenas for investigations of ``imminent'' threats made against an individual whom the service is authorized to protect. The Secret Service has requested that the Congress grant this administrative subpoena authority to expedite investigation procedures particularly in situations where an individual has made threats against the President and is en route to exercise those threats. 
   ``Administrative subpoena'' is the term generally used to refer to a demand for documents or testimony by an investigative entity or regulatory agency that is empowered to issue the subpoena independently and without the approval of any grand jury, court or other judicial entity. I am generally skeptical of administrative subpoena power. Administrative subpoenas avoid the strict grant jury secrecy rules and the documents provided in response to such subpoenas are, therefore, subject to broader dissemination. Moreover, since investigative agents issue such subpoenas directly, without review by a judicial officer or even a prosecutor, fewer ``checks'' are in place to ensure the subpoena is issued with good cause and not merely as a fishing expedition. 
   H.R. 3048 addresses these general concerns with the following procedural safeguards, some of which would apply not only to the new administrative subpoena authority of the Secret Service but also to current administrative subpoena authority granted to the FBI to issue administrative subpoenas in cases involving child abuse, child sexual exploitation, and Federal health care offenses. 
   The new administrative subpoena authority in threat cases may only be exercised by the Secretary of the Treasury upon determination of the Director of the Secret Service that the threat is imminent, and the Secret Service must notify the Attorney General of the issuance of each subpoena. I should note that this requirement will help ensure that administrative subpoenas will be used in only the most significant investigations since obtaining the authorization for such a subpoena from senior Treasury and Secret Service personnel may take longer than simply going to the local U.S. Attorney's office to get a grand jury subpoena. 
   The bill would limit the scope of both current and new administrative subpoena authority of the FBI for obtaining records in child sex abuse and exploitation cases from Internet Service Providers to the name, address, local and long distance telephone billing records, telephone number or services used by a subscriber. 
   The bill would also expressly allow a person whose records are demanded pursuant to an administrative subpoena to contest the administrative subpoena by petitioning a federal judge to modify or set aside the subpoena. 
   The bill would authorize a court to order non-disclosure of the administrative subpoena for up to 90 days (and up to a 90 day extension) upon a showing that disclosure would adversely affect the investigation in an enumerated way. 
   Upon written demand, the agency must return the subpoenaed records or things if no case or proceedings arise from the production of records ``within a reasonable time.'' 
   The administrative subpoena may not require production in less than 24 hours after service so agencies may have to wait for at least a day before demanding production. 
   The Senate amendment to H.R. 3048 would modify the House-passed version, which provides that violation of the administrative subpoena is punishable by fine or up to five years' imprisonment. This penalty provision in the House version of the bill is both unnecessary and excessive since current law already provides that failure to comply with the subpoena may be punished as a contempt of court--which is  either civil or criminal. See 18 U.S.C. &#167;3486(c). Under current law, the general term of imprisonment for some forms of criminal contempt is up to six months. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. &#167;402. The Senate amendment would strike that provision in the House bill. 
   Secret Service protective function Privilege. While passage of this legislation will assist the Secret Service in fulfilling its critical mission, this Congress is unfortunately coming to a close without addressing another significant challenge to the Secret Service's ability to fulfill its vital mission of protecting the life and safety of the President and other important persons. I refer to the misguided and unfortunately successful litigation of Special Counsel Kenneth Starr to compel Secret Service agents to answer questions about what they may have observed or overheard while protecting the life of the President. 
   As a result of Mr. Starr's zealous efforts, the courts refused to recognize a protective function privilege and required that at least seven Secret Service officers appear before a federal grand jury to respond to questions regarding President Clinton, and others. In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 1998 W.L. 272884 (May 22, 1998 D.C.), affirmed 1998 WL 370584 (July 7, 1998 D.C. Cir) (per curiam). These recent court decisions, which refused to recognize a protective function privilege, could have a devastating impact upon the Secret Service's ability to provide effective protection. The Special Counsel and the courts ignored the voices of experience--former Presidents, Secret Service Directors, and others--who warned of the potentially deadly consequences. The courts disregarded the lessons of history. We cannot afford to be so cavalier; the stakes are just too high. 
   In order to address this problem, I introduced the Secret Service Protective Privilege Act, S. 1360, on July 13, 1999, to establish a Secret Service protective function privilege so Secret Service agents will not be put in the position of revealing private information about protected officials as Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr compelled the Secret Service to do with respect to President Clinton. Unfortunately, the Senate Judiciary Committee took no action on this legislation in this Congress. 
   Few national interests are more compelling than protecting the life of the President of the United States. The Supreme Court has said that the nation has ``an overwhelming interest in protecting the safety of its Chief Executive and in allowing him to perform his duties without interference from threats of physical violence.'' Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705, 707 (1969). What is at stake is not merely the safety of one person: it is the ability of the Executive Branch to function in an effective and orderly fashion, and the capacity of the United States to respond to threats and crises. Think of the shock waves that rocked the world in November 1963 when President Kennedy was assassinated. The assassination of a President has international repercussions and threatens the security and future of the entire nation. 
   The threat to our national security and to our democracy extends beyond the life of the President to those in direct line of the Office of the President--the Vice President, the President-elect, and the Vice President elect. By Act of Congress, these officials are required to accept the protection of the Secret Service--they may not turn it down. This statutory mandate reflects the critical importance that Congress has attached to the physical safety of these officials. 
   Congress has also charged the Secret Service with responsibility for protecting visiting heads of 
   foreign states and foreign governments. The assassination of a foreign head of state on American soil could be catastrophic from a foreign relations standpoint and could seriously threaten national security. 
   The bill I introduced, S. 1360, would enhance the Secret Service's ability to protect these officials, and the nation, from the risk of assassination. It would do this by facilitating the relationship of trust between these officials and their Secret Service protectors that is essential to the Secret Service's protective strategy. Agents and officers surround the protectee with an all-encompassing zone of protection on a 24-hour-a-day basis. In the face of danger, they will shield the protectee's body with their own bodies and move him to a secure location. 
   That is how the Secret Service averted a national tragedy on March 30, 1981, when John Hinckley attempted to assassinate President Reagan. Within seconds of the first shot being fired, Secret Service personnel had shielded the President's body and maneuvered him into the waiting limousine. One agent in particular, Agent Tim McCarthy, positioned his body to intercept a bullet intended for the President. If Agent McCarthy had been even a few feet farther from the President, history might have gone very differently. 
   For the Secret Service to maintain this sort of close, unremitting proximity to the President and other protectees, it must have their complete, unhesitating trust and confidence. Secret Service personnel must be able to remain at the President's side even during confidential and sensitive conversations, when they may overhear military secrets, diplomatic exchanges, and family and private matters. If our Presidents do not have complete trust in the Secret Service personnel who protect them, they could try to push away the Secret Service's ``protective envelope'' or undermine it to the point where it could no longer be fully effective. 
   This is more than a theoretical possibility. Consider what former President Bush wrote in April, 1998, after hearing of the independent counsel's efforts to compel Secret Service testimony:  
   The bottom line is I hope that [Secret Service] agents will be exempted from testifying before the Grand Jury. What's at stake here is the protection of the life of the President and his family and the confidence and trust that a President must have in the [Secret Service]. If a President feels that Secret Service agents can be called to testify about what they might have seen or heard then it is likely that the President will be uncomfortable having the agents nearby. I allowed the agents to have proximity first because they had my full confidence and secondly because I knew them to be totally discreet and honorable....... I can assure you that had I felt they would be compelled to testify as to what they had seen or heard, no matter what the subject, I would not have felt comfortable having them close in....... I feel very strongly that the [Secret Service] agents should not be made to appear in court to discuss that which they might or might not have seen or heard. What's at stake here is the confidence of the President in the discretion of the [Secret Service]. If that confidence evaporates the agents, denied proximity, cannot properly protect the President.  
   As President Bush's letter makes plain, requiring Secret Service agents to betray the confidence of the people whose lives they protect could seriously jeopardize the ability of the Service to perform its crucial national security function. 
   The possibility that Secret Service personnel might be compelled to testify about their protectees could have a particularly devastating affect on the Service's ability to protect foreign dignitaries. The mere fact that this issue has surfaced is likely to make foreign governments less willing to accommodate Secret Service both with respect to the protection of the President and Vice President on foreign trips, and the protection of foreign heads of state traveling in the United States. 
   The security of our chief executive officers and visiting foreign heads of state should be a matter that transcends all partisan politics and I regret that this legislation does not do more to help the Secret Service by providing a protective function privilege. 
   The Fugitive Apprehension Act. The Senate amendment to H.R. 3048 incorporates into the bill the substance of the Thurmond-Biden-Leahy substitute amendment to S. 2516, the Fugitive Apprehension Act, which passed the Senate unanimously on July 26, 2000. That substitute amendment reconciled the significant differences between S. 2516, as introduced, and S. 2761, ``The Capturing Criminals Act,'' which I introduced with Senator KOHL on June 21, 2000. The Senate amendment to H.R. 3048 makes certain changes to S. 2516 to ensure that the authority granted is consistent with privacy and other appropriate safeguards. 
   As a former prosecutor, I am well aware that fugitives from justice are an important problem and that their capture is an essential function of law enforcement. According to the FBI, nearly 550,000 people are currently fugitives from justice on federal, state, and local felony charges combined. This means that there are almost as many  fugitive felons as there are citizens residing in my home state of Vermont. 
   The fact that we have more than one half million fugitives from justice, a significant portion of whom are convicted felons in violation of probation or parole, who have been able to flaunt court order and avoid arrest, breeds disrespect for our laws and poses undeniable risks to the safety of our citizens. 
   Our Federal law enforcement agencies should be commended for the job they have been doing to date on capturing federal fugitives and helping the states and local communities bring their fugitives to justice. The U.S. Marshals Service, our oldest law enforcement agency, has arrested over 120,000 federal, state and local fugitives in the past four years, including more federal fugitives than all the other federal agencies combined. In prior years, the Marshals Service spearheaded special fugitive apprehension task forces, called FIST Operations, that targeted fugitives in particular areas and was singularly successful in arresting over 34,000 fugitive felons. 
   Similarly, the FBI has established twenty-four Safe Streets Task Forces exclusively focused on apprehending fugitives in cities around the country. Over the period of 1995 to 1999, the FBI's efforts have resulted in the arrest of a total of 65,359 state fugitives. 
   Nevertheless, the number of outstanding fugitives is too large. The Senate amendment to H.R. 3028 will help make a difference by providing new but limited administrative subpoena authority to the Department of Justice to obtain documentary evidence helpful in tracking down fugitives and by authorizing the Attorney General to establish fugitive task forces. 
   Unlike initial criminal inquiries, fugitive investigations present unique difficulties. Law enforcement may not use grand jury subpoenas since, by the time a person is a fugitive, the grand jury phase of an investigation is usually over. Use of grand jury subpoenas to obtain phone or bank records to track down a fugitive would be an abuse of the grand jury. Trial subpoenas may also not be used, either because the fugitive is already convicted or no trial may take place without the fugitive. 
   This inability to use trial and grand jury subpoenas for fugitive investigations creates a gap in law enforcement procedures. Law enforcement partially fills this gap by using the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167;1651(a), which authorizes federal courts to ``issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.'' The procedures, however, for obtaining orders under the Act, and the scope and non-disclosure terms of such orders, vary between jurisdictions. Authorizing administrative subpoena power will help bridge the gap in fugitive investigations by providing a uniform mechanism for federal law enforcement agencies to obtain records useful for tracking a fugitive's whereabouts. 
   The Thurmond-Biden-Leahy substitute amendment, which previously passed the Senate, incorporated a number of provisions from the Leahy-Kohl ``Capturing Criminals Act'' and made significant and positive modifications to the original version of S. 2516. These improvements are largely incorporated into the current Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendments to H.R. 3048, which the Senate considers today. First, as introduced, S. 2516 would have limited use of an administrative subpoena to those fugitives who have been ``indicted,'' and failed to address the fact that fugitives flee after arrest on the basis of a ``complaint'' and may flee after the prosecutor has filed an ``information'' in lieu of an amendment. The prior substitute amendment and the current Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment to H.R. 3048, by contrast, would allow use of such subpoenas to track fugitives who have been accused in a ``complaint, information or indictment.'' 
   Second, S. 2516, as introduced, would have required the U.S. Marshals Service to report quarterly to the Attorney General (who must transmit the report to Congress) on use of the administrative subpoenas. While a reporting requirement is useful, the requirement as described in the original S. 2516 was overly burdensome and insufficiently specific. The prior substitute amendment and the current Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment to H.R. 3048 would require, as set forth in the Capturing Criminals Act, that the Attorney General report for the next three years to the Judiciary Committees of both the House and Senate on the following information about the use 
   of administrative subpoenas in fugitive investigations: the number issued, by which agency, identification of the charges on which the fugitive was wanted and whether the fugitive was wanted on federal or state charges. 
   Third, although the original S. 2516 outlined the procedures for enforcement of an administrative subpoena, it was silent on the mechanisms for contesting the subpoena by the recipient. The procedures outlined in H.R. 3048 address this issue in a manner fully consistent with those I originally outlined in the Capturing Criminals Act by allowing a person, who is served with an administrative subpoena, to petition a court to modify or set aside the subpoena. 
   Fourth, the original S. 2516 set forth no procedure for the government to command a custodian of records to avoid disclosure or delay notice to a customer about the existence of the subpoena. This is particularly critical in fugitive investigations when law enforcement does not want to alert a fugitive that the police are on the person's trail. Both the prior substitute amendment to S. 2516, which passed the Senate last July, and H.R. 3048, which the Senate considers today, provide express authority for law enforcement to apply for a court order directing the custodian of records to delay notice to subscribers of the existence of the subpoena on the same terms applicable in current law to other subpoenas issued, for example, to telephone companies and financial institutions. This procedure is consistent with provisions I originally proposed in the Capturing Criminals Act. 
   Fifth, S. 2516, as introduced, would have authorized use of an administrative subpoena in fugitive investigations upon a finding by the Attorney General that the documents are ``relevant and material,'' which is further defined to mean that ``there are articulable facts that show the fugitive's whereabouts may be discerned from the records sought.'' In my view, changing the standard for issuance of a subpoena from ``relevancy'' to a hybrid of ``relevant and material'' would set a confusing precedent. Accordingly, the current Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment to H.R. 3048 amendment would authorize issuance of an administrative subpoena in fugitive investigations based on the same standard as for other administrative subpoenas, i.e., that the documents may be relevant to an authorized law enforcement inquiry. 
   Sixth, the original S. 2516 authorized the Attorney General to issue guidelines delegating authority for issuance of administrative subpoenas in fugitive investigations only to the Director of the U.S. Marshals Service, despite the fact that the FBI, and the Drug Enforcement Administration also want this authority to find fugitives on charges over which they have investigative authority. The substitute amendment to S. 2516, which previously passed the Senate, and the current Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment to H.R. 3048, which we consider today, would authorize the Attorney General to issue guidelines delegating authority for issuance of administrative subpoenas to supervisory personnel within components of the Department. In addition, the current Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment to H.R. 3048 would require that the Attorney General's guidelines require that administrative subpoenas in fugitive investigations be issued only upon the review and approval of senior supervisory personnel within the respective investigating agency and of the U.S. Attorney in the judicial district in which the subpoena 
   would be served. 
   Seventh, the original S. 2516 did not address the issue that a variety of administrative subpoena authorities exist in multiple forms in every agency. The substitute amendment to S. 2516, which previously passed the Senate, and the Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment to H.R. 3048, which we consider today, incorporates from the Capturing Criminals Act a requirement that the Attorney General provide a report on this issue.  
   Eighth, the current Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment to H.R. 3048 would limit the use of administrative subpoenas in fugitive investigations to those fugitives who have been accused or convicted of serious violent felony or serious drug offenses. 
   Finally, as introduced, S. 2516 authorized the U.S. Marshal Service to establish permanent Fugitive Apprehension Task Forces. By contrast, the substitute amendment to S. 2516, which previously passed the Senate, and the Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment to H.R. 3048, which we consider today, would authorize $40,000,000 over three years for the Attorney General to establish multi-agency task forces (which will be coordinated by the Director of the Marshals Service) in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the States, so that the Secret Service, BATF, the FBI and the States are able to participate in the Task Forces to find their fugitives. 
   The Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment to H.R. 3048 will help law enforcement--with increased resources for regional fugitive apprehension task forces and administrative subpoena authority--to bring to justice both federal and state fugitives who, by their conduct, have demonstrated a lack of respect for our nation's criminal justice system. 
   I urge that the Senate pass H.R. 3048 with the Hatch-Leahy-Thurmond amendment without delay.

   Mr. LEAHY. I would like to commend Senator REED for allowing us to proceed on several important immigration matters even though the Republican majority has refused to act on his compelling legislation to do justice for Liberians. Senator REED has been a persistent advocate for the Liberian nationals who have fled the strife in their nation for the United States. He has recognized that the U.S. has a special relationship with Liberia's citizens and has sought to respect and enhance that relationship. But his efforts have been resisted by the majority, which has consistently denied his requests to take up his bipartisan bill, which would allow Liberians who fled here and meet certain criteria to become legal permanent residents of the United States. I hope that we will change course and address this issue before we adjourn. I commend the Administration for its commitment to insist on action. 
   Meanwhile, I am pleased that we were able to pass H.R. 2883, a bill that will confer automatic citizenship upon foreign-born children who are adopted by the American parents. Given the severe curtailment of noncitizens' rights under the immigration laws we passed in 1996, it is all the more important to  extend this right to American parents and their adopted children. Everyone in the Senate supports adoption, and we should make sure the law expresses that support. 
   Many Senators on both sides of the aisle worked hard to see this bill become law, and I would like in particular to commend Senator LANDRIEU for her efforts. She and her staff were dedicated to this bill and were instrumental in its passage. 
   I hope that we are able today to move forward on a number of pieces of legislation. First, I hope we can pass the bill that extends the program under which religious workers can obtain visas to enter the U.S. Senator KENNEDY has championed this legislation, it has significant bipartisan support, and there is no reason not to act quickly to pass it. We should also pass the bill benefiting Syrian Jews that Senator SCHUMER has advocated, as well as legislation benefiting the Hmong people, which the late Congressman Bruce Vento did so much to promote. Although many of the larger immigration issues that should have been addressed in this Congress--from reforming expedited removal to restoring due process rights for legal permanent residents--may regrettably remain unresolved, we can at least take these more limited steps and demonstrate some commitment to immigrants and a sound immigration policy.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, more than a week ago I came to the floor to be sure the record was clear that all Democrats had cleared for final passage H.R. 5107, the Work for Hire and Copyright Corrections Act of 2000. I urged the Senate to take up H.R. 5107 without further unnecessary delay. I am glad that the majority has finally decided that action on this consensus bill is appropriate. I still do not know what caused the unexplained 2-week delay on the Republican side. 
   Representatives BERMAN and COBLE deserve credit, along with the interested parties, for working out a consensus solution in this legislation. The purpose of this bill is to restore the status quo ante, as it existed before November 29, 1999 regarding whether a sound recording can qualify as a ``work made for hire'' under the second part of the definition of that term in section 101 of the Copyright Act, and to do so in a manner that does not prejudice any person or entity that might have interests concerning this question. The House held an oversight hearing to explore this matter earlier this year and originated this legislation. This bill restores the law to the same place it was before the enactment of section 1101(d) of the Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999, as enacted by section 1000(a)(9) of Public Law Number 106-113, so that neither side is prejudiced by what was enacted at the end of 1999 or by what is being enacted now. This bill does not express or imply any view as to the proper interpretation of the work made for hire definition before November 29, 1999. Thus, neither the enactment of section 1101(d) nor this bill's deletion of that language are to be considered in any way or otherwise given any effect by a court or the Copyright Office when interpreting the work made for hire definition. 
   I congratulate Congressmen BERMAN and COBLE on final passage of this measure.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I agree with the distinguished Senator from California on Bonnie Campbell. As the one who has brought life into the Violence Against Women Act, it is remarkable that she cannot even get a vote in this Chamber on her judicial nomination. 
   I have said on the floor, although we are different parties, I have agreed with Gov. George Bush, who has said that in the Senate a nominee ought to get a vote, up or down, within 60 days. I urge in the time remaining in this session that he, as the head of his party, as their Presidential nominee, call the Republican leader of the Senate and say that all of these women, all of these minorities, in fact, all of the people who have been sitting here for well over 60 days waiting for a vote on their nomination, let them have a vote. Vote for them or vote against them. Bonnie Campbell deserves a vote. My guess is the reason she has not been brought for a vote is they know at least 80 of the 100 Senators would vote for her. It would be impossible to justify a vote against her because of her extraordinary qualifications. 
   Again, if Governor Bush is serious when he says have a vote within 60 days, pick up the phone, call the Senate majority leader, reach him at the switchboard, 202-224-3121, and ask him to bring her to a vote. It is a very easy thing to do. 
   I agree with the Senator on the Internet alcohol bill. That was included over my objection. It is unnecessary. It is dangerous to e-commerce. Adding Internet sales on alcohol demeans the issue of violence against women and sex trafficking that this bill is all about. It is demeaning to what is a good bill.

   Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield, the study was done by the non-partisan Citizens for Independent Courts. In fact, the former Republican Congressman from Oklahoma, Mickey Edwards, co-chaired that study. They found, without taking sides and without taking political stands, that women and minorities took longer to be confirmed by the Senate. Unfortunately, a lot of those women and minorities are not even getting a vote. 
   Again I say if Governor Bush means it, pick up the phone and call 202-224-3121; ask the Senate switchboard to connect him to the Republican leader and say: You know, I have made it a tenet of my campaign that the Senate should vote on a nomination within 60 days. You can bring every one of these people to the floor for a vote, up or down, today. Let's do so. Who knows. We will find out how the Senate feels about them. Are they for them or are they against them? Right now, instead of voting yes or no, we vote ``maybe,'' by having one or two Senators in the dark of night put holds on these people.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I recall very well the incident of which the Senator from Maryland speaks. I am pleased this is a case where the perpetrator was arrested and prosecuted. 
   One of the things I learned in my years as a prosecutor is that too often nobody wanted to pursue those cases. All that meant, of course, was that somebody else would be a victim. In this case, it was the Senator from Maryland. But from my experience, had the person not been apprehended, not been convicted, then someday it would be somebody else. So I commend the people of Baltimore who rallied to her. At least out of that sorry thing there was adequate prosecution. But we have so much violence against women that we never see. 
   I recall so many times police officers seeing a badly battered woman, and where we would bring prosecution, but as I talked to her, I would find this had happened several times before in a domestic situation and that they had gone to law enforcement, and others, and had been turned back where nothing had been followed up on. We had a very aggressive program in my office where we would follow up on it. I have to think there are a number of deaths, though, that have occurred and do occur in places where it is not followed up on. 
   This is something you do not see in the sunny ads and the perfect homes and domestic situations that we see on our television. The fact is, there are a lot of places in this country where  there is enormous violence against women. 
   I would add to the comments of my colleague, it goes across every economic strata, it goes across all social strata. This is not one thing that is just in poor neighborhoods or just in one ethnic group or another. This goes across the economic strata. It goes across good neighborhoods and bad neighborhoods, large families and small families. But, unfortunately, many times it never comes to the attention of law enforcement. Regrettably, sometimes when it does, it is not followed up on. This act, itself, will help focus the attention of law enforcement on this. 
   Mr. President, the Senator from New Jersey had asked to speak, and I know the Senator from Louisiana wishes to speak.

   Mr. LEAHY. I will speak more on this in another venue, but I think it is safe to say VAWA would not be voted on today had it not been for the persistence of the Senator from Delaware. That persistence is something the public has not seen as much as those of us who have been in private meetings with him, where his muscle really counted. We would not have this vote today, and I suspect it will be an overwhelmingly supportive vote--that vote would not have been today were it not for the total and complete persistence of the Senator from Delaware, just as the vote on sex trafficking is to the credit of the Senators from Kansas and Minnesota.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there is an interesting precedent being set as the Senate considers adopting Aimee's law as part of the conference report on the Sex Trafficking Act. The supporters of Aimee's law argue that states have a financial responsibility regarding the protection, or lack of protection, offered by state law. 
   I have expressed my concerns about Aimee's law and I want to put my colleagues on notice. If Congress and the President determine that this Act will become law, there are important ramifications that should be reflected in future legislation on many issues. 
   For example, the application of the Aimee's law standard to state responsibility should also be applied to pollution and waste that also crosses state borders. I think it will be interesting to see in the future whether supporters of Aimee's law will also support efforts to make states responsible for air pollution that is generated in their states but falls downwind on other states to damage the environment and endanger the health of children and individuals who suffer from asthma. 
   My colleagues in the Northeast will all recognize this issue--we are collectively suffering from the damage inflicted on our forests, waterways, and public health every day by the tons of uncontrolled pollution emitted from power plants in the midwest. In 1997, out of the 12,000,000 tons of acid-rain causing sulfur dioxide emitted by the United States, Vermont was the source of only ten--or 0.00008%. Yet my state suffers disproportionately from the ecological and financial damage of acid rain, from stricken sugar maple trees to fishless lakes and streams. Vermont, like many other New England states, spends significant funds to test fish for mercury and issue fish advisories when levels are too high--mercury that also has its source at uncontrolled midwestern plants. All of our hospitals also spend money for tests for respiratory problems for children exposed to ozone-thick air, air that drifts into Vermont from the urban centers to the south and west. 
   I would like to put the Senate on notice that when the Senate considers any amendments to the Clean Air Act, I will consider offering an amendment that will hold states responsible for the cost of the pollution they generate and which falls downwind. It will be interesting to see whether the supporters of the logic behind Aimee's law will support a Federal Government mandate that Vermont be paid by midwestern states for every ton of uncontrolled pollution that crosses into our state and results in costs to our environment and our citizens. 
   I provide this background to highlight the underlying problems with Aimee's law. While done with the best of intentions, the solution achieved with this provision is on questionable constitutional ground and has the potential to set a precedent that will have far reaching implications for many issues Congress will address in the future.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we all in the Senate and the House have been saddened by the death of Bruce Vento. Congressman Vento came to the Congress 2 years after I did. We served together and worked together on many issues. He belonged, proudly, to a sort of informal Italian-American caucus. We would talk about from which parts of Italy our families had come, and we became close friends. 
   I remember talking with Bruce when he was first diagnosed with cancer. I told him he was in my prayers, my wife's prayers, our family's prayers. He was a good man. 
   I was sad when I heard him announce he would not run for reelection because of his illness. Of course, we have been notified of his death. 
   There are Senators and House Members who come here who, under the old saying, some are show horses and some are workhorses. He was a workhorse. One of his priorities during his last year in Congress was the plight of the Hmong people, many of whom settled in Minnesota. They are people from Laos who had fought with the United States and its allies in the Vietnam war and came to the United States afterwards. They very much wanted to become citizens here but had great difficulty learning English because they come from a culture that does not have a written language. 
   Bruce Vento was the primary House sponsor of the Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act, a bill that passed the House and Senate earlier this year and became law. This bill waives the English language requirement for naturalization, and provides special consideration for the civics requirement for Hmong veterans and their spouses and widows. It has been a small concession on our part in return for the great sacrifices these men made in fighting for the American cause in Southeast Asia. I am pleased that with the help of Senators WELLSTONE, FEINGOLD, HAGEL, MCCAIN, and others the bill became law before the Congressman's untimely death earlier this week. 
   There is another bill that addresses an outstanding issue in the Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act. H.R. 5234, cosponsored by Congressman Vento, will extend the benefits of the new law to widows of Hmong veterans who died in Laos, Thailand, or Vietnam. The bill was passed by voice vote in the House on September 25. The Senate companion bill is strongly bipartisan with seven Democrats and five Republicans joining Senator WELLSTONE as sponsors. I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to lift the hold they have on this bill and allow it to pass so we can complete our work on this important issue. We can do this in Bruce Vento's memory, but we can also rectify an injustice that has been done to the Hmong people who have come to this country.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I rise to tell you about a man I have known for many years now who is a credit to his profession and to his community. He is a consummate professional and an even finer human being. Tim Johnson has been bringing the news to Brattleboro, VT and beyond for more than 20 years now. It is clear that Vermonters know a good thing when they hear it. 
   Tim, now the news director at WTSA, is a Brattleboro institution. In these times of huge media conglomerates and syndicated radio programs, Tim Johnson knows Brattleboro--he is a graduate of Brattleboro Union High School--and residents have come to rely on him for the news they care about. Time, on a typical day, will report on everything from lost pets, to school closings and national affairs. As Vermont's Senator for more than 20 years, I have had the pleasure of working with Tim throughout the years and I have come to appreciate his keen insights and his dogged pursuit of the facts. Tim has demonstrated an unflagging commitment to keeping his community informed and Brattleboro has been the better for it. While we hear so much about what is wrong with the media today, Tim Johnson is a shining example of what is right.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the House of Representatives has, again, thwarted the will of a bipartisan majority of the Congress. 
   After strong votes in both the House and Senate to lift sanctions on the sale of food and medicine to Cuba, the Republican conferees on the Agriculture appropriations bill have added a provision to prohibit public financing which makes it virtually certain that few, if any, sales will actually occur. 
   It is bad for America's farmers, bad for the people of Cuba, and bad foreign policy. 
   Even worse, the conferees would codify the restrictions on travel to Cuba, a position which is at odds with the fundamental right of every American to travel freely. 
   Senator DODD and I introduced legislation earlier this year that would lift the ban on travel to Cuba. It is ironic--or I should say it is outrageous--that Americans can travel to North Korea, or Syria, or Vietnam, but not Cuba. What a hypocritical, self-defeating, anachronistic policy. 
   Senator DODD spoke eloquently last Friday about this misguided provision and I want to associate myself with his remarks. I will not take more time today. 
   But I want to say that this is a terrible decision, a partisan decision, a decision driven by politics, and one of the many, many reasons why the election on November 7 is so important. It is far past time that we inject some intelligence and bipartisanship into our foreign policy. 
   This Congress has had its chance. It has fallen short in too many ways to count. This decision on Cuba is just another example of the 106th Congress' failures to do what is right for America, and right for the American people.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to note my deep disappointment that hate crimes legislation has been dropped from the Department of Defense authorization bill in conference, despite the fact that both the Senate and the House have voted to include it. This is a major step backward for our commitment to civil rights. 
   The Senate passed the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2000, sponsored by Senators KENNEDY and GORDON SMITH, on June 20 by a strong bipartisan vote of 57-42. This legislation would strengthen current law by making it easier for federal authorities to investigate and prosecute crimes based on race, color, religion, and national origin. It also focuses the attention and resources of the federal government on the problem of hate crimes committed against people because of their sexual orientation, gender, or disability. 
   The Senate bill also shows full respect for principles of federalism. It strengthens Federal jurisdiction over hate crimes as a back-up, but not a substitute, for state and local law enforcement. It has received strong bipartisan support from state and local law enforcement organizations across the country, support that is particularly significant to me as a former prosecutor. 
   On September 13, the House voted 232-192 to instruct their conferees to agree to the Senate language, showing that a strong bipartisan majority of the House also wanted to strengthen and expand our laws against hate crimes. 
   But the conferees have now ignored the will of both the Senate and the House. They have dropped the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, which has the support of not just the Congress but the President and the American people. 
   Their objection cannot be that this legislation is unimportant. Hate crimes affect more than just their victims and their victims' families--they inspire fear in those who have no connection to the victim beyond a shared characteristic such as race or sexual orientation. When James Byrd, Jr. was dragged behind a pickup truck and killed by bigots in Texas for no reason other than his race, many African-Americans throughout the United States surely felt diminished as citizens. When Matthew Shepard was brutally murdered in Wyoming because he was gay, many gay people throughout the United States felt less safe on our streets and in their homes. These crimes promote fear and insecurity that are distinct from the reactions to other crimes, and House and Senate have both agreed that they should have distinct punishments. 
   The conferees' objection cannot be that this legislation is unnecessary. Bigotry and hatred are corrosive elements in any society, but especially in a country as diverse and open as ours. We need to make clear that a bigoted attack on one or some of us diminishes each of us, 
   and it diminishes our Nation. As a Nation, we must say loudly and clearly that we will defend ourselves against such violence. All Americans have the right to live, travel and gather where they choose. In the past we have responded as a nation to deter and to punish violent denials of civil rights. We have enacted Federal laws to protect the civil rights of all of our citizens for more than 100 years. The hate crimes amendment this Senate  approved and the House endorsed continues that great and honorable tradition. 
   The conferees' objection cannot be that this legislation is unconstitutional. This bill accomplishes a critically important goal--protecting all of our citizens--without compromising our constitutional responsibilities. It is a tool for combating acts of violence and threats of violence motivated by hatred and bigotry. The Constitution does not permit us in Congress to prohibit the expression of an idea simply because we disagree with it. As Justice Holmes wrote, the Constitution protects not just freedom for the thought and expression we agree with it. As Justice Holmes wrote, the Constitution protects not just freedom for the thought and expression we agree with, but freedom for the thought that we hate. I am devoted to that principle, and I am confident that this bill does not contradict it. 
   The conferees' objection cannot be that this legislation has not been properly examined. In addition to gaining the approval of the Senate and the House this year, similar legislation passed the Senate last year. It has been the subject of great discussion in the general public and in the halls of Congress. It is long past time to act on this legislation. 
   Finally, the conferees's objection cannot be that hate crimes are rare occurrences. In addition to the terrible murders of Mr. Byrd and Mr. Shepard, the last years have seen the murder of former Northwestern basketball coach Ricky Byrdsong and others in a bigoted Illinois shooting spree, the terrible sight of small children at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles fleeing a gunman who sprayed the building with 70 bullets from a submachine gun, and racially-motivated crimes in the Pittsburgh area by both African-American and white offenders. And these are just some examples of a wider phenomenon of hate-based crimes. 
   I would like to thank Senators KENNEDY and GORDON SMITH for their exhaustive efforts on behalf of hate crimes legislation. I regret that their efforts and the will of the House and Senate have been frustrated.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as a conferee last year on the satellite television bill, I worked hard to include, along with several of my colleagues, a provision that would have ensured that the benefits of that bill would also be shared by rural Americans through a loan guarantee program. 
   Those benefits include providing local-into-local television over satellite--which simply means that rural Americans would be able to receive their local network stations over satellite if they owned a satellite dish, along with the full range of weather, movie, superstation, sports and a host of other channels. 
   We wanted to ensure that rural Americans would get the same level of television service over satellite as urban Americas would enjoy. 
   As it turns out, urban Americans can now receive the full array of local network channels over satellite--but the great majority of rural Americans can not. 
   Unfortunately, the Chairman of the Banking Committee objected to the provision--at the end of last year--that would have helped finance such service to rural areas and we have been unable to resolve this matter. 
   At the time I was very worried this would happen which is why I discussed it at some length on the floor. 
   I want to stress, once again, to all of my colleagues that this is very important to our constituents. We need to work together so that we can resolve this problem and make sure that rural America is not left in the dark. 
   I am here today, to again stand with rural Americans. I have already mentioned on the floor several times that if we tried to hold a Conference on this issue that we would be unable to pass the bill this year. 
   I said few weeks ago that we simply do not have time to go through the formal Conference process. The e-signature Conference, for example, took many months. As I have warned everyone before--we do not have time for a Conference. 
   However, if we work together we can easily finish a bill that will actually work and get local television stations carried over satellite.  
   With a few improvements to the House-passed or to the Senate-passed bills we can get this job done for rural America. 
   We need to make sure that the federal guarantee can cover providing high-speed Internet access to rural Americans. As long as we are going to help finance a satellite we should get the biggest benefit out of it by having it also help break down the digital divide. 
   Also, some of the bill provisions consist of such atypical, and onerous, credit requirement that I do not think that any lenders will want to participate. 
   I have two basic concerns with the proposed language, and have serious concerns about the extraneous House provisions on cell telephones and the like. 
   I also understand through lobbyists that efforts are being made to include language that would take away FCC authority to approve the new ``Northpoint'' technology that could provide local-into-local television in many areas of the country. My understanding is that some of the satellite providers are concerned that Northpoint could compete with them. 
   In terms of the credit provisions of the bill, I am worried that potential borrowers may have long-term existing contractural obligations or security agreements whose contract terms would be abrogated by this law if they were to participate in this loan guarantee program. 
   If they received a guaranteed loan under the bill, their lenders could pull back existing credit lines for violating their contracts by complying with the new law. 
   With respect to the default language, even a minor default could lead to liquidation which would reduce the ability of the United States to protects its own interests and, in addition, could trigger unnecessary defaults on loans or projects which the borrower may have with the United States, or other lenders. 
   The additional problem with the superpriority bankruptcy language is that it is a backdoor ``taking'' of property because it would take the property rights of creditors that have other prior perfected security interests in the borrower's property. 
   These contract property rights--which would be destroyed after the fact--could be very valuable and the bill could take them away. 
   Mr. President, I have provided language to most interested offices some months ago to resolve these points which may appear at first blush to be technical but, in fact, could make it impossible for this program to work. 
   I have also proposed language to ensure that rural Americans are able to receive high-speed Internet access under this bill. The section on prerequisites for the loan does not list high-speed Internet access as a purpose for the guarantee. 
   I recommend adding ``high-speed Internet access'' to that section so that the Board could approve a guarantee which would include that purpose, as a secondary consideration. 
   I have pointed out before on the Senate floor that, ``computers are on a development path that improves performance by a factor of 10 every five years,'' according to Scientific American. 
   However, without high-speed linkage of these constantly improving computers rural America will be left behind. 
   In America, there is a growing disparity between the digital ``haves'' and ``have-nots'' as portions of our society get left behind at the same lightning pace at which the Internet develops. 
   I would like the bill changed so that we can close the ``digital divide'' that keeps rural America from fully participating in America's economic boom under President Clinton. 
   I know that some are fighting to keep this disparity--but this disparity between rural and urban America is self-defeating as the Internet becomes an increasingly important thread of our business and social fabric. 
   So I hope all my colleagues will join with me in working together to get this program in operation before Congress goes out of session.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the situation we are in right now is interesting. It is different from any similar period I can recall in nearly 26 years in the Senate. We are at the end of the fiscal year--we have actually gone beyond the end of the fiscal year--and nothing seems to be happening. I voted against the continuing resolution, not because I do not think we should keep the Government going--of course we should; it is unfortunate to close down the Government--but more to express my concern that we are not doing our business. 
   We have not passed our appropriations bills as we should. We all talk about how we make Government more efficient or how we make Government better. But imagine if you are running one of these Agencies or one of these Departments and you have to make the decisions for the year, and Congress, which has a mandate under law to pass the appropriations bills by September 30, we are here on October 5 and are nowhere near completing the bills. 
   Yet in a Congress that spends more time investigating than legislating, we are perfectly willing to have investigations and actually bring a lot of these Departments to a halt while we ask them question after question, even if the questions have already been asked, and yet we are unwilling to do our own work on time. It is not the way it can be done, and it is not the way it should be done. 
   I strongly urge Senators to consider next year when we come back, no matter who wins the Presidency, no matter who wins seats in the Senate or in the other body, that we spend more time trying to do things that actually help the country, that we set aside some of the partisanship and bitterness that has marked this Senate actually since impeachment time, which in itself was marked by partisanship when impeachment was rushed through in a lame duck House of Representatives and then passed over to this body. It appears in many ways we lost our footing at that time and never got back on course. 
   There are bills that have bipartisan support. There was one I was discussing on the floor a few minutes ago with the distinguished Senator from Colorado, the Campbell-Leahy bulletproof vest bill. This is a bill that provides money for bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers. 
   Senator CAMPBELL and I served in law enforcement before we came to Congress. We served at a time when much of law enforcement did not face the danger it does now, but we kept enough of our ties to law enforcement and so we know how difficult it is. We know that the men and women we send out to protect all of us are themselves so often the victims of the same criminals from whom they try to protect us. 
   Bulletproof vests are a $500 or $600 item. They wear out in 5 years. A lot of departments, especially small departments in States such as Vermont or rural areas like Texas, cannot afford these vests. I have letters from hundreds of law enforcement people from around the country who tell me that under the original Campbell-Leahy bill, they finally have a sense of security because they have bulletproof vests. We want to extend that for a couple more years. Yet we cannot even get a vote on it. 
   This is a bill which, if it is brought to a vote in this Chamber, I am willing to bet virtually every Senator, Republican and Democrat, will vote for. How can one vote against it? Yet there has been one hold on the Republican side of the aisle, and we cannot bring up this vital law enforcement piece of legislation. 
   I wanted to be sure--I am hearing from law enforcement agencies all across the country: Why can't you pass it?--so I actually made the point of checking with all 46 Democratic Senators: Do any of you have any objection to voting on this on a second's notice? They said: No, pass it by unanimous consent, if you want. 
   I ask whoever is holding it up on the other side not to continue to hold it up. 
   Mr. President, I return to ask the Republican leadership what is holding up enactment of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000? This is a bill I introduced with Senator CAMPBELL and others last April. The Senate Judiciary Committee considered and and reported the bill unanimously to the full Senate back in June. I have since been working to get Senate consideration, knowing that it will pass overwhelmingly if not unanimously. 
   Unfortunately, an anonymous ``hold'' on the Republican side prevented enactment before the Senate recessed in July. I have been unable to discover which Republican Senator opposes the bill or why, and that remains true today. 
   We have been working for several months to pass the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000. It has been cleared by all Democratic Senators. 
   That it has still not passed the full Senate is very disappointing to me, as I am sure that it is to our nation's law enforcement officers, who need life-saving bulletproof vests to protect themselves. Protecting and supporting our law enforcement community should not be a partisan issue. 
   Senator CAMPBELL and I worked together closely and successfully in the last Congress to pass the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998 into law. This year's bill reauthorizes and extends the successful program that we helped create and that the Department of Justice has done such a good job implementing. 
   I have charts here that show how successful the Bulletproof Vests Grant Program has been for individual states. In its first year of operation in 1999, the program funded the purchase of 167,497 vests with $23 million in federal grant funds. 
   For the State of Alabama, the program funded the purchase of 2,287 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 1999. For the State of California, the program funded the purchase of 28,106 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 1999. For the State of Colorado, the program funded the purchase of 1,844 bulletproof vests for police officers in 1999. 
   For the State of Idaho, the program funded the purchase of 711 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 1999. For the State of Michigan, the program funded the purchase of 2,932 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 1999. For the State of Minnesota, the program funded the purchase of 1,052 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 1999. For the State of Mississippi, the program funded the purchase of 1,283 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 1999. For the State of Missouri, the program funded the purchase of 2,919 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 1999. 
   For the State of New York, the program funded the purchase of 13,004 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 1999. For the State of Oklahoma, the program funded the purchase of 3,042 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 1999. For the State of Rhode Island, the program funded the purchase of 792 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 1999. For the State of Utah, the program funded the purchase of 1,326 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 1999. For my home State of Vermont, the program funded the purchase of 361 bulletproof vests for police officers in 1999. For big and small states, the program was a success in its first year. 
   I have a second chart that shows how successful the Bulletproof Vests Grant Program has been for individual states in its second year of operation. In 2000, the program funded the purchase of 158,396 vests with $24 million in federal grant funds. 
   For the State of Alabama, the program funded the purchase of 2,498 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 2000. For the State of California, the program funded the purchase of 27,477 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 2000. For the State of Colorado, the program funded the purchase of 2,288 bulletproof vests for police officers in 2000. 
   For the State of Idaho, the program funded the purchase of 477 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 2000. For the State of Michigan, the program funded the purchase of 3,427 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 2000. For the State of Minnesota, the program funded the purchase of 709 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 2000. For the State of Mississippi, the program funded the purchase of 1,364 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 2000. For the State of Missouri, the program funded the purchase of 1,221 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 2000. 
   For the State of New York, the program funded the purchase of 11,969 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 2000. For the State of Oklahoma, the program funded the purchase of 3,389 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 2000. For the State of Rhode Island, the program funded the purchase of 313 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 2000. For the State of Utah, the program funded the purchase of 1,326 bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers in 2000. For my home State of Vermont, the program funded the purchase of 175 bulletproof vests for police officers in 2000. For the second year in a row, the program was a great success.

   Mr. LEAHY. The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 builds on the success of this program by doubling its annual funding to $50 million for fiscal years 2002-2004. It also improves the program by guaranteeing jurisdictions with fewer than 100,000 residents receiving the full 50-50 matching funds because of the tight budgets of these smaller communities and by making the purchase of stab-proof vests eligible for grant awards to protect corrections officers in close quarters in local and county jails. 
   We have 20 cosponsors on the new bill, including a number of Democrats and Republicans. This is a bipartisan bill that is not being treated in a bipartisan way. For some unknown reason a Republican Senator has a hold on this bill and has chosen to exercise that right anonymously. 
   More than ever before, police officers in Vermont and around the country face deadly threats that can strike at any time, even during routine traffic stops. Bulletproof vests save lives. It is essential the we update this law so that many more of our officers who are risking their lives everyday are able to protect themselves. 
   I hope that the mysterious ``hold'' on the bill from the other side of the aisle will disappear. The Senate should pass without delay the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 and send to the President for his signature into law. 
   Before we recessed last July, I informed the Republican leadership that the House of Representatives had passed the companion bill, H.R. 4033, by an overwhelming vote of 413-3. I expressed my hope that the Senate would quickly follow suit and pass the House-passed bill and send it to the President. President Clinton has already endorsed this legislation to support our Nation's law enforcement officers and is eager to sign it into law. 
   I find it ironic that the Senate in July passed the Federal Law Enforcement Animal Protection Act, H.R. 1791. That bill increased the penalties for harming dogs and horses used by federal law enforcement officers. President Clinton signed that bill into law on August 2nd. 
   The majority acted quickly to protect dogs and horses used by law enforcement officers but has stalled action on legislation to provide life-saving protection for law enforcement officers themselves. The Senate should have moved as quickly in July to pass the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 and sent it to the President for his signature into law. 
   Several more months have come and gone. Unfortunately, nothing has changed. Not knowing what the misunderstanding of our bill is, I find it is impossible to overcome an anonymous, unstated objection. I, again, ask whoever it is on the Republican side who has a concern about this program to please come talk to me and to Senator CAMPBELL. I hope that the Senate will do the right thing and pass this important legislation without further unnecessary delay.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today is October 5, the first anniversary of an event I hope I will not see again in the Senate. I have spoken many times about the Senate being the conscience of the Nation, and it should be. A year ago today, I believe the country was harmed by a party-line vote. That party-line vote defeated the nomination of Justice Ronnie White to the Federal district court in Missouri. Justice White, on the Missouri Supreme Court, had the highest qualifications. He passed through the Senate Judiciary Committee. He had the highest ABA ratings. He is a distinguished African American jurist. Yet when it came to a vote, every Democrat voted for him and every Republican voted against him. I believe that was a mistake and one we will regret. I spoke on this nomination on October 15 and 21 of last year and more recently this year. 
   Fifty-one years ago this month--I was 9 years old--the Senate confirmed President Truman's nomination of William Henry Hastings to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. That was actually the first Senate confirmation of an African American to our Federal courts--only 51 years ago. Thirty-one years ago, the Senate confirmed President Johnson's nomination of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court. When we rejected Ronnie White, I wonder if we went backward or we moved forward. 
   This year, the Judiciary Committee has even refused to move forward with a hearing on Roger Gregory or Judge James Wynn to the Fourth Circuit. It is interesting--talk about bipartisanship--one of these men is a distinguished African American, a legal scholar, strongly supported by both the Republican and Democratic Senators from his State. Senator WARNER, a distinguished and respected Member of this body and a Republican, strongly supports him. Senator ROBB, an equally distinguished and respected Member of this body and a Democrat, a decorated war hero, also supports him, and the President nominated him. We cannot even get a vote. 
   I hope this does not continue. I suggest, again, whoever wins the Presidency, whoever wins seats or loses seats in the Senate, that we not do this next year. 
   This year, the Judiciary Committee reported only three nominees to the Court of Appeals all year. We denied a committee vote to two outstanding nominees who succeeded in getting hearings. I understand the frustration of Senators who know Roger Gregory, Judge James Wynn, Kathleen McCree Lewis, Judge Helene White, Bonnie Campbell, and others should have been considered and voted on. 
   There are multiple vacancies on the Third, the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, Tenth, and District of Columbia Circuits; 23 current vacancies. Our appellate courts have nearly half of the judicial vacancies in the Federal court system. That has to change. I hope it will. 
   I see my distinguished colleague and friend from Texas on the floor. I want to assure her I will yield the floor very soon. 
   But I hope we can look again and ask ourselves objectively, without any partisanship, can we not do better on judges? 
   I quoted Gov. George Bush on the floor a couple days ago. I said I agreed with him. On nominations, he said we should vote them up or down within 60 days. If you don't want the person, vote against them. The Republican Party should have no fear of that. They have the majority in this body. They can vote against them if they want, but have the vote. Either vote for them or vote against them. Don't leave people such as Helene White and Bonnie Campbell--people such as this--just hanging forever without even getting a rollcall vote. That is wrong. It is not a responsible way and besmirches the Senate, this body that I love so much. 
   I consider it a privilege to serve here. This is a nation of a quarter of a billion people; and only 100 of us can serve at any one time to represent this wonderful Nation. It is a privilege that our States give us. We should use the privilege in the most responsible way to benefit all of us. 
   When Senators do not vote their conscience, they risk the debacle that we witnessed last October 5th, when a partisan political caucus vote resulted in a fine man and highly qualified nominee being rejected by all Republican Senators on a party-line vote. The Senate will never remove the blot that occurred last October when the Republican Senators emerged from a Republican Caucus to vote lockstep against Justice White. At a Missouri Bar Association forum last week, Justice White expressed concern that the rejection of his nominations to a Federal judgeship will have a ``chilling effect'' on the desire of other young African American lawyers to seek to serve on our judiciary. 
   President Clinton has tried to make progress on bringing greater diversity to our federal courts. He has been successful to some extent. With our help, we could have done so much more. We will end this Congress without having acted on any of the African American nominees, Judge James Wynn or Roger Gregory, sent to us to fill vacancies on the Fourth Circuit and finally integrate the Circuit with the highest percentage of African American population in the country, but the one Circuit that has never had an African American judge. We could have acted on the nomination of Kathleen McCree Lewis and confirmed her to the Sixth Circuit to be the first African American woman to sit on that Court. Instead, we will end the year without having acted on any of the three outstanding nominees to the Sixth Circuit pending before us. 
   This Judiciary Committee has reported only three nominees to the Courts of Appeals all year. We have held hearings without even including a nominee to the Courts of Appeals and denied a Committee vote to two outstanding nominees who succeeded in getting hearings. I certainly understand the frustration of those Senators who know that Roger Gregory, Judge James Wynn, Kathleen McCree Lewis, as well as Judge Helene White, Bonnie Campbell and others should have been considered by this Committee and voted on by the Senate this year. 
   There continue to be multiple vacancies on the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, Tenth and District of Columbia Circuits. With 23 current vacancies, our appellate courts have nearly half of the total judicial emergency vacancies in the federal court system. I note that the vacancy rate for our Courts of Appeals is more than 12 percent nationwide. If we were to take into account the additional appellate judgeships included in the Hatch-Leahy Federal Judgeship Act of 2000, S.3071, a bill that was requested by the Judicial Conference to handle current workloads, the vacancy rate on our federal courts of appeals would be more than 17 percent. 
   The Chairman declares that ``there is and has been no judicial vacancy crisis'' and that he calculates vacancies at ``less than zero.'' The extraordinary service that has been provided by our corps of senior judges does not mean there are no vacancies. In the federal courts around the country there remain 63 current vacancies and several more on the horizon. With the judgeships included in the Hatch-Leahy Federal Judgeship Act of 2000, there would be over 130 vacancies across the country. That is the truer measure of vacancies, many of which have been long-standing judicial emergency vacancies in our southwest border states. The chief judges of both the Fifth and Sixth Circuits have had to declare their entire courts in emergencies since there are too many vacancies and too few circuit judges to handle their workload. 
   The chairman misconstrues the lessons of the 63 vacancies at the end of  the 103rd Congress in 1994. I would point out that in 1994 the Senate confirmed 101 judges to compensate for normal attrition and to fill the vacancies and judgeships created in 1990. In fact, that Congress reduced the vacancies from 131 in 1991, to 103 in 1992, to 112 in 1993, to 63 in 1994. Vacancies were going down and we were acting with Republican and Democratic Presidents to fill the 85 judgeships created by a Democratic Congress under a Republican President in 1990. Since Republicans assumed control of the Senate in the 1994 election the Senate has not even kept up with normal attrition. We will end this year with more vacancies than at the end of the session in 1994. As I have pointed out, the vacancies are most acute among our courts of appeals. Further, we have not acted to add the judgeships requested by the Judicial Conference to meet increased workloads over the last decade. 
   According to the Chief Justice's 1999 year-end report, the filings of cases in our Federal courts have reached record heights. In fact, the filings of criminal cases and defendants reached their highest levels since the Prohibition Amendment was repealed in 1933. Also in 1999, there were 54,693 filings in the 12 regional courts of appeals. Overall growth in appellate court caseload last year was due to a 349 percent upsurge in original proceedings. This sudden expansion resulted from newly implemented reporting procedures, which more accurately measure the increased judicial workload generated by the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, both passed in 1996. 
   Let me also set the record straight, yet again, on the erroneous but oft-repeated argument that ``the Clinton Administration is on record as having stated that a vacancy rate just over 7 percent is virtual full-employment of the judiciary.'' That is not true. 
   The statement can only be alluded to an October 1994 press release. It should not be misconstrued in this manner. That press release was pointing out that at the end of the 103rd Congress if the Senate had proceeded to confirm the 14 nominees then pending on the Senate calendar, it would have reduced the judicial vacancy rate to 4.7 percent, which the press release then proceeded to compare to a favorable unemployment rate of under 5 percent. 
   Unfortunately, the chairman's assertions are demonstrably false. Contrary to his statement, the Justice Department's October 12, 1994 press release that he cites does not equate a 7.4 percent vacancy rate with ``full employment,'' but rather a 4.7 percent rate. Additionally, the vacancy rate was not reduced to 4.7 percent in 1994, and stands at three times that today. 
   The Justice Department release was not a statement of administration position or even a policy statement but a poorly designed press release that included an ill-conceived comment. Job vacancy rates and unemployment rates are not comparable. Unemployment rates are measures of people who do not have jobs not of Federal offices vacant without an appointed office holder. 
   When I learned that some Republicans had for partisan purposes seized upon this press release, taken it out of context, ignored what the press release actually said and were manipulating it into a misstatement of Clinton administration policy, I asked the Attorney General, in 1997, whether there was any level or percentage of judicial vacancies that the administration considered acceptable or equal to ``full employment.'' 
   The Department responded:  
   There is no level or percentage of vacancies that justifies a slow down in the Senate on the confirmation of nominees for judicial positions. While the Department did once, in the fall of 1994, characterize a 4.7 percent vacancy rate in the federal judiciary as the equivalent of the Department of Labor `full employment' standard, that characterization was intended simply to emphasize the hard work and productivity of the Administration and the Senate in reducing the extraordinary number of vacancies in the federal Article III judiciary in 1993 and 1994. Of course, there is a certain small vacancy rate, due to retirements and deaths and the time required by the appointment process, that will always exist. The current vacancy rate is 11.3 percent. It did reach 12 percent this past summer. The President and the Senate should continually be working diligently to fill vacancies as they arise, and should always strive to reach 100 percent capacity for the Federal bench.  
   At no time has the Clinton administration stated that it believes that 7 percent vacancies on the federal bench is acceptable or a virtually full federal bench. Only Republicans have expressed that opinion. As the Justice Department noted three years ago in response to an inquiry on this very questions, the Senate should be ``working diligently to fill vacancies as they arise, and should always strive to reach 100 percent capacity for the federal bench.'' 
   Indeed, I informed the Senate of these facts in a statement in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD on July 7, 1998, so that there would be no future misunderstanding or misstatement of the record. Nonetheless, in spite of the facts and in spite of my July 1998 statement and subsequent statements on this issue over the past three years, these misleading statements continue to be repeated. 
   Ironically, the Senate could reduce the current vacancy rate to under 5 percent if we confirmed the 39 judicial nominees that remain bottled up before the Judiciary Committee. Instead of misstating the language of a 6-year-old press release that has since been discredited by the Attorney General herself, the chairman would have my support if we were working to get those 39 more judges confirmed. 
   I regret to report again today that the last confirmation hearing for federal judges held by the Judiciary Committee was in July, as was the last time the Judiciary Committee reported any nominees to the full Senate. Throughout August and September and now into the first week in October, there have been no additional hearings held or even noticed, and no executive business meetings have included any judicial nominees on the agenda. By contrast, in 1992, the last year of the Bush administration, a Democratic majority in the Senate held three confirmation hearings in August and September and continued to work to confirm judges up to and including the last day of the session. 
   I continue to urge the Senate to meet its responsibilities to all nominees, including women and minorities. So long as the Senate is in session, I will urge action. That highly-qualified nominees are being needlessly delayed is most regrettable. The Senate should join with the President to confirm well-qualified, diverse and fair-minded nominees to fulfill the needs of the Federal courts around the country. 
   As I noted on the floor earlier this week, the frustration that many Senators feel with the lack of attention this Committee has shown long pending judicial nominees has simply boiled over. I understand their frustration and have been urging action for some time. This could all have been easily avoided if we were continuing to move judicial nominations like Democrats did in 1992, when we held hearings in September and confirmed 66 judges that Presidential election year. 
   I regret that the Judiciary Committee and the Senate is not holding additional hearings, that we only acted on 39 nominees all year and that we have taken so long on so many of them. I deeply regret the lack of a hearing and a vote on so many qualified nominees, including Roger Gregory, Judge James Wynn, Judge Helene White, Bonnie Campbell, Enrique Moreno, Allen Snyder and others. And, I regret that a year ago today, the Senate rejected the nomination of Justice Ronnie White to the Federal District Court of Missouri on a partisan, party-line vote.

   Mr. LEAHY. There is no question about it. In fact, in the 1999 bill they were able to purchase nearly 400 vests, many of those in the rural areas. If we get this through, now they can purchase 1,176 vests. 
   I say this because the Senate moved very quickly to pass a bill that increased the penalties if we harmed dogs or horses used by law enforcement. In other words, we could quickly zip this through and pass a bill saying the penalty will be increased if one harms a dog or horse used by law enforcement, but, whoops, we can't pass a bipartisan piece of legislation protecting the law enforcement officer himself or herself. I think of Alice in Wonderland, I have to admit, under those circumstances.

If you have the police officer out with the police dog, that police officer deserves protection. If you have a police officer out there with a horse--in many parts of both urban and rural areas horses are still used for a number of reasons by police officers--then let's also protect the police officer.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join today with Senators BAYH, GRAMS, and CLELAND in introducing the ``Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act of 2000.'' I have been concerned for some time that even as the general crime rate has been declining steadily over the past eight years, the rate of crime against the elderly has remained unchanged. That is why I introduced the Seniors Safety Act, S. 751, with Senators DASCHLE, KENNEDY, and TORRICELLI over a year ago. 
   The Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act includes one of the titles from the Seniors Safety Act. This title does two things. First, it instructs the Attorney General to conduct a study relating to crimes against seniors, so that we can develop a coherent strategy to prevent and properly punish such crimes. Second, it mandates the inclusion of seniors in the National Crime Victimization Study. Both of these are important steps, and they should be made law. 
   The Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act also includes important proposals for addressing the problem of crimes against the elderly, especially fraud  crimes. In addition to the provisions described above, the bill authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to establish local programs to prevent fraud against seniors and educate them about the risk of fraud, as well as to provide information about telemarketing and sweepstakes fraud to seniors, both directly and through State Attorneys General. These are two common-sense provisions that will help seniors protect themselves against crime. 
   I hope that we can also take the time to consider the rest of the Seniors Safety Act, and enact even more comprehensive protections for our seniors. The Seniors Safety Act offers a comprehensive approach that would increase law enforcement's ability to battle telemarketing, pension, and health care fraud, as well as to police nursing homes with a record of mistreating their residents. The Justice Department has said that the Seniors Safety Act would ``be of assistance in a number of ways.'' I asked Senator HATCH to hold Judiciary Committee hearings on the bill as long ago as October 1999, and again this past February, but my requests have thus far not been granted. I ask again today for hearings on this important and comprehensive proposal. 
   First, the Seniors Safety Act provides additional protections to nursing home residents. Nursing homes provide an important service for our seniors--indeed, more than 40 percent of Americans turning 65 this year will need nursing home care at some point in their lives. Many nursing homes do a wonderful job with a very difficult task--this legislation simply looks to protect seniors and their families by isolating the bad providers in operation. It does this by giving federal law enforcement the authority to investigate and prosecute operators of those nursing homes that engage in a pattern of health and safety violations. This authority is all the more important given the study prepared by the Department of Health and Human Services and reported this summer in the New York Times showing that 54 percent of American nursing homes fail to meet the Department's ``proposed minimum standard'' for patient care. The study also showed that 92 percent of nursing homes have less staff than necessary to provide optimal care. 
   Second, the Seniors Safety Act helps protect seniors from telemarketing fraud, which costs billions of dollars every year. My bill would give the Attorney General the authority to block or terminate telephone service where that service is being used to defraud seniors. If someone takes your money at gunpoint, the law says we can take away their gun. If someone uses their phone to take away your money, the law should allow us to protect other victims by taking their phone away. In addition, my proposal would establish a Better Business Bureau-style clearinghouse that would keep track of complaints made about telemarketing companies. With a simple phone call, seniors could fine out whether the company trying to sell to them over the phone or over the Internet has been the subject of complaints or been convinced of fraud. Senator BAYH has recently introduced another bill, S. 3025, the Combating Fraud Against Seniors Act, which includes the part of the Seniors Safety Act that establishes the clearinghouse for telemarketing fraud information. 
   Third, the Seniors Safety Act punishes pension fraud. Seniors who have worked hard for years should not have to worry that their hard-earned retirement savings will not be there when they need them. The bill would create new criminal and civil penalties for those who defraud pension plans, and increase the penalties for bribery and graft in connection with employee benefit plans. 
   Fourth and finally, the Seniors Safety Act strengthens law enforcement's ability to fight health care fraud. A recent study by the National Institute for Justice reports that many health care fraud schemes ``deliberately target vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or Alzheimer's patients, who are less willing or able to complain or alert law enforcement.'' This legislation gives law enforcement the additional investigatory tools it needs to uncover, investigate, and prosecute health care offenses in both criminal and civil proceedings. It also protects whistle-blowers who alert law enforcement officers to examples of health care fraud. 
   In conclusion, I would like to commend Senators BAYH and CLELAND for working to take steps to improve the safety and security of America's seniors. I call upon my colleagues to pass this bipartisan legislation and begin the fight to lower the crime rate against seniors. I also urge them to consider and pass the Seniors Safety Act. Taken together, these two bills would provide a comprehensive approach toward giving law enforcement and older Americans the tools they need to prevent crime.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, all Democrats have cleared for final passage H.R. 5107, the Work for Hire and Copyright Corrections Act of 2000. I hope that the Senate will take up H.R. 5107 without further unnecessary delay. Representatives BERMAN and COBLE deserve credit, along with the interested parties, for working out a consensus solution in their work for hire copyright legislation. I do not know why the Senate has not confirmed their work and accorded their bill consent for final passage. Why the Republican majority has not taken up this measure since the middle of last week is another unexplained mystery. 
   As has been true with our bipartisan bill to provide bulletproof vest grants to law enforcement, S. 2014, and its House-passed counterpart, H.R. 4033, all Democrats have cleared these matters for Senate action. As has been true for some time with the Violence Against Women Act of 2000, S. 2787, all Democrats have cleared these matters for Senate action. The same is true with respect to S. 1796, the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, all Democrats have cleared these matters for Senate action. There are so many bills cleared by the Senate Democrats being held hostage without explanation by the Republican majority, it is hard to know where to begin and where to end. Here is this last week of the session the Senate could be making progress on a number of items but we remained stymied. 
   I regret that Congress did not complete its necessary work on the required appropriations bills before the beginning of the new fiscal year. We are again requiring the Government to exist from continuing resolution to continuing resolution. Along with the American people, I hope that we will complete our work before too much longer.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very pleased the Senate is poised to pass legislation to increase the number of H-1B visas. The bill that we will pass today is the result of long negotiations. It is significantly improved from  the version reported from the Judiciary Committee earlier this year. 
   This is an important step that will allow American employers to compensate for the current shortage in highly skilled employees by hiring such employees from abroad. 
   Thanks to the efforts of Senators KENNEDY, LIEBERMAN, FEINSTEIN, and others, this bill also includes strong education and worker training components. That is going to help American workers and students to erase the skills shortage. 
   No one on this side of the aisle sees H-1B visas as a permanent solution. It is a stopgap until our renewed commitment to education and training pays dividends. I would like to thank all of those in the corporate world who have supported our efforts on education and training. 
   Although I am happy about the passage of this bill, I am somewhat disappointed in the severe way in which debate on this bill was restricted. 
   I had hoped that our consideration of this bill would allow us to achieve other crucially important immigration goals that have been neglected by the majority throughout this Congress. 
   I had hoped that the Republican majority could agree to at least vote on, if not vote for, limited proposals designed to protect Latino families and other immigrant families. 
   I had hoped that the majority would consider proposals to restore the due process that was taken away from immigrants by the immigration legislation that Congress passed in 1996. 
   I thought we could work together to restore some of America's lost luster on immigration issues. That did not happen. 
   Still, we did have a vote on the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act that showed where the Senate stood on issues of extreme importance to the Hispanic community, Eastern Europeans, and the Liberians. On that vote, regrettably, every Republican voted no. They refused to even consider the amendment. We should have had a vote. Senators should have the political courage to either vote for it, or vote against it. 
   I hope my Republican colleagues have the chance to reevaluate their position. The President has said he wants Congress to address these issues before we adjourn. Many Democratic Members of Congress and I join him in that view, and we will continue to work to see that this Congress addresses the real needs of real people, whether they be native-born or immigrant. 
   Both my mother and my wife are first-generation Americans. I think if Congress had taken some of the attitudes toward immigration that some take today when their families were seeking to enter the United States, neither might be in this country. 
   I agree that we need to increase the number of H-1B visas. The stunning economic growth we have experienced in the past eight years has led to worker shortages in certain key areas of our economy, and I have been involved in promoting efforts to ease those shortages. Last year, I cosponsored the HITEC Act, S. 1645, legislation that Senator ROBB has introduced that would create a new visa that would be available to companies looking to hire recent foreign graduates of U.S. master's and doctoral programs in math, science, engineering, or computer science. 
   Although S. 2045 uses a broader approach, the goals are similar. Allowing workers with specialized skills to come to the U.S. and work for 6-year periods, as the H-1B visa does, helps to alleviate worker shortage. In the recently ended fiscal year, 115,000 such visas were available, and they ran out well before the fiscal year ended. That is why we have to change the law now. 
   If we do not change the law, there will actually be fewer visas available in fiscal year 2001, as the cap drops to 107,500. This will simply be insufficient to allow America's employers--particularly in the information technology industry--to maintain their current rates of growth. As such, I think that we need to increase the number of available visas dramatically. The bill we will vote on today accomplishes that goal, increasing the number of visas to 195,000 for FY 2001. It also contains a provision that will allow educational institutions to use H-1B visas without counting against the cap, which will greatly help our colleges and universities, which are often on a different hiring schedule than our nation's other employers and have been shut out in the past from obtaining needed visas. 
   Of course, H-1B visas are not a long-term answer to the current mismatch between the demands of the high-tech industry and the supply of workers with technical skills. Although I believe that there is a labor shortage in certain areas of our economy, I do not believe that we should accept that circumstance as an unchangeable fact of life. We need to make a greater effort to give our children the education they need to compete in an increasingly technology-oriented economy, and offer adults the training they need to refashion their careers to suit the changes in our economy. This bill takes significant steps to improve our education and training programs. Since employers pay a $500 fee for a visa, increasing the number of visas will lead to an increase in revenue generated for worker training programs, scholarships for disadvantaged students, and funding for public-private partnerships to improve science and technology education. 
   I also want to note that the legislation extends current law's attestation requirements. These requirements force employers to certify that they were unable to find qualified Americans to do a job that they have hired a visa recipient to fill. The Labor Department also retains authority under S. 2045 to investigate possible H-1B violations. 
   I continue to believe that we could have passed this 
   legislation many months ago. The Judiciary Committee reported S. 2045 more than six months ago, with my support. During this long stretch of inactivity, it has often appeared that the Republican majority has been more interested in gaining partisan advantage from a delay than in actually making this bill law. The Democratic Leader said repeatedly that he wanted to pass a bill, and that although Democratic members did want the opportunity to offer amendments, he was ready to agree to limit debate on those amendments so that we could conclude all work on this bill in a single day. Those offers were rebuffed again and again by the majority. 
   Months went by in which the Republican majority made no attempt to negotiate with us, time which many members of the majority instead spent trying to blame Democrats for the delay in their bringing this legislation to the floor. At many times, it seemed that the majority was more interested in casting blame upon Democrats than in actually passing legislation. Instead of working in good faith with the minority to bring this bill to the floor, the majority spent its time trying to convince leaders in the information technology industry that the Democratic Party was hostile to this bill, which was always false. Considering that three-quarters of the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee voted for this bill, and that the bill has numerous Democratic cosponsors, including Senator LIEBERMAN, this partisan appeal was not only inappropriate but absurd on its face. 
   I do regret that we have not made more progress on the longstanding proposals that have been combined now under the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. These provisions had been proposed throughout this Congress, and in some cases in previous Congresses. They are solid, pro-family proposals that would reward immigrants who are working and paying taxes in the United States. But the Republican majority--as has been shown repeatedly on the Senate floor over the past week--refused even to consider these proposals, instead branding them as rewards for illegal immigrants. 
   Thankfully, the President has taken action to provide temporary protection for the Liberians who faced imminent return to their conflicted nation, and who would have been protected by the LIFA legislation. It is shameful that the Congress has not taken action on the Liberians' behalf, despite the dogged and dedicated efforts of Senator JACK REED. 
   I am worried about the things we have not done on immigration issues in this Congress. It is a disturbing but increasingly undeniable fact that the interest of the business community has become a prerequisite for immigration  bills to receive attention on the Senate floor. In fact, we are in the final days of the Congress, and this is the first immigration bill to be debated on the floor. Even humanitarian bills with bipartisan backing have been ignored in this Congress, both in the Judiciary Committee and on the floor of the Senate. 
   The majority has shown a similar lack of concern for proposals by Senators to restore the due process protections were removed by the passage of the Antiterrorism Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act 4 years ago. 
   There are still many aspects of those laws that merit our 
   careful review and rethinking, including the inhumane use of expedited removal, which would be sharply reformed by S. 1940, the Refugee Protection Act, which I have introduced with Senator BROWNBACK and our 10 cosponsors. 
   But the Refugee Protection Act has not even received a hearing in the Judiciary Committee, despite my requests as ranking member. This is quite unusual, because every committee I have served upon has honored such requests on the part of the ranking member. When I was chairman, any request made by a ranking member was honored. Indeed, I have never seen anything like this, especially on a bill that has such bipartisan support. 
   The bill addresses the issue of expedited removal, a process under which aliens arriving in the United States can be returned immediately to their native land at the say-so of low-level INS officers. Expedited removal was the subject of a major debate in this Chamber in 1996. The Senate voted to use it only during immigration emergencies. The Senate-passed restriction was removed at probably the most partisan conference committee I have ever witnessed. The Refugee Protection Act is modeled closely on the 1996 amendment. I hope someday we can pass it. We should. 
   As a result of the adoption of expedited removal, we now have a system of removing people arriving here either without proper documentation or with valid documents that INS officers suspect are invalid. This policy ignores the fact that somebody who is fleeing a despotic regime is quite often unable to go in and get a passport from the same regime they are trying to flee, either because of religious persecution or some other type of persecution. The only way to get out of there is with a forged passport. 
   In the limited time that expedited removal has been in operation, we already have numerous stories of valid asylum seekers who were kicked out of country without the opportunity to convince an immigration judge that they faced persecution in their native lands. To provide just one example, a Kosovo Albanian was summarily removed from the United States after the civil war in Kosovo had already made the front pages of America's newspapers. Imagine what happens to such people when they are forced to return to their native lands. 
   I also urge the Senate to take up S. 3120, the Immigrant Fairness Restoration Act, which was introduced by Senators KENNEDY and BOB GRAHAM. This bill would go a long way toward undoing the damage done to due process by the 1996 immigration laws, and the House has already passed related, bipartisan legislation. Among other things, S. 3120 would eliminate the retroactive features of those laws, which have led to the deportation of legal permanent residents who committed relatively minor crimes decades ago. I have sponsored legislation that would at the very least provide due process to those who have served in our Armed Forces, the Fairness for Immigrant Veterans Act, S. 871. This legislation has been endorsed by the American Legion, the Vietnam Veterans of America, and other veterans' groups. The Republican majority has refused to consider even this narrow reform. 
   As important as H-1B visas are for our economy and our nation's employers, this is not the only immigration issue that faces our nation. Although the legislation we are concerned with 
   today is good legislation, it does not test our commitment to the ideals of opportunity and freedom that America has represented at its best. Those tests will apparently be left for another day, or another Congress. 
   In closing, I commend our leaders in this matter: Senator DASCHLE, Senator HARRY REID, Senator KENNEDY, and their able staffs. In particular, I would like to thank Andrea LaRue with Senator DASCHLE, Eddie Ayoob with Senator REID, Esther Olavarria and Melody Barnes with Senator KENNEDY and the Democratic staff of the Immigration Subcommittee, and Tim Lynch with my Judiciary Committee staff. I have not heard thanks from the other side. I thank Senator ABRAHAM and his staff for cooperation in improving the bill and Senator HATCH for allowing the matter finally to proceed to conclusion. I also thank Lee Otis and Stuart Anderson with Senator ABRAHAM and Sharon Prost with Senator HATCH for their hard work on this legislation.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I note that each of the component parts of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act were filed long before July 25. Democratic Senators repeatedly asked for hearings on this proposal, and those requests were repeatedly denied. 
   It is not fair to say that this legislation is neither ``Latino'' nor ``fair.'' If anybody wants to know whether it is something that the Latino community wants and whether the Latino community thinks it is fair, just ask them. They will tell you the Latino fairness bill is supported by the Latino community and it is a fair bill. 
   I do thank my chairman, my close friend, that we are getting this through.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have been scarcely able to hold back the tears listening to my good friend from Utah. I am sure he did not mean to mislead the Senate, but those who might not know the numbers could be misled, not by any intent on the part of the senior Senator from Utah. 
   As he has said himself, we will have confirmed fewer than 40 judges in the last year of President Clinton's term in office. When the Democrats controlled the Senate, in the last year of President Bush's term in office, we confirmed 66. In fact, we were holding hearings right into September and voting on judges up to the last days of the session, confirming judges for President Bush. 
   The distinguished Senator from Utah feels perhaps some have suggested inappropriately that women, minorities, and others take longer going through this body. I point out that the ones who suggested that have been independent bipartisan groups outside the Senate. 
   I have stated over and over, I have never seen or heard a statement expressing--I wonder if the Senator from Utah can stay while I speak; I do not want to say this with him off the floor--I have never once heard him express either a racist or a sexist remark. He has been a close and dear friend of mine for over 20 years. Nor have I ever suggested that anybody on the Senate Judiciary Committee has taken a racist or sexist position, but I am troubled, as I hope he and others would be troubled, by the fact that women and minorities, if they are nominated for judgeships, have taken longer to go through this Republican-controlled Senate than others if they are allowed to go through at all. 
   We talk about Roger Gregory, nominated to the Fourth Circuit. It has been suggested this is a seat that is reserved to North Carolina. That is not so. As pointed out in the Wall Street Journal in a recent letter from the President's Counsel Beth Nolan, this is a vacant seat that has not been allocated to the State of North Carolina and is appropriate for an appointment from Virginia. The distinguished chairman of the committee has said that Senators should work with the White House. In this case, two of the most distinguished Members of the Senate--one a Republican, one a Democrat, JOHN WARNER and CHUCK ROBB--worked very closely with the White House on this Virginia nomination and both support the nomination of Roger Gregory. 
   Senator ROBB strongly urged the White House to appoint Roger Gregory, a highly distinguished African American. Senator WARNER supports him. He has the highest ratings possible from bar associations. But he cannot get confirmed by the Senate; he cannot even get a hearing. 
   I commend what Senator ROBB said on the floor today in support of Roger Gregory. I hope all of us will listen to him. 
   Likewise, I was struck by the remarks of Senator DURBIN of Illinois with respect to the Supreme Court and his support for Michael Reagan to a district court judgeship in Illinois. Senator DURBIN laid out what I have also heard from Republicans and Democrats who support Michael Reagan for that judgeship. Democrats and Republicans were at hearings for him. Democrats and Republicans, ranging across the political spectrum, have spoken to me in support of Michael Reagan. He is supported by both home state Senators, one a Republican and one a Democrat. 
   Senator CARL LEVIN, the distinguished senior Senator from Michigan, one of the most respected voices in this body, spoke of his support for Judge Helene White to the Sixth Circuit and Kathleen McCree Lewis to the Sixth Circuit and how he wished they would be considered. They have been held up and blocked by this Senate. Is the chairman saying that Judge Helene White and Kathleen McCree Lewis do not have the support of their two Senators from Michigan? If that is the case, we ought to know that. I understand that they both have that support. If they don't have the support of a home state Senator, then let's say that. Judge Helene White and Kathleen McCree Lewis are extraordinarily well-qualified women. I wish they would get confirmed. 
   Senator TOM HARKIN, was an extraordinary advocate for Bonnie Campbell. I can't add to what he has said. Senator HARKIN spoke extremely well about Bonnie Campbell and, of course, Bonnie Campbell should be confirmed. Again, going to the test: Did the President work with the Senators from that State. Are we saying that the two Senators from Iowa do not support Bonnie Campbell? My understanding is both of them support her. Why can't she get Committee consideration and a Senate vote? 
   The Senate will move forward on a number of nominees today: Michael Reagan, Susan Ritchie Bolton, Mary Helen Murguia, and James Teilborg. I recommend that all four be confirmed by the Senate. It is unfortunate that this Republican-controlled Senate, is not willing to do for President Bill  Clinton what a Democratic-controlled Senate did for President George Bush, and move people forward. We can talk about the numbers that various Presidents have appointed. Recent Presidents have appointed more judges than George Washington did or Thomas Jefferson or Abraham Lincoln or Teddy Roosevelt. But we are also a much bigger country, and we have a lot more cases and need more judges. In fact, if we passed the judgeship bill the distinguished senior Senator from Utah and I have introduced, the vacancy rate would be well into the teens with over 130 vacancies. 
   We have waited 10 years to authorize new judges, even as this country has expanded over the years and caseloads have grown. The Judicial Conference is asking us to authorize 70 judges. In fact, I strongly urge we pass the judgeship bill before the Presidential election while no one knows who is going to be elected President, and we are looking at what is best for our court system. 
   I am glad to see the Senate moving forward on these three nominees. I expect they will be approved overwhelmingly. They are all well qualified for appointment to the federal courts. 
   Three judicial nominees on the Senate calendar have been cleared by Democrats for action for some time, including two from Arizona and one from Illinois who has been pending the longest of the four. 
   There were Senators who wanted to be heard and have a chance to debate the lack of hearings and the refusal to give hearings to qualified nominees. They have spoken eloquently on behalf of Roger Gregory, Bonnie Campbell and Judge Helene White. They are not seeking to filibuster these nominations and each has agreed to a reasonable time for debate before a vote. 
   The Senator from Arizona is right that there has been a 
   problem with the nomination of James Teilborg, who happens to be a close personal friend of the Senator since their days together back at the University of Arizona Law School. Mr. Teilborg was nominated on July 21 and was afforded a hearing and was reported by the Judiciary Committee within a week. 
   The frustration that many Senators feel with the lack of attention the Committee has shown long-pending judicial nominees has recently boiled over. They wish to be heard; they seek parity and similar treatment for nominees they support. I understand their frustration and have been urging action for some time. This could all have been easily avoided if we were continuing to move judicial nominations like Democrats did in 1992, when we held hearings in September and confirmed 66 judges that presidential election year. 
   Michael Reagan, nominated to be a District Court Judge for the Southern District of Illinois, is a distinguished private attorney in Belleville, Illinois. He graduated from Bradley University in 1976, and St. Louis University Law School in 1980. He has been in private practice for over 20 years, and has been an adjunct professor of law at Belleville Area College and St. Louis University. He also presently serves as an Assistant Public Defender in St. Clair County, Illinois. He enjoys the support of both of his home state Senators. When other nominees to the Illinois federal courts were given hearings and confirmed in June, he was held back. He had likewise been nominated in early May. He was finally included in a hearing in late July and reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee on July 27. He could have been confirmed before the August recess or at any time in September. I am glad that time has finally come. 
   Judge Susan Ritchie Bolton has presided in the Arizona Superior Court for Maricopa County since 1989. She received her undergraduate degree and law degree from the University of Iowa. Following law school she clerked for the Honorable Laurence T. Wren on the Arizona Court of Appeals. She then went into private practice at Shimmel, Hill, Bishop & Bruender. She enjoys the support of both of her home state Senators and received a well-qualified rating from the American Bar Association. She was nominated on July 21, participated in a confirmation hearing on July 25 and was unanimously reported by the Judiciary committee on July 27. She could have been confirmed before the August recess or at any time in September. I am glad the Senate is turning its attention to her nomination and am confident that she will be confirmed to fill the judicial emergency vacancy for which she was nominated. 
   Mary Murguia currently serves as Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys. She also serves as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Arizona. Prior to that, she served as an Assistant District Attorney for the Wyandotte County District Attorney's Office. She earned her undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Kansas. She enjoys the full support of both of her home state Senators. Like Judge Bolton, she was nominated on July 21, received a hearing on July 25 and was unanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee on July 27. She could have been confirmed before the August recess or at any time in 
   September. I know that the Senate will now do the right thing and confirm her to fill the judicial emergency vacancy for which she was nominated. 
   I thank the Majority Leader and commend the Democratic Leader for scheduling the consideration of these judicial nominations. I wish there were many more being considered to fill the 67 current vacancies and eight on the horizon. I wish that we were making progress on the Hatch-Leahy Federal Judgeship Act of 2000, S. 3071, and authorizing the 70 judgeships affected by that legislation as requested by the Judicial Conference. 
   I heard Senator HATCH argue last week that the vacancies on the federal judiciary are ``less than zero''. While I marvel at the audacity of such argument, it moves us no closing to fulfilling our constitutional responsibilities to the federal judiciary. Likewise the notion that the refusal by some to waive the Senate's 2-hour rule in late September somehow preventing the Committee from holding additional confirmation hearings in early September or now is hardly compelling. I wish the Committee and the Senate would have followed the model established in 1992 and continued holding hearings and reporting judicial nominees in August and September. That simply did not happen and despite my requests no additional hearings were held. This year we held about half as many hearings as in 1992. Despite all of our efforts we have been unable to get the Judiciary Committee to consider the nominations of Bonnie Campbell or Allen Snyder or Fred Woocher following their hearings. 
   The debate on judicial nominations over the last several years has included too much delay with respect to too many nominations. The most prominent current examples of that treatment are Judge Helene White, Bonnie Campbell, Roger Gregory, and Enrique Moreno. With respect to these nominations, the Senate has for too long refused to do its constitutional duty and vote. Nominees deserve to be treated with dignity and dispatch--not delayed for two or three or four years. The nomination of Judge White has now been pending for over four years, the longest pending nomination without a hearing in Senate history. 
   Of course it is every Senator's right to vote as he or she sees fit on all matters. But I would hope that in the cases of these long-pending nominations, those who have opposed them will show them the courtesy of using this time to discuss with us any concerns they may have and to explain the basis for their anonymous holds and the Senate's refusals to act. 
   It was only a couple of years ago when the Chief Justice of the United States chastised this Senate for refusing to vote up or down on judicial nominations after a reasonable period for review. 
   This Senate continues to reject his wisdom and, in my view, our duty. 
   It is my hope the Senate will confirm all four district court nominees on the Senate calendar. I know there are Senators who want a chance to debate the lack of hearings and the refusal to give hearings to qualified nominees. I understand that frustration, and it is justifiable, especially as it is not the way the Democrats acted when they controlled the Senate with a Republican President. 
   The nominee from Illinois should have been confirmed some time 
   ago. The nominees from Arizona have zipped through here faster than the Republican leadership has allowed most  judges to go through. When Senators supporting nominations, received months and years before, see newer nominees zip through, they are, of course, frustrated. 
   The Judiciary Committee has reported only three nominees to the court of appeals all year. We have held hearings without even including a nominee to the court of appeals. We have denied a committee vote to two outstanding nominees who have succeeded in getting hearings; namely, Bonnie Campbell and Allen Snyder. You have to understand the frustration of Senators and those outside the Senate who know that Roger Gregory and Helene White and Bonnie Campbell and Kathleen McCree Lewis and others should have been considered by the Judiciary Committee and voted on by the Senate. 
   On September 14, Senators BARBARA MIKULSKI, BARBARA BOXER, BLANCHE LINCOLN, TOM HARKIN, and CARL LEVIN and Representative CAROLYN MALONEY from the other body, highlighted the Senate's failure to act on judicial nominations to the Federal bench. They called on the Senate leadership to consider qualified women before the Congress adjourned. They also discussed the problems of judicial emergencies, the length of time it takes women and people of color to be confirmed, and how the Federal courts do not currently reflect the diversity of our country. I do not recall them or anybody else ascribing motives to those who are holding up these people. Rather, they were saying in a diverse country such as ours, the Federal court should reflect the diversity of our country. 
   They focused on the following women who have been waiting more than 60 days for confirmation: Helene White, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, has been pending more than 1,360 days; Kathleen McCree Lewis, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, has been pending more than 370 days; Bonnie Campbell, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, has been pending more than 215 days; Elena Kagen, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, has been pending for more than 480 days; Lynette Norton, U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, has been pending more than 890 days; Patricia Coan, U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, has been pending more than 500 days; Dolly Gee, U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, has been pending more than 495 days; Rhonda Fields, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, has been pending more than 325 days; and Linda Riegle, U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, has been pending more than 165 days. That is why these Senators and this Member of Congress made the statement we did. 
   Mr. President, am I correct in understanding that under the previous order, we are to recess at 12:30?

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from North Carolina for his comments. Senator EDWARDS has been a friend since he came to this body. I have, at the risk of embarrassing him, stated on a number of occasions on this floor that the Senate was enhanced by his presence here. As a lawyer, I must say that having him here because of his own experience as one of the most outstanding and most recognized trial lawyers in the country, to say nothing about his own State. I think Senators on both sides of the aisle should listen to what he said. 
   He is not a Senator who speaks in the abstract and who simply reads a statement on this. This is a Senator who has spent time in the courts of his State and of the region. He has had active practice in both State courts and Federal courts. He understands the judicial system. 
   He has argued cases at all levels. He has worked with lawyers who have been on his side of an issue and opposed to him. He knows, as does any lawyer who practices law, that no matter how much you might try a case at the trial level, at some point, especially if the stakes are high, that case is going to go up on appeal. It is going to go up on appeal whether you are the plaintiff or the defendant. Whoever loses that case, if it is of significance, will take it up on appeal. 
   I recall the statements made in court when I was trying cases. The judge in chambers would say: OK, we will take it to the jury and let justice be done. Usually the person who had the weaker case said: If that is the case, I will appeal, if justice is done. 
   But the fact of matter is cases become more and more complex and more and more significant to the litigants and to the issues of law. They go up on appeal, and you ought to have a good appellate court. 
   I commend the Senator for what he has said. I hope we will listen to what is needed in that appellate court. 
   We should also note, I suggest, that there is going to be a significant debate tonight in Boston between the two candidates of our two great parties--the Republican and Democratic Parties. Both parties have nominated those we consider to be our best choices. Obviously, I strongly support my friend of over 20 years, AL GORE. But I also know that the Republican Party has nominated a very distinguished Governor, George W. Bush. 
   I mention this because Governor Bush and I, while we disagree on some issues, have one very significant issue on which we agree. He gave a speech awhile back and criticized what has happened in the Senate where confirmations are held up not because somebody votes down a nominee but because they cannot ever get a vote. Governor Bush said: You have the nominee. Hold the hearing. Then, within 60 days, vote them up or vote them down. Don't leave them in limbo. 
   Frankly, that is what we are paid to do in this body. We are paid to vote either yes or no--not vote maybe. 
   When we hold a nominee up by not allowing them a vote and not taking any action one way or the other, we are not only voting ``maybe'' but we are doing a terrible disservice to the man or woman to whom we do this. They have to put their life on hold. They do not know what is going to happen: Are they going to be confirmed, or not? It is not like when any one of us runs for election; we know that on a certain  day the election occurs. 
   We either win or we lose. But we know that on that Tuesday, we are going to know our fate. We won or we lost. 
   These people come here and they never know what may happen. They don't know whether they will have a hearing. And if they have a hearing, they don't know if there will be a vote in committee. And if there is a vote in committee, they don't know whether they will come on the floor. And if they come on the floor, they don't know if they will have a vote because one person hiding in the Cloakroom will say: Don't allow it to come to a vote yet. So they may have 99 Senators voting for them but somebody mysteriously in the background says ``Don't vote,'' and they don't vote. 
   Helene White of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has been pending for 1,360 days. Governor Bush said we ought to have a vote up or down within 60 days. Let's have a vote on Helene White. She has been waiting not 60 days, not 600 days, but 1,360 days. 
   Kathleen McCree Lewis, who has been nominated for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, an outstanding African American woman, who has one of highest ratings of anybody we have ever seen come before the Senate, has been waiting for 370 days. Not the 60 days we talked about, but more than six times the 60 days. Bonnie Campbell, for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, has been spending for more than 215 days. 
   We are debating bringing up the Violence Against Women Act which has been stalled. The Violence Against Women Act has expired. Distinguished Senators on both sides of the aisle are working to bring it up and we cannot bring it up for a vote. 
   I see the distinguished Senator from Delaware and the distinguished Senator from Kansas, both of whom support it on the floor, and we cannot get that up for a vote. 
   We also can't get Bonnie Campbell up, even though she is the Director of the Violence Against Women Office. She supported, worked for and administered the Violence Against Women Act, an act that has seen a dramatic decrease in violence against women. 
   We ought to be standing and applauding Ms. Campbell. She is somebody who shows by her own experience that she can do the things necessary to bring down this scourge of violence against women in our country. Now that she has gone through the vetting process, and found out that she is one of the most qualified people to be a judge of anyone confirmed in the last 20 years, Republican or Democrat, we ought to at least let her have a vote instead of holding her in limbo. 
   Elena Kagan for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has been pending for more than 480 days without a vote; Lynette Norton, for the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, has been pending for more than 890 days; Patricia Coan, for the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, has been pending for more than 500 days; Dolly Gee, for the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California has been pending for more than 495 days; Rhonda C. Fields, for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, has been pending for 325 days; Linda Riegle, for the U.S. District Court of Nevada, has been pending for more than 165 days. 
   Let them have a vote. These women are outstanding. They have 
   demonstrated more than most people who get confirmed in this body, Republican or Democrat, how well qualified they are. At least let them have a vote. If people want to vote against them, vote against them. 
   I will state for the record that I will vote for every one of them. In checking with our side of the aisle, every single Democrat Senator will vote for every one of these women. 
   President Clinton, in remarks before the Michigan Bar Association, recently spoke about the Senate's failure to act upon his judicial nominees, noting his nominees have received more top American Bar Association ratings than those of any President in 40 years. President Clinton, to his credit, has nominated people who have received higher ratings than any President, Democrat or Republican, in 40 years and they still get held up. He said:  
   These people are highly qualified, which leads to only one conclusion, that the appointments process has been politicized in the hope of getting appointees ultimately to the bench who will be more political. That is wrong. It is a denial of justice.  
   President Clinton is right. We should move forward with these nominees. Let them have a vote. Don't do this in the dark of the night holding people up. 
   We are going to have four nominees, three from Arizona which has a desperate situation, where they need Federal judges. My friend from Arizona, Senator KYL, has pointed out, quite rightly, that cases cannot be heard, several cases cannot be heard. He has had experiences as a civil lawyer. He knows how difficult that is. 
   I say as a former prosecutor, when that happens, the criminal cases can't be heard because you don't have enough people on the bench. When that happens, the prosecutor has to start plea bargaining down. He or she has to either get a lighter sentence or has to start dropping charges all over the place because they know they can't get a trial because the judges aren't there. 
   If we are going to be tough on law and order, we have to have the judges there. We cannot just say we are against crime. I am willing to concede that all 100 of us are against crime. But if we are going to fight crime, we have to have the men and women there to do it: the prosecutors, the defense attorneys, and the judges. 
   If we will move those judges through, I will vote for every one of them. But I also point out that they can move through very rapidly, all the judges from the time they were nominated, to the hearings, to the floor. A lot of the other judges discussed today are judicial nominees who have waited and waited and waited and waited and cannot get a vote. 
   It is not too late in the session to move on these nominations. We know that we can make quick progress when we want to do so. The group of nominees being considered tonight include nominations received on a Friday, who had a hearing the next Wednesday and were reported that Thursday, all within a week. In addition, there is the example of a hearing held last month by the Government Affairs Committee on two District of Columbia Superior Court judges, one who was nominated on May 1 and the other who was nominated on June 26. Another example of the ability of the Senate to act is the September 8 confirmation of James E. Baker to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. In addition, there is 
   the examples of Timothy Lewis who was confirmed in waning days of the 1992 session, the last year of a Republican presidential term with a Democratic majority in the Senate. Judge Lewis was confirmed to the Third Circuit on October 8, having only been nominated on September 17 of that year. 
   Of course, the Republican candidate for the presidency has said that nominations should be acted upon within 60 days. Of the 42 judicial nominations currently pending, 37 have been pending from 60 days to 4 years without final action. 
   Let us compare the lack of action this year to what a Democratic majority in the Senate accomplished in 1992 during the last year of a Republican presidential term. The Senate confirmed 11 Court of Appeals nominees during that Republican President's last year in office and a total of 66 judges for that year. This year the Senate is will not reach anywhere near 66 confirmations, not 60, not 50, not even 40. In 1992, the Committee held 15 hearings--twice as many as this Committee has found time to hold this year. In the last 10 weeks of the 1992 session, the Committee held four hearings and all of the nominees who had hearings then were confirmed before adjournment. In the last 10 weeks of the 1992 session, we confirmed 32 judicial nominations. In the last 10 weeks of this year we will be holding no hearings and confirming only four District Court nominees. 
   We still have pending without a hearing qualified nominees like Judge Helene White of Michigan. She has been held hostage for over 45 months without a hearing. She is the record holder for a judicial nominee who has had to wait the longest for a hearing and her wait continues without explanation to this day. 
   We still have pending before the Committee, the nomination of Bonnie Campbell to the Eighth Circuit. Ms Campbell had her hearing last May, but  the Committee refuses to consider her nomination, vote her up or vote her down. Instead, there is the equivalent of an anonymous and unexplained secret hold. Bonnie Campbell is a distinguished lawyer, public servant and law enforcement officer. She was the Attorney General for the State of Iowa and the Director of the Violence Against Women Office at the United States Department of Justice. And she enjoys the support of both of her home State Senators, Senator HARKIN and Senator GRASSLEY. I understand and share Senator HARKIN's frustration and believe that the Senate's failure to act on this highly qualified nominee is without justification. 
   We still have pending without a hearing the nomination of Roger Gregory of Virginia and Judge James Wynn of North Carolina to the Fourth Circuit. Were either of these highly-qualified jurists confirmed by the Senate, we would be finally acting to allow a qualified African American to sit on that Court for the first time. Fifty years has passed since the confirmation of Judge Hastie to the Third Circuit and still there has never been an African-American on the Fourth Circuit in the history of that Circuit. The nomination of Judge James A. Beatty, Jr., was previously sent to us by President Clinton in 1995. That nomination was never considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee or the Senate and was returned to President Clinton without action at the end of 1998. It is time for the Senate to act on a 
   qualified African-American nominee to the Fourth Circuit. It is also time for the Senate to act on the nomination of Kathleen McCree Lewis to be the first African American woman to serve on the Sixth Circuit. President Clinton spoke powerfully about these matters at the NAACP Convention. We should respond not be misunderstanding or mischaracterizing what he said but, instead, by taking action on these well-qualified nominees. 
   I commend Senators ROBB and WARNER, along with Representatives BOBBY SCOTT and JIM CLYBURN, for speaking out last Wednesday to draw attention to the Senate's failure to act upon the nomination of Roger Gregory to fill an emergency vacancy in the Fourth Circuit. As Senator ROBB pointed out, Mr. Gregory has been nominated to fill a vacancy that has existed on the Fourth Circuit for 10 years. While the Court is authorized to have 15 judges, it is operating with only 10 judges today. That means the Court has one-third of its positions vacant. Beth Nolan, the Counsel to the President, recently wrote in the Wall Street Journal:  
   [T]he seat for which Mr. Gregory was nominated has not been filed before, nor allocated to any particular state in the Fourth Circuit. Moreover, Roger Gregory has the strong support of both of his home-state senators (who were indeed consulted prior to nomination). Democratic Sen. Chuck Robb recommended Mr. Gregory to the president and has been working tirelessly on Mr. Gregory's behalf. Republican Sen. John Warner has joined Sen. Robb in requesting that Sen. Hatch give Mr. Gregory a hearing.  
   It is past time for the Judiciary Committee to consider Mr. Gregory's nomination. 
   We still have pending before the Committee the nomination of Enrique Moreno to the Fifth Circuit. He is the latest in a succession of outstanding Hispanic nominees by President Clinton to that Court, but he too is not being considered by the Committee or the Senate. Mr. Moreno succeeded to the nomination of Jorge Rangel on which the Senate refused to act last Congress. These are well-qualified nominees who will add to the capabilities and diversity of those courts. In fact, the Chief Judge of the Fifth Circuit declared that a judicial emergency exists on that court, caused by the number of judicial vacancies, the lack of Senate action on pending nominations, and the overwhelming workload. 
   I remain vigilant regarding the Senate's treatment of nominees who are women or minorities. I have said that I do not regard the Chairman as a biased person. I have also been outspoken in my concern about the manner in which we are failing to consider qualified minority and women nominees over the last several years. From Margaret Morrow, Margaret McKeown and Sonia Sotomayor, through Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, and including Judge James Beatty, Jr., Judge James Wynn, Roger Gregory, Enrique Moreno and all the other qualified women and minority nominees who have been delayed and opposed over the last several years, I have spoken out. 
   The Senate will never remove the blot that occurred last October when the Republican Senators emerged from a Republican Caucus to vote lockstep against Justice Ronnie White to be a Federal District Court Judge in Missouri. At a Missouri Bar Association forum last week, Justice White expressed concern that the rejection of his nominations to a federal judgeship will have 
   a ``chilling effect'' on the desire of young African American lawyers to seek to enter the judiciary. The Senate took the wrong action last October when the Republican caucus rejected Justice White's nomination. 
   At our last Executive Business Session in the Judiciary Committee, the Chairman used some of Senator BIDEN's remarks from a nominations hearing last November to make the point that he is neither racist nor sexist. And I agree. I do not believe that the Chairman is himself for or against a particular nominee based purely on race or gender, though I do understand that the Committee does keep track of such numbers for statistical purposes. But to paraphrase our former Chairman from later on in that Executive Business Session, it would be better for the current Chairman to explain to those of us on this side of the aisle and the public at large why he is not moving on particular nominations. I understand there may be outstanding FBI investigations that he is not at liberty to discuss, but I do not believe any such impediments exist that would prevent the Chairman from telling us why Helene White, Roger Gregory, and Enrique Moreno have not yet had a hearing. 
   There continue to be multiple vacancies on the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, Tenth and District of Columbia Circuits. With 23 current vacancies, our appellate courts have nearly half of the total judicial emergency vacancies in the federal court system. I note that the vacancy rate for our Courts of Appeals is more than 11 percent nationwide. If we were to take into account the additional appellate judgeships included in the Hatch-Leahy Federal Judgeship Act of 2000, a bill that was requested by the Judicial Conference to handle their increased workloads, the vacancy rate would be 16 percent. 
   Also at our last executive business session, my friend from Utah, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said there is and has been no judicial vacancy crisis. That is a bold statement considering there are 67 current vacancies in courts and emergency situations, including the Fifth Circuit. If we pass the bill that has been requested by the nonpartisan judicial conference, we would have another 7 or more judicial vacancies, so we would have over 150 judicial vacancies. 
   The chairman went on to say that since 363 senior judges are now serving in the Federal judiciary the true number of vacancies is ``less than zero.'' While it is true that there are 363 senior judges now serving, it is inaccurate to say that the true number of vacancies is less than zero. 
   I commend the large number of senior judges for coming in to help out and fill in. Some of them are well into their eighties. But that is not the way it should be. Surely, if we didn't have these senior judges, the courts would collapse under the weight of their own caseloads and the extended and extensive vacancies. 
   What we have is a situation where selfless public servants have made a conscious decision to hold off on the rewards of retiring from a job well done to help administer fair and proper justice in our country. Our senior judges should be thanked for their diligent work and dedication. Still, their service does not mean we have fewer vacancies. Indeed, the Judicial Conference has recommended 70 new judgeships in addition to the already existing 67 vacancies. 
   Let's not say the only way that can happen is if people, no matter how old they are, say: I will never retire; I will just keep on showing up and do the best I can. It is the lifeblood of our judiciary to have new judges come in. 
   I regret that the last confirmation hearing for Federal judges held by the Judiciary Committee was in July. In fact, that was the last time the Judiciary Committee reported any nominees to the full Senate. Throughout August,  September, and now the first week in October, there have been no additional hearings held, or even noticed; no executive business meetings have included any judicial nominees on the agenda. 
   I mention that because in 1992, the last year of the Bush administration, we had a Republican President and a Democratic majority in the Senate. We held three confirmation hearings in August and September. We continued to work to confirm judges. 
   How late did we work, even though we have the so-called Thurmond rule which cuts off judicial nominations after about midyear? Do you know how long the Democrat-controlled Senate was confirming judges for a Republican President? 
   Up to and including the very last day of the session; not up to and including 6 months before the session ended. 
   I know there is some frustration. Some Senators have objected to Senate committees continuing to meet on other matters while the Senate is in session. That is partly because the matter is so acute with regard to the numerous vacancies in our court of appeals and the qualified women and men who have been nominated and stalled. 
   The chairman says, and he holds the banner for his party, that Democrats have no grounds to complain. I remind the Senate of the hoops that Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon had to jump through in order to get a vote, including the extraordinary step of overcoming a motion to postpone indefinitely the vote on Marsha Berzon. 
   So I hope we will continue to meet our responsibility to all nominees--men, women, and minorities. As long as the Senate is in session, I am going to urge action. Highly qualified nominees should not be delayed. The Senate should join with the President to confirm well-qualified, diverse, and fair-minded nominees to fulfill the needs of the Federal courts around the country. 
   I see my friend from Arizona on the floor. I have spoken somewhat longer than I suggested to him that I would. I apologize for that, but I hope he will take some comfort from the fact that as I said at the beginning of my talk that I would vote for the nominees from his State, including one who has been a long-time friend of his. I am going to be urging Members on this side to do so. I can say with some certitude, all four will be confirmed. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. I appreciate what my friend from Arizona said. And he is my friend. It has been my experience on the committee, even on issues that start out appearing to be partisan, that the Senator from Arizona has worked hard to remove that sense of partisanship. He and I have joined together on a number of pieces of legislation. I do not think he would object to the description as a conservative Republican and myself as a liberal Democrat, but we have both been pragmatic Senators in getting some very good pieces of legislation through. 
   I mention that because he and I may well share a belief that there have been some times this year when it has become too partisan. I hope after the elections, no matter who is elected President and no matter what the numbers are in the House and the Senate, that a number of Senators who have had the experience of working together across the aisle will start off the year trying to find pieces of legislation we can do that will demonstrate to the country there are many Members of good will in both parties who do want what is best for this country. There will be issues, of course, where there are distinct party differences, but there are so many issues where there is far more unity. I hope we can do 
   that. 
   I thank the Senator for his kind words. I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on July 2, 2000, the people of Mexico elected Vincente Fox, candidate of the National Action Party, to be their President. This election represents a dramatic change and a historic affirmation of democracy in Mexico. The inauguration of Mr. Fox later this year will end 71 years of PRI control of the Mexican Presidency.  
   I want to join other Members of congress in expressing my congratulations to Mr. Fox and the people of Mexico. I also want to commend President Zedillo, whose leadership helped to ensure the freest and fairest election in Mexico's history. 
   Mr. Fox's election has significance far beyond Mexico's borders. It represents an historic opportunity for our two countries to redefine, broaden and strengthen our relationship. 
   It is a relationship that has been burdened by history, and plagued by distrust, arrogance, and misunderstanding. There have been times when it seemed that on issues of hemispheric or international importance Mexico embraced whatever position was the opposite of the United States position, simply because we are the United States. At other times, our country has treated Mexico like a second-class cousin once or twice removed. 
   Problems that can only be solved through cooperation have too often been addressed with fences and sanctions, and self-serving assertions of sovereignty. It is time for a new approach. There is far too much at stake for us to continue down the road of missed opportunities. 
   Mexico is our neighbor, our friend, and our strategic partner. We share a 2,000-mile border. We have strong economic ties, with a two-way annual trade of $174 billion. We have a common interest in combating transnational problems, and we have strong cultural bonds, as more than 20 million people of Mexico descent now live in the United States. 
   At present, there are several issues between the two countries that deserve immediate attention: 
   After more than 6 years, the situation in Chipas remains unresolved. Many innocent lives have been lost and thousands of people are displaced and living in squalor. Tens of thousands of Mexican troops have surrounded the area, which could explode in renewed violence at any time. There is an urgent need to demilitarize the area and embark on an enlightened, sustained, good faith process to address the underlying social, economic, and political issues and resolve this conflict peacefully. 
   Since the implementation of NAFTA, trade between our countries has doubled. While NAFTA has been beneficial for both nations, reports of violations of labor and environmental laws must be more effectively addressed and outstanding trade disputes must be resolved. 
   The Mexican Government has made progress in combating illegal narcotics trafficking by undertaking a number of measures, including firing more than 1400 federal police officers for corruption, cooperating with the FBI last year on an investigation that occurred on Mexican soil, and increasing seizures of illegal narcotics. However, major problems remain and far more needs to be done to reduce narco-trafficking and official corruption in Mexico. 
   Illegal immigration continues to be a major concern for both countries. Although we must be sure that our immigration laws are effectively and fairly enforced, a long-term solution can only be achieved by improving the quality of life in Mexico where half the population--some 50 million people--struggles to survive on $2 per day. 
   With thousands of United States and Mexican citizens traveling back and forth across the border every day, the spread of HIV/AIDS, TB and other infectious diseases is inevitable. These health problems, and shared environmental problems, can only be effectively addressed if we work together. 
   Human rights is another issue of importance to the Mexican people, and to Americans. These are universal rights, and it is very disturbing to read reports by the State Department and respected human rights organizations of widespread torture by Mexican police. It is also unacceptable that American citizens, including priests, some of whom have lived and worked in Mexico for decades, have been summarily deported for as little as being present at a demonstration against excessive force by the Mexican Army. Even when the Inter-American Human Rights Commission rejected the Mexican Government's arguments in these cases, the Mexican Government has refused to change its policy. 
   On August 24, 2000, President-elect Fox came to the United States, where he met with President Clinton and Vice President GORE. During those meetings, Mr. Fox expressed a strong commitment to democracy, economic development, and human rights, and to cooperate with the United States to combat corruption, illicit drug trafficking, and other transnational threats. 
   This bodes well for our future relationship. I hope that we would soon invite President-elect Fox to address a joint session of Congress. This should happen as soon as possible after the 107th convenes in January. Congress has had a major role in shaping United States policy toward Mexico, and we would all benefit from hearing directly from Mr. Fox. It would also give him an opportunity to outline in more detail his proposals to address key issues that affect our relations. 
   Like many Americans I was very encouraged by Vincente Fox's election, and am confident that he will be a strong partner of the United States. I look forward to making the most of this opportunity to strengthen the United States-Mexico relationship.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the joys in living in a State as small as Vermont is that you get to know where all the treasures are. One such treasure is Villa Tragara in Waterbury Center. My family and I have gone there for so many years and have become friends of Tish and Tony DiRuocco.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this bill addresses a critically important issue: the preservation of our visa waiver program. I am a cosponsor of the Senate  version of this bill, and I strongly recommend the passage of H.R. 3767. 
   This legislation will achieve the important goal of making our visa waiver program permanent. We have had a visa waiver pilot project for more than a decade, and it has been a tremendous success in allowing residents of some of our most important allies to travel to the United States for up to 90 days without obtaining a visa, and in allowing American citizens to travel to those countries without visas. Countries must meet a number of requirements to participate in the program, including having extraordinarily low rates of visa refusals. Of course, the visa waiver does not affect the need for international travelers to carry valid passports. 
   The pilot project expired on April 30, and I had sought passage of S. 2367, which is incorporated into the bill we consider today, before that expiration date. Indeed, I encouraged the discharge of this bill from the Judiciary Committee in April so that the Senate could act upon this highly time-sensitive matter. Unfortunately, this bill was instead held hostage to other issues. Fortunately, the Administration extended the program administratively until the end of May, but despite my best efforts we failed to meet that deadline as well. As a result, the program was extended until the end of June, but once again the Senate did not meet the deadline. The Administration then extended the program through July, sparing thousands of American tourists and international business travelers tremendous inconvenience and cost during the busy summer traveling season. Before the August recess, we once again failed to act on this legislation, forcing the Administration to extend it again. It is now well past time to end this charade, pass this bill, and send it back to the House for its final approval. 
   Rather than simply pass another extension of the pilot program, it is time to make this program permanent--it has stood the test of time for well over a decade. In order to address any security concerns about making the program permanent, the requirements placed upon participating countries have been tightened. Indeed, countries wishing to participate in the visa waiver program must meet each of the following four criteria: the participating country must allow U.S. citizens to travel without a visa; the country must have a nonimmigrant refusal rate for B-1/B-2 visitor visas at U.S. consulates that is low, averaging less than 2 percent the previous two full fiscal years, with the refusal rate less than 2.5 percent in either year, or less than 3 percent the previous full fiscal year; the country must already possess or be in the process of developing a machine-readable passport program; and, the Attorney General must conclude that entry into the Visa Waiver Pilot Program will not compromise U.S. law enforcement interests. 
   The visa waiver program provides substantial benefits to both the American tourism industry and to Americans traveling abroad. I urge the Senate to make it permanent. 
   Although I am a strong supporter of the bill, I must speak out against the amendment that has been inserted into the bill by Senator HELMS. This amendment states that under a certain paragraph of this bill, no court will have jurisdiction to review any visa refusal based on race, sex, or disability. It is my understanding that this provision has no practical effect, since affected foreign nationals would not be able to bring such a claim in an American court in the first place. Because it is effectively a dead letter, and because of the importance of the visa waiver program and other amendments to this bill, I have chosen not to assert rights and deny unanimous consent. But this provision is offensive to our legal traditions. I have consistently opposed attempts to strip courts of authority to resolve immigration matters, and I am particularly opposed to such attempts where the stripping is directed specifically toward claims asserting discrimination. Judicial review is a critical part of American law, and we should not be impinging upon it--symbolically or otherwise. 
   Finally, passage of this bill should not be misinterpreted as a signal that this Congress has dealt fairly or adequately with immigration issues. There is still so much to do in the little time we have left, from passing the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act--to dealing with the aftereffects of the immigration legislation this Congress passed in 1996. In particular, I would call again for hearings on S. 1940, the Refugee Protection Act. This is a bill I introduced with Senator BROWNBACK and a number of other Senators that would undo the damage that has been done to our asylum process by the implementation of expedited removal. I believe it, like so many immigration issues that have been ignored for the last 21 months, deserves the attention of this Congress. 
   The amendment (No. 4276) was agreed to.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to once again ask the majority to immediately bring S. 2787, the Violence Against Women Act of 2000, VAWA II, to the floor for a vote. 
   Yesterday the President wrote to the Majority Leader urging passage of VAWA II this week. This is a top priority not only for the Administration but for the Nation. The President wrote: ``The Senate should not delay, and I urge you to pass a freestanding version of the Biden-Hatch VAWA reauthorization bill this week. The women and families whose lives have been scarred by domestic violence deserve nothing less than immediate action by the Congress.'' The President is right. 
   This Tuesday the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act by a vote of 415 to 3. I commend the House for finally acting on this important legislation. Many of us have been urging Senate action on legislation to reauthorize and improve the Violence Against Women Act for months. We have been stymied by the Republican leadership. 
   I also would like to thank my friend Senator JOE BIDEN, for his leadership on this issue. He has been a champion for victims of domestic violence for many years. He was pivotal in the enactment of the Violence Against Women Act almost a decade ago. He has been tireless in his efforts this year. It is time for the Senate to take up S. 2787, review and accept the consensus substitute and move to final passage. It could be done this week--today. Senator BIDEN has offered to proceed on a clean bill within 10 minutes and he is right. 
   I regret to have to remind the Senate that the authorization for the original Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, expires at the end of this week on Saturday, September 30, 2000. This is outrageous. This should be consensus legislation, bipartisan legislation. With a straight up or down vote I have no doubt that our bill will pass overwhelmingly. Playing partisan or political games with this important legislation is the wrong thing to do and this is the wrong time to be playing such games. 
   ``Gotcha'' games have no place in this debate or with this important matter. The Violence Against Women Act II is not leverage or fodder but important legislation with 71 Senate cosponsors. 
   There is and has been no objection on the Democratic side of the aisle to passing VAWA II. Unfortunately, there have been efforts by the majority party to attach this uncontroversial legislation to the ``poison pill'' represented by the version of bankruptcy legislation currently being advanced by Republicans and to other matters. 
   I received today a letter from the Pat Ruess of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund that emphatically makes the point the VAWA is not ``cover'' for other legislation that hurts women. She is right. The bankruptcy bill as the Republicans have designed it is opposed by the National Partnership for Women and Families, the National Women's Law Center, the American Association of University Women and dozens of women's organization across the country. I hope that the rumors of such an effort by the Republican leadership will prove unfounded and that no such cynical pairing will be attempted. It is destined to fail and only delays and distracts the Senate from what we should be doing--passing VAWA II. 
   I believe the Senate can and should pass VAWA II as a clean, stand-alone bill, without further delay. That is what Senator BIDEN urged Tuesday. 
   According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, almost one-third of women murdered each year are killed by a husband or boyfriend. In 1998, women experience about 900,000 violent offenses at the hands of an intimate partner. The only good news about this staggering number is that it is lower than that of previous years when the number of violent offenses was well past 1 million. I have no doubt this drop in the numbers of victims of domestic violence is due to the success of the programs of the Violence Against Women Act. We should be working to lower that number even further by reauthorizing and expanding the programs of VAWA. The country has come too far in fighting this battle against domestic violence to risk losing it because the Senate does not pass VAWA II or someone wanting to score clever, political points for short term partisan gain. 
   There is no reason to make this a political battle. We must act now. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD the President's letter and the September 28 letter from the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund and a September 17, 1999 letter from the National Partnership for Women & Families, National Women's Law Center and other women's advocacy organizations.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to see the Federal Judiciary Protection Act finally being acted on by the Senate today. In the last Congress, I was pleased to cosponsor nearly identical legislation introduced by Senator Gordon SMITH, which unanimously passed the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate but was not acted upon by the House of Representatives. I commend the Senator from Oregon for his continued leadership in protecting our Federal judiciary. 
   Our bipartisan legislation would provide greater protection to Federal judges, law enforcement officers and their families. Specifically, our legislation would: increase the maximum prison term for forcible assaults, resistance, opposition, intimidation or interference with a Federal judge or law enforcement officer from 3 years imprisonment to 8 years; increase the maximum prison term for use of a deadly weapon or infliction of bodily injury against a Federal judge or law enforcement officer from 10 years imprisonment to 20 years; and increase the maximum prison term for threatening murder or kidnaping of a member of the immediate family of a Federal judge or law enforcement officer from 5 years imprisonment to 10 years. It has the support of the Department of Justice, the United States Judicial Conference, the United States Sentencing Commission and the United States Marshal Service. 
   It is most troubling that the greatest democracy in the world needs this legislation to protect the hard working men and women who serve in our Federal judiciary and other law enforcement agencies. But, unfortunately, we are seeing more violence and threats of violence against officials of our Federal government. 
   For example, a courtroom in Urbana, Illinois was firebombed last year, apparently by a disgruntled litigant. This  follows the horrible tragedy of the bombing of the federal office building in Oklahoma City in 1995. In my home state during the summer of 1997, a Vermont border patrol officer, John Pfeiffer, was seriously wounded by Carl Drega, during a shootout with Vermont and New Hampshire law enforcement officers in which Drega lost his life. Earlier that day, Drega shot and killed two state troopers and a local judge in New Hampshire. Apparently, Drega was bent on settling a grudge against the judge who had ruled against him in a land dispute. 
   I had a chance to visit John Pfeiffer in the hospital and met his wife and young daughter. Thankfully, Agent Pfeiffer has returned to work along the Vermont border. As a federal law enforcement officer, Agent Pfeiffer and his family will receive greater protection under our bill. 
   There is, of course, no excuse or justification for someone taking the law into their own hands and attacking or threatening a judge or law enforcement officer. Still, the U.S. Marshal Service is concerned with more and more threats of harm to our judges and law enforcement officers. 
   The extreme rhetoric that some have used in the past to attack the judiciary only feeds into this hysteria. For example, one of the Republican leaders in the House of Representatives has been quoted as saying: ``The judges need to be intimidated,'' and if they do not behave, ``we're going to go after them in a big way.'' I know that this official did not intend to encourage violence against any Federal official, but this extreme rhetoric only serves to degrade Federal judges in the eyes of the public. 
   Let none of us in the Congress contribute to the atmosphere of hate and violence. Let us treat the judicial branch and those who serve within it with the respect that is essential to preserving its public standing. 
   We have the greatest judicial system in the world, the envy of people around the globe who are struggling for freedom. It is the independence of our third, co-equal branch of government that gives it the ability to act fairly and impartially. It is our judiciary that has for so long protected our fundamental rights and freedoms and served as a necessary check on overreaching by the other two branches, those more susceptible to the gusts of the political winds of the moment. 
   We are fortunate to have dedicated women and men throughout the Federal Judiciary and law enforcement in this country who do a tremendous job under difficult circumstances. They are examples of the hard-working public servants that make up the federal government, who are too often maligned and unfairly disparaged. It is unfortunate that it takes acts or threats of violence to put a human face on the Federal Judiciary and other law enforcement officials, to remind everyone that these are people with children and parents and cousins and friends. They deserve our respect and our protection. 
   I urge the House of Representatives to pass the Federal Judiciary Protection Act and look forward to its swift enactment into law.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday I was amazed when I checked my computer, as I do during the day, to see what the latest news items were in our country and around the world. I learned of another tragic incident of school violence in a middle school in New Orleans. Just before noon yesterday, two teenaged boys, age 13 and 15, shot each other with the same gun during a fight just outside the cafeteria at the Carter G. Woodson Middle School. Hundreds of students were inside eating lunch. Both boys are in critical condition. 
   The growing list of schoolyard violence by children in Arkansas, Washington, Oregon, Tennessee, California, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Mississippi, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Florida, and now Louisiana is simply unacceptable and intolerable. 
   Over a year ago, May 20, 1999, this Senate passed the Hatch-Leahy juvenile crime bill by a vote of 73-25. It had a number of things that would address school violence, a number of things that would help with the problems of teenage violence, that would create everything from mentoring programs to the prosecution of juvenile delinquents, and it passed overwhelmingly, with Republicans and Democrats alike voting for it. 
   But we never had a real conference on it. It was stalled. Why? Because the gun lobbies told the Republican leadership that there was one minor problem, one minor bit of gun control--closing the gun show loophole, something that allows people to sell firearms to felons out of the back of a pickup truck at a flea market. One would think everyone would want to close that gun loophole and say everyone will abide by the same rules that the regular gun shops in Vermont or anywhere else have to follow; but, instead, because the gun lobby doesn't want that simple loophole closed, we haven't gone forward with a vote on this juvenile justice bill that goes into so many other areas--helping troubled teens, helping prosecutors, courts, and others with teenage violence. 
   How many shootings do we have to have before the leadership, the Republican leadership, says we will stand up to the gun lobby and actually have a vote? If this Senate wants to vote against it, let it vote against it. I don't know why the Republicans are so concerned. They have a majority. They can vote against this bill if they want. But vote. Vote ``aye'' or vote ``nay.'' We are not paid to vote ``maybe.'' We are paid to vote up or down. We should do it. 
   It has been more than 15 months since the Senate acted. It has been more than a year since the only meeting of the House-Senate conference committee on the Hatch-Leahy juvenile crime bill. It was on August 5, 1999 that Chairman HATCH convened the conference for the limited purpose of opening statements. I am disappointed that the Republican majority continues to refuse to reconvene the conference and that for a over a year this Congress has failed to respond to issues of youth violence, school violence and crime prevention. 
   It has been 17 months since the tragedy at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, where 14 students and a teacher lost their lives. Senate and House Democrats have been ready for more than a year to reconvene the juvenile justice conference and work with Republicans to craft an effective juvenile justice conference report, but the Republican majority has adamantly refused to act. 
   On October 20, 1999, all the House and Senate Democratic conferees wrote to Senator HATCH who serves as the Chairman of the juvenile justice conference, and Congressman HYDE, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, to reconvene the conference immediately. 
   In April of this year, Congressman HYDE joined our call for the juvenile justice conference to meet as soon as possible in a letter to Senator HATCH, which was also signed by Congressman CONYERS. 
   Last March, the President invited House and Senate leaders of the conference to the White House to implore us to proceed to the conference and to final enactment of legislation before the anniversary of the Columbine tragedy. 
   This effort to jump-start the stalled conference could not break through the majority's intransigent inaction. That anniversary, like so many others tragic anniversaries has come and gone. We have seen more incidents but no action by the Republican Congress. 
   The Republican majority has rejected the President's pleas for action as they have those of the American people. Every parent, teacher and student in this country is concerned about school violence over the last few years and worried about when the next shooting may occur. They only hope it does not happen at their school or involve their children. 
   We all recognize that there is no single cause and no single legislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our schools or in our streets. But we have had an opportunity before us to do our part and the Republican majority has chosen to squander it. We should have seized this opportunity to act on balanced, effective juvenile justice legislation. 
   I regret that this Republican Congress has failed to do its work and provide the additional resources and reforms that would have been helpful and reassuring to our children, parents, grandparents, teachers and schools.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I regret how little progress we were able to make yesterday on legislation to increase the number of H-1B visas. This legislation was reported from the Judiciary Committee more than a half a year ago. I have advocated that it receive a fair hearing and that the Senate vote to increase the number of H-1B visas. 
   I have also said we should take up other important immigration matters that have been neglected for too long in this body. But those requests have fallen on deaf ears, as yesterday once again demonstrated. Senators DASCHLE and REID have offered to spend only 10 minutes debating immigration amendments. Under those terms, we could complete action on this bill in well under a day. But the majority apparently would rather see this process continue to drag on than take a simple up-or-down vote on matters of critical importance to the Latino community and other immigrant groups. Indeed, this bill has been more strictly controlled than any bill during this Congress. At a certain point one cannot help but ask: What is the majority afraid of? 
   We ought to vote up or down on the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. I don't say this from any parochial interest. We do not have any significant minority ethnic group in Vermont. We are sort of unique in that regard. But all Vermonters, Republican and Democrat alike, believe in fairness. It is a matter of fairness to have the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act voted on. Let us vote it up or vote it down. I will vote for it. I am a cosponsor of it. I strongly support it. 
   The chairman of the Judiciary Committee complained yesterday that the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act was not introduced until July, and that the Democrats were pressing for action on the bill even though it had no hearings. As the chairman must know, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act brings together a number of proposals that have been talked about since the very beginning of this Congress, and in some cases for years before that. Indeed, the current proposal is drawn from S. 1552, S. 1592, and S. 2668. And as the chairman also must recognize, these proposals have been denied hearings in the Judiciary Committee he chairs and the Immigration subcommittee that Senator ABRAHAM chairs. For the chairman to point to the lack of hearings on these proposals as an excuse to derail them reminds me of the person on trial for killing his parents who throws himself on the mercy of the court as an orphan. 
   Meanwhile, I am encouraged by the majority leader's conciliatory words on the substance of the LIFA proposals. According to today's Congress Daily, the majority leader has said that he thought the proposals ``could be wrapped in such a way that I could be for it.'' I hope this signals that he will work with us to find a way to have a vote on these issues. 
   Let me be clear: I support increasing the number of H-1B visas and voted for S. 2045 in the Judiciary Committee. I have hoped that our consideration of this bill would allow us to achieve other crucially important immigration goals that have been neglected by the majority throughout this Congress. I have hoped that the majority could agree to at least vote on--if not vote for--limited proposals designed to protect Latino families and other immigrant families. I have hoped that the majority would consider proposals to restore the due process that was taken away from immigrants by the immigration legislation Congress passed in 1996. In short, I thought we could work together to restore some of America's lost luster on immigration issues. Since the majority has thus far been unwilling to do that, pro-immigration Senators have been faced with a choice between achieving one of our many goals or achieving nothing at all. 
   Like most of my Democratic colleagues, I agree that we need to increase the number of H-1B visas. The stunning economic growth we have experienced in the past eight years has led to worker shortages in certain key areas of our economy. Allowing workers with specialized skills to come to the United States and work for a 6-year period--as an H-1B visa does--helps to alleviate those shortages. In the current fiscal year, 115,000 H-1B visas were available. These visas ran out well before the fiscal year ended. If we do not change the law, there will actually be fewer visas available next year, as the cap drops to 107,500. This will simply be insufficient to allow America's employers--particularly in the information technology industry--to maintain their current rates of growth. As such, I think that we need to increase the number of available visas dramatically. I think that S. 2045 is a valuable starting point, although it can and should be improved through the amendment process. 
   I have been involved in helping to ease America's labor shortage for some time. Last year, I cosponsored the HITEC Act, S. 1645, legislation that Senator ROBB has introduced that would create a new visa that would be available to companies looking to hire recent foreign graduates of U.S. master's and doctoral programs in math, science, engineering, or computer science. I believe that keeping such bright, young graduates in the United States should be the primary purpose of any H-1B legislation we pass. By concentrating on such workers, we can address employers' needs for highly-skilled workers, while also limiting the number of visas that go to foreign workers with less specialized skills. 
   Of course, H-1B visas are not a long-term answer to the current mismatch between the demands of the high-tech industry and the supply of workers with technical skills. Although I believe that there is a labor shortage in certain areas of our economy, I do not  believe that we should accept that circumstance as an unchangeable fact of life. We need to make a greater effort to give our children the education they need to compete in an increasingly technology-oriented economy, and offer our adults the training they need to refashion their careers to suit the changes in our economy. This bill goes part of the way toward improving our education and training programs, but could do better. 
   Although I have said that this is not a perfect bill, there are a few provisions within it that should be retained in any final version. I strongly support the increased portability this legislation offers for visa holders, making it easier for them to change jobs within the United States. And the legislation extends the labor attestation requirements in the bill--which force employers to certify that they were unable to find qualified Americans to do a job that they have hired a visa recipient to fill--as well as the Labor Department's authority to investigate possible H-1B violations. 
   It is regrettable that it has taken so long for us to turn our attention to the H-1B issue. The Judiciary Committee reported S. 2045 more than six months ago. It has taken us a very long time to get from point A to point B, and it has often appeared that the majority has been more interested in gaining partisan advantage from a delay than in actually making this bill law. 
   The Democratic leader has said month after month that we would be willing to accept very strict time limits on debating amendments, and would be willing to conduct the entire debate on S. 2045 in less than a day. Our leader has also consistently said that it is critical that the Senate should take up proposals to provide parity for refugees from right-wing regimes in Central America and to address an issue that has been ignored for far too long--how we should treat undocumented aliens who have lived here for decades, paying taxes and contributing to our economy. These provisions are both contained in the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. I joined in the call for action on H-1B and other critical immigration issues, but our efforts were rebuffed by the majority. 
   Indeed, months went by in which the majority made no attempt to negotiate these differences, time which many members of the majority instead spent trying to blame Democrats for the delay in their bringing this legislation to the floor. At many times, it seemed that the majority was more interested in casting blame upon Democrats than in actually passing legislation. Instead of working in good faith with the minority to bring this bill to the floor, the majority spent its time trying to convince leaders in the information technology industry that the Democratic Party is hostile to this bill and that only Republicans are interested in solving the legitimate employment shortages faced by many sectors of American industry. Considering that three-quarters of the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee voted for this bill, and that the bill has numerous Democratic cosponsors, including Senator LIEBERMAN, this partisan appeal was not only inappropriate but absurd on its face. 
   Finally, a few weeks ago, the majority made a counteroffer that did not provide as many amendments as we would like, but which did allow amendments related to immigration generally. We responded enthusiastically to this proposal, but individual members of the majority objected, and there is still no agreement to allow general immigration amendments. At least some members of the majority are apparently unwilling even to vote on issues that are critical to members of the Latino community. This is deeply unfortunate, and leaves those of us who are concerned about humanitarian immigration issues with an uncomfortable choice. We can either address the legitimate needs of the high-tech industry in the vacuum that the majority has imposed, or we can refuse to proceed on this bill until the majority affords us the opportunity to address other important immigration needs. I still hope that an agreement can be reached with the majority that will allow votes on other important immigration matters as part of our consideration of this bill, but I have little confidence that this will happen. 
   I regret that we will likely be unable to offer other important amendments to this bill. For much of the summer, the majority implied that we were simply using the concerns of Latino voters as a smokescreen to avoid considering S. 2045. Speaking for myself, although I have had reservations about certain aspects of S. 2045, I voted to report it from the Judiciary Committee so that we could move forward in our discussions of the bill. I did not seek to offer immigration amendments on the Senate floor because I wanted to derail S. 2045. Nor did the White House urge Congress to consider other immigration issues as part of the H-1B debate because the President wanted to play politics with this issue, as the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee suggested on the floor a few weeks ago. Rather, the majority's inaction on a range of immigration measures in this Congress forced those of us who were concerned about immigration issues to attempt to raise those issues. Under our current leadership, the opportunity to enact needed change in our immigration laws does not come around very often, to put it mildly. 
   It is a disturbing but increasingly undeniable fact that the interest of the business community has become a prerequisite for immigration bills to receive attention on the Senate floor. In fact, we are now in the week before we are scheduled to adjourn, and this is the first immigration bill to be debated on the floor in this Congress. Even humanitarian bills with bipartisan backing have been ignored in this Congress, both in the Judiciary Committee and on the floor of the Senate. 
   It is particularly upsetting that the majority refuses to vote on the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. This is a bill that I have cosponsored and that offers help to hardworking families who pay taxes and help keep our economy going strong. On two occasions, including last Friday, the minority has moved to proceed to this bill, and the majority has twice objected. In our negotiations with the majority about how S. 2045 would be brought to the floor, we have consistently pressed for the opportunity to vote on the proposals contained within it. But the majority has turned its back on the concerns of Latinos and other immigrants who are treated unfairly by our current immigration laws. 
   The majority has shown a similar lack of concern for proposals by numerous Democratic Senators to restore the due process protections that were removed by the passage of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act 4 years ago. There are still many aspects of those laws that merit our careful review and rethinking, including the inhumane use of expedited removal, which would be sharply limited by the Refugee Protection Act (S. 1940) that I have introduced with Senator BROWNBACK. 
   As important as H-1B visas are for our economy and our Nation's employers, it is not the only immigration issue that faces our Nation. And the legislation we are concerned with today does not test our commitment to the ideals of opportunity and freedom that America has represented at its best. Those tests will apparently be left for another day, or another Congress. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I spoke earlier this month about the continuing problems for Federal law enforcement caused by the so-called McDade law, which was slipped into the omnibus appropriations law at the end of the last Congress. I discussed how the interplay of the McDade law and a recent attorney ethics decision by the Oregon Supreme Court is severely hampering Federal law enforcement efforts in Oregon. Oregon's Federal prosecutors will no longer use federally authorized investigative techniques such as wiretaps and consensual monitoring, and by the end of this week, the FBI will shut down Portland's Innocent Images undercover operation, which targets child pornography and exploitation. This is just the latest example of how the McDade law has impeded important criminal prosecutions, chilled the use of traditional Federal investigative techniques and posed multiple hurdles for Federal prosecutors. 
   Due to my serious concerns about the adverse effects of the McDade law on Federal law enforcement efforts, I introduced S. 855, the Professional Standards for Government Attorneys Act, on April 21, 1999. The Justice Department has called this legislation ``a good approach that addresses the two most significant problems caused by the McDade Amendment--confusion about what rule applies and the issue of contacts with represented parties.'' 
   Since that time, I have conferred with a number of lawmakers from both sides of the aisle about crafting an alternative to the McDade law. Together, we worked out a proposal based on S. 855, which would address the problems that have caused by the McDade law, while adhering to the basic premise of that law-- that the Department of Justice should not have the authority it long claimed either to write its own ethics rules or to exempt its lawyers from the ethics rules adopted by the Federal courts. Based on these discussions, I am filing this substitute amendment to my bill, S. 855. 
   I regret that we have squandered opportunities to move any corrective legislation through the Congress. The consequences of our inaction have been severe, as I have discussed, and it is clear that Federal law enforcement efforts will continue to suffer if we do not act now.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an extraordinary Vermonter, Daniel Dyer. As the world celebrates the end of the twentieth century, Daniel Dyer is celebrating the end of his first century. He has seen history made, but he has also made history of his own. Growing up on a farm in Vermont, Mr. Dyer attended the local school in Albany. His strong academic record afforded him the opportunity to attend Craftsbury Academy--where he performed odd jobs to help defray the cost of his room and board. From there, he moved on to the University of Vermont to study education and agriculture, and graduated in 1924. Since then, Mr. Dyer has given over forty years of dedicated service to the young people of Vermont as a teacher, a coach and a principal. 
   Even after retiring, Mr. Dyer remains active in his community--just last year he was speaking to a classroom of sixth-grade students about his experiences growing up. His contributions to Vermonters were recognized by the University of Vermont when he received awards for Community Service Leadership in 1978 and Distinguished Service in 1988. Today Mr. Dyer is the University's oldest active alumnus and still maintains an amicable relationship with members of the faculty. 
   On November 3, Daniel Dyer will celebrate his one hundredth birthday with friends and family. Of course, this grand event will include his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, all of whom--along with countless other Vermont children--have been touched by this special man.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Windfall Oil Profits for Heating Assistance Act of 2000 is a bit of a mouthful, but let me explain what this does. My legislation imposes a windfall profits adjustment on the oil industry so we can fund heating help for consumers and small business owners across America. 
   Mr. President, while American families have been paying sky-high prices at the gas pump and are bracing for record-high home heating costs this winter, the oil industry is savoring phenomenal profits. Something is wrong when working families are struggling to pay for basic transportation and home heat while Big Oil rakes in obscene amounts of cash by the barrel. 
   Indeed, the overall net income for the 14 major petroleum companies more than doubled in the second quarter of 2000 relative to the second quarter of 1999, to $10.3 billion. 
   In the second quarter of 2000, BP Amoco PLC reported profits of $2.87 billion, Chevron Corporation reported profits of $1.14 billion, Conoco reported profits of $460 million, Exxon Mobil Corporation reported profits of $4.53 billion, Marathon Oil Company reported profits of $367 million, Phillips Petroleum Company reported profits of $439 million, Royal Dutch/Shell Group reported profits of $3.15 billion and Texaco, Inc. reported profits of $641 million. 
   Look at these huge profits. When people in Vermont and New England want to know why they are paying so much extra for home heating oil, pick up the phone and call Texas and ask them how they justify these huge windfall profits. 
   This chart illustrates the phenomenal profits of the oil industry. Keep in mind, these profits came as gasoline prices soared and heating oil stocks fell. The oil industry executives said: It is the people of OPEC. It is not our fault. We love our customers. We are your friends. We wouldn't raise these prices. It is the naughty people overseas. We are not making any money from this. We are sorry you have to pay so much more to commute to work. We are sorry you can't heat your home. 
   In my State, where it can drop down to 20 below zero, this is not a matter of comfort. It is a matter of whether you will live or not. 
   But the oil industry executives say: We are sorry you have to pay so much more. Gee, maybe you should fill up early. Stocks are low. It is not our fault. We are not making anything out of this. We are not making any money out of it. 
   They are liars. They are making money. They are making windfall profits. 
   I have a chart here that illustrates the phenomenal profits of the oil industry for the past year when gasoline prices soared and heating oil stocks fell. Compared to the second quarter of 1999, the profits in the second quarter of 2000 increased 133 percent for BP Amoco, 136 percent for Chevron, 205 percent for Conoco, 123 percent for Exxon Mobil, 208 percent for Marathon, 275 percent for Phillips, 96 percent for Shell and 124 percent for Texaco. 
   Not surprisingly, these multi-million and even multi-billion dollar profits in the second quarter of 2000 for BP Amoco, Chevron, Conoco, Exxon Mobil and Shell were record quarterly profits. 
   These gushering profits are not new for the oil industry in 2000. In the first quarter of 2000, Big Oil also reaped record profits. 
   In the first quarter of 2000, ARCO reported profits of $333 million, BP Amoco reported profits of $2.68 billion, Chevron reported profits of $1.10 billion, Conoco reported profits of $391 million, Exxon Mobil reported profits of $3.35 billion, Phillips reported profits of $250 million, Shell reported profits of $3.13 billion, and Texaco reported profits of $602 million. 
   I have a second chart here that illustrates the phenomenal profits of the oil industry for the first quarter of the past year. Compared to the first quarter of 1999, the profits in the first quarter of 2000 increased 136 percent for ARCO, 296 percent for BP Amoco, 291 percent for Chevron , 371 percent for Conoco, 108 percent for Exxon Mobil, 257 percent for Phillips, 117 percent for Shell and 473 percent for Texaco. 
   Again, these multi-million and multi-billion dollar profits in the first quarter of 2000 for BP Amoco, Conoco, Exxon Mobil and Shell were record quarterly profits. 
   Yet these same oil company executives can tell the people of Vermont, the Northeast and elsewhere: Sorry you have to pay so much more for your gasoline. Sorry you have to pay so much more for your home heating oil. It is not our fault. We are not making any profits. It is those mean people in the Middle East. 
   Man, what hypocrisy. 
   Somebody once said, in Vermont: We will rely on the facts. Vermonters are not fooled by this. But how frustrating it is for all of us, how frustrating it is for middle America, to pay these bills, feeling they are helpless. Because the fact comes down, in our State, in an extraordinarily cold winter, we have to have heat. The fact comes down, when men and women have to go to work and they have to commute, they have to pay the price of going there. Everybody expects to pay what it costs to live. But they do not expect to have to pay windfall profits for a cartel of companies. 
   Big Oil reaped record profits while American consumers and small business owners dug deeper into their pockets to pay for soaring gasoline prices. And more record profits for Big Oil at the expense of consumers and small business owners are expected this winter when heating costs go through the roof. 
   Even more disturbing are the recent press reports that the major oil companies are not using their record profits to boost production and lower future prices, but are instead cutting back on exploration and production. 
   If they were using some of these huge profits to create more fuel, to create more production ability to be able to stave off shortages in the future, I would say let them have the profits because we will all benefit. They are not. They are just pocketing the profits. They are not doing a thing to find new oil, to find new production facilities. 
   Listen to this from a report in yesterday's Wall Street Journal: ``Exploration and production expenditures at the so-called super majors--Exxon Mobil Corp., BP Amoco PLC, and Royal Dutch/Shell Group--fell 20 percent to $6.91 billion in the first six months of the year from a year earlier.......'' Mr. President, that is outrageous. 
   The oil industry is made up of corporations formed under the laws of the United States. These oil industry corporations have a responsibility to the public good as well as their shareholders.  
   To reap record windfall profits and then cut back on exploration and production to further increase future profits is poor corporate citizenship and an abuse of the public trust by these oil industry corporations and their executives. 
   Well I for one have had enough of Big Oil making record profits at the expense of the working families and the small business owners who pay the oil bills, live by the rules and struggle mightily when fuel and heating costs skyrocket. 
   In response to the energy crisis of the 1980s, Congress enacted the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980. This windfall profits tax, which was repealed in 1988, funded low-income fuel assistance and energy and transportation programs. 
   Similar to the early 1980s, American families again face an energy crisis of high prices and record oil company profits. This past June, gasoline prices hit all-time highs across the United States, with a national average of $1.68 a gallon, according to the Energy Information Administration. 
   This winter, the Department of Energy estimates that heating oil inventories are 36 percent lower than last year with heating oil inventories in New England estimated to be 65 percent lower than last year. In my home state of Vermont, energy officials estimate heating oil costs will jump to $1.31 per gallon, up from $1.19 last winter and 80 cents in 1998. 
   Given the oil industry's record windfall profits in the face of this energy crisis, it is time for Congress to act and again limit the windfall profits of Big Oil. 
   The Leahy bill would do just that and dedicate the revenue generated from this windfall profits adjustment to help working families and small business owners with their heating oil costs this winter. 
   If they are not going to put more money into providing more energy for us, then the Windfall Oil Profits For Heating Assistance Act of 2000 would impose a 100 percent assessment on windfall profits from the sale of crude oil. My legislation builds on the current investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, a well deserved investigation into the pricing and profits of the oil industry. 
   My bill requires the Federal Trade Commission to expand this investigation to determine if the oil industry is reaping windfall profits. 
   The revenue collected from windfall oil industry profits, under my legislation, would be dedicated to two separate accounts in the Treasury for the following: 75 percent of the revenues to fund heating assistance programs for consumers such as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), weatherization and other energy efficiency programs; and 25 percent of the revenues to fund heating assistance programs for small business owners. 
   American consumers and small business owners continue to pay sky-high gasoline prices and home heating oil costs are expected to hit an all-time high this winter while U.S. oil corporations reap more record profits. We ought to restore some basic fairness to the marketplace. It is time for Congress to transfer the windfall profits from Big Oil to fund heating oil assistance for working families. 
   If big oil executives say: But we need these profits so we can continue our exploration, we can continue to increase refineries--then let them spend the money for that. If they are actually spending the money for that, it is not a problem. But they want to have it both ways: They want to have a shortage, they want to force up the price, they want to have a windfall profit, and they want to stick it in their pocket and they don't want to do anything to help the consumer. If they are unwilling to help the consumer, the Congress ought to stand up and help the consumer.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of a bill as important as the Immigrant Fairness Restoration Act, which would restore a number of the due process rights that were taken away by the passage in 1996 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) and the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA). With those laws, we turned our back on our historical commitment to immigration and the rule of law. It is long past time to undo the damage that was done then, and this bill provides an excellent foundation for such important change. 
   First, this bill would eliminate the retroactive effects of the 1996 laws. Those laws not only contained new and overly harsh provisions calling for increased deportations for minor offenses, it applied those new provisions retroactively. Under those laws, immigrants who may have committed a crime years before and had since gone on to live productive lives suddenly faced removal from the United States. Some had plead guilty to minor offenses--many of which did not even require jail time--with the understanding that such a plea would have no effect on their immigration status. And that was true at the time. But suddenly, with the passage of this law, they face removal and are not even allowed to apply for relief. They receive no due process, despite the fact that they have American families and legal immigration status. 
   This part of our immigration law simply must be changed. I have previously introduced legislation that would at least provide noncitizen veterans of our Armed Forces the right to due process before being removed for past offenses under these laws--the Fairness to Immigrant Veterans Act (S. 871). This bill has the support of the American Legion, the Vietnam Veterans of America, and other veterans' groups. It is unconscionable that those who served our country would be forced to leave it for a crime they committed 20 years ago, under a different immigration law regime, without even receiving the chance to convince a judge that they deserve the opportunity to stay. But in truth, this country should not treat any immigrant in that way, and I welcome a total eradication of the retroactivity provisions of these laws. 
   The Immigrant Fairness Restoration Act also refines the definition of ``aggravated felony'' that was itself altered in the 1996 legislation. This redefinition will ensure that immigrants who commit relatively minor offenses will not be classified as aggravated felons and precluded from all relief from deportation. Current law is unfair even when it is not applied retroactively, and we must fight to restore the concept of judicial review in our immigration law. The United States has historically been committed to the idea that people should be judged as individuals, and that we are just to impose penalties--whether they be criminal penalties or severe civil measures such as removal--because we have considered them carefully. We must return to that historical commitment. 
   The bill will also return the definition of ``crimes involving moral turpitude'' to the pre-1996 definition of that term. Before the 1996 laws were passed, an immigrant had to have been sentenced to a year in prison for a crime involving moral turpitude to be deportable. Today, any crime that could lead to a sentence of a year--even if a judge decides to impose no sentence whatsoever--qualifies as a crime involving moral turpitude. A one-year prison term requirement makes sense and could prevent great unfairness. Our immigration law should respect the decisions of judges and juries, not seek to undermine them. 
   This bill also touches on an area that I have worked on extensively--expedited removal. Expedited removal allows low-level INS officers with cursory supervision to return people who enter the United States to their home countries without opportunity for review. Although those who say they fear returning are given the opportunity for a credible fear hearing, there is ample evidence that that protection is insufficient to help those who have learned to fear authority in their native lands, or those whose grasp of English is halting or nonexistent. Senator Brownback and I last year introduced S. 1940, the Refugee Protection Act, which would restrict the use of expedited removal to immigration emergencies, as certified by the Attorney General. I have been greatly disappointed that the Judiciary Committee has not scheduled a hearing on this bipartisan bill. I hope that we can still take action in this Congress to resolve this critical human rights issue. Meanwhile, I strongly support this bill's provision to restrict the use of expedited removal to our ports of entry. The INS has recently begun implementing expedited removal inside the United States. I believe an expansion of this program is inappropriate,  considering the bipartisan movement in Congress to reevaluate its existence even at our ports of entry. This bill will limit expedited removal's growth while we continue our efforts to restrict its use altogether. 
   I would also like to note this bill's restoration of the authority of federal courts to review INS decisions. Portions of this authority were stripped in both 1996 bills, a move I opposed at the time and continue to oppose today. Congress should not be in the business of micromanaging the federal docket, especially in politically sensitive areas such as immigration law. We should restore the pre-1996 status quo and give federal courts back the power we improvidently removed in the midst of the anti-immigration movement that seized this Congress. 
   I have highlighted only some of the excellent provisions in this bill today. This legislation also contains good provisions addressing the detention of immigrants, and allowing immigrants who have already been deported under the 1996 laws to reopen their cases. We cannot be content simply to fix these problems while ignoring those who have already been harmed by them. Rather, we must find a way to rectify the situations of those who have been treated unfairly over the last four years. 
   Although it is late in this Congress, there is a real opportunity for action on these issues. The House has already passed bipartisan legislation eliminating some of the retroactive effects of the 1996 laws. That legislation is not comprehensive enough in my view, but it is a good start, and it shows that members on both sides of the aisle are concerned about the effects--perhaps unintended--of those laws. 
   I would like to thank Senator KENNEDY and Senator GRAHAM for their hard and consistent work on these issues. I am happy to be able to join with them and I hope that we can work together to gain attention for this bill, and convince our colleagues and the Administration that these are changes that need to be made this year.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my friend the Senator from Nevada has given me more credit than I deserve, but I do strongly support the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, as just that, a matter of fairness, as something we should do. Whether we have a large immigrant population in our States or not, this is something where Senators are going to reflect the conscience of the Nation, as this body should. 
   My question is this. I was over at one of our latest investigation committee meetings. We tend to investigate rather than legislate in this body. I was at a meeting where the Senate decided to go ahead and investigate the Wen Ho Lee investigation and, thus, hold up the FBI, who were supposed to be debriefing Dr. Wen Ho Lee today under the court agreement. Instead, in the Senate we jumped in, feet first, to interfere with that. I had to be off the floor to serve as Ranking Democrat of Judiciary at that hearing. So I wonder if the Senator from Nevada could explain the parliamentary procedure in which we find ourselves. It seems somewhat of a strange one.

   Mr. LEAHY. On this question, I have been here now with a number of distinguished majority leaders, all of whom have been friends of mine: the Senator from Montana, Mr. Mike Mansfield; the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD; the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Howard Baker; the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Robert Dole; the Senator from Maine, Mr. George Mitchell. During that time, I do not recall a case where a majority leader, even though they have the ability to call up an amendment, has ever done that without giving notice first to the Senator who sponsored the amendment. That is during my now almost 26 years with all these distinguished, both Democratic and Republican, majority leaders. Has it been the experience of the distinguished Democratic deputy leader that if the leader is going to call up another Senator's amendment, that they give the sponsor notice?

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada makes a compelling argument. Consider the extraordinary and, I believe, unprecedented procedure of the majority leader in calling up an amendment of a Democratic Senator who was not consulted. Note that the amendment is the amendment filed just before the amendment that we have been trying to have considered to provide Latino and immigration fairness, the one on which we are being denied consideration or a vote. The amendment on the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act is something we ought to at least have the guts to stand up and vote up or down on and let the Latino population of this country know where we stand. 
   I say to my friend from Nevada, this exercise--to me, at least--appears to be an attempt to keep us from voting on something of significance to this country. Isn't this very similar to what we have seen on the question of judges, where anonymous holds from the Republican side have stopped us from voting up or down on judicial nominations for months and years in some cases; and anonymous holds from the Republican side are currently preventing Senate action on the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization; and anonymous holds from the Republican side have been preventing Senate action on the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, a bill to help fund bulletproof vests to protect our State and local police officers; and anonymous holds on the Republican side have prevented passage of the visa waiver legislation; and anonymous holds on the Republican side are preventing the Senate from passing the Computer Crime Enforcement Act? Is there a pattern here? The majority appears not to want to allow the Senate to either vote for or against these measures. They should at least allow us to vote.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to again urge the Senate to bring up and pass, S. 2787, the Violence Against Women Act of 2000, VAWA II--we are quickly running out of time to reauthorize it. The authorization for the original Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, expires at the end of this week on September 30, 2000. There is absolutely no reason to delay this bill which has overwhelming bipartisan support. 
   I have joined Senators from both sides of the aisle at rallies and press conferences calling for the immediate passage of this legislation. The bill has 70 co-sponsors and is a significant improvement of the highly successful original VAWA which was enacted in 1994. There is no objection on the Democratic side of the aisle to passing VAWA II. Unfortunately, there have been efforts by the majority party to attach this uncontroversial legislation to the ``poison pill'' represented by the version of bankruptcy legislation currently being advanced by Republicans. I do not agree with stall tactics like this one and believe we should pass VAWA II as a stand-alone bill, without further delay. 
   Yesterday, in New Mexico, where he was releasing funding made available through VAWA for one of the country's oldest battered women's shelters, the President made a public plea for Congress to reauthorize VAWA, claiming, ``[T]his is not rocket science. Yes we're close to an election ..... But it is wrong to delay this one more hour. Schedule  the bill for a vote.'' I urge my colleagues to heed the cry of the President as he speaks on behalf of the almost 1 million women around this country who face domestic violence each year. 
   The President called domestic violence ``America's problem'' and I could not agree with him more. When we talk about reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act we are not just talking about a big bureaucratic government program the effects of which we can't really see. With this bill we are talking about reauthorizing critical programs that have had a tremendous immediate effect on how this Nation handles domestic violence and its victims. We are at risk of jeopardizing what has been one of the most effective vehicles for combating domestic violence if we let this law expire. 
   I have heard from countless people in Vermont that have benefitted from grant funding through VAWA programs. VAWA II ensures the success of these crucial programs such as the Rural Domestic Violence Grant program. These grants are designed to make victim services more accessible to women and children living in rural areas. I worked hard to see this funding included in the original VAWA in 1994, and I am proud that its success has merited an increased authorization for funding in VAWA II. Rural Domestic Violence and Child Victimization Enforcement Grants have been utilized by the Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, the Vermont Attorney General's Office, and the Vermont Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services to increase community awareness, to develop cooperative relationships between state child protection agencies and domestic violence programs, to expand existing multi disciplinary task forces to include allied professional groups, and to create local multi-use supervised visitation centers. 
   I witnessed the devastating effects of domestic violence when I was the Vermont State's Attorney for Chittenden County. In those days, long before the passage of the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, there were not support programs and services in place to assist victims of these types of crimes. Today, because of the hard work and dedication of those in Vermont and around the country who work in this field every day, an increasing number of women and children are being aided by services through domestic violence programs and at shelters around the Nation. Lori Hayes, Executive Director of the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services, and Marty Levin, Coordinator of the Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, have been especially instrumental in coordinating VAWA grants in Vermont. 
   Let the Senate pass S. 2787, the Violence Against Women Act 2000 without further delay before its critical programs are jeopardized. It was cleared for passage by all Democratic Senators two months ago and should be passed today. It is past time to reauthorize and build upon the historic programs of the Violence Against Women Act and do all that we can to protect children from the ravages and lasting impact of domestic violence.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today is passing S. 2272, the Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act, SANCA. I strongly support this legislation, which will provide much needed dollars to the Nation's overburdened abuse and neglect courts. We added to their burdens in 1997, by passing the Adoption and Safe Families Act, ASFA, without providing adequate funding to assure effective implementation. Courts nationwide are struggling to meet the accelerated timelines and other requirements of that legislation, which was intended to expedite the process of securing safe, permanent, and loving homes for abused and neglected children. 
   SANCA will help ease the pressure, by making available to State and local courts some Federal funding to assure timely court hearings and reduce the case backlogs created by the ASFA. Both the Conference of Chief Justices and the Conference of State Court Administrators have adopted resolutions in support of SANCA. It is without doubt a good idea. 
   This legislation authorizes $10 million over five years to assist state and local courts to develop and implement automated case tracking systems for abuse and neglect proceeding. It authorizes another $10 million to reduce existing backlogs of abuse and neglect cases, plus $5 million to expand the Court-Appointed Special Advocate, CASA, program in underserved areas. That is a total of $25 million that would help address a very real problem that we in Congress helped to create. 
   In my own State of Vermont, the courts are committed to implementing the ASFA and reducing the amount of time spent by children in foster care settings. But they are having trouble meeting the Federal law's tight deadlines and procedural requirements. 
   My only concern with S. 2272 is the competitive grant method that it adopts for allocating grant money. By contrast, the model for S. 2272--the Court Improvement Project, or CIP--allocates money by formula. Congress created the CIP grant program in 1993, to assist State courts in improving their handling of child abuse and neglect cases. On an annual basis, each State is awarded $85,000, and the remainder of the funds are distributed by formula based on the proportionate population of children in the States. This has been a highly successful program. States have combined CIP funds with State and local dollars to make sweeping changes in the way they handle child abuse and neglect cases. 
   Under SANCA, State and local courts would compete against each other for a relatively small number of grants, and many will get no help at all, even if their needs are great. I understand that there is companion legislation, the ``Training and Knowledge Ensure Children a Risk-Free Environment, TAKE CARE, Act,'' S. 2271, which would authorize increased assistance for every State to help improve the quality and availability of training for judges, attorneys, and volunteers working in the Nation's abuse and neglect courts. That bill was referred to the Committee on Finance, which has yet to consider it. It is my hope that the Senate will take up and pass S. 2271 before the end of this legislative session. 
   Many other important bills remain pending before this body as we head into the final weeks of the 106th Congress. I want to highlight one bill, which I introduced with Senators DEWINE and ROBB this summer, and which the Judiciary Committee reported by unanimous consent last week. The Computer Crime Enforcement Act, S. 1314, would authorize a $25 million Department of Justice grant program to help states prevent and prosecute computer crime. Grants under our bipartisan bill may be used to provide education, training, and enforcement programs for local law enforcement officers and prosecutors in the rapidly growing field of computer criminal justice. Our legislation has been endorsed by the Information Technology Association of America and Fraternal Order of Police. I hope all Senators can join us in our bipartisan effort to provide our state and local partners in crime fighting with the resources they need in the battle against computer crime. 
   I commend Senator DEWINE and Senator ROCKEFELLER for their leadership on the SANCA legislation and urge its speedy passage into law.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to speak today about the provisions in H.R. 4365--which passed the Senate on Friday, that address our Nation's growing problems with methamphetamines and ecstasy and other club drugs. I am happy to have worked with Senator HARKIN and Senator BIDEN to ensure that these provisions could be included in the conference report. Indeed, Senator HARKIN has worked tirelessly to address this issue, and I commend him for his efforts; without his involvement, this legislation would not have passed. 
   I believe that the methamphetamine provisions in this report embody the best elements of S. 486, which the Senate passed last year, while casting aside the more ill-advised ideas in that legislation. The manufacture and distribution of methamphetamines and amphetamines is an increasingly serious problem, and the provisions we have retained in this legislation will provide significant additional resources for both law enforcement and treatment. In addition to creating tougher penalties for those who manufacture and distribute illicit drugs, this bill allocates additional funding to assist local law enforcement, allows for the hiring of new DEA agents, and increases research, training and prevention efforts. This is a good and comprehensive approach to deal with methamphetamines in our local communities. 
   Meanwhile, we have not included in this legislation the provision in S. 486 that would have allowed law enforcement to conduct physical searches and seizures without the existing notice requirement, a serious curtailment of the civil liberties that Americans have come to expect. It would have also amended the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure so that Rule 41(d)'s requirements concerning the notice, inventory, and return of seized property would only apply to tangible property, thus exempting the contents of individuals' computers from the property protections provided to American citizens under current law. I worked hard to make sure that that provision did not become law, and I had effective and dedicated allies on both sides of the aisle in the House of Representatives. Indeed, the methamphetamine legislation approved by the House Judiciary Committee did not include this provision. 
   We have also not included those provisions from S. 486 that concerned advertising and the distribution of information about methamphetamines. Both of those provisions raised First Amendment concerns, and I believe the legislation is stronger without them. Once again, the House Judiciary Committee acted wisely, leaving those provisions out of its meth legislation. 
   The meth bill has taken a lengthy path from introduction to passage, and I believe it has been improved at each step. For example, we significantly improved this bill during committee considerations. As the comprehensive substitute for the original bill was being drafted, I had three primary reservations: First, earlier versions of the bill imposed numerous mandatory minimums. I continue to believe that mandatory minimums are generally an inappropriate tool in our critically important national fight against drugs. Simply imposing or increasing mandatory 
   minimums subverts the more considered process Congress set up in the Sentencing Commission. The Federal Sentencing Guidelines already provide a comprehensive mechanism to equalize sentences among persons convicted of the same or similar crime, while allowing judges the discretion they need to give appropriate weight to individual circumstances. 
   The Sentencing Commission goes through an extraordinary process to set sentence levels. For example, pursuant to our 1996 anti-methamphetamine law, the Sentencing Commission increased meth penalties after careful analysis of recent sentencing data, a study of the offenses, and information from the DEA on trafficking levels, dosage unit size, price and drug quantity. Increasing mandatory minimums takes sentencing discretion away from judges. We closely examine judges' backgrounds before they are confirmed and should let them do their jobs. 
   Mandatory minimums also impose significant economic and social costs. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the annual cost of housing a federal inmate ranges from $16,745 per year for minimum security inmates to $23,286 per year for inmates in high security facilities. It is critical that we take steps that will effectively deter crime, but we should not ignore the costs of the one size fits all approach of mandatory minimums. We also cannot ignore the policy implications of the boom in our prison population. In 1970, the total population in the federal prison system was 20,686 prisoners, of  whom 16.3 percent were drug offenders. By 1997, the federal prison population had grown to almost 91,000 sentenced prisoners, approximately 60 percent of whom were sentenced for drug offenses. The cost of supporting this expanded federal criminal justice system is staggering. We ignore at our peril the findings of RAND's comprehensive 1997 report on mandatory minimum drug sentences: ``Mandatory minimums are not justifiable on the basis of cost-effectiveness at reducing cocaine consumption, cocaine expenditures, or drug-related crime.'' 
   This is why I have repeatedly expressed my concerns about creating new mandatory minimum penalties, including in the last Congress, when another anti-methamphetamine bill was before the Judiciary Committee. 
   Second, earlier drafts of this bill would have contravened the Supreme Court's 1999 decision in Richardson versus U.S. I, along with some other members of the Committee, believed that it would be inappropriate to take such a step without first holding a hearing and giving thorough consideration to such a change in the law. The Chairman of the Committee, Senator HATCH, was sensitive to this concern and he agreed to remove that provision from this legislation. 
   Third, an earlier version of the bill contained a provision that would have created a rebuttable presumption that may have violated the Constitution's Due Process Clause. Again, I believed that we needed to seriously consider and debate such a provision before voting on it. And again, the Chairman was sensitive to the concerns of some of us on the Committee and agreed to remove that provision. 
   The SAMHSA authorization bill also dealt with ecstasy and other so-called ``club drugs.'' Ecstasy is steadily growing in popularity, especially among younger Americans. It is perceived by many young people as being harmless, but medical studies are beginning to show that it can have serious long-term effects on users. This bill asks the Sentencing Commission to look at our current sentencing guidelines for those who manufacture, import, export, or traffic ecstasy, and to provide for increased penalties as it finds appropriate. It also authorizes $10 million for prevention efforts. These efforts are particularly crucial with new drugs like ecstasy, so that our young people can learn the true consequences of use. 
   This legislation took a tough approach to drugs without taking the easy way out of mandatory minimums, and without undue Congressional interference with the Sentencing Commission. I hope that any future efforts we must take to address our drug problem will use these provisions as a model.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to thank my distinguished colleagues, Senators Baucus and SMITH, for their hard work on the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. I am especially grateful for their inclusion of a provision in this bill that will ultimately expand the successful federal, state, and local partnerships restoring the highest water quality in the Lake Champlain watershed. 
   One project that we could not come to full agreement on before this bill's passage, however, was authorization for the repair of the Waterbury Dam. Our lack of final language was in a large part due to the absence of a final Dam Safety Assurance Program Evaluation Report from the Army Corps of Engineers, a final draft of which was sent to ACE Headquarters for review on August 24, 2000. 
   The Waterbury Dam was built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1935 and holds 1.23 billion cubic feet of water in its reservoir. Were the dam to fail, this volume of water would ultimately submerge and destroy the entire corridor of cities and towns downstream in the Winooski River valley. Thousands of lives would be lost. Hundreds of thousands of acres would be completely devastated. 
   Unfortunately, increasingly serious cracks and seepage in Waterbury Dam's structure were recently discovered and have heightened concerns that the dam could, in fact, fail. The State of Vermont and the Army Corps went into action and drew down the water level to alleviate pressure on the dam. The Corps carried out an assessment this summer to further characterize immediate repair needs. There is strong evidence that these cracks are, in fact, the result of initial design flaws and the Corps work today follows two previous instances--one in 1956-8 and one in 1985--when the Army Corps of Engineers had full authority to make needed dam modifications. 
   I understand that the Army Corps of Engineers is expediting the review of the Dam Safety Assurance Report for the Waterbury Dam. I am grateful to Senators SMITH and BAUCUS for their understanding that the final report may contain important information relevant for authorization of the project. 
   I look forward to working with my distinguished colleagues, Senators SMITH and BAUCUS, once the report is finalized and is able to guide our plans for Waterbury Dam repair.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I regret to report to the Senate that the last confirmation hearing for federal judges held by the Judiciary Committee was in July. Throughout August and now into the third week in September, there have been no additional hearings held or even noticed. By contrast, in 1992, the last year of the Bush Administration, a Democratic majority in the Senate held three confirmation hearings in August and September and continued to work to confirm judges up to and including the last day of the session. 
   I also regret that the Judiciary Committee's inaction on judicial nominations has led to Senators object to Senate committees continuing to meet on other matters when the Senate is in session. The matter is most acute with regard to the numerous vacancies on our Courts of Appeals and the qualified women and men who have been stalled before this Committee. 
   This Judiciary Committee has reported only 3 nominees to the Courts of Appeals all year. We have held hearings without even including a nominee to the Courts of Appeals and denied a Committee vote to two outstanding nominees who succeeded in getting hearings. I certainly understand the frustration of those Senators who know that Roger Gregory, Helene White, Bonnie Campell and others should be considered by this Committee and voted on by the Senate without additional delay. 
   Currently there remain more judiciary vacancies than there were when Congress adjourned in 1995. We have not even kept up with attrition over that last 5 years. Earlier this week, Senator HATCH joined with me and a dozen other Senators to introduce the Federal Judgeship Act of 2000. That legislation incorporates recommendations of the Judicial Conference of the United States to authorize 70 judgeships in addition to the 64 current vacancies within the federal judiciary. If those additional judgeships were taken into account, the so-called ``vacancy rate'' would be over 13 percent with over 130 vacancies. 
   We can make quick progress when we want to do so. The last group of nominees considered by the Judiciary Committee included three who were nominated on a Friday, had their hearing the next week and were approved and reported to the Senate within 6 days. 
   By contrast, we still have pending without a hearing qualified nominees like Judge Helene White of Michigan. She has been held hostage for over 45 months without a hearing. She is the record holder for a judicial nominee who has had to wait the longest for a hearing and her wait continues without explanation to this day. 
   We still have pending before the Committee, the nomination of Bonnie Campbell to the Eighth Circuit. Ms. Campbell had her hearing last May, but the Committee refuses to consider her nomination, vote her up or vote her down. Instead, there is the equivalent of an anonymous and unexplained secret hold. Bonnie Campbell is a distinguished lawyer, public servant and law enforcement officer. She was the Attorney General for the State of Iowa and the Director of the Violence Against Women Office at the United States Department of Justice. And she enjoys the full support of both of her home State Senators, Senator HARKIN and Senator GRASSLEY. I commend Senator HARKIN for his remarks on Ms. Campbell's nomination earlier today. I understand his frustration and believe that this Senate's failure to act on this highly qualified nominee is without justification. 
   We still have pending without a hearing the nomination of Roger Gregory of Virginia and Judge James Wynn of North Carolina to the Fourth Circuit. Were either of these highly-qualified jurists confirmed by the Senate, we would be finally acting to allow a qualified African American to sit on that Court for the first time. We still have pending before the Committee the nomination of Enrique Moreno to the Fifth Circuit. He is the latest in a succession of outstanding Hispanic nominees by President Clinton to that Court, but he too is not being considered by the Committee or the Senate.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to urge the majority to lift its hold on H.R. 3767, which would permanently authorize the visa waiver pilot  program. I am a cosponsor of the Senate version of this legislation, which will achieve the important goal of making our visa waiver program permanent. We have had a visa waiver pilot project for more than a decade, and it has been a tremendous success in allowing residents of some of our most important allies to travel to the United States for up to 90 days without obtaining a visa, and in allowing American citizens to travel to those countries without visas. Countries must meet a number of requirements to participate in the program, including having extraordinarily low rates of visa refusals. Of course, the visa waiver does not affect the need for international travelers to carry valid passports. 
   The visa waiver pilot program expired on April 30. The House passed legislation to make the program permanent before that deadline. But the Senate failed to meet this deadline, and the Administration was forced to extend it administratively. Since then, the Senate has missed deadline after deadline, and has had to rely on the grace of the Administration for this program--which is relied upon by thousands of American travelers every year--to continue. 
   Every Democratic Senator has cleared this bill. But the majority has refused to clear it, even five months after it passed the House and the statutory authorization for this program expired. Earlier in the year, some members had substantive concerns about the bill. Those have been rectified. I am unaware of any remaining substantive objections to this legislation, and it is now well past time to pass it. Passing it will not require any floor debate or roll call vote. It simply requires Senators to life their holds. 
   This is a bill that benefits American travelers from every State and the tourism industry in every State. It is not a Democratic bill or a Republican bill. It is not a regional bill. It is simply a good, common-sense bill that deserves the Senate's support. There has been too much stalling on this bill already--we should act today.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I applaud what the distinguished Senator from Illinois has said. He, of course, has worked so long on both the H-1B visas issue and the immigration issues included in the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. I know of nobody who spends more time on these issues than he does. I am proud to be here with him, and I invite him to return to these issues as we proceed in this debate.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are finally turning our attention to this legislation and a debate over the best way to increase the number of H-1B visas, a policy goal that is shared widely in this body. The bill was reported from the Judiciary Committee more than six months ago. It has taken us a very long time to get from Point A to Point B, and it has often appeared that the majority has been more interested in gaining partisan advantage from a delay than in actually making this bill law. 
   The Democratic Leader has consistently said that we would be willing to accept very strict time limits on debating amendments, and would be willing to conduct the entire debate on S. 2045 in less than a day. Our Leader has also consistently said that it is critical that the Senate take up proposals to provide parity for refugees from right-wing regimes in Central America and to address an issue that has been ignored for far too long--how we should treat undocumented aliens who have lived here for decades, paying taxes and contributing to our economy. I joined in the call for action on H-1B and other critical immigration issues, but our efforts were rebuffed by the majority.  
   Indeed, months went by in which the majority made no attempt to negotiate these differences, time which many members of the majority instead spent trying to blame Democrats for the delay in their bringing this legislation to the floor. At many times, it seemed that the majority was more interested in casting blame upon Democrats than in actually passing legislation. Instead of working in good faith with the minority to bring this bill to the floor, the majority spent its time trying to convince leaders in the information technology industry that the Democratic Party is hostile to this bill and that only Republicans are interested in solving the legitimate employment shortages faced by many sectors of American industry. Considering that three-quarters of the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee voted for this bill, and that the bill has numerous Democratic cosponsors, including Senator LIEBERMAN, this partisan appeal was not only inappropriate but absurd on its face. 
   Finally, last week, the majority made a counteroffer that did not provide as many amendments as we would like, but which did allow amendments related to immigration generally. We responded enthusiastically to this proposal, but individual members of the majority objected, and there is still no agreement to allow immigration amendments. At least some members of the majority are apparently unwilling even to vote on issues that are critical to members of the Latino community. This is deeply unfortunate, and leaves those of us who are concerned about humanitarian immigration issues with an uncomfortable choice. We can either address the legitimate needs of the high-tech industry in the vacuum that the majority has imposed, or we can refuse to proceed on this bill until the majority affords us the opportunity to address other important immigration needs. I voted yesterday to proceed to S. 2045 because I believe it presents a good starting point for discussion, and because I believe we should make progress on immigration issues in this Congress. I still hope that an agreement can be reached with the majority that will allow votes on 
   other important immigration matters as part of our consideration of this bill. 
   I believe there is a labor shortage in certain areas of our economy, and a short-term increase in H-1B visas is an appropriate response. Due to the stunning economic growth we have experienced in the past eight years, unemployment is lower than the best-case scenario envisioned by most economists. Increasing the number of available H-1B visas is particularly important for the high-tech industry, which has done so much to contribute to our strong economy. Although it is important that the high-tech industry ensure that it is making maximum possible use of American workers, it should also have access to highly-skilled workers from abroad, particularly workers who were educated at American universities. Under current law, however, which allowed for 115,000 visas for FY 2000, every visa was allotted by March, only halfway through the fiscal year. 
   So I support this bill's call for an increase in the number of visas. But I believe the legislation can be improved, and I look forward to the opportunity to make improvements through the amendment process. Most importantly, instead of including an open-ended provision exempting from the cap those foreign workers with graduate degrees from American universities, as S. 2045 does, I believe we should retain a concrete cap on the number of these visas. I believe we should increase the cap to 200,000, and then set aside a significant percentage of those visas for such workers. This should address employers' needs for highly-skilled workers, while also limiting the number of visas that go to foreign workers with less specialized skills. 
   I regret that we will likely be unable to offer other important amendments to this bill. For much of the summer, the majority implied that we were simply using the concerns of Latino voters as a smokescreen to avoid considering S. 2045. Speaking for myself, although I have had reservations about certain aspects of S. 2045, I voted to report it from the Judiciary Committee so that we could move forward in our discussions of the bill. I did not seek to offer immigration amendments on the Senate floor because I wanted to derail S. 2045. Nor did the White House urge Congress to consider other immigration issues as part of the H-1B debate because the President wanted to play politics with this issue, as the distinguished Chairman of the Judiciary Committee suggested on the floor last Friday. Rather, the majority's inaction on a range of immigration measures in this Congress forced those of us who were concerned about immigration issues to attempt to raise those issues. Under our current leadership, the opportunity to enact needed change in our immigration laws does not come around very often, to put it mildly. 
   It is a disturbing but increasingly undeniable fact that the interest of the business community has become a prerequisite for immigration bills to receive attention on the Senate floor. In fact, with only a few weeks remaining before we adjourn, this will be the first immigration bill to be debated on the floor in this Congress. Even humanitarian bills with bipartisan backing have been ignored in this Congress, both in the Judiciary Committee and on the floor of the Senate. 
   The bipartisan bills that have suffered from the majority's neglect include both modest bills designed to assist particular immigrant groups and larger bills designed to reform substantial portions of our immigration and asylum laws. Bills to assist Syrian Jews, Haitians, Nicaraguans, Liberians, Hondurans, Cubans, and Salvadorans all need attention. Bills to restore due process rights and limited public benefits to legal permanent residents have been ignored. 
   The Refugee Protection Act, a bipartisan bill with 10 sponsors that I introduced with Senator BROWNBACK, has not even received a hearing in the Judiciary Committee, despite my request as Ranking Member. The Refugee Protection Act addresses the issue of expedited removal, the process under which aliens arriving in the United States can be returned immediately to their native lands at the say-so of a low-level INS officer. Expedited removal was the subject of a major debate in this Chamber in 1996, and the Senate voted to use it only during immigration emergencies. This Senate-passed restriction was removed in what was probably the most partisan conference committee I have ever witnessed. The Refugee Protection Act is modeled closely on that 1996 amendment, and I hope that it again gains the support of a majority of my colleagues. 
   As a result of the adoption of expedited removal, we now have a system where we are removing people who arrive here either without proper documentation or with facially valid documentation that an INS officer suspects is invalid. This policy ignores the fact that people fleeing despotic regimes are quite often unable to obtain travel documents before they go--they must move quickly and cannot depend upon the government that is persecuting them to provide them with the proper paperwork for departure. In the limited time that expedited removal has been in operation, we already have numerous stories of valid asylum seekers who were kicked out of our country without the opportunity to convince an immigration judge that they faced persecution in their native lands. To provide just one example, a Kosovar Albanian was summarily removed from the U.S. after the civil war in Kosovo had already made the front pages of America's newspapers. 
   The majority has mishandled even those immigration bills that needed to be passed by a date certain to avoid significant humanitarian and diplomatic consequences. First, the Senate failed to pass a bill to make permanent the visa waiver program that allows Americans to travel to numerous other countries without a visa. The visa waiver pilot program expired on April 30, and the House passed legislation to make the program permanent in a timely manner, understanding the importance of not allowing this program--which our citizens and the citizens of many of our closest allies depend upon--to lapse. The Senate, however, simply ignored the deadline and has subsequently ignored numerous deadlines for administrative extensions of the program. 
   Second, the Senate has thus far refused to act on the bipartisan S. 2058, which would extend the deadline by one year for Nicaraguans, Cubans, and Haitians to apply for adjustment of  status under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, NACARA, and the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act, HRIFA. 
   The original deadline expired on March 31. But the Senate did not extend the deadline--an action that the Judiciary Committee unanimously approved--by March 31. And the Senate has not acted to extend the deadline in the intervening five and a half months. No one has expressed any opposition to S. 2058, which counts Senators MACK and HELMS among its sponsors; rather, the majority has simply allowed the bill to sit and fester, perhaps holding it hostage to the passage of S. 2045. As a result, we in the Congress have had to rely upon the Administration's assurances that it would not remove those who would be aided by the extension from the United States while this legislation was pending. As someone who has served for more than 25 years in the Senate, I find it profoundly disturbing that this body must rely on the Administration not to enforce the law because it has taken us so long to actually make good on our intention to change it. We should not need to rely on the good graces of the Administration--we should do our job and legislate. 
   I am well aware that immigration is just one of the many issues that Congress must address. Indeed, there may be some Congresses where immigration needs to be placed on the backburner so that we can address other issues. But this is not such a Congress. It was only four years ago that we passed two bills with far-reaching effects on immigration law--the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. There are still many aspects of those laws that merit our careful review and rethinking. Among many others, Senators KENNEDY, MOYNIHAN, and DURBIN have been actively involved in promoting necessary changes to those laws, in an attempt to rededicate the United States to its historic role as a leader in immigration policy. But their efforts too have been ignored by the majority. 
   When a bill such as S. 2045 comes to the floor, then, those of us who are concerned about immigration legislation would be abdicating our duty not to raise other potential immigration legislation. Most members of both parties want to see a significant increase in the number of H-1B visas. If there had been another avenue to obtain consideration of the rest of our immigration agenda, we would have taken it. But such an avenue was not offered. 
   I voted to proceed to consideration of this bill. I hold out hope that we can reach an agreement to discuss other critical immigration matters. If the majority truly wishes to display compassionate conservatism, and show concern for all Americans, such an agreement should be easy to reach.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let me speak about the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act and why we should consider this bill now. 
   I say this with no ulterior motive. Obviously, if anyone looks at the demographics of Vermont, they know I am not speaking about this because of a significant Hispanic population in the State of Vermont. I speak about it out of a sense of fairness. It is called the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. That is what it is. 
   I am a proud cosponsor of this legislation, not only as a Senator but as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, because it addresses three very important issues to the Latino community. 
   We fought on our side of the aisle consistently to obtain debate and a vote on these proposals either as an amendment or as a freestanding bill. 
   Once again, I call on the leadership to give us either a vote as a freestanding bill or as an amendment because we ought to stand up in the Senate and say how we stand on this issue. If my colleagues on the other side believe in compassionate conservatism, they will allow a vote on this bill, which offers help to hardworking families who pay taxes and help keep our economy strong. 
   First off, this legislation ensures that we treat all people who fled tyranny in Central America equally, regardless of whether the tyrannical regime they fled was a left-wing or right-wing government. 
   I remember going into a refugee camp in Central America and talking to a woman who was there with her one remaining child. Her husband had been killed. Her other children had been killed. 
   I said: Do you ally yourself with the left or the right? She didn't know who was on the left or who was on the right in the forces that were fighting. She only knew that she and her husband had wanted to raise their family and to farm a little land. And yet the forces of the regime came in and killed the whole family with the exception of her and her one child. 
   People who have no political position get caught in terrible circumstances, in between forces to which they have no allegiance. 
   In 1997, Congress granted permanent residence status to Nicaraguans and Cubans who fled dictatorship and who met certain conditions. It may well have been the right step. But others were left behind. 
   It is past time to extend the benefits of the 1997 law to Guatemalans, Salvadorans, Hondurans, and Haitians. To benefit under this bill, an immigrant would have to have been in the United States since December of 1995 and would have to demonstrate good moral character. 
   In addition to the clear humanitarian justifications for treating an immigrant from Guatemala who fled terror in the same way we treat an immigrant from Nicaragua who fled terror, there is also a strong foreign policy justification for this bill. These immigrants send money back to their families. They help support fledgling economies in what remain fragile democracies. The United States has devoted significant effort to assisting democratic 
   efforts in Latin America, and the hard work that Latin American immigrants perform in America helps to stablize the growth of democracy there. 
   Second, this amendment would reinstate section 245(i), which, for a $1,000 fee, allows immigrants on the verge of getting legal permanent residence status to achieve that status from within the United States, instead of being forced to leave their families and their jobs for lengthy periods to be able to complete the process. Section 245(i) was a part of American law until 1997, when Congress failed to renew the provision. There is bipartisan support for correcting this erroneous policy, and now is the time to do it. It is important to note that these are people who already have the right under our laws to obtain permanent residency--this provision simply streamlines that process while contributing a significant amount to the Treasury. Indeed, in the last fiscal year in which section 245(i) was law, it produced $200 million in revenue for the government. At a time when the Immigration and Naturalization Service is plagued by backlogs, that is funding that would be useful. 
   Third, of course, the amendment would allow people who have lived and worked here for 14 years or more, contributing to the American economy, to adjust their immigration status. That has been a part of the immigration law since the 1920s. It has been continually updated. It should be updated now for the first time in 14 years. This will adjust the status of thousands of people already working in the United States, helping both them and their employers to continue playing a role in our current economic boom. These are people who have built deep roots in the United States, who have families here and children who are American citizens, and who have in many cases done jobs that American citizens did not want. We should continue our historical practice and update the registry. 
   This legislation has the strong support of numerous groups representing Hispanic Americans, including the League of United Latin American Citizens, the National Council of La Raza, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. It also has the support of conservative groups such as Americans for Tax Reform and Empower America. It has received union support from the AFL-CIO, the Union of Needletrades and Industrial Textile Employees, and the Service Employees International Union. Religious groups ranging from the U.S. Catholic Conference to the Anti-Defamation League  to Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services have also endorsed the bill. Finally, business organizations including the National Restaurant Association and the American Health Care Association have also encouraged this bill's passage. 
   When we talk about H-1B visas, we are usually talking about giving immigration benefits to people who are going to have high-paying, high-tech jobs. Everybody wants to do that. We worked to get that out of the Judiciary Committee. 
   But I would say to those who are holding up the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, don't think only of people in high-tech, high-paying jobs. Think of the needs of ordinary workers. 
   It seems that the immigration concerns of everyday families 
   have been ignored day after day in this Congress. I am talking about people who are not going to be in executive positions, and who cannot afford lawyers or anything else they want. I am talking about men and women who work for an hourly wage, who try to raise their families, who go to church, who want to see their children go to school, who want to live the American life, the American dream. 
   My grandparents came to this country. They did not speak a word of English. But they raised a family. They raised six children, including my mother. They started a small business. They had a grandson who ended up in the Senate. But they also had six children. They weren't wealthy. My grandfather came here not speaking a word of English, with his brother, and they started a stone shed. Then when they had enough money to afford to send back to Italy for their wives and their children, they did. It was the American dream. People still have that dream. We should help them, especially in this case. 
   There are also important due process issues that need to be fixed if America wants to retain its historic role as a beacon for refugees and a nation of immigrants. But in this Congress, even humanitarian bills with bipartisan backing have been completely ignored, both in the Judiciary Committee and on the Senate floor. The bipartisan bills that have suffered from the majority's neglect include both modest bills designed to assist particular immigrant groups and larger bills designed to reform substantial portions of our immigration and asylum laws. Bills to assist Syrian Jews, Haitians, Nicaraguans, Liberians, Hondurans, Cubans, and Salvadorans all need attention.

   In the limited time we have remaining, I urge the majority to just bring up the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act and have a vote on it. We know we could pass it if we could only be allowed to have a vote. Let's show the kind of fairness that America wants to show. Let us be the beckoning country that it was to my grandparents and my great-grandparents.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at the end of July, the administration transmitted to the Senate and the House of Representatives legislation intended to increase privacy and security in cyberspace. Today, at the request and on behalf of the Administration, I introduce this legislation, the Enhancement of Privacy and Public Safety in Cyberspace Act. 
   The White House Chief of Staff, John Podesta, announced the administration's cyber-security proposal in an important speech at the National Press Club on Monday, July 17, 2000. This is a complex area that requires close attention to get the balance among law enforcement, business and civil liberties interests just right. I welcome the Administration's participation in this debate on the privacy implications of government surveillance, which certainly deserves just as much attention as the issue of the collection and dissemination of personally-identifiable information by the private-sector. 
   The means by which law enforcement authorities may gain access to a person's private ``effects'' is no longer limited by physical proximity, as it was at the time the Framers crafted our Constitution's Fourth Amendment right of the American people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures. New communications methods and surveillance devices have dramatically expanded the opportunities for surreptitious law enforcement access to private messages and records from remote locations. 
   One example of these devices is the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Carnivore software program, which screens Internet traffic and captures information targeted by court orders. The Senate and House Judiciary Committees have both conducted hearings on Carnivore to discuss how the software works and whether it minimizes intrusion or maximizes the potential for government abuse. The Attorney General is arranging for an independent technical review of Carnivore, and I look forward to reviewing the results. 
   In short, new communications technologies pose both benefits and challenges to privacy and law enforcement. The Congress has worked successfully in the past to mediate this tension with a combination of stringent procedures for law enforcement access to our communications and legal protections to maintain their privacy and confidentiality, whether they occur in person or over the telephone, fax machine or computer. In 1968, the Congress passed comprehensive legislation authorizing government interception, under carefully defined circumstances, of voice  communications over telephones or in person in Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act. 
   We returned to this important area in 1986, when we passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), which I was proud to sponsor, that outlined procedures for law enforcement access to electronic mail systems and remote data processing systems, and that provided important privacy safeguards for computer users. 
   The Administration's legislation is an important contribution to the ongoing debate over the sufficiency of our current laws in the face of the exponential growth of computer and communications networks. In fact, this legislation contains some proposals which I support. For example, the bill would allow judicial review of pen register orders so the judge is not just a rubber stamp, and would update the wiretap laws to apply the same procedural rules to e-mail intercepts as to phone intercepts. 
   Nevertheless, the merits of other provisions in this legislation would benefit from additional scrutiny and debate. For example, the legislation proposes elimination of the current $5,000 threshold for large categories of federal computer crimes. This would lower the bar for federal investigative and prosecutorial attention with the result that lesser computer abuses could be converted into federal crimes. 
   Specifically, federal jurisdiction currently exists for a variety of computer crimes if, and only if, such criminal offenses result in at least $5,000 of aggregate damage or cause another specified injury, such as the impairment of medical treatment, physical injury to a person or a threat to public safety. Elimination of the $5,000 threshold would criminalize a variety of minor computer abuses, regardless of whether any significant harm results. Our federal laws do not need to reach each and every minor, inadvertent and harmless hacking offense--after all, each of the 50 states has its own computer crime laws. Rather, our federal laws need to reach those offenses for which federal jurisdiction is appropriate. This can be accomplished, as I have done in the Internet Security Act, S. 2430, which I introduced earlier this year, by simply adding an appropriate definition of ``loss'' to the statute. 
   Prior Congresses have declined to over-federalize computer offenses and sensibly determined that not all computer abuses warrant federal criminal sanctions. When the computer crime law was first enacted in 1984, the House Judiciary Committee reporting the bill stated:  
   The Federal jurisdictional threshold is that there must be $5,000 worth of benefit to the defendant or loss to another in order to concentrate Federal resources on the more substantial computer offenses that affect interstate or foreign commerce. (H.Rep. 98-894, at p. 22, July 24, 1984).  
   Similarly, the Senate Judiciary Committee under the chairmanship of Senator THURMOND, rejected suggestions in 1986 that ``the Congress should enact as sweeping a Federal statute as possible so that no computer crime is potentially uncovered.'' (S. Rep. 99-432, at p. 4, September 3, 1986). 
   For example, if an overly-curious college sophomore checks a professor's unattended computer to see what grade he is going to get and accidentally deletes a file or a message, current Federal law does not make that conduct a crime. That conduct may be cause for discipline at the college, but not for the FBI to swoop in and investigate. Yet, under the Administration's legislation, this unauthorized access to the professor's computer would constitute a federal offense. 
   As the Congress considers changes in our current laws with a view to updating our current privacy safeguards from unreasonable government surveillance, I commend the administration for focusing attention on this important issue by transmitting its legislative proposal.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate votes on whether to establish Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China. 
   This issue has been the subject of longstanding and emotional debate. It is an issue which has divided the Congress, human rights groups and policy experts from across the spectrum. There are strong arguments on both sides--arguments I carefully weighed in deciding how to vote. 
   In the past, I have opposed extending annual Most Favored Nation status to China because of concerns about China's egregious record on human rights and labor rights. By many accounts, including the State Department's, the situation there has deteriorated over the past year. Repression of political dissent, restrictions on freedom of religion and the persecution of ethnic minorities are realities of everyday life. I witnessed with my own eyes the tragedy that has befallen the people of Tibet, when I traveled there in 1988. 
   For Vermonters, the young Tibetan and former Middlebury College student, Ngawang Choephel, and his mother, Sonam Dekyi, are the human faces of the hardships and injustices endured under Chinese rule. 
   Ngawang was arrested more than four years ago by Chinese police when he was in Tibet making a film about traditional Tibetan culture. He was sentenced to 18 years in prison, despite the fact that the Chinese have never produced a shred of evidence that he committed any crime. President Clinton and Secretary of State Albright have personally sought his release, to no avail. In May 1999, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights declared his detention to be arbitrary. I have taken countless steps in seeking his release, year after year, and so have Senator JEFFORDS and Congressman SANDERS.  
   Since 1996, Ngawang's mother sought permission to visit him. Chinese law permits family members to visit imprisoned relatives, but for four years the Chinese Government ignored her pleas. Finally, last month, the Chinese Government made it possible for her to see him. She found that he is suffering from recurrent, serious health problems, far more serious than those of us who have followed his case closely had been led to believe. 
   Thirty-two years ago, Ms. Dekyi made the dangerous journey from Tibet to India to escape Chinese repression. She lost a child along the way. Her remaining son is now paying a terrible price for his brave attempts to document Tibetan culture. 
   No one here would disagree that in so many ways the policies and practices of the Chinese Government stand in direct opposition to the democratic principles upon which our country is founded. Mr. Choephel's case is just one of many examples. 
   The question, however, is not whether we approve or disapprove of this reality. It exists. The question is what can we do about it? How can we most effectively encourage China to become a more open, humane and democratic society? 
   The unavoidable fact is that our current approach has not worked. Due process is non-existent. Ngawang Choephel and many other political prisoners remain in custody. Many of China's workers are exploited. Anyone who publicly expresses support for democracy is silenced. If I thought that we could solve these problems by preventing normal trade relations with China, I would support it without hesitation, but I do not believe that course would achieve our long-sought solutions to these many problems. 
   Preventing normal trade with China would not advance the political and humanitarian goals that the United States has long worked for in China, nor will it advance the economic goals we have set for ourselves here at home. 
   The fact is, with or without Congress' approval, China will join the World Trade Organization. 
   It will join 135 other countries in an organization which regulates global trade. It will be part of an international economic system created by democratic nations and governed by the rule of law. It will be required to further liberalize an economy which is already being transformed by trade and technology, and which has contributed to slow but steady reform.  
   So on the one hand, preventing normal trade relations with China would not stop China from enjoying the benefits of WTO. It will join WTO regardless. Nor, I believe, would blocking China PNTR result in Ngawang Choephel's release. But on the other hand, by blocking PNTR we would deny ourselves the significant economic benefits that will result from China's agreement to reduce tariffs and 
   open its markets to U.S. exports in ways that it never has before. And, I believe, we would deny ourselves the opportunity to build a better relationship with China. 
   Some have suggested that this debate is about what is right and what is wrong with the WTO. From its history of negotiating trade agreements in secret, to inadequate consideration of labor rights, human rights and the environment, there are plenty of problems with the WTO. These issues are important and they absolutely should be addressed. But they are not what this debate is about. 
   I have long spoken out against the lack of basic freedoms in China. I strongly supported the Administration's decision to sponsor a resolution condemning China at the U.N. Human Rights Commission. I have done everything I can think of to seek Ngawang Choephel's release, and I will continue to do so until he is released. I fervently hope that the Chinese Government will respond to the Congress' vote in favor of PNTR by releasing Mr. Choephel, along with others who do not belong in prison and who in no way threaten China's security. 
   Until the rule of law is respected and there is an independent judiciary that protects people's rights, until Ngawang Choephel and the other prisoners of conscience who languish in China's prisons are free, China will never be able to fully join the global community. 
   I am encouraged that the legislation that has come from the House would create a bipartisan Helsinki-type commission to monitor, promote and issue annual reports on human rights and worker rights in China. This bill requires hearings on the contents of these reports, including the recommendations of the commission, and it establishes a task force to strengthen our ability to prevent the import of goods made with prison or forced labor. 
   In the past, questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the yearly review of China's human rights record. However, I believe that it is important to have an annual debate on this issue, and I feel that the Helsinki-type commission and task force will provide useful, albeit limited, mechanisms for the examination of China's record on these issues 
   I have voted for every amendment to this legislation that was consistent with PNTR, and which would have also strengthened human rights. I deeply regret that they were not adopted. We can expand our trade with China, we can build a better relationship with China, and we can also stand up for human rights. The amendments offered by Senator FEINGOLD, Senator WELLSTONE, and others were reasonable and fully consistent with our most cherished values. 
   Profound differences over human rights will continue to cast a shadow on our relationship with China, and that is unfortunate. But it is also important to recognize that life in China is significantly different from what it was two decades ago or even two years ago. 
   For the first time, Chinese citizens are starting their own businesses. More and more Chinese are employed by foreign-owned companies, where they generally receive higher pay and enjoy better working conditions. State-run industries are gradually being dismantled and state-owned houses, health clinics, schools and stores are no longer the rule--reducing the influence that the Chinese Communist party has over its citizens everyday lives. 
   Technology has also weakened the government's ability to control people's lives. In the past year, the number of Internet addresses in China has risen dramatically. This year, the number is expected to exceed 20 million. With the Internet comes the exchange of information and ideas. And the government's best efforts to stifle this exchange are little match for a phenomenon that has transformed the lives of people around the world, from the most open to the most closed societies. In addition, access to print and broadcast media has expanded rapidly, along with nonprofit and civic organizations. 
   It is impossible to know what path Chinese authorities will ultimately choose--whether WTO membership and the changes it requires will indeed contribute to real democratic reform. But it would be a mistake for us to err on the side of isolation when there is so much that could be gained by engagement. 
   The President's arguments on this issue have been persuasive. So have the arguments of three former Presidents, six former Secretaries of State, and nine former Secretaries of the Treasury. 
   I also found persuasive the fact that many Chinese democracy and human rights activists, who have suffered the most under Chinese rule and have the most to gain from change, support PNTR. 
   And so I will vote for PNTR today. 
   Our archaic, counterproductive and ill-conceived approach toward Cuba is a perfect model for what we should not do in China. Our isolationist policy, which I 
   have long argued against, has fallen hardest on everyday Cubans. Nothing has done more to perpetuate Castro's grip on power, and the denial of basic freedoms there, than our embargo. 
   Rejecting PNTR would strengthen the same element in China--the hard-liners who are afraid that engagement with the outside world will dilute their power and influence. These are the same hard-liners who are refusing to negotiate with the Dalai Lama on Tibet and who would settle differences with Taiwan by force. 
   Which brings me to the issue of national security. China is an emerging military power, with a small but growing capability to deliver nuclear arms. It has an increasing influence in Asia, which military experts have identified as the most likely arena for future conflict. Passage of PNTR and China's accession to the WTO offer important opportunities to increase China's stake in global security and stability and to help ensure that over the long term China becomes our competitor and not our adversary. 
   Moreover, this legislation will not undermine U.S. efforts to use a full range of policy tools--diplomatic, economic and military--to address any potential Chinese noncompliance with American interests or international norms. 
   In purely commercial terms, Congress concedes nothing to China by approving PNTR. We do not open our country to more Chinese products. Rather, we simply maintain the present access to our economy that China already enjoys. In return, Chinese tariffs--from telecommunications to automobiles to agriculture--will fall by half or more over just five years, paving the way for the export of more American goods and services to the largest market in the world. 
   It is important to remember that if Congress rejects PNTR, other countries will continue to trade with China. They will reap the trade benefits that we have rejected. 
   PNTR will benefit Vermont. In the past year, Vermont exports to China have increased significantly--from $1 million in 1998 to $6.5 million in 1999. While this represents only a small fraction of Vermont's total exports, lower tariff barriers are likely to help Vermonters export their products beyond the Green Mountains to a quarter of the world's people. More Vermont exports mean more Vermont jobs. 
   I recognize the concerns of some in the labor community who believe that approving PNTR may cause the loss of some jobs in the United States. I know that many leaders of American labor organizations are motivated by their concern about their workers, and I respect them for that. Behind the statistics are real people with real families who suffer real consequences. 
   Some American workers will be hurt by this agreement. It is likely that some jobs will be lost as some businesses shift operations to China. However, trade experts generally agree that granting China PNTR will ultimately create a more favorable trade balance by increasing exports to China. And more American exports means more American jobs at a time when unemployment is at a historic low.  
   I support the strong anti-surge controls that have been included in the legislation, which will help protect American industries from a surge in Chinese imports that disrupt U.S. markets. The bill also authorizes funding to monitor China's compliance with its WTO commitments. 
   Mr. President, as with most trade bills that have come before Congress in the last ten years, the debate over granting PNTR for China has become clouded with simple slogans and half-truths. 
   Despite what we may hope for, history has proven time and again that there is no quick fix for the problems facing the Chinese people. And as it becomes harder for Chinese authorities to maintain control in the face of outside influences, the temptation to crack down on dissent may get worse before it gets better. 
   But we need to look beyond next month or next year. Freer trade will not in and of itself improve civil and political rights in China. It will not guarantee U.S. national security. It will not create thousands of American jobs overnight. But China's civilization is thousands of years old. It is changing faster today than ever before. With continued engagement on all fronts, we can, I believe, advance each of those important goals. For my part, I personally look forward to a much more intensive and regular dialogue with Chinese officials on these and other issues of importance to both our countries. 
   At the end of this debate, all of these many issues and arguments must be distilled to answer this one question: Is a vote for permanent normal trade relations with China in the best interests of the United States? The answer to that question is clearly ``yes.''

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are fast approaching the end of this Congress and we have much unfinished business. While there are many items of importance to the American people that remain undone, I will speak today about a single bill that has been languishing for some time despite the fact that it is wholly uncontroversial. That bill is S. 671, the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act. 
   This bill is important to American businesses, both big and small. As the International Trademark Association explained in a letter to me on February 9, 2000 on behalf of its 3,700 member companies and law firms, ``the practical benefits of the Madrid system, such as ease of applying and renewing trademark registrations internationally, will be of tremendous benefit to U.S. companies'' and, in particular, the benefits to ``small, entrepreneurial companies which do not have the financial means to seek separate national registrations for their trademarks in every country where they wish to do business.'' The bill and the Protocol are also supported by the American Intellectual Property Law Association and the Information Technology Association of America. 
   I first introduced this legislation in the 105th Congress as S. 2191 and again in this Congress in March, 1999. The Judiciary Committee reported S. 671, favorably and unanimously, on February 10, 2000. Unfortunately, the legislation has been languishing on the Senate calendar for the past eight months. In the House of Representatives, Congressmen COBLE and BERMAN sponsored and passed an identical bill, H.R. 769, on April 13, 1999. This marked the third time and the third Congress in which the House of Representatives had passed this bill. 
   There is no opposition to S. 671, nor to the substantive portions of the underlying Protocol. The White House recently forwarded the Protocol to the Senate for its advise and consent after working to resolve differences between the Administration and the European Community, EC, regarding the voting rights of intergovernmental members of the Protocol in the Assembly established by the agreement. These differences over the voting rights of the European Union and participation of intergovernmental organizations in this intellectual property treaty are now resolved in accordance with the U.S. position. Specifically, on February 2, 2000, the Assembly of the Madrid Protocol expressed its intent ``to use their voting rights in such a way as to ensure that the number of votes cast  by the European Community and its member States does not exceed the number of the European Community's Member States.'' 
   Shortly after this letter was forwarded by the Assembly, I wrote to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright requesting information on the Administration's position in light of the resolution of the voting dispute. At a hearing of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee on April 14, 2000, I further inquired of Secretary Albright about the progress the Administration was making on this matter. 
   With the voting rights issue resolved, President Clinton transmitted Treaty Document 106-41, the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement to the Senate for ratification on September 5, 2000. United States membership in the Protocol would greatly enhance the ability of any U.S. business, whether large and small, to protect its trademarks in other countries more quickly, cheaply and easily. That, in turn, will make it easier for American businesses to enter foreign markets and to protect their trademarks in those markets. 
   Senators HELMS and BIDEN moved promptly to hold a hearing in the Foreign Relations Committee on September 13, 2000 to consider the Protocol, and I commend them for acting quickly so this treaty may be considered by the full Senate before we adjourn. Members on both sides of the aisle have worked together successfully and productively in the past on intellectual property matters, and I am pleased to see these efforts again with the Protocol and implementing legislation. 
   Passage of S. 671 would help to ensure timely accession to and implementation of the Madrid Protocol, and it will send a clear signal to the international community, U.S. businesses, and trademark owners that Congress is serious about our Nation becoming part of a low-cost, efficient system to promote the international registration of marks. 
   The Madrid Protocol Implementation Act is part of my ongoing effort to update American intellectual property law to ensure that it serves to advance and protect American interests both here and abroad. The Protocol would help American businesses, and especially small and medium-sized companies, protect their trademarks as they expand into international markets. Specifically, this legislation will conform American trademark application procedures to the terms of the Protocol in anticipation of the U.S.'s eventual ratification of the treaty. Ratification by the United States of this treaty would help create a ``one stop'' international trademark registration process, which would be an enormous benefit for American businesses.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to speak today about two critically important immigration issues--expedited removal and the treatment of domestic violence victims in our asylum process. They both arose in a case recently brought to my attention. Two months ago, Ms. Nurys Altagracia Michel Dume fled to the United States from the Dominican Republic. She was fleeing from the man with whom she had lived for the past 11 years, a man who had raped her numerous times, forbade her even to leave the house, and, shortly before she left, bought a gun, held it to her head, and threatened to kill her. This was not the first time he had threatened her life. 
   She arrived here on July 17, and she was subject to expedited removal because, in her haste to escape from her abusive partner, she traveled without a valid passport. She expressed her fear of returning to the Dominican Republic. After three days of confinement, she was accorded a credible fear interview. At this crucial interview, at which she would have to discuss the fact that she had been raped, she was interviewed by two male employees and was not represented by counsel. Under their narrow interpretation of what may constitute ``credible fear of persecution,'' based on their interpretation of a Board of Immigration Appeals decision, Matter of R-A-, the INS took the position initially that Ms. Michel should be sent back to the Dominican Republic. Under their interpretation any asylum claims based on a fear of domestic violence would be barred. So even though they believed that Ms. Michel's partner might kill her if she were forced to return to her native country, they nonetheless made a legal judgment that her claim was invalid. 
   I cannot believe that even those supporters of the expedited removal process who forced it into law in 1996 could have intended for this matter to be resolved in this way or for questions of law to be resolved in INS officers at a credible fear hearing. I brought this case to the attention of the INS by way of a letter on August 28. The Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights, Congresswoman CAROLYN MALONEY, and others wrote, as well. I am glad to report that Ms. Michel was accorded a second credible fear interview. At this second interview, Ms. Michel was found to have a credible fear of persecution, and will now have the chance to raise an asylum claim. 
   Despite this reprieve, however, Ms. Michel's case reveals yet again the serious flaws in expedited removal. A woman who told a compelling history about the danger she faced if returned to her country was only able to receive an asylum hearing after the intervention of highly capable counsel and Members of both Houses of Congress. That it is not an effective or just system. If Ms. Michel's case had not come to the attention of the Lawyers' Committee, she would likely already be back in the Dominican Republic. If she had been forced back, I shudder to think what might have happened to her. 
   People who flee their countries to escape serious danger should be able to have asylum hearings in the United States without having to navigate the procedural roadblocks established by 
   expedited removal. I, again, call upon the Senate to consider S. 1940, the Refugee Protection Act, a bipartisan bill I introduced last fall with Senator BROWNBACK and five other Senators of both parties. This bill would restrict the use of expedited removal to times of immigration emergencies, and include due process protections in those rare times when it is used. 
   Expedited removal was originally instituted in the 1996 Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA). Under expedited removal, low-level INS officers with cursory supervision have the authority to ``remove'' people who arrive at our border without proper documentation, or with facially valid documentation that the officer simply suspects is invalid. No review--administrative or judicial--is available of the INS officer's decision, which is rendered after a so-called secondary inspection interview. ``Removal'' is an antiseptic way of saying thrown out of the country. 
   Expedited removal was widely criticized at the time of its passage as ignoring the realities of political persecution, since people being tortured by their government are quite likely to have difficulties obtaining valid travel documents from that government. Its adoption was viewed by many--including a majority of this body--as an abandonment of our historical commitment to refugees and a misplaced reaction to our legitimate fears of terrorism. 
   When we debated the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act later the same year, I offered an amendment with Senator DEWINE to restrict the use of expedited removal to times of immigration emergencies, which would be certified by the Attorney General. This more limited authority was all that the Administration had requested in the first place, and it was far more in line with our international and historical commitments. This amendment passed the Senate with bipartisan support, but it was removed in one of the most partisan conference committees I have ever witnessed. As a result, the extreme version of expedited removal contained in AEDPA remained law, and was implemented in 1997. Ever since, I have attempted to fix the problems with expedited removal. 
   The Refugee Protection Act is modeled closely on the 1996 amendment that passed the Senate, and I have been optimistic that it too would be supported by a broad coalition of Senators. It allows expedited removal only in times of immigration emergencies, and it provides due process rights and elemental fairness for those arriving at our borders without sacrificing security concerns. But even as the Refugee Protection act has gained additional cosponsors during this session, it has been ignored by the Senate leadership. Indeed, despite my requests, the bill has not even received a hearing. 
   Meanwhile, in the three and a half years that expedited removal has been in operation, we already have numerous stories of valid asylum seekers who were thrown out of the country without the opportunity to convince an immigration judge that they faced persecution in their native lands. To provide just one example, ``Dem,'' a Kosovar Albanian, was summarily removed from the U.S. after the civil war in Kosovo had already made the front pages of America's newspapers. During  his interview with the INS inspector who had unreviewable discretion over his fate, he 
   was provided with a Serbian translator who did not speak Albanian, rendering the interview a farce. Instead of being embraced as a political refugee, he was put on the next plane back to where his flight had originated. We only know about his story at all because he was dogged enough to make it back to the United States. On this second trip, he was found to have a credible fear of persecution and he is currently in the midst of the asylum process. 
   One of the most distressing parts of expedited removal is that there is no way for us to know how many deserving refugees have been excluded. Because secondary inspection interviews are conducted in secret, we typically only learn about mistakes when refugees manage to make it back to the United States a second time, like Dem, or when they are deported to a third country they passed through on their way to the U.S. This uncertainty should lead us to be especially wary of continuing this failed experiment. 
   And now we must even be concerned about the conduct of credible fear interviews. When aliens subject to expedited removal express a fear of returning to their home country, the law requires that they be referred for a credible fear hearing. If their fear is found to be legitimate, they are then allowed to make a claim for political asylum. These interviews are not designed to make judgments about legal questions, but simply to determine whether a person may have a valid asylum claim. This process failed Ms. Michel, and we must now worry that it is failing other refugees. 
   I am also concerned about the underlying legal issue in the case of Ms. Michel and other victims of domestic violence. Last year, the Board of Immigration Appeals denied the asylum request of a Guatemalan woman who faced likely death at the hands of her husband if she were forced to return home. In that decision, Matter of R-A-, the BIA decided that victims of domestic violence did not qualify as a ``social group'' under our asylum laws. The Attorney General currently has this very decision under review. It is my hope that she will reverse it. 
   Last year I sent a letter to the INS Commissioner supporting the asylum claim of Ms. R-A. In that case, the INS did not dispute her account of horrific abuse, including her claims that her husband raped and pistol-whipped her, and beat her unconscious in front of her children. Nor did the INS dispute that law enforcement authority in her native Guatemala told her that they would not protect her from violent crimes committed against her by her husband. Based on this evidence, an immigration judge determined in 1996 that she was entitled to asylum, but the INS appealed that ruling and convinced the BIA to reverse it. That decision is currently on appeal in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, but that court has stayed its consideration of the matter pending the Attorney General's own review. 
   Evidence of domestic violence is sadly all too common in our asylum system. Last year, I also encouraged the INS to grant asylum to a 16-year-old girl from Mexico who sought asylum in the United States after fleeing from a father who had beaten her since she was three years old, using whips, tree branches, his fists, and a hose. Apparently, the girl attempted to intervene when her father was beating her mother. Again, local law enforcement failed to protect the girl, and she 
   fled to the United States. As in R-A-, an immigration judge granted her asylum request, but the INS appealed, and the BIA reversed it. 
   These BIA decisions came only two years after its decision that Fauziya Kasinga--who faced female genital mutilation if forced to return to her native Togo--was protected by our asylum laws. In making this decision, the BIA found that potential victims of genital mutilation constituted a ``social group.'' I agree with this decision, and I believe that women fearing domestic violence must certainly also so qualify. This is especially true where--as is the case for Ms. Michel and many other women--the asylum applicants come from nations where law enforcement officials often turn a blind eye to claims of domestic violence. 
   Of course, the problems faced by women around the world go beyond domestic violence. Another stark example of the ways in which women applicants may be insufficiently protected by our asylum laws comes from the case of Ms. A-, a Jordanian woman seeking asylum in the United States after fleeing the prospect of a so-called ``honor killing'' in Jordan. I wrote the Attorney General in February--along with a bipartisan group of six other Senators--to support her asylum application. Ms. A- had fallen in love with a Palestinian man who asked her to marry him. Her father forbade the marriage, however, because he was Palestinian and had a low-paying job. Ms. A- was at that point faced with the possibility that she might be pregnant and the certainty that her future husband, whoever he might be, would know that she was no longer a virgin, a fact that would bring shame and dishonor upon her family and potentially justify her murder at her family's hands under a widely-practiced Jordanian custom. She fled to the United States and married this man. 
   In June 1995, her sister informed her that their father had met with their nuclear family, uncles and cousins to demand that they kill A- wherever they might meet her. The State Department reported that there were more than 20 ``honor killings'' in Jordan in 1998, and speculated that the actual number was probably four times as high. Making matters even worse, these killings are typically punishable by only a few months' imprisonment. 
   Despite the very close resemblance between these facts and the facts in Kasinga, both an immigration judge and the BIA found that Ms. A- was ineligible for asylum. The INS has agreed to stay further proceedings in the case while the Attorney General reviews the matter. 
   The existence of these problems in our asylum system shows that there is still work to be done, both by this Congress and in the executive branch. I call upon the Senate to use some of the time we have remaining to address the problems in our expedited removal system, and upon the Attorney General and the INS to be vigilant that victims of rape and other forms of serious domestic abuse not be returned to their countries under expedited removal. And I renew my call to the Attorney General that we reevaluate our position on asylum eligibility for victims of severe domestic violence from nations that do not take domestic violence seriously. Finally, I encourage all of my colleagues to sign on to a letter that Senator LANDRIEU and I are circulating that would ask the Attorney General to overturn R-A- and reaffirm our commitment to human rights and women's rights.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today Senator HATCH and I are introducing the Federal Judgeship Act of 2000. I am pleased that Senators FEINSTEIN, SCHUMER, BOXER, GRAHAM, REID, ROBB, INOUYE, EDWARDS, MURRAY, BINGAMAN, BAYH, KERREY, and DOMENICI are joining us as original cosponsors of this measure. 
   Our bill creates 70 judgeships across the country to address the workload needs of the federal judiciary. This bill incorporates the recommendations for additional judgeships most recently forwarded to us by the Judiciary Conference of the United States. Specifically, our legislation would create 6 additional permanent judgeships and 4 temporary judgeships for the U.S. Courts of Appeal; 30 additional permanent judgeships and 23 temporary judgeships for the U.S. District Courts; and convert 7 existing temporary district judgeships into permanent positions. 
   The Judicial Conference of the United States is the nonpartisan policy-making arm of the judicial branch. Federal judges across the nation believe that the increasingly heavy caseloads of our courts necessitate these additional judges. The Chief Justice of the United States in his annual year-end reports over the last several years has commented on the serious problems facing our federal courts having too much work and too few judges and other resources. 
   The Judicial Conference and Chief Justice Rehnquist are right. According to his 1999 year-end report, the filings in our federal courts have reached record heights. In fact, the numbers of criminal cases and defendants have reached their highest levels since the Prohibition Amendment was repealed in 1933. In 1999, overall growth in appellate court caseload included a 349 percent upsurge in original proceedings. This sudden expansion resulted from newly implemented reporting procedures, which more accurately measure the increased judicial workload generated by the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, both passed in 1996. 
   District court activity was characterized by an increase in criminal filings and a smaller increase in civil filings. Criminal case filings rose 4 percent from 57,691 in 1998 to 59,923 in 1999, and the number of defendants grew 2 percent from 79,008 to 80,822. Criminal case filings per authorized judgeship went up almost 5 percent. Since the last significant expansion of the federal judiciary in 1990, felony criminal case filings have increased almost 50 percent, from 31,727 in 1990 to 46,789 in 1999. 
   Despite these dramatic increases in case filings, Congress has failed to authorize new judgeships since 1990, thus endangering the administration of justice in our nation's federal courts. Without the extraordinary contributes of our senior judges, the administration of justice could well have broken down entirely. 
   Over the last several decades, a 6-year cycle for reviewing the needs of the judiciary and authorizing additional judgeships had been followed by Democrats and Republicans alike. For example, in 1978, Congress passed legislation to address the need for additional judgeships. Six years later, in 1984, Congress passed legislation creating additional judgeships. Then, again six years later, in 1990, Democratic majorities in both Houses of Congress fulfilled their constitutional responsibilities and enacted the Federal Judgeship Act of 1990 because of a sharply increasing caseload, particularly for drug-related crimes. At that time President Bush was in the middle of his first term in office. 
   That type of bipartisan effort broke down in 1996. It has now been 10 years since Congress made a systematic evaluation of the needs of the federal judiciary and acted to meet those needs. For each of the last two Congresses, the Republican majority has resisted any such action. Three years ago, the Judicial Conference requested an additional 55 judgeships to address the growing backlog. I introduced the Federal Judgeship Act of 1997, S. 678, legislation based on the Judicial Conference's 1997 recommendations. That legislation languished in the Judicial Committee without action during both sessions of the last Congress. Again last year, the Judicial Conference updated its request and recommended an additional 72 judgeships. I, again, introduced those recommendations in the Federal Judgeship Act of 1999, S. 1145. There was no action on it by the Judiciary Committee. 
   This year, the Judiciary Conference took the unusual step of updating last year's recommendations yet again. Those updated recommendations affect 70 judgeships. Today may signal a turning point in our efforts. Today Republicans are joining with us. I welcome them to this effort and look forward to working with them to pass the Federal Judgeship Act of 2000. 
   Included within our bill are the additional judgeships that would be authorized by S. 2730, the Southwest Border Judgeship Act of 2000. Senator FEINSTEIN has been tenacious in seeking the resources needed the federal courts of our southwest border States, including southern California. She is right. Those 13 judgeships for California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas are included in our bill. 
   Implicit in our legislation is acknowledgment that the federal judiciary does not just have 64 current vacancies with 9 of the horizon, but that even if all those vacancies were filled, the federal judiciary would remain 70 judges short of those it needed to manage its workload, try the cases and provide the individual attention to matters that have set a high standard for the administration of justice in our federal system. In other words, considering vacancies and taking into account the judgeships authorized by our bill, the federal judiciary is today in need of more than 130 more judges. 
   We have the greatest judicial system in the world, the envy of people around the globe who are struggling for freedom. It is the independence of our third, co-equal branch of government that gives it the ability to act fairly and impartially. It is our judiciary that has for so long protected our fundamental rights and freedoms and served as a necessary check on overreaching by the other two branches, those more susceptible to the gusts of the political winds. 
   Let us act to ensure that justice in our federal courts is not delayed or denied for anyone. I urge the Senate to do in this last month of this Congress what the Republican majority has so strenuously resisted for the last four years: Enact the Federal Judgeship Act without further delay. 
   Mr. GRAMS (for himself and Mr. HAGEL):

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President. I want to express my thanks and appreciation to my colleagues in the Senate for their support of Senate Resolution 355 congratulating Middlebury College on the successful completion of their first 200 years of higher education. I also want to thank my friend Senator HATCH and my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee for discharging this resolution in such a timely manner. 
   Later this fall, Middlebury College will enjoy the honor of celebrating its bicentennial. Middlebury College is one of the most respected liberal arts colleges in the nation and it was one of the first institutions of higher education in Vermont. In November 1800, the school first opened its doors for business to seven students and one professor in space at the local grammar school. Today, the school has more than two thousand students, almost two hundred professors, and a main campus of over 250 acres. 
   In recognition of 200 years of educating students from across this country and the world, the Middlebury College Bicentennial Planning Commission has designed Celebration 2000 to commemorate this milestone in Vermont's and the nation's educational history. The year-long bicentennial celebration honors the people and events that have made and continue to make Middlebury College a leader in higher education. Celebration 2000 features concerts, plays, and symposia, both on campus and at additional locations such as the New York Public Library, and the dedication of a new science building, Bicentennial Hall, with an exterior that resembles the Old Stone Row and the school's early architectural history. This year-long celebration will culminate later this fall during Founders' Week, a series of events on campus during the first week of November. 
   I am pleased this body has moved so quickly to commend and congratulate Middlebury College on the completion of its first two hundred years of educational excellence. I thank my colleagues for joining Senator JEFFORDS, the other cosponsors of this resolution and me in honoring the contributions of the school, its students and its alumni.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I came to the floor on May 25 to speak about the pressing criminal justice problems arising out of the so-called McDade law, which was enacted at the end of the last Congress as part of the omnibus appropriations law. At that time, I described some examples of how this law has impeded important criminal prosecutions, chilled the use of federally-authorized investigative techniques and posed multiple hurdles for federal prosecutors. In particular, I drew attention to the problems that this law has posed in cases related to public safety--among them, the investigation of the maintenance and safety practices of Alaska Airlines. The Legal Times and the Los Angeles Times recently reported on the situation regarding the Alaska Airlines investigation, and I ask unanimous consent to include these reports in the RECORD following my remarks. 
   Since I spoke in May, the McDade law has continued to stymie Federal law enforcement efforts in a number of States. I am especially troubled by  what is happening in Oregon, where the interplay of the McDade law and a recent attorney ethics decision by the Oregon Supreme Court is severely hampering Federal efforts to combat child pornography and drug trafficking. 
   I refer to the case of In re Gatti, 330 Or. 517 (2000). In Gatti, the court held that a private attorney had acted unethically by intentionally misrepresenting his identity to the employees of a medical records review company called Comprehensive Medical Review (``CMR''). The attorney, who represented a client who had filed a claim with an insurance company, believed that the insurance company was using CMR to generate fraudulent medical reports that the insurer then used to deny or limit claims. The attorney called CMR and falsely represented himself to be a chiropractor seeking employment with the company. The attorney was hoping to obtain information from CMR that he could use in a subsequent lawsuit against CMR and the insurance company. 
   The Oregon Supreme Court upheld the State Bar's view that the attorney's conduct violated two Oregon State Bar disciplinary rules and an Oregon statute--specifically, a disciplinary rule prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; a disciplinary rule prohibiting knowingly making a false statement of law or fact; and a statute prohibiting willful deceit or misconduct in the legal profession. In so doing, the court rejected the attorney's defense that his misrepresentations were justifiable because he was engaged in an investigation to seek evidence of fraud and other wrongful conduct. The court expressly ruled that there was no ``prosecutorial exception'' to either the State Bar disciplinary rules or the Oregon statute. As a result, it would appear that prosecutors in Oregon may not concur or participate in undercover and other deceptive law enforcement techniques, even if the law enforcement technique at issue is lawful under Federal law. 
   Gatti has had a swift and devastating effect on FBI operations in Oregon. Soon after the decision was announced, the U.S. Attorney's Office informed the FBI Field Office that it would not concur or participate in the use of long-used and highly productive techniques, such as undercover operations and consensual monitoring of telephone calls, that could be deemed deceptive by the State Bar. Several important investigations were immediately terminated or severely impeded. 
   Because of the Gatti decision, Oregon's U.S. Attorney refused to certify the six-month renewal of Portland's Innocent Images undercover operation, which targets child pornography and exploitation. Portland sought and obtained permission to establish an Innocent Images operation after the work of another task force over the past two years revealed that child pornography and exploitation is a significant problem in Oregon. With that finally accomplished, and with the investigative infrastructure in place, the U.S. Attorney refused to send the necessary concurring letter to the FBI for Portland's six-month franchise renewal. Since the U.S. Attorney's concurrence is necessary for renewal of the undercover operation, it now appears that Portland's Innocent Images operation will be shut down. 
   Gatti has also had an immediate and harmful impact on Oregon's war on drugs. Last winter, there was a multi-agency wiretap investigation into the activities of an Oregon-based drug organization. To date, the investigation has produced numerous federal and state indictments. Recently, the post-wiretap phase brought to the surface a cooperating witness. During the initial briefing, the cooperating witness indicated he had information about other drug organizations in Oregon and another State. In an effort to widen the investigation, the FBI sought the AUSA's concurrence in the cooperator's use of an electronic device to record conversations with other traffickers. Citing the Gatti decision, the assigned AUSA refused to provide concurrence. Since AUSA concurrence is required for such consensual monitoring, the FBI cannot make use of this basic investigative technique. Thus, a critical phase of the investigation languishes because of the interplay of Gatti and the McDade law. 
   These examples show how the McDade law is severely hampering federal law enforcement in Oregon. But as I made clear in my prior remarks, this ill-conceived law is having dangerous effects on federal law enforcement nationwide. Let me update my colleagues on the Talao case, which I discussed at some length in May. 
   In Talao, a company and its principals were under investigation for failing to pay the prevailing wage on federally funded contracts, falsifying payroll records, and demanding illegal kickbacks. The company's bookkeeper, who had been subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury, initiated a meeting with the AUSA in which she asserted that her employers were pressing her to lie before the grand jury, and that she did not want the company's lawyer to be present before or during her grand jury testimony. The grand jury later indicted the employers for conspiracy, false statements, and illegal kickbacks. 
   The district court held that the AUSA had acted unethically because the company had a right to have its attorney present during any interview of any employee, regardless of the employee's wishes, the status of the corporate managers, or the possibility that the attorney may have a conflict of interest in representing the bookkeeper. The court declared that if the case went to trial, it would inform the jury of the AUSA's misconduct and instruct them to take it into account in assessing the bookkeeper's credibility. 
   When I last spoke about the Talao case, the Ninth Circuit was reviewing the district court's decision. The Ninth Circuit has now spoken, and although it found no ethical violation, it did so on the narrow ground that the bookkeeper had initiated the meeting, and that the AUSA had advised the bookkeeper of her right to contact substitute counsel. Thus, the court sent a message that AUSAs and investigating agents may not approach employees in situations where there is a possible conflict of interest between the employee and the corporation for whom the employee works, and corporate counsel is purporting to represent all employees and demanding to be present during interviews. Let me put that another way. If a corporate whistleblower in California told an FBI agent that the agent should speak to a particular employee who had important information, and the AUSA assigned to the case knew that the corporation was represented by counsel in that matter, the AUSA arguably would have to nix the interview. 
   The need to modify the McDade law is real, and our time is running out. I introduced legislation last year that addressed the most serious problems caused by the McDade law, and I worked with the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee to refine and improve it. I described our approach when I spoke on this issue in May. Congress should take up and pass corrective legislation before the end of the session.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a resolution on behalf of myself and Senator JEFFORDS to commemorate 200 years of quality higher education at nationally acclaimed Middlebury College located in Middlebury, Vermont. 
   In the fall of 1800, a group of distinguished Vermonters petitioned the Vermont General Assembly for the establishment of a new institution of higher education in the small agricultural town of Middlebury. On November 1, 1800 these efforts proved successful when the Vermont General Assembly adopted a law to establish a college in Middlebury. Less than one week after receiving its charter, Middlebury College opened its doors to seven students and one professor in space at the local grammar school. 
   Over the last two centuries, Middlebury College has evolved from one of the first colleges in Vermont into one of the most respected liberal arts colleges in the Nation. Today, Middlebury has more than two thousand students, almost two hundred professors, and a main campus of over 250 acres. The campus of was first built beginning in 1810 with three larger stone buildings, each sharing a unique architectural style. On May 19, 2000, the United States Postal Service issued postcards to commemorate the Old Stone Row and the first buildings of the Middlebury College campus. 
   In recognition of 200 years of educating students from across this country and the world, the Middlebury College Bicentennial Planning Commission has designed Celebration 2000 to commemorate this milestone in Vermont's and the Nation's educational history. The year-long bicentennial celebration honors the people and events that have made and continue to make Middlebury College a leader in higher education. Celebration 2000 features concerts, plays, and symposia, both on campus and at additional locations such as the New York Public Library, and the dedication of a new science building, Bicentennial Hall, with an exterior that resembles the Old Stone row and the school's early architectural history. This year-long celebration will culminate later this fall during Founders' Week, a series of events on campus during the first week of November. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this resolution to commend and congratulate Middlebury College on the completion of its first two hundred years of educational excellence. I hope my colleagues will join Senator JEFFORDS and me in honoring the contributions of the school, its students and its alumni.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I again ask why the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 is being held up. Senator CAMPBELL and I, and others, both Republicans and Democrats, introduced this bulletproof vest bill to help our police officers. We introduced it last April. It was stuck in the Judiciary Committee for a time despite my requests that it be brought forth. It finally was allowed on the agenda and was passed out of there unanimously in June. 
   I find it hard to think that anybody who would be opposed to using some of our Federal crime-fighting money for bulletproof vests for our police officers. In fact, most Senators with whom I have talked, Republican and Democrat, tell me they are very much in favor of it. They saw how this worked in its first 2 years of operation. The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program under the original Campbell-Leahy bill funded more than 180,000 new bulletproof vests for police officers across the Nation. 
   We have a bill, though, that has been stalled, unfortunately, by an anonymous hold on the Republican side. This is a bipartisan bill that is being held up in a partisan fashion. 
   I am continually being asked by police officers who know how well the original Campbell-Leahy bill worked on bulletproof vests why we cannot pass this continuation of it. It is strongly supported by police officers all over the country. The President has made it very clear he would sign such a bill into law, as he did the last one. It is something that, if it were brought to a rollcall vote in the Senate, I am willing to guess 98, maybe all 100 Senators, would vote for it. Certainly no fewer than 95 Senators would vote for it. 
   When we could not pass it by unanimous consent before our summer recess because there was a hold, I wanted to make sure I could tell these police officers that there was no hold on this side. We actually checked with all 46 Democratic Senators. All 46 told us they would support it. All 46 said they would consent to having it passed anytime we want to bring it up by a voice vote. 
   I have told these police officers that while a significant number of both Republicans and Democrats support it or have cosponsored it, and while every single Democrat has said they support having it passed today, there is an anonymous hold on the Republican side. I hope that hold will go away. I urge these same police departments that have contacted me to contact the Republican leadership and say: Please ask whoever your anonymous Senator is to take the hold away and let the Campbell-Leahy bill pass. 
   That it has still not passed the full Senate is very disappointing to me, as I am sure that it is to our nation's law enforcement officers, who need life-saving bulletproof vests to protect themselves. Protecting and supporting our law enforcement community should not be a partisan issue. 
   Senator CAMPBELL and I worked together closely and successfully in the last Congress to pass the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998 into law. This year's bill reauthorizes and extends the successful program that we helped create and that the Department of Justice has done such a good job implementing. 
   We have 19 cosponsors on the new bill, including a number of Democrats and some Republicans. This is a bipartisan bill that is not being treated in a bipartisan way. For some unknown reason a Republican Senator has a hold on this bill and has chosen to exercise that right anonymously. 
   According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, more than 40 percent of the 1,182 officers killed by a firearm in the line of duty since 1980 could have been saved if they had been wearing body armor. Indeed, the FBI estimates that the risk of fatality to officers while not wearing body armor is 14 times higher than for officers wearing it. 
   To better protect our Nation's law enforcement officers, Senator CAMPBELL and I introduced the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998. President Clinton signed our legislation into law on June 16, 1998. Our law created a $25 million, 50 percent matching grant program within the Department of Justice to help state and local law enforcement agencies purchase body armor for fiscal years 1999-2001. 
   In its first two years of operation, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program has funded more than 180,000 new bulletproof vests for police officers across the country. 
   The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 builds on the success of this program by doubling its annual funding to $50 million for fiscal years 2002-2004. It also improves the program by guaranteeing jurisdictions with fewer than 100,000 residents receive the full 50-50 matching funds because of the tight budgets of these smaller communities and by making the purchase of stab-proof vests eligible for grant  awards to protect corrections officers in close quarters in local and county jails. 
   More than ever before, police officers in Vermont and around the country face deadly threats that can strike at any time, even during routine traffic stops. Bulletproof vests save lives. It is essential the we update this law so that many more of our officers who are risking their lives everyday are able to protect themselves. 
   I hope that the mysterious ``hold'' on the bill from the other side of the aisle will disappear. The Senate should pass without delay the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 and send it to the President for his signature. 
   Before we recessed last July, I informed the Republican leadership that the House of Representatives had passed the companion bill, H.R. 4033, by an overwhelming vote of 413-3. I expressed my hope that the Senate would quickly follow suit and pass the House-passed bill and send it to the President. President Clinton has already endorsed this legislation to support our Nation's law enforcement officers and is eager to sign it into law. 
   Several more weeks have come and gone. Unfortunately, nothing has changed. Not knowing what the misunderstanding of our bill is, I find it is impossible to overcome an anonymous, unstated objection. I, again, ask whoever it is on the Republican side who has a concern about this program to please come talk to me and Senator CAMPBELL. I hope the Senate will do the right thing and pass this important legislation without further unnecessary delay.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, talking about things that are being held up, I want to talk about the juvenile justice conference. Last year, in response to the terrible tragedy at Columbine, we passed a bipartisan juvenile justice bill through the Senate. Something like 73 Senators of both parties voted for this bill. We had weeks of debate. We had a number of amendments that improved it and a number of amendments that were rejected, but we had a full and open debate and a number of rollcall votes. As I said, it passed with 73 Senators voting for it. 
   That was last year. I urged before school started last year that we have a conference and work out the differences, if there are differences, between the House and the Senate; that we vote up or down. The conference is chaired by a Republican Senator, and we have not had anything other than a formal meeting to start the conference the day before the August recess in 1999. We have not met since then. We went off to our summer vacation and came back to schools starting all across the country. We just returned this week from this year's summer recess and we still have not had a meeting of the conferees. 
   I have been willing to accept votes up or down on matters of difference. I point out there are more Republicans on the conference than there are Democrats, Republicans chair both delegations from both Houses, so Republicans control the conference. If they do not like something that is in the conference, they can vote it down, they can vote it out. I know the we are in the minority. What I want to do is get this juvenile justice bill through so we can make the school year better, more productive, more educational, and a safer one. 
   The President of the United States was concerned enough about this that he invited the Republican leadership and Democratic leadership to meet with him at the White House. 
   I recall that he spent nearly 2 hours with us going over the bill. He indicated that he wanted to work with us to get a good law enacted. All he wanted to do was to get us to at least meet on the Hatch-Leahy juvenile crime bill that passed the Senate by a 3-to-1 bipartisan majority vote back on May 20, 1999. This is the Hatch-Leahy bill. Even with the two chief sponsors, you span the political spectrum. 
   I urge again that the Congress not continue to stall this major piece of legislation. I remind Republicans, if they do not like anything Democrats have put in the bill, they can vote us down. There are more Republican Senate conferees than there are Democratic conferees. There are more Republican House conferees than there are Democratic conferees. If the Republicans do not like something in it, they can just vote to remove it. There is nothing we can do to stop that. But at least take what is a good piece of legislation that will protect our children in school and let it go forward. 
   It has been 17 months since the tragedy at Columbine High School. Fourteen students and a teacher lost their lives there. Surely we could do better than to just stall this bill and hold this bill up. 
   Every parent, every teacher, every student in this country is concerned about the school violence over the last few years. It does not make any difference which political affiliation it is. If you are a parent, you are worried about the safety of your children going to school. If you are a teacher, you are worried about your workplace. If you are a student, you worry when you go to school. 
   Now, many fear that there will be more tragedies. The list of places suffering incidents of school violence continues to grow to include Arkansas, Washington, Oregon, Tennessee, California, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Mississippi, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, and Florida. 
   We all know there is no single cause. There is no single legislative solution to cure the ill of youth violence in our schools or on our streets. But we have had an opportunity for us to do our part. Frankly, I am disappointed in the Republican majority because they are squandering this opportunity. 
   We passed this bill, with 73 Senators--Republicans and Democrats alike joining to pass this bill--by an overwhelming margin. The least we could do is not allow it to then languish without ever being brought up for final action so the President can either sign it or veto it. 
   We should have seized this opportunity to act on balanced, effective juvenile justice legislation. Instead, the Senate has been in recess more than in session since the single ceremonial meeting of the juvenile crime conference. Just think of that. That is wrong. Let us go forward and pass this. 
   In fact, the Republican chairman of the House-Senate conference, at our one and only conference meeting in August 1999, said:  
   Our Nation has been riveted by a series of horrific school shootings in recent years, which culminated this spring--  
   Remember, this was said last year--  
   with the tragic death of 12 students and one teacher at Columbine High School in Colorado. Sadly, the killings at Columbine High School are not an isolated event. In 1997, juveniles accounted for nearly one-fifth of all criminal arrests in the United States. Juveniles committed 13.5 percent of all murders, more than 17 percent of all rapes, nearly 30 percent of all robberies, 50 percent of all arsons. While juvenile crime has dipped slightly in the last 2 years, it remains at historically unprecedented levels. Such violence makes this legislation necessary.  
   I agree with the Republican chairman of that conference that such violence makes this legislation necessary. I absolutely agree with him. But I do not agree with him then leaving that conference well over a year ago and never coming back and never completing the work. 
   We have to finish this. We have to finish this bill. All we have to do is bring the conference together. Ninety-eight percent of the bill would be agreed to very quickly. If there is 2 percent remaining, then vote it up or vote on it. 
   During the course of Senate debate on the bill in May 1999 we were able to make to the bill better, stronger and better balanced. It became more comprehensive and more respectful of the core protections in federal juvenile justice legislation that have served us so well over the last three decades. At the same time we made it more respectful of the primary role of the States in prosecuting criminal matters. 
   I recognize, as we all do, that no legislation is perfect and that legislation alone is not enough to stop youth violence. We can pass an assortment of new laws and still turn on the news to find out that some child somewhere in the country has turned violent and turned on other children and teachers, with terrible results. 
   All of us--whether we are parents, grandparents, teachers, psychologists, or policy-makers--puzzle over the causes of kids turning violent in our country. The root causes are likely  multi-faceted. We can all point to inadequate parental involvement or supervision, over-crowded classrooms and over-sized schools that add to students' alienation, the easy accessibility of lethal weapons, the violence depicted on television, in movies and video games, or inappropriate content available on the Internet. There is no single cause and no single legislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our schools or in our streets. Nevertheless, our legislation would have been a significant step in the right direction. As the FBI Report released on September 6, 2000 entitled ``The School Shooter'' points out, there are a number of factors that make a child turn violent. 
   The Senate bill, S. 254, started out as a much-improved bill from the one reported by the Judiciary Committee in the last Congress. In fact, a number of proposals that the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee specifically voted down in 1997 were incorporated at the outset into this bill. These are changes that I and other Democrats have been urging on our Republican colleagues for the past few years, and that they have resisted until quietly incorporated into this bill. 
   I tried in July 1997 to amend the earlier bill to protect the State's traditional prerogative in handling juvenile offenders and avoid the unnecessary federalization of juvenile crime that so concerns the Chief Justice and the Federal judiciary. Specifically, my 1997 amendment would have limited the federal trial as an adult of juveniles charged with nonviolent felonies to circumstances when the State is unwilling or unable to exercise jurisdiction. This amendment was defeated, with all the Republicans voting against it. 
   The Senate bill last year contained a new provision designed to address these federalism concerns that would direct federal prosecutors to ``exercise a presumption in favor of referral'' of juvenile cases to the appropriate State or tribal authorities, where there is ``concurrent jurisdiction,'' unless the State declines jurisdiction and there is a substantial federal interest in the case. 
   Yet, concerns remained that the bill would undermine a State's traditionally prerogative to handle juvenile offenders. 
   The changes we made to the underlying bill in the Hatch-Leahy managers' amendment went a long way to satisfy my concerns. For 
   example, S. 254 as introduced would have repealed the very first section of the Federal Criminal Code dealing with ``Correction of Youthful Offenders.'' This is the section that establishes a clear presumption that the States--not the federal government--should handle most juvenile offenders [18 U.S.C. section 5001]. While the original S. 254 would have repealed that provision, the Managers' amendment retained it in slightly modified form. 
   In addition, the original S. 254 would have required federal prosecutors to refer most juvenile cases to the State in cases of ``concurrent jurisdiction ..... over both the offense and the juvenile.'' This language created a recipe for sharp lawyering. Federal prosecutors could avoid referral by simply claiming there was no ``concurrent'' jurisdiction over the ``offense'' due to linguistic or other differences between the federal and state crimes. Even if the juvenile's conduct violated both Federal and State law, any difference in how those criminal laws were written could be used to argue they were different offenses altogether. This was a huge loophole that could have allowed federal prosecutors to end-run the presumption of referral to the State. 
   We fixed this in the Managers' Amendment, and clarified that whenever the federal government or the State have criminal laws that punish the same conduct and both have jurisdiction over the juvenile, federal prosecutors should refer the juvenile to the State in most instances. 
   Finally, I was concerned that, contrary to current law, a federal prosecutor's decision to proceed against a juvenile in federal court would not be subject to any judicial review. The Managers' Amendment permitted such judicial review, except in cases involving serious violent or serious drug offenses. 
   Federal Trial of Juveniles as Adults. Another area of concern had been the ease with which the original S. 254 would have allowed federal prosecutors to prosecute juveniles 14 years and older as adults for any felony. 
   While I have long favored simplifying and streamlining current federal procedures for trying juveniles, I believe that judicial review is an important check in the system, particularly when you are dealing with children. 
   This bill, S. 254, included a ``reverse waiver'' proposal allowing for judicial review of most cases in which a juvenile is charged as an adult in federal court. I had suggested a similar proposal in July 1997, when I tried to amend the earlier bill before the Judiciary Committee to permit limited judicial review of a federal prosecutor's decision to try certain juveniles as adults. That prior bill granted sole, non-reviewable authority to federal prosecutors to try juveniles as adults for any federal felony, removing federal judges from that decision altogether. My 1997 amendment would have granted federal judges authority in appropriate cases to review a prosecutor's decision and to handle the juvenile case in a delinquency proceeding rather than try the juvenile as an adult. 
   Only three States in the country granted prosecutors the extraordinary authority over juvenile cases that the earlier bill had proposed. We saw the consequences of that kind of authority, when a local prosecutor in Florida charged as an adult a 
   15-year-old mildly retarded boy with no prior record who stole $2 from a school classmate to buy lunch. The local prosecutor charged him as an adult and locked him up in an adult jail for weeks before national press coverage forced a review of the charging decision in the case. 
   This was not the kind of incident I wanted happening on the federal level. Unfortunately, my proposal for a ``reverse waiver'' procedure providing judicial review of a prosecutor's decision was voted down in Committee in 1997, with no Republican on the Committee voting for it. 
   I was pleased that S. 254 contained a ``reverse waiver'' provision, despite the Committee's rejection of this proposal three years ago. Though made belated, this was a welcome change in the bill. The Managers' amendment made important improvements to that provision, as well. 
   First, S. 254 gave a juvenile defendant only 20 days to file a reverse waiver motion after the date of the juvenile's first appearance. This time was too short, and could have lapsed before the juvenile was indicted and was aware of the actual charges. The Managers' amendment extended the time to make a reverse waiver motion to 30 days, which begins at the time the juvenile defendant appears to answer an indictment. 
   Second, S. 254 required the juvenile defendant to show by ``clear and convincing'' evidence that he or she should be tried as a juvenile rather than an adult. This is a very difficult standard to meet, particularly under strict time limits. Thus, the Managers' amendment changed this standard to a ``preponderance'' of the evidence. These are all significant improvements over the version of this bill considered originally in the 105th Congress. 
   Juvenile Records. As initially introduced, S. 254 would have required juvenile criminal records for any federal offense, no matter how petty, to be sent to the FBI. This criminal record would haunt the juvenile as he grew into an adult, with no possibility of expungement from the FBI's database. 
   The Managers' amendment made important changes to this record requirement. The juvenile records sent to the FBI would be limited to acts that would be felonies if committed by an adult. In addition, under the Managers' amendment, a juvenile would be able after 5 years to petition the court to have the criminal record removed from the FBI database, if the juvenile showed by clear and convincing evidence that he or she is no longer a danger to the community. Expungement of records from the FBI's database would not apply to juveniles convicted of rape, murder or certain other serious felonies. 
   Increasing Witness Tampering Penalties. This bill, S. 254, also contained a provision to increase penalties for witness tampering that I first suggested and included in the ``Youth Violence, Crime and Drug Abuse Control Act of 1997,'' S. 15, which was introduced in the first weeks of the 105th Congress, at the end of the last Congress in the  ``Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of 1998,'' S. 2484, and again in S. 9, the comprehensive package of crime proposals introduced with Senator DASCHLE at the beginning of this Congress. This provision would increase the penalty for using or threatening physical force against any person 
   with intent to tamper with a witness, victim or informant from a maximum of ten to twenty years' imprisonment. In addition, the provision adds a conspiracy penalty for obstruction of justice offenses involving witnesses, victims and informants. 
   I have long been concerned about the undermining of our criminal justice system by criminal efforts to threaten or harm witnesses, victims and informants, to stop them from cooperating with and providing assistance to law enforcement. I tried to include this provision, along with several other law enforcement initiatives, by amendment to the earlier bill during Committee mark-up on July 11, 1997, but this amendment was voted down by all the Republicans on the Committee. At the end of the mark-up, however, this witness tampering provision was quietly accepted and I am pleased that it is included in S. 254. 
   Eligibility Requirements for Accountability Block Grant. This bill, S. 254, substantially relaxes the eligibility requirements for the new juvenile accountability block grant. By contrast, the bill in the last Congress would have required States to comply with a host of new federal mandates to qualify for the first cent of grant money, such as permitting juveniles 14 years and older to be prosecuted as adults for violent felonies, establishing graduated sanctions for juvenile offenders, implementing drug testing programs for juveniles upon arrest, and nine new juvenile record-keeping requirements. These record-keeping mandates would have required, for example, that States fingerprint and photograph juveniles arrested for any felony act and send those records to the FBI, plus make all juvenile delinquency records available to law enforcement agencies and to schools, including colleges and universities. We could find no State that would have qualified for this grant money without agreeing to change their laws in some fashion to satisfy the twelve new mandates. 
   In 1997, I tried to get the Judiciary Committee to relax the new juvenile record-keeping mandates under the accountability grant program during the mark-up of the earlier bill. My 1997 amendment would have limited the record-keeping requirements to crimes of violence or felony acts committed by juveniles, rather than to all juvenile offenses no matter how petty. But my amendment was voted down on July 23, 1997, by the Republicans on the Committee. Finally, two years later, S. 254 reflects the criticism I and other Democrats on the Judiciary Committee leveled at the strict eligibility and record-keeping requirements. 
   Indeed, the Senate decisively rejected this approach when it defeated an amendment by a Republican Senator that would have revived those straight-jacket eligibility requirements. Specifically, his amendment would have required States to try as adults juveniles 14 years or older who committed certain crimes. As I pointed out during floor debate on this amendment, only two States would have qualified for grant funds unless they agreed to change their laws. 
   Moreover, the current bill removes the record-keeping requirements altogether from the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant. Instead, S. 254 sets up an entirely new Juvenile Criminal History Block Grant, funded at $75 million per year. To qualify for a criminal history grant, States would have to promise within three 
   years to keep fingerprint supported records of delinquency adjudications of juveniles who committed a felony act. No more photographs required. No more records of mere arrests required. No more dissemination of petty juvenile offense records to schools required. Instead, only juvenile delinquency adjudications for murder, armed robbery, rape or sexual molestation must be disseminated in the same manner as adult records; other juvenile delinquency adjudications records may only be used for criminal justice purposes. These limitations are welcome changes to the burdensome, over-broad record-keeping requirements in the prior version of the Republican juvenile crime bill. 
   The eligibility requirements for the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant now number only three, including that the State have in place a policy of drug testing for appropriate categories of juveniles upon arrest. 
   Core Protections for Children. Much of the debate over reforming our juvenile justice system has focused on how we treat juvenile offenders who are held in State custody. Republican efforts to roll back protections for children in custody failed in the last Congress. These protections were originally put in place when Congress enacted the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (JJDPA) to create a formula grant program for States to improve their juvenile justice systems. This Act addressed the horrific conditions in which children were being detained by State authorities in close proximity to adult inmates--conditions that too often resulted in tragic assaults, rapes and suicides of children. 
   As the JJDPA has evolved, four core protections have been adopted--and are working--to protect children from adult inmates and to ensure development of alternative placements to adult jails. These four core protections for juvenile delinquents are: Separation of juvenile offenders from adult inmates in custody (known as sight and sound separation); Removal of juveniles from adult jails or lockups, with a 24-hour exception in rural areas and other exceptions for travel and weather related conditions; Deinstitutionalizaton of status offenders; and to study and direct prevention efforts toward reducing the disproportionate confinement of minority youth in the juvenile justice system. 
   Over strong objection by most of the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee in the last Congress, the earlier bill would have eliminated three of the four core protections and substantially weakened the ``sight and sound'' separation standard for juveniles in State custody. At the same time the Committee appeared to acknowledge the wisdom and necessity of such requirements when it adopted an amendment requiring separation of juveniles and adult inmates in Federal custody. 
   This bill, S. 254, was an improvement in its retention of modified versions of three out of the four core protections. Specifically, S. 254 included the sight and sound standard for juveniles in Federal custody. The same standard is used to apply to juveniles delinquents in State custody. 
   Legitimate concerns were raised that the prohibition on physical contact in S. 254 would still allow supervised proximity between juveniles and adult inmates that is ``brief and incidental 
   or accidental,'' since this could be interpreted to allow routine and regular--though brief--exposure of children to adult inmates. For example, guards could routinely escort children past open adult cells multiple times a day on their way to a dining area. 
   The Hatch-Leahy managers' amendment made significant progress on the ``sight and sound separation'' protection and the ``jail removal'' protection. Specifically, our amendment made clear that when parents in rural areas give their consent to have their children detained in adult jails after an arrest, the parents may revoke their consent at any time. In addition, the judge who approves the juvenile's detention must determine it is in the best interests of the juvenile, and may review that detention--as the judge must periodically--in the presence of the juvenile. 
   The managers' amendment also clarified that juvenile offenders in rural areas may be detained in an adult jail for up to 48 hours while awaiting a court appearance, but only when no alternative facilities are available and appropriate juvenile facilities are too far away to make the court appearance or travel is unsafe to undertake. 
   The Hatch-Leahy managers' amendment also significantly improved the sight and sound separation requirement for juvenile offenders in both Federal and State custody. The amendment incorporated the guidance in current regulations for keeping juveniles separated from adult prisoners. Specifically, the Managers' amendment would require separation of juveniles and adult inmates and excuse only ``brief and inadvertent or accidental'' proximity in non-residential areas, which  may include dining, recreational, educational, vocational, health care, entry areas, and passageways. 
   I was pleased we were able to make this progress. I appreciate that a number of Members remain seriously concerned, as do I, about how S. 254 would change the disproportionate minority confinement protection in current law. This bill, S. 254, removes any reference to minorities and requires only that efforts be made to reduce over-representation of any segment of the population. I was disappointed that Senators WELLSTONE and KENNEDY's amendment to restore this protection did not succeed during Senate consideration of the bill and looked forward to continued discussion and progress on this issue in the conference. 
   Prevention. The bill included a $200 million per year Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Challenge Grant to fund both primary prevention and intervention uses after juveniles have had contact with the juvenile justice system. I and a number of other members were concerned that in the competition for grant dollars, the primary prevention uses would lose out to intervention uses in crucial decisions on how this grant money would be spent. With the help of Senator KOHL, we included in the Hatch-Leahy managers' amendment a clear earmark that eighty percent of the money, or $160 million per year if the program is fully funded, is to be used for primary prevention uses and the other twenty percent is to be used for intervention uses. Together with the 25 percent earmark, or about $112 million per year if that program is fully funded, for primary prevention in the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant that was passed by the Senate in the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment, 
   this bill now reflects a substantial amount of solid funding for primary prevention uses. 
   Prosecutors' Grants. I expressed some concern when the Senate passed the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment authorizing $50 million per year for prosecutors and different kinds of assistance to prosecutors to speed up prosecution of juvenile offenders. I pointed out that this amendment did not authorize any additional money for judges, public defenders, counselors, or corrections officers. The consequence would be to exacerbate the backlog in juvenile justice systems rather than helping it. 
   The managers' amendment fixed that problem by authorizing $50 million per year in grants to State juvenile court systems to be used for increased resources to State juvenile court judges, juvenile prosecutors, juvenile public defenders, and other juvenile court system personnel. 
   State Advisory Groups. The Senate bill incorporates changes I recommended to the earlier version of the bill in the last Congress. I have been working to ensure the continued existence and role of State Advisory Groups, or SAGs, in the development of State plans for addressing juvenile crime and delinquency, and the use of grant funds under the JJDPA. The Judiciary Committee in 1997 adopted my amendment to preserve SAGs and require representation from a broad range of juvenile justice experts from both the public and private sectors. 
   While, as introduced, S. 254 preserved SAGs, it eliminated the requirement in current law that gives SAGs the opportunity to review and comment on a grant award to allow these experts to provide input on how best to spend the money. In addition, while the bill authorizes the use of grant funds to support the SAG, the bill does require States to commit any funds to ensure these groups can function effectively. I am pleased that we were able to accept an amendment sponsored by Senators KERREY, ROBERTS, and others, to ensure appropriate funding of SAGs at the State level and to support their annual meetings. 
   Protecting Children from Harmful Internet Content. Over the past decade, the Internet has grown from relative obscurity to an essential commercial and educational tool. This rapid expansion has brought with it remarkable gains, but has also created new dangers for our children, prompting Congress to struggle with legislation that protects the free flow of information, as required by the First Amendment, while at the same time shields our children from inappropriate material accessible on the Internet. 
   I share the concern of many of my colleagues that much of the material available on the Internet may not be appropriate for children and have joined in the search to find a solution that does not impinge on any important constitutional rights or the free flow of information on the Internet and avoids the pitfalls inherent in proposals such as the Communications Decency Act and other pending proposals. Specifically, Senators HATCH and I offered an amendment to S. 254, the juvenile justice bill, that was agreed to on May 13, 1999, by a vote of 100 to 0. Our Internet filtering proposal would leave the solution to protecting children in school and libraries from inappropriate online materials to local school boards and communities. The Hatch-Leahy amendment would require Internet 
   Service Providers (ISPs) with more than 50,000 subscribers to provide residential customers, free or at cost, with software or other filtering system that prevents minors from accessing inappropriate material on the Internet. A survey would be conducted at set intervals after enactment to determine whether ISPs are complying with this requirement. The requirement that ISPs provide blocking software would become effective only if the majority of residential ISP subscribers lack the necessary software within set time periods. 
   Unfortunately, progress on this Internet filtering proposal has been stalled as the majority in Congress has refused to conclude the juvenile justice conference. This is just one of the many legislative proposals contained in the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, S. 254, designed to help and safeguard our children-- which is why that bill passed the Senate by an overwhelming majority over a year ago. 
   I commend Senator MCCAIN for his leadership and dedication to this subject. I hope that we can work together on this issue since we share an appreciation of the Internet as an educational tool and venue for free speech, as well as concerns about protecting our children from inappropriate material whether they are at home, at school or in a library. 
   Protecting Children From Guns. Significantly, the Senate amended this bill with important gun control measures that we all hope will help make this country safer for our children. The bill, as now amended: bans the transfer to and possession by juveniles of assault weapons and high capacity ammunition clips; increases criminal penalties for transfers of handguns, assault weapons, and high capacity ammunition clips to juveniles; bans prospective gun sales to juveniles with violent crime records; expands the youth crime gun interdiction initiative to up to 250 cities by 2003 for tracing of guns used in youth crime; and increases federal resources dedicated to enforcement of firearms laws by $50 million a year. These common-sense initiatives were first included in the comprehensive Leahy law enforcement amendment that was tabled by the majority, but were later included in successful amendments sponsored by Republican Senators. No matter how these provisions were finally included in the bill, they will help keep guns out of hands of children and criminals, while protecting the rights of law abiding adults to use firearms. 
   In addition, through the efforts of Senators LAUTENBERG, SCHUMER, KERREY and others, we were able to require background checks for all firearm purchases at all gun shows. After three Republican amendments failed to close the gun show loophole in the Brady law, and, in fact, created many new loopholes in the law, with the help of Vice President GORE's tie-breaking vote, a majority in the U.S. Senate voted to close the gun show loophole. 
   Our country's law enforcement officers have urged Congress for more than a year to pass a strong and effective juvenile justice conference report. The following law enforcement organizations, representing thousands of law enforcement officers, have endorsed the Senate-passed gun safety amendments: 
   International Association of Chiefs of Police; 
   International Brotherhood of Police Officers; 
   Police Executive Research Forum; 
   Police Foundation; 
   Major City Chiefs; 
   Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association;  
   National Sheriffs Association; 
   National Association of School Resource Officers; 
   National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives; 
   Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association. 
   Our law enforcement officers deserve Congress' help, not the abject inaction that has ensued over that last two years. 
   I recount a few of the aspects of the Hatch-Leahy juvenile crime bill to indicate that it was comprehensive and that it was the result of years of work and weeks of Senate debate and amendment. I said at the outset of the debate last May 1999 that I would like nothing better than to pass responsible and effective juvenile justice legislation. I wanted to pass juvenile justice legislation that would be helpful to the youngest citizens in this country--not harm them. I wanted to pass juvenile justice legislation that assists States and local governments in handling juvenile offenders--not impose a ``one-size-fits-all'' Washington solution on them. I wanted to prevent juveniles from committing crimes, and not just narrowly focus on punishing children. I wanted to keep children who may harm others away from guns. This bill would have made important contributions in each of these areas. 
   At the time the bill was considered by the Senate, in May 1999, the Republican Manager of the bill, declared his support for the Senate bill and said:  
   Littleton was different. The need to do something about the serious problem of youth violence has always been apparent. The tragedy of a month ago gave us the ingenuity and dedication to follow through. . . . I believe that the Senate has crafted a consensus product and one which I intend to support.  
   He called the Senate bill ``a testament to those who worked on it and a product which, on the whole, will help our young people and do something significant about the problems of juvenile crime.'' He observed:  
   People believe we are powerless to deal with violent juvenile crime and that we are powerless to change our culture. It is this feeling of powerlessness which threatened our collective ambition for meaningful, penetrating solutions in the wake of the Littleton tragedy. I believe the Senate has taken a meaningful step towards shedding this defeatism. * * * * * 
   Given the seriousness of our youth violence problem--and the number of warning signs that tragedies will continue unless all of us come together--we must move forward. We should join together and pass this bill.  
   I deeply regret that the Republican leadership of this Congress will not complete our work by holding the conference, meeting, voting, and reporting a final bill to the House and Senate and sending to the President a bill that would improve juvenile justice and school safety. 
   I commend the Administration for the numerous efforts it has made within the limitations of current law. Most recently, the Department of Justice has made available a Threat Assessment Perspective on school violence developed by the Critical Incident Response Group and National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime of the FBI. This follows upon the joint Justice and Education Department publication ``Early Warning, Timely Response: A Guide to Safe Schools,'' which was made available nationwide in 1998. In addition, the Department of Justice has provided important resources through the COPS in Schools Grant Program. 
   In closing, I thank our schools, teachers, parents, and children for all they have done in the past 2 years, without the Congress' help, to lower the level of violence in our schools. But I regret that this Congress has failed to do its work to provide the additional resources and reforms that would have been helpful and reassuring to our children, parents, grandparents, and teachers at schools. It can be better. It is unconscionable if we do not do better. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand that my friend from Mississippi, the distinguished majority leader, may propose a unanimous consent request regarding the rural television loan guarantee bill which I have been working to get passed for many months. If the consent request actually offered is the one I have seen, I will have to object when that happens. I will explain why now so I don't hold up the distinguished leader when he comes to the floor. 
   As a conferee last year on a major satellite television bill--the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act--I worked hard to include, along with other Senators, a provision that would have assured that rural Americans were not left out of the benefits of that Act. I teamed up with other Senators to include a title that would have allowed USDA to provide loan guarantees to companies that wished to offer local-into-local television to rural Americans. We wanted to do this so that rural families would be able to receive their local network television stations over satellite, or other service, along with the full range of other programming. We wanted rural families to be able to get local news, local weather warnings and local programming but recognized that without a loan guarantee program that might never happen. 
   In other words, we wanted to share the benefits of that bill that would go to urban areas to rural Americans also through a loan guarantee program. I know many parts of rural America would not have the benefits of it without a loan guarantee program. It is similar to what we did in my grandparents' time to bring telephone service and electricity to rural areas. 
   As a Conferee, I originated the rural satellite guarantee program to be administered by USDA when I was a conferee on the satellite TV bill. Unfortunately, one of the Senate committee chairmen objected to that provision and insisted that it be pulled from the Conference Report. To date, we have been unable to resolve this matter and regain the ground we lost last year. I know the distinguished junior Senator from Montana, Senator BURNS, took an early leadership role in this matter. His colleague, the distinguished senior Senator from Montana, Senator BAUCUS, introduced legislation with me last year also on this issue. We did this to show bipartisan support. 
   I want to work with all Members on this. The reason I would make such an objection, if it were done the way I have been told, is that to do otherwise I would have to abandon rural America, and I don't intend to do that. As a product of rural America, I feel my roots there very deeply. Ironically enough, this could have already been law by today. There is a simple solution. A lot of Republicans and Democrats agree on this. We can send a great rural satellite loan guarantee bill to the House by working together. I think that could be passed by unanimous consent. Or, we could enact a final bill by a Senate amendment to the House-passed bill. We could do that in the time it would take to get the conferees together to meet. 
   I am concerned that a conference would delay this process until the end of the year and result in denying rural Americans local-into-local television--the same kind of satellite local-into-local television urban residents now enjoy. I use as an example the electronic signature conference. That showed how difficult a conference can be and it shows how long a conference can take. That conference took way more time to finish than we have left to devote to any rural satellite conference. In addition, the Congress has to pass at least ten major appropriations bills or else there could be another government shutdown. In this case, the proposal would leave two key committees off the conference. 
   Regarding the e-signature conference, when we finally got the right mix of conferees and followed proper procedures, we still had many struggles before we finished a strong e-signature bill that has been applauded by both businesses and consumers. However, this time around we do not have time because the Congress is going out of session soon.  
   But we clearly have time to enact this rural satellite bill. My staff provided draft language to many of the Republican and Democratic offices months ago in order to help resolve this matter. I urge the majority leader and the Democratic leader to call a meeting so we can resolve this important issue and send a clean bill over to the House without wasting time. I suspect it would be passed very quickly, with very strong support from the rural areas of our country. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia has offered an amendment which highlights that China has enormous reserves of coal which that country will in all likelihood rely on greatly to fuel power plants as its economy continues to expand and modernize. 
   I commend Senator BYRD for his effort to support the transfer of clean coal technologies to China as part of our foreign assistance programs. The coal in the hills and mountains of China has high concentrations of sulfur and mercury. The United States should encourage the use of technologies that will reduce emissions of harmful substances and improve generation efficiency. 
   While I support the amendment offered by Senator BYRD, I strongly encourage the Administration to also promote the use of renewable energy technologies in China. Coal may be a plentiful resource in China but that country should also utilize other energy technologies to provide power for their growing economy such as wind, solar and biomass. The United States and many European countries have developed low cost power generation technologies in all of these areas of renewable energy. Our foreign policy  should vigorously promote these technologies as well as clean coal technology.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage passage of the Seniors Safety Act, legislation I introduced along with Senators DASCHLE, KENNEDY, and TORRICELLI in March 1999. Eight additional Senators have signed on as cosponsors since then. Despite this broad support, however, the majority has declined even to hold hearings on this bill to fight crime against America's senior citizens. As Grandparents' Day approaches this Sunday, and as this Congress comes to a close, I urge the majority to join with us in our efforts to improve the safety and security of older Americans. 
   During the 1990s, while overall crime rates dropped throughout the nation, the rate of crime against seniors remained constant. In addition to the increased vulnerability of some seniors to violent crime, older Americans are increasingly targeted by swindlers looking to take advantage of them through telemarketing schemes, pension fraud, and health care fraud. We must strengthen the hand of law enforcement to combat those criminals who plunder the savings that older Americans have worked their lifetimes to earn. The Seniors Safety Act tries to do exactly that, through a comprehensive package of proposals to establish new protections and increase penalties for a wide variety of crimes against seniors. 
   First, this bill provides additional protections to nursing home residents. Nursing homes provide an important service for our seniors--indeed, more than 40 percent of Americans turning 65 this year will need nursing home care at some point in their lives. Many nursing homes do a wonderful job with a very difficult task--this legislation simply looks to protect seniors and their families by isolating the bad providers in operation. It does this by giving Federal law enforcement the authority to investigate and prosecute operators of those nursing homes that engage in a pattern of health and safety violations. This authority is all the more important given the study prepared by the Department of Health and Human Services and reported this summer in the New York Times showing that 54 percent of American nursing homes fail to meet the Department's ``proposed minimum standard'' for patient care. The study also showed that 92 percent of nursing homes have less staff than necessary to provide optimal care. 
   Second, the Seniors Safety Act helps protect seniors from telemarketing fraud, which costs billions of dollars every year. My bill would give the Attorney General the authority to block or terminate telephone service where that service is being used to defraud seniors. If someone takes your money  at gunpoint, the law says we can take away their gun. If someone uses their phone to take away your money, the law should allow us to protect other victims by taking their phone away. In addition, my proposal would establish a Better Business Bureau-style clearinghouse that would keep track of complaints made about telemarketing companies. With a simple phone call, seniors could find out whether the company trying to sell to them over the phone or over the Internet has been the subject of complaints or been convicted of fraud. 
   Third, the Seniors Safety Act punishes pension fraud. Seniors who have worked hard for years should not have to worry that their hard-earned retirement savings will not be there when they need them. My bill would create new criminal and civil penalties for those who defraud pension plans, and increase the penalties for bribery and graft in connection with employee benefit plans. 
   Fourth and finally, the Seniors Safety Act strengthens law enforcement's ability to fight health care fraud. A recent study by the National Institute for Justice reports that many health care fraud schemes ``deliberately target vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or Alzheimer's patients, who are less willing or able to complain or alert law enforcement.'' This legislation gives law enforcement the additional investigatory tools it needs to uncover, investigate, and prosecute health care offense in both criminal and civil proceedings. It also protests whistle-blowers who alert law enforcement officers to examples of health care fraud. 
   This legislation is intended to focus attention on the particular criminal activities that victimize seniors the most. Congress should act on this bill now--when it comes to protecting our seniors, we have no time to waste. I am eager to work with the majority on this bill, and would be happy to consider any constructive improvements. Protecting seniors should be a bipartisan cause, and I want to pursue it in a bipartisan way. So I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to look at this bill and work with us to improve the security of our seniors.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, like so many Americans, I have been faced with a barrage of confusing and frightening information about the recent Firestone tire recall. I have a Ford Explorer, and it has Firestone tires on it. My wife and I drive it and take our children and our friends and others for rides in that vehicle. So I understand what a lot of my fellow Vermonters are going through regarding this deadly episode. It never should have happened. 
   But it is not just Explorer owners who are at risk--pedestrians, joggers, bicyclists, and other cars could be hit by out-of-control vehicles or by tire pieces. 
   The tires on my car are the same size and type as those covered by the recall. But they were manufactured at a different plant--a North Carolina plant. Even though employees of that plant have raised serious concerns about quality control in that factory, the tires on my Explorer are not eligible for the recall. But I have to tell you, I look long at them each time I get into the vehicle, and it is in the back of my mind every time I drive. 
   Even though they tell me that they are not yet the subject of a recall, I wonder what tomorrow's news may bring. 
   The first foreign recall occurred on August 1999, but the Secretary of Transportation apparently was not even informed of this by the manufacturer until May of 2000--nearly a year after the fact. That is outrageous. It is unacceptable. Worse yet, that kind of delay has proven deadly. I don't even want to think about the lives that could have been saved had there been quicker action, and had the manufacturers been honest enough to notify the public immediately. 
   Even after the recall was issued, the deadly risk continues as families have to wait to get replacement tires. I want to mention one sad case. A grandfather, Gary Meek of Farmersville, California, was a retired police officer. He, his wife and granddaughter, Amy, 13 years old, were driving on August 16, a couple weeks ago, when a Firestone tire on the Ford Explorer separated. His wife survived the crash, but Mr. Meek and his granddaughter were killed. His widow has to carry on with those awful memories. 
   I am going to introduce legislation today to mandate that the Secretary of Transportation be immediately notified of defects in motor vehicles or vehicle components--immediately after the foreign manufacturer becomes aware of the dangerous defect or when the manufacturer is notified about the defect by the foreign government. This notification would be earlier in time than the beginning of a foreign recall or any efforts to replace the defective product. 
   My bill also requires the manufacturer file a full report on the circumstances regarding each defective vehicle or vehicle component. The bill will impose stiff criminal penalties for false or misleading statements, or efforts to coverup the truth, regarding these reports. It also imposes criminal and civil penalties for other violations of the bill. In other words, if tires are defective, or are going to be recalled or replaced in some other country, they have to notify us--and notify us accurately and truthfully. 
   One would think some of these foreign tire companies would feel a moral duty to save lives. You would think that would be enough to motivate them. One would think even the idea of huge fines might motivate them. That doesn't seem to be enough. Maybe if they think they will get a jail sentence if they don't notify us truthfully, maybe, they will put the interests of the lives and safety of the public ahead of the short-term gains of their own companies. 
   My bill, the Transportation Information Recall Enhancement Act, requires notification of a foreign dangerous defect within 48 hours. It requires even more detailed information filings a few days later. My bill also requires notification of increases in deaths or serious injuries in foreign countries regarding vehicles and vehicle components that could prove deadly if they are on American soil. 
   Secretary Slater said in an interview that there should be a law requiring that the United States be immediately notified of foreign recalls. We are on the way to making that a reality. I will work with any Senator, Republican or Democrat, on this issue so we can pass this legislation or any other bill to get the job done in the next couple of weeks. 
   It is incomprehensible to me how any corporate executives can live with themselves when they withhold information that could have saved people's lives. If they are going to conceal the truth or make false statements, they should face criminal sanctions. Sometimes if a person thinks they are going to end up in the slammer, they will pay a lot more attention to the safety of people, rather than simply looking at the balance sheet. 
   For example, we just received reports about Mitsubishi over the past two decades. For 20 years, they routinely withheld information about dangerous products which ended up in America and other countries. These corporate officers should be forced to explain their inaction to the families of those who have been injured using their products. Maybe Americans should not buy any Mitsubishi products because they lied for 20 years. Criminal penalties are clearly needed. In the global economy there has to be some compassion for the suffering that is sometimes caused around the world. There seems to be almost a disconnect. 
   The President of Ford Motors, for example, when he heard that Congress was going to question him, at first was unwilling to testify personally. 
   I think he heard an almost national outcry over that insolence and disregard of the people of this country, insolence and arrogance that kept him from realizing how concerned Americans were. Fortunately, he changed his mind and found the time. I suspect the appropriate congressional committees would have gotten a subpoena, and the result would have been the same. He would have testified. 
   Every corporation has a right to sell their products. Every corporation has a right to make a decent profit. They  ought to be able to do that. When they know they have a product that can bring about death or injury, and especially when only they know it and nobody else does, they ought to make those facts known. The law should be very clear that they have to make it known. If they manufacture a product in this country to sell both here and abroad, if there are problems in the other country and the product is defective, they should notify this country of that fact. They will lose some business in the short term. In the long term, they will do better. The American public will be secure, and the American public will not be endangered. 
   What Firestone did, what Ford did, and for that matter, what Mitsubishi did, was wrong. It was absolutely wrong. I want corporate leaders never to do this again. I want a law that says if you provide information to our government regarding defective products that is false, misleading or untruthful that you are going to go to jail. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print a summary of the bill in the RECORD.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that we have reached a time agreement to take up and consider S.1796, the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act. However, it is regrettable that we could not pass this important legislation by unanimous consent this week, as I had hoped. 
   The Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act addresses an issue that should deeply concern all of us: the enforcement of court-ordered judgments that compensate the victims of state-sponsored terrorism. This legislation has the strong support of American families who have lost loved ones due to the callous indifference to life of international terrorist organizations and their client states, and it deserves our support as well. 
   One such family is the family of Alisa Flatow, an American student killed in Gaza in a 1995 bus bombing. The Flatow family obtained a $247 million judgment in Federal court against the Iranian-sponsored Islamic Jihad, which proudly claimed responsibility for the bombing that took her life. But the family has been unable to enforce this judgment because Iranian assets in the United States remain frozen. 
   This bill would provide an avenue for the Flatow family and others in their position to recover the damages due them under American law. It would permit successful plaintiffs to attach certain foreign assets to satisfy judgments against foreign states for personal injury or death caused by an act of torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, hostage taking, or the provision of material support or resources for such an act. Meanwhile, it allows the President to waive the bill's provisions if that is necessary for the national security interest. 
   Some have raised concerns that the legislation could cause the United States to violate its treaty obligations to protect the diplomatic property of other nations, and thus provoke retaliation against our diplomatic property in other nations. I believe that this bill can and should be construed as being consistent with our international obligations, and I trust the State Department to ensure that it does not compromise the integrity of our diplomatic property abroad. I want to commend Senator BIDEN for working with the sponsors and the State Department to help fashion the changes to S.1796 that help accomplish that goal. 
   I am also pleased that the time agreement will allow the Senate to consider a Mack-Lautenberg-Leahy-Feinstein amendment dealing with support for victims of international terrorism. This amendment will enable the Office for Victims of Crime to provide more immediate and effective assistance to Americans who are victims of terrorism abroad--Americans like those killed or injured in the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, and in the Pan Am 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. These victims deserve help, but according to OVC, existing programs are failing to meet their needs. Working with OVC, we have crafted legislation to correct this 
   problem. 
   Our amendment will permit the Office for Victims of Crime to serve these victims better by expanding the types of assistance for which the VOCA emergency reserve fund may be used, and the range of organizations to which such funds may be provided. These changes will not require new or appropriated funds: They simply allow OVC greater flexibility in using existing reserve funds to assist victims of terrorism abroad, including the victims of the Lockerbie and embassy bombings. 
   Our amendment will also authorize OVC to raise the cap on the VOCA emergency reserve fund from $50 million to $100 million, so that the fund is large enough to cover the extraordinary costs that would be incurred if a terrorist act caused massive casualties, and to replenish the reserve fund with unobligated funds from its other grant programs. 
   At the same time, the amendment will simplify the presently-authorized system of using VOCA funds to provide  victim compensation to American victims of terrorism abroad, by permitting OVC to establish and operate an international crime victim compensation program. This program will, in addition, cover foreign nationals who are employees of any American government institution targeted for terrorist attack. The source of funding is the VOCA emergency reserve fund, which we authorized in an amendment I offered to the 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. 
   Finally, our amendment clarifies that deposits into the Crime Victims Fund remain available for intended uses under VOCA when not expended immediately. This should quell concerns raised regarding the effect of spending caps included in appropriations bills last year and this. I understand the appropriations' actions to have deferred spending but not to have removed deposits from the Fund. This provision makes that explicit. 
   I want to thank Senator FEINSTEIN for her support and assistance on this initiative. Senator FEINSTEIN cares deeply about the rights of victims, and I am pleased that we could work together on some practical, pragmatic improvements to our federal crime victims' laws. We would have liked to do more. In particular, we would have liked to allow OVC to deliver timely and critically needed emergency assistance to all victims of terrorism and mass violence occurring outside the United States and targeted at the United States or United States nationals. 
   Unfortunately, to achieve bipartisan consensus on our amendment, we were compelled to restrict OVC's authority, so that it may provide emergency assistance only to United States nationals and employees. It seems more than a little bizarre to me that the richest country in the world would reserve emergency aid for victims of terrorism who can produce a passport or W-2. I will continue to work with OVC and victims' organization to remedy this anomaly. 
   I regret that we have not done more for victims this year, or during the last few years. I have on several occasions noted my concern that we not dissipate the progress we could be making by focusing exclusively on efforts to amend the Constitution. Regretfully, I must note that the pace of victims legislation has slowed noticeably and many opportunities for progress have been squandered. 
   I am hopeful that we can make some progress this year by passing our amendment to S.1796, and I look forward to continuing to work with the Administration, victims groups, prosecutors, judges and other interested parties on how we can most effectively assist victims and provide them the greater voice and rights that they deserve. 
   I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today is in effect the anniversary of the only  meeting of the House-Senate Conference committee on the Hatch-Leahy juvenile crime bill. This is the last day before the August recess this year and last year on August 5, Chairman HATCH convened the conference for the limited purpose of opening statements. I am disappointed that the majority continues to refuse to reconvene the conference and that for a over a year this Congress has failed to respond to issues of youth violence, school violence and crime prevention. 
   It has been 15 months since the shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, where 14 students and a teacher lost their lives in that tragedy on April 20, 1999. It has been 14 months since the Senate passed the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill by an overwhelming vote of 73-25. Our bipartisan bill includes modest yet effective gun safety provisions. It has been 13 months since the House of Representatives passed its own juvenile crime bill on June 17, 1999. 
   Sadly, it will be 12 months next week since the House and Senate juvenile justice conference met for the first--and only--time on August 5, 1999, less than 24 hours before the Congress adjourned for its long August recess. 
   Senate and House Democrats have been ready for months to reconvene the juvenile justice conference and work with Republicans to craft an effective juvenile justice conference report that includes reasonable gun safety provisions, but the majority refuses to act. Indeed, on October 20, 1999, all the House and Senate Democratic conferees wrote to Senator HATCH, the Chairman of the juvenile justice conference, and Congressman HYDE, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, to reconvene the conference immediately. In April 2000, Congressman HYDE joined our call for the juvenile justice conference to meet as soon as possible in a letter to Senator HATCH, which was also signed by Congressman CONYERS. 
   A few months ago, the President even invited House and Senate members of the conference to the White House to urge us to proceed to the conference and to final enactment of legislation before the anniversary of the Columbine tragedy. But the majority has rejected his pleas for action as they have those of the American people. Apparently, the gun lobby objects to one provision in the bill, even though the bill passed overwhelmingly, and they will not let us proceed with the conference. This lobby was not elected to the Senate or to the House of Representatives, but apparently has enormous influence. 
   Every parent, teacher and student in this country is concerned about school violence over the last two years and worried about when the next shooting may occur. They only hope it does not happen at their school or involve their children. 
   Just last week, a 13-year old student put a gun to a fellow classmate at Seattle middle school. Although the student fired a shot in the school cafeteria, thankfully no one was hurt during this latest school shooting. Unfortunately, that cannot be said about the rash of recent incidents of school violence throughout the country. The growing list of schoolyard shootings by children in Arkansas, Washington, Oregon, Tennessee, California, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Mississippi, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, and Florida is simply unacceptable and intolerable. 
   We all recognize that there is no single cause and no single legislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our schools or in our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to do our part. We should not let another school year begin without addressing some of the core issues of youth violence and school violence. We should seize this opportunity to act on balanced, effective juvenile justice legislation, and measures to keep guns out of the hands of children and away from criminals. 
   It is ironic that the Senate will be in recess next week on the anniversary of the first and only meeting of the juvenile justice conference. In fact, the Senate has been in recess more than in session since the one ceremonial meeting of the juvenile crime conference committee. It is beneath us. We ought to meet. We ought to get this done.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to turn now to another issue. This time last year, I rose to express concern about the final decisions of the Supreme Court's 1998 Term, in which it struck down on federalism grounds three important pieces of bipartisan legislation. Another Supreme Court Term has now ended, and this Term's victims include the Violence Against Women Act and, as applied to State employees, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. 
   I see my distinguished friend from Delaware in the Chamber, and I know he has spoken extensively on this. I believe it bears repeating. 
   We have seen a growing trend of judicial second-guessing of congressional policy decisions, both in the Supreme Court and in some of the lower Federal courts. Most troubling to me is the encroachment of the Federal judiciary on the legitimate functions of the Federal legislative branch in matters that are perceived by the courts to impact the States. 
   We ought to all be concerned about this because it affects our constitutional system of checks and balances. We ought to ask ourselves how we can have a situation where an unelected group of Supreme Court Justices can over and over substitute their judgment for the judgment of the elected representatives of this country. 
   It is not a question of how we feel about an individual case. Sometimes I vote for these bills and sometimes I vote against them. But when we have held hearings, when we have determined that there is a need for Federal legislation, when we have gone forward, and then in an almost cavalier and, in some cases, disdainful fashion, the Supreme Court knocks it all down, something is wrong. It is time for us to join together in taking stock of the relationship between Congress and the courts. 
   According to a recent article by Stuart Taylor, the Rehnquist Court has struck down about two dozen congressional enactments in the last five terms. That is about five per year--a stunning pace. To put that in perspective, consider that the Supreme Court struck down a total of 128 Federal statutes during its first 200 years. That is less than one per year, and it includes the years of the so-called ``activist'' Warren Court. 
   Justice Scalia recently admitted that the Rehnquist Court is ``striking down as many Federal statutes from year to year as the Warren Court at its peak.'' In fact, the Rehnquist Court, with its seven Republican-appointed Justices, is striking down Federal statutes almost as fast as this Republican Congress can enact them. These cases evidence a breakdown of respect between the judiciary and legislative branches, and raise serious concerns about whether the Court has embarked on a program of judicial activism under the rubric of protecting State sovereignty. 
   Let me start where I left off a year ago, with the trio of 5-4 decisions that ended the Court's last Term. In the Florida Prepaid case, the Court held that the States could no longer be held liable for infringing a Federal patent. In the College Savings Bank case, the Court held that the States could no longer be held liable for violating the Federal law against false advertising. And in Alden v. Maine, the Court held that the States could no longer be held liable for violating the Federally-protected right of their employees to get paid for overtime work. 
   These decisions were sweeping in their breadth. They allowed special immunities not just to essential organs of State government, but also to a wide-range of State-funded or State-controlled entities and commercial ventures. They tilted the playing field by leaving institutions like the University of California entitled to benefit from Federal intellectual property laws, but immune from enforcement if they violate those same laws. They were also startling in their reasoning, casting aside the text 
   of the Constitution, inferring broad immunities from abstract generalizations about federalism, and second-guessing Congress' reasoned judgment about the need for national remedial legislation. 
   When I discussed these decisions last year, I warned that they could endanger a wide range of other Federally-protected rights, including rights to a minimum wage, rights against certain  forms of discrimination, and whatever rights we might one day provide to health coverage. This year's crop of 5-to-4 decisions continued the trend toward restricting individual rights and diminishing the authority of Congress to act on behalf of all Americans in favor of protecting State prerogatives. 
   The predictions I made last year have unfortunately come to pass with this year's Supreme Court decisions. In Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, the Court held that State employees are not protected by the Federal law banning age discrimination, notwithstanding Congress' clearly expressed intent. Five members of the Court decided that age discrimination protections applied to the States were unnecessary. The Congress and the American people had it wrong when we concluded that age discrimination by State employers was a problem that needed a solution. None of those five Justices sat in on the hearings that Congress held 30 years ago, they did not hear the victims of age discrimination describe their experiences, but they nonetheless decided they knew better than Congress did. Justice Thomas wrote separately to say that he was prepared to go even further and make it even harder for Congress to apply anti-discrimination laws to the States. 
   The Kimel decision could spell trouble for all sorts of Federal laws, including other laws prohibiting discrimination in the workplace and regulating wages and hours and health and safety standards. The Supreme Court majority has now told us, after the fact, that we in Congress have to ``build a record,'' like an administrative agency, before they will allow us to protect State employees from discrimination, but it has not made it entirely clear just how many victims of discrimination have to come before us and testify before it will allow us to give them legislative protection. 
   The signs, however, are ominous: the week after it decided Kimel, the Court vacated two lower court decisions holding that States must abide by the Equal Pay Act, calling into question the ability of Congress to offer State employees protection from sex discrimination. Next Term, in University of Alabama v. Garrett, the Court will decide whether States can be held liable for discriminating against employees with disabilities. That plaintiff in Garrett is a State employee--a nurse at the University of Alabama--who was diagnosed with breast cancer, and was demoted after taking sick leave to undergo surgery and chemotherapy. 
   The second blow this Term to congressional authority was United States v. Morrison, which struck down a portion of the Violence Against Women Act that provides a Federal remedy for victims of sexual assault and violence. The Violence Against Women Act had been our measured response to the horrifying effects of violence on women's lives nationwide, not only on their physical well-being but also on their ability to carry on their lives and their jobs as they are driven into hiding by stalking and prevented from going out at night in some areas by fear of rape. After hearing a mountain of evidence detailing the impact of violence on women's lives and interstate commerce, I was proud to work with Senator BIDEN, Senator HATCH, Senator KENNEDY and others in an overwhelming bipartisan consensus in 1994 to enact VAWA. 
   But the five-Justice majority was unimpressed with the evidence, and with the common-sense point that violence affects women's lives, including their participation in commerce. Relying once again on abstract notions of federalism, the Court decided that violence against women does not affect interstate commerce enough, or rather, it affects interstate commerce, but in the wrong sort of way, so Congress has no business protecting American women from violence. 
   One Justice said he would cut even more into Congress' power, saying we had very little business doing much of what we had done throughout the 20th century. Frankly, I do not want to see us turn back, in the 21st century, to a 19th century view. 
   What made this latest ``federalism'' decision all the more remarkable is that the vast majority of the States, whose rights the Court's ``federalism'' decision are supposed to protect, had urged the Court to uphold the VAWA Federal remedy. 
   The Kimel and Morrison decisions are troubling, both for what they do to the rights of ordinary Americans, and for what they say about the relationship between Congress and the present majority of the Supreme Court. State's rights and individual rights are both essential to our constitutional scheme, and the Court has a constitutional duty to prevent the Congress from encroaching on them. I have spoken before about the need to restrain the congressional impulse to federalize more local crimes. There are significant policy downsides to such federalization, however, that do not apply in other areas, where each American, no matter what State he or she lives in, should have the same rights and protections. 
   The legislative judgments we make that are reflected in the laws we pass deserve more respect than the Rehnquist Court has shown. It is troubling when five unelected Justices repeatedly second-guess our collective judgments as to whether discrimination and violence against women and other major social problems are serious enough, or affect commerce in the right sort of way, to merit a legislative response. 
   It is even more troubling when a Justice steps out of his judicial role, and beyond the judgment calls inherent in individual cases, to express a generalized disdain for the legislative branch. Yet, that is precisely what Justice Scalia did in a recent speech, in which he suggested that the oath to uphold the Constitution that each of us takes counts for nothing, and that Acts of Congress should be stripped of their traditional presumption of constitutionality. Justice Scalia is as free as the next citizen to express his mind, but that sort of open disrespect for Congress coming from a sitting Supreme Court Justice bodes ill for democracy, and for the delicate balance of power between the Congress, the President and the courts on which our Constitution rests. 
   I am also fearful that Justice Scalia's remarks are becoming a rallying cry for Federal judges around the country who are hostile to Congress and to some of our efforts to protect ordinary people from discrimination, from violence, from invasions of privacy and violations of civil liberties, and from environmental and other health hazards. The Federal appeals court in Richmond, Virginia--the Fourth Circuit--has the dubious honor of leading this charge with radical new legal theories that cut back on Federal power and individual rights. 
   In January, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed a Fourth Circuit decision invalidating a Federal law that prohibits States from disclosing personal information from motor vehicle records. The Fourth Circuit had held that this common-sense privacy law violated abstract notions of federalism. As we have seen, it takes a lot to outdo the present Supreme Court in raising abstract federalism principles over individual rights. 
   Also in January, the Supreme Court overwhelmingly rejected the Fourth Circuit's reasoning in a case involving citizen ``standing'' in Federal court to sue polluters who violate our environmental laws. The Fourth Circuit decision had sharply limited the ability of citizens to sue polluters and win civil penalties. The Supreme Court reversed that decision by a 7-2 vote, with Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas dissenting. 
   The Fourth Circuit is even more consistently hostile to civil rights in matters of criminal law and civil liberties. In death 
   penalty cases, for example, it seems to have embraced a doctrine of State infallibility. An article in the American Lawyer last month reported that:  
   While condemned inmates' rates of at least partial success in Federal habeas corpus actions run at close to 40 percent nationally, the rate in the 4th Circuit since October 1995 has been a cool 0 percent, with more than 80 consecutive convictions having been upheld.  
   In May, a unanimous Supreme Court, a Court that itself espouses the general belief that the rights of capital defendants are best protected by the State justice system that seeks to execute them, overturned two Fourth Circuit decisions that denied habeas corpus relief to death row inmates who had been sentenced to death on the basis of grossly unfair procedures. 
   Just last month, the Fourth Circuit lost its bid to overturn the Supreme  Court's landmark decision in Miranda v. Arizona. The Fourth Circuit's notion that it had the right to overturn a longstanding Supreme Court precedent was unorthodox, to say the least. By a 7-2 vote, in which Justices Scalia and Thomas dissented again, the Court reaffirmed the 34-year-old precedent that requires the police to inform suspects of their right to remain silent. 
   What we are seeing in the Fourth Circuit is unparalleled, but not unrivaled. Other Federal courts across the country are also embracing Justice Scalia's ``no-deference'' philosophy and busily redefining the relationship of the judiciary to the other branches of government. The D.C. Circuit departed from a half century of Supreme Court separation-of-powers jurisprudence to strike down air quality standards established by the EPA under the Clean Air Act, a crucial statute passed during the Nixon administration that has improved the air we breath for the last three decades. Meanwhile, in a striking throw-back to the Lochner era of economic libertarian ``natural law'' theory, the Federal Circuit has adopted an unusually expansive reading of the Takings Clause that threatens to undermine basic environmental protections that Congress has established. Likewise, Federal district courts in Texas have recently rendered radical decisions, limiting the Federal Government's authority to enforce basic food safety standards. 
   Republican detractors of the Ninth Circuit often refer to that court's high reversal rate in the Supreme Court. But about half of the Ninth Circuit decisions that the Supreme Court reversed this year were written by Reagan and Bush appointees. Moreover, set against the reversal record of other circuits, the Ninth Circuit, which has the largest caseload of all the Federal appeals courts, looks about average. Courts with half or a third of the caseload of the Ninth Circuit have more than their share of reversals. The Fourth Circuit was reversed five times this year, as was the Fifth Circuit. The overwhelmingly Republican-appointed judges of the Seventh Circuit were reversed in five out of seven cases this year. 
   I have spoken at some length about this growing trend of judicial decisions second-guessing the congressional judgments embodied in laws that apply to the States because I am deeply concerned about what they mean for the relationship between the judicial and the legislative branches and for our democracy. When a Supreme Court Justice, one held up by some of my Republican friends as a paragon of judicial restraint, declares that no deference, no respect, is owed to the democratic decisions of Congress, Americans should be concerned. 
   We here in the Senate have a responsibility to safeguard democratic values. That does not mean that we should be strident, or disrespectful; we should always cherish judicial independence even when we dislike the results. We should, however, defend vigorously our democratic role as the peoples' elected representatives. When we see bipartisan policies, supported by a vast majority of the American people, being overturned time and 
   time again on the basis of abstract notions of federalism, it is our right, and our duty, to voice our concerns. And when the rights of ordinary Americans are defeated by technicalities in the courts and by abstract notions of ``State's rights'' that the States themselves do not support, it is our responsibility to work together to find new ways to protect them. 
   I have tried to do that. A year ago, I voiced my concerns about the Supreme Court's 1999 State sovereign immunity decisions, as did some of my colleagues, including Senator BIDEN and Senator SPECTER. I warned then of their potential impacts on the civil rights of American workers. As we have seen, my fears became a disturbing reality in the Kimel case. I have also tried to begin work on restoring the integrity of our national intellectual property system, in the Intellectual Property Protection Restoration Act, S. 1835, a bill I introduced last October. That bill would restore intellectual property protections while meeting all the Court's constitutional objections, however questionable they are. I am delighted that a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing today to explore ways to undo the damage done to our intellectual property system by the Court's 1999 decisions. I hope that the Senate Judiciary Committee will consider and act on this important issue, which it has ignored all year. 
   These are issues we should all be working on together. Republicans and Democrats can agree on the importance of protecting civil rights, intellectual property rights, privacy and other rights of ordinary Americans that recent doctrinaire judicial decisions have impaired. We can also agree on the importance of protecting Congress as an institution from repeated judicial second-guessing of policy judgments on matters that affect the States. 
   It is important for Congress, as an institution, to focus on making our relationship with the Federal judiciary a more constructive and mutually respectful one. Here in the Senate, where the Constitution requires us to give our ``advice and consent'' on judicial nominations, we have a special responsibility in this regard, a responsibility to protect both democratic values and judicial independence. The disgraceful manner in which the Senate has treated judicial nominees does not help and may be a factor in the current breakdown of respect between the legislative and judicial branches. 
   Too often, judicial nominees have been put through a litmus test by my Republican colleagues to determine whether they will engage in ``liberal judicial activism.'' In fact, I cannot remember a recent judicial nomination hearing in which one of my Republican friends has not made a speech about ``liberal activist judges.'' Strangely, however, hardly a mention is made of traditional judicial activism--striking down democratically-adopted laws with which one happens to disagree based on abstract principles with no basis in the Constitution, as the Supreme Court did in the age discrimination case, or overturning the long-standing precedent of a higher court, as the Fourth Circuit did in the Miranda case. Nor do my colleagues seem troubled by Justice Scalia's disdain for Congress. But I know that my Republican friends are very concerned about ``liberal judicial activism.'' The terms of this test change depending on the circumstances. 
   From what I can gather, the easiest way to spot ``liberal judicial activists'' is by the company they keep. You might call it the ``activist by association'' principle. Over the last few years, several outstanding judicial nominees have come under attack simply because, as young lawyers out of law school, they clerked for Supreme Court Justice William Brennan. These nominees were tarred as potential activists not because of anything they had done, but because of their one-year association with a distinguished and respected member of the United States Supreme Court. This test is 
   applied only to delay or oppose nominees--clerking for a conservative justice like Chief Justice Rehnquist has not helped Allen Snyder, a nominee to a vacancy on the D.C. Circuit who has been held up in Committee for months. Maybe someone should send a warning to the students at the Nation's top law schools that the Senate has become so partisan that clerking for the Supreme Court can damage your career. 
   Other nominees were challenged because of their association with legal organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Woman's Legal Defense Fund or for contributing time to pro bono activities. Maybe we should publish a list of groups you cannot associate with, and of rights and liberties you cannot work to protect in your private life, if you want to be a Federal judge. 
   How else can we tell if a nominee will be a ``liberal judicial activist''? In the case of Margaret Morrow, it was unfounded allegations that she was skeptical toward California voter initiatives. With respect to Marsha Berzon we were told that she would be an activist judge because she had been an ``aggressive'' advocate for her client, the AFL-CIO. Maybe we should advise lawyers in private practice who would like to be judges to be less vigorous in pursuing their clients' interests. Of course, since their confirmations neither of these nominees has been cited to be anything other than an outstanding judge. 
   Then there is the old-fashioned litmus test. As a member of the Missouri  Supreme Court, Justice White had committed the heresy of voting to reverse death sentences in some cases for serious legal error. No matter that Justice White voted to uphold the imposition of the death penalty 41 times. No matter that other members of the Missouri Supreme Court, including members of the Court appointed by Republican governors, had similar voting records and more often than not agreed with Justice White, both when he voted to uphold the death penalty and when he joined with a majority of that Court to reverse and remand such cases for resentencing or a new trial. Maybe someone should have advised Justice White to follow the Fourth Circuit model and bat a thousand for the State in death penalty cases, regardless of the evidence. 
   Another litmus test that has been dressed up as a sign of ``liberal judicial activism'': The nominee's willingness to enforce Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court's landmark abortion decision. I confess to some confusion as to how a nominee for a lower Federal court could be faulted for promising to adhere to established Supreme Court precedent. Whether you agree with Roe or not, it is, after all, the law of the land. But maybe someone should advise lower court judges to follow the lead of the Fourth Circuit in the Miranda case and disregard Supreme Court precedent. 
   We need to get away from rhetoric and litmus tests, and focus on rebuilding a constructive relationship between Congress and the courts. We need balance and moderation that respects the democratic will and the weight of precedent. We do not need partisan delays by anonymous Senators because a nominee clerked for Justice Brennan or contributed to the legal services organization. We do not need our Federal courts further packed for ideological purity. We do not need nominees put on hold for years, as this Republican Senate has done, while we screen them for their Republican sympathies and associations.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I often hear from members of the public who feel that the United States is spending too much on ``foreign aid.'' Why are we sending so much money abroad, they ask, when we have so many problems here at home? 
   This concerns me a great deal, because it has been shown over and over again that most Americans mistakenly believe that 15 percent of our national budget goes to foreign aid. In fact it is about 1 percent. The other 99 percent goes for our national defense and to fund other domestic programs--to build roads, support farmers, protect the environment, build schools and hospitals, pay for law enforcement, and countless other things the governments does.  
   The United States has by far the largest economy in the world. We are unquestionably the wealthiest country. The amount we spend on foreign aid totals only a few dollars per American per year. 
   What does the rest of the world look like? 
   Imagine, for a moment, if the world's population were shrunk to a population of 100 people, with the current ratios staying the same. Of those 100 people, 57 would be Asians. There would be 21 Europeans. Fourteen would be from North and South America. Eight would be Africans. 
   Of those 100 people, 52 would be women, and 48 would be men. Seventy would be non-White, and 30 would be White. Seventy would be non-Christian, and 30 would be Christian. 
   Six people would possess 59 percent of the world's wealth, and all 6 would be Americans. Think about that. 
   Fifty people--one half of the population, would suffer from malnutrition. 80 out of 100 would live in substandard housing, often without safe water to drink. 
   Seventy would be illiterate. Only 1 would have a college education. And only 1 would own a computer. 
   Are we spending too much on foreign aid? These statistics put things in perspective. I would suggest that there are two reasons to conclude that not only are we not spending too much, we are not spending enough. 
   First, we are a wealthy country--far wealthier than any other. Yes we have problems. Serious problems. But they pale in comparison to the deprivation endured by over a billion of the world's people who live in extreme poverty, with incomes of less than $1 per day. Like other industrialized countries, we have a moral responsibility to help. 
   Second, it is often said, but worth repeating, that our economy and our security are closely linked to the global economy and to the security of other countries. Although we call it foreign aid, it isn't just about helping others. These programs help us. 
   By raising incomes in poor countries we create new markets for American exports, the fastest growing sector of our economy. 
   Raising incomes abroad also reduces pressure on people to flee their own countries in search of a better life. One example that is close to home is Mexico, where half the population survives on an income of $2 per day. Every day, thousands of people cross illegally from Mexico into the United States, putting enormous strains on U.S. law enforcement. 
   Foreign aid programs support our democratic allies. There are few examples in history of a democracy waging war against another democracy. 
   These programs protect the environment and public health, by stopping air and water pollution, and combating the spread of infectious diseases that are only an airplane flight away from our shores. 
   They help deter the proliferation of weapons, including nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. 
   These are but a few examples of how ``foreign aid'' creates jobs here at home, and protects American interests abroad. 
   The American people need to know what we do with our foreign aid, and why in an increasingly interdependent world the only superpower should be doing more to protect our interests around the world, not less.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at the beginning of this year, I spoke to the Senate about the breakdown in the administration of capital punishment across the country and suggested some solutions. I noted then that for every 7 people executed, 1 death row inmate has been shown some time after conviction to be innocent of the crime. 
   Since then, many more fundamental problems have come to light. More court-appointed defense lawyers who have slept through trials in which their client has been convicted and sentenced to death; more cases--43 of the last 131 executions in Texas according to an investigation by the Chicago Tribune--in which lawyers who were disbarred, suspended or otherwise being disciplined for ethical violations have been appointed to represent people on trial for their lives; cases in which prosecutors have called for the death penalty based on the race of the victim; and cases in which potentially dispositive evidence has been destroyed or withheld from death row inmates for years. 
   We have also heard from the National Committee to Prevent Wrongful Executions, a blue-ribbon panel comprised of supporters and opponents of the death penalty, Democrats and Republicans, including six former State and Federal judges, a former U.S. Attorney, two former State Attorneys General, and a former Director of the FBI. That diverse group of experts has expressed itself to be ``united in [its] profound concern that, in recent years, and around the country, procedural safeguards and other assurances of fundamental fairness in the administration of capital punishment have been significantly diminished.'' 
   I have been working with prosecutors, judges and defense counsel, with death penalty supporters and opponents, and with Democrats and Republicans, to craft some basic common-sense reforms. I could not be more pleased that Senators GORDON SMITH, SUSAN COLLINS, JIM JEFFORDS, CARL LEVIN, RUSS FEINGOLD, and others here in the Senate, and Representatives RAY LAHOOD, WILLIAM DELAHUNT, and over 60 other members of both parties in the House have joined me in sponsoring the Innocence Protection Act of 2000. 
   The two most basic provisions of our bill would encourage the State to at  least make DNA testing available in the kind of case in which it can determine guilt or innocence and at least provide basic minimum standards for defense counsel so that capital trials have a chance of determining guilt or innocence by means of the adversarial testing of evidence that should be the hallmark of American criminal justice. 
   Our bill will not free the system of all human error, but it will do much to eliminate errors caused by the willful blindness to the truth that our capital punishment system has exhibited all too often. That is the least we should demand of a justice system that puts people's lives at stake.

   Mr. LEAHY. It is my hope that the national debate on the death penalty will continue, and that people of good conscience--both those who support the death penalty and those who oppose it--will join in our effort to make the system more fair and so reduce the risk that innocent people may be executed.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to comment briefly on the issue of H1-B visas. Like most if not all Democrats, I believe that the number of H1-B visas--which are used by foreign workers wishing to work in the United States--should be increased. 
   I also believe that we should address other immigration priorities. First, we should ensure that we treat all people who fled tyranny in Central America equally, regardless of whether the tyrannical regime they fled was a left-wing or a right-wing government. Congress has already acted to protect Nicaraguans and Cubans, as well it should. It is now time to apply the same protections to Guatemalans, Salvadorans, Hondurans, and also Haitians. 
   Second, we should prevent people on the verge of gaining legal permanent resident status from being forced to leave their jobs and their families for lengthy periods in order to complete the process. U.S. law allowed such immigrants to remain in the country until 1997, when Congress failed to renew the provision. It is now time to correct that error. 
   Third, we should allow people who have lived and worked here for 14 years or more, contributing to the American economy, to adjust their immigration status. This principle has been a part of American immigration law since the 1920s and should be updated now for the first time since 1986. 
   Vice President GORE shares these priorities, as reflected in a letter he wrote on July 26 to Congresswoman LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD. In this letter, he endorses an increase in the number of H1-B visas and each of the three proposals I have outlined briefly here today. The Vice President's position on this issue is the right position, and it is the compassionate position. I urge the Senate to take up S..2912, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act--a bill that would accomplish each of the three immigration goals I have just discussed--and pass it without further delay.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have heard a lot of outrageous examples of greed in my life but one of the worst is where pharmaceutical giants pay generic drug companies to keep low-cost drugs from senior citizens and from families. 
   If Dante were still alive today I am certain he would find a special resting place for those who engage in these conspiracies. 
   The Federal Trade Commission and the New York Times deserve credit for exposing this problem. Simply stated: some manufacturers of patented drugs--often brand-name drugs--are paying millions each month to generic drug companies to keep lower-cost products off the market. 
   This hurts senior citizens, it hurts families, it cheats healthcare providers and it is a disgrace. 
   These pharmaceutical giants and their generic partners then share the profits gained from cheating American families. 
   The companies have been able to get away with this by signing secret deals with each other not to compete. My bill, which I am introducing today, will expose these deals and subject them to immediate investigation and action by the Federal Trade Commission, or the Justice Department. This solves the most difficult problem faced by federal investigators--finding out about the improper deals. This bill does not change the so-called Hatch-Waxman Act, it does not amend FDA law, and it does not slow down the drug approval process. It allows existing antitrust laws to be enforced because the enforcement agencies have information about deals not to compete. 
   Fortunately, the FTC was able to get copies of a couple of these secret contracts and instantly lowered the boom on the companies

   Mr. LEAHY. This editorial neatly summarizes the problem and concludes that the FTC ``is taking aggressive action to curb the practice. It needs help from Congress to close loopholes in federal law.'' 
   My bill slams the door shut on would-be violators by exposing the deals to our competition enforcement agencies. 
   Under current law, manufacturers of generic drugs are encouraged to challenge weak or invalid patents on brand-name drugs so that consumers can enjoy lower generic drug prices. 
   Current law grants these generic companies a temporary protection from competition to the first manufacturer that gets permission to sell a generic drug before the patent on the brand-name drug expires. 
   This approach then gives the generic company a 180-day headstart on other generic companies. 
   That was a good idea--the unfortunate loophole exploited by a few is that secret deals can be made that allow the manufacturer of the generic drug to claim the 180-day grace period--to block other generic drugs from entering the market--while, at the same time, getting paid by the brand-name manufacturer to not sell the generic drug. 
   The bill I am introducing today will shut this loophole down for companies who want to cheat the public, but keeps the system the same for companies engaged in true competition with each other. This bill would give the FTC or the Justice Department the information it needs to take quick and decisive action against companies driven more by greed than by good sense. 
   I think it is important for Congress not to overreact in this case and throw out the good with the bad. Most generic companies want to take advantage of this 180-day provision and deliver quality generic drugs at much lower costs for consumers. We should not eliminate the incentive for them. 
   Instead, we should let the FTC and Justice look at every single deal that could lead to abuse so that only the deals that are consistent with the intent of that law will be allowed to stand. 
   This bill was quickly drafted because I wanted my colleagues to be able to look at it over the recess so that we can be ready to act when we get back in session. 
   I look forward to suggestions from other Members on this matter and from brand-name and generic companies who will work with me to make sure this loophole is closed. I am not interested in comments from companies who want to continue to cheat consumers. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print the bill in the RECORD.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators DEWINE, HATCH and VOINOVICH in introducing bipartisan legislation to provide common-sense tax incentives to help address asbestos liability issues. 
   I agree with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the Amchem Products decision that Congress can provide a secure, fair and efficient means of compensating victims of asbestos exposure. The appropriate role for Congress is to provide incentives for private parties to reach settlements, not to take away the legal rights of asbestos victims and their families. Our bipartisan bill provides these tax incentives for private parties involved in asbestos-related litigation to reach global settlements and for asbestos victims and their families receive the full benefit of the incentives. 
   Mr. President, encouraging fair settlements while still preserving the legal rights of all parties involved is a win-win situation for business and asbestos victims. For example, Rutland Fire Clay Company, a family-run, 117-year-old small business in my home state of Vermont, recently reached a settlement with its insurers and the trial bar concerning the firm's asbestos problems. Unlike some big businesses that are trying to avoid any accountability for their asbestos responsibilities through national ``tort reform'' legislation, the Rutland Fire Clay Company and its President, Tom Martin, are doing the right thing within the legal system. Mr. Martin plans to lead the family-run business from bankruptcy this year as a stronger firm with a solid financial foundation for its employees in the 21st Century. The tax incentives in our bipartisan bill will support the Rutland Fire Clay Company and its employees while providing financial security for its settlement with asbestos victims. 
   I believe it is in the national interest to encourage fair and expeditious settlements between companies and asbestos victims. The legislation we are introducing today will protect payments to victims while ensuring defendant firms remain solvent. I urge my colleagues to support our bipartisan legislation.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to briefly discuss a GAO report that was released earlier this week to be sure that other Senators are aware of. 
   The report, entitled ``Global Health: Framework for Infectious Disease Surveillance,'' was commissioned by Senator MCCONNELL and myself, and Senators FRIST and FEINGOLD. It investigates the existing global system, or network, of infectious disease surveillance, and will be followed by a second report which analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of this network and make recommendations for strengthening it. 
   We requested this report in response to a growing concern among public health officials about the inability of many countries to identify and track infectious diseases and respond promptly and effectively to disease outbreaks. In fact, the World Health Assembly determined in 1995 that the existing surveillance networks could not be considered adequate. 
   By way of background, the term ``surveillance'' covers four types of activities: detecting and reporting diseases; analyzing and confirming reports; responding to epidemics; and reassessing longer-term policies and programs. I will touch on these categories in a bit more detail, as they illustrate the need for reform. 
   In the detection and reporting phase, local health care providers diagnose diseases and then report the existence of pre-determined ``notifiable'' diseases to national or regional authorities. The accurate diagnosis of patients is obviously crucial, but it can be very difficult as many diseases share symptoms. It is even more difficult in developing countries, where public health professionals have less access to the newest information on diseases. 
   In the next stage of surveillance, disease patterns are analyzed and reported diseases are confirmed. This process occurs at a regional or national level, and usually involves lab work to confirm a doctor's diagnosis. From the resulting data, a response plan is devised. Officials must determine a number of other factors as well, such as the capability of a doctor to make an accurate diagnosis. Unfortunately, in many developing countries this process can take weeks, while the disease continues to spread. 
   When an epidemic is identified, various organizations must determine how to contain the disease, how to treat the infected persons, and how to inform the public about the 
   problem without causing panic. Forty-nine percent of internationally significant epidemics occur in complex emergency situations, such as overcrowded refugee camps. Challenges in responding to epidemics are mainly logistical--getting the necessary treatment to those in need. 
   Finally, in assessing the longer-term health policies and programs, surveillance teams can provide information on disease patterns, health care priorities, and the allocation of resources. However, information from developing countries is often unreliable. 
   I want to emphasize two points. The first is that all the activities that I have just described are done by what WHO calls a ``network of networks.'' There is, in fact, no global system for infectious disease surveillance. Let me repeat, for anyone who thinks there is some centrally-managed, well-organized global system, there is not. Rather, what exists is a loose network, a patch-work quilt of sorts, involving the UN, non-governmental organizations, national health facilities, military laboratories, and many other organizations, all of which depend upon each other for information, but with no standardized procedures. 
   The second point is that in countries where a tropical climate fosters many infectious diseases, one also finds the least amount of reliable data. If we as a country, or we as a global community, are committed to eradicating the deadliest diseases, building the capacity for effective surveillance in the developing countries is where we need to focus our attention. 
   The sequel to this report is due to be released by the GAO in a few months. It will assess the strengths and weaknesses of this loosely-organized surveillance system, and make recommendations for strengthening it. We need to  be able to accurately diagnose diseases, and quickly transmit the information to the global health community. 
   I urge other Senators to read this first report. This is an issue that has received far too little attention, and which directly affects the health of every American. Any disease, whether HIV/AIDS, malaria, TB, or others as yet unknown, which could infect and kill millions or tens of millions of people, is only an airplane flight away. 
   Accurate surveillance, which is the first step to an effective response, is critical. Yet today we are relying on a haphazard network of public, private, official, and unofficial components of varying degrees of reliability, patched together over time. It is a lot better than nothing, but the world needs a uniformly reliable, coordinated system with effective procedures that apply the highest standards. I look forward to GAO's next report, and its recommendations for action.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wanted to inform the Repubican leadership that the House of Representatives today passed the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, H.R. 4033, by an overwhelming vote of 413-3. I hope that the Senate will quickly follow suit and pass the House-passed bill and send it to the President. President Clinton has already endorsed this legislation to support our nation's law enforcement officers and is eager to sign it into law. 
   Senator CAMPBELL and I have introduced the Senate companion bill, S. 2413. Unfortunately, someone on the other side of the aisle has a hold on our bill. We have been working for the past week to urge the Senate to pass the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, S. 2413. The Senate Judiciary Committee passed our bill unanimously on June 29. It has been cleared by all 45 Democratic Senators. 
   But it still has not passed the full Senate. This is very disappointing to our nation's law enforcement officers who need life-saving bulletproof vests to protect themselves. Protecting and supporting our law enforcement community should not be a partisan issue. 
   Senator CAMPBELL and I worked together closely and successfully with the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the last Congress to pass the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998 into law. Senator HATCH is an original cosponsor this year's bill to reauthorize this grant program. Senators SCHUMER, KOHL, THURMOND, REED, JEFFORDS, ROBB, REID, SARBANES, BINGAMAN, ASHCROFT, EDWARDS, BUNNING, CLELAND, HUTCHISON, and ABRAHAM are also cosponsors of our bipartisan bill. 
   But for some reason a Republican senator has a hold on this bill to provide protection to our nation's law enforcement officers. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, more than 40 percent of the 1,182 officers killed by a firearm in the line of duty since 1980 could have been saved if they had been wearing body armor. Indeed, the FBI estimates that the risk of fatality to officers while not wearing body armor is 14 times higher than for officers wearing it. 
   To better protect our nation's law enforcement officers, Senator CAMPBELL and I introduced the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998. President Clinton signed our legislation into law on June 16, 1998. Our law created a $25 million, 50 percent matching grant program within the Department of Justice to help state and local law enforcement agencies purchase body armor for fiscal years 1999-2001. 
   In its two years of operation, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program has funded more than 180,000 new bulletproof vests for police officers across the country. 
   The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 builds on the success of this program by doubling its annual funding to $50 million for fiscal years 2002-2004. It also improves the program by guaranteeing jurisdictions with fewer than 100,000 residents receive the full 50-50 matching funds because of the tight budgets of these smaller communities and by making the purchase of stab-proof vests eligible for grant awards to protect corrections officers in close quarters in local and county jails. 
   More than ever before, police officers in Vermont and around the country face deadly threats that can strike at any time, even during routine traffic stops. Bulletproof vests save lives. It is essential the we update this law so that many more of our officers who are risking their lives everyday are able to protect themselves. 
   I hope this mysterious ``hold'' on the other side of the aisle will disappear. The Senate should pass without delay the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 and sent to the President for his signature into law.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to give my support to the Creating New Markets and Empowering America Act of 2000. In a time of unprecedented economic prosperity, there are too many communities in this nation that are beleaguered by crumbling infrastructures and stagnant economies. This legislation will help attract capital, produce much-needed housing, and encourage private investment to communities most in need. 
   I am proud to join in cosponsoring this legislation and would like to thank Senator ROBB for all his hard work in crafting this bill. Of particular importance to my home state of Vermont are increases in the Low Income Housing Tax Credit and Private Activity Bond cap. 
   Vermont is currently in the middle of an affordable housing crisis. Production has stalled and demand has risen. In Chittenden County, one of Vermont's most populated areas, residents face a rental vacancy rate of less than one percent. Housing costs are so expensive, middle income families are being forced into hotels, college dorms, homeless shelters, or left out on the street. Sadly, this is a situation that is being repeated nationwide. 
   As funding for other federal housing assistance programs has diminished, states depend more and more on the LIHTC and private activity bonds to finance affordable housing projects. The LIHTC has been extremely successful since its enactment as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Today, the LIHTC is one of the primary tools that states have to attract private investment in affordable rental housing. In Vermont, the LIHTC has made possible the production, rehabilitation, and preservation of over 2,600 affordable apartments since 1987. Unfortunately this credit has not been increased since its creation nearly fourteen years ago. Today, the demand for tax credits far exceeds their availability. This year in Vermont, over $2.5 million in credits were requested but only $718,000 were available. 
   I am pleased that this bill raises the annual per capita allocation of tax credits from $1.25 to $1.75 and indexes the credit to inflation. In addition to the increased per capita allocation, I hope to work a small state minimum. Such a floor would help to ensure that small states like Vermont have access to the resources they need to provide affordable housing for every resident in need. 
   Private activity bonds also play an important role in providing affordable housing for Vermonters. In 1986 the Federal Tax Reform Act limited the amount of tax-exempt bonds that each state could issue to no more than $50 per capita. There has not been an inflation adjustment to the cap since its inception. The Vermont Housing Finance Agency (VHFA) has issued over $1.25 billion in private activity bonds since 1974, bonds which have helped make the dream of home ownership a reality for over 20,425 Vermont households. I am pleased that this bill includes a cap increase from $50 to $75 per capita which will help Vermont's finance agencies continue this success. 
   Again, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill which will offer many households, businesses and communities new opportunities as we enter the 21st century. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing S. 2516, ``The Fugitive Apprehension Act of 2000.'' 
   During Senate Judiciary Committee consideration of this legislation, we were able to reconcile in the Thurmond-Biden-Leahy substitute amendment to S. 2516, the significant differences between that bill, as introduced, and S. 2761, ``The Capturing Criminals Act,'' which I introduced with Senator KOHL on June 21, 2000. I commend Senators THURMOND and BIDEN for their leadership on this issue and am glad we were able to make a number of changes to the bill to ensure that the authority granted is consistent with privacy and other appropriate safeguards. 
   As a former prosecutor, I am well aware that fugitives from justice are an important problem and that their capture is an essential function of law enforcement. According to the FBI, nearly 550,000 people are currently fugitives from justice on federal, state, and local felony charges combined. This means that there are almost as many fugitive felons as there are citizens residing in my home state of Vermont. 
   The fact that we have more than one half million fugitives from justice, a significant portion of whom are convicted felons in violation of probation or parole, who have been able to flaunt courts order and avoid arrest, breeds disrespect for our laws and poses undeniable risks to the safety of our citizens. 
   Our federal law enforcement agencies should be commended for the job they have been doing to date on capturing federal fugitives and helping the states and local communities bring their fugitives to justice. The U.S. Marshals Service, our oldest law enforcement agency, has arrested over 120,000 federal, state and local fugitives in the past four years, including more federal fugitives than all the other federal agencies combined. In prior years, the Marshals Service spearheaded special fugitive apprehension task forces, called FIST Operations, that targeted fugitives in particular areas and was singularly successful in arresting over 34,000 fugitive felons. 
   Similarly, the FBI has established twenty-four Safe Streets Task Forces exclusively focused on apprehending fugitives in cities around the country. Over the period of 1995 to 1999, the FBI's efforts have resulted in the arrest of a total of 65,359 state fugitives. 
   Nevertheless, the number of outstanding fugitives is too large. The substitute amendment we consider today will help make a difference by providing new but limited administrative subpoena authority to the Department of Justice to obtain documentary evidence helpful in tracking down fugitives and by authorizing the Attorney General to establish fugitive task forces. 
   ``Administrative subpoena'' is the term generally used to refer to a demand for documents or testimony by an investigative entity or regulatory agency that is empowered to issue the subpoena independently and without the approval of any grand jury, court or other judicial entity. I am generally skeptical of administrative subpoena power. Administrative subpoenas avoid the strict grand jury secrecy rules and the documents provided in response to such subpoenas are, therefore, subject to broader dissemination. Moreover, since investigative agents issue such subpoenas directly, without review by  a judicial officer or even a prosecutor, fewer ``checks'' are in place to ensure the subpoena is issued with good cause and not merely as a fishing expedition. 
   Nonetheless, unlike initial criminal inquiries, fugitive investigations present unique difficulties. Law enforcement may not use grand jury subpoenas since, by the time a person is a fugitive, the grand jury phase of an investigation is usually over. Use of grand jury subpoenas to obtain phone or bank records to track down a fugitive would be an abuse of the grand jury. Trial subpoenas may also not be used, either because the fugitive is already convicted or no trial may take place without the fugitive. 
   This inability to use trial and grand jury subpoenas for fugitive investigations creates a gap in law enforcement procedures. Law enforcement partially fills this gap by using the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C.  1651(a), which authorizes federal courts to ``issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.'' The procedures, however, for obtaining orders under this Act, and the scope and non-disclosure terms of such orders, vary between jurisdictions. 
   Thus, authorizing administrative subpoena power will help bridge the gap in fugitive investigations to allow federal law enforcement agencies to obtain records useful for tracking a fugitive's whereabouts. 
   The Thurmond-Biden-Leahy substitute amendment incorporates a number of provisions from the Leahy-Kohl ``Capturing Criminals Act'' and makes significant and positive modifications to the original version of S. 2516. First, as introduced, S. 2516 would have limited use of an administrative subpoena to those fugitives who have been ``indicted,'' and failed to address the fact that fugitives flee after arrest on the basis of a ``complaint'' and may flee after the prosecutor has filed an ``information'' in lieu of an indictment. The substitute amendment, by contrast, would allow use of such subpoenas to track fugitives who have been accused in a ``complaint, information or indictment.'' 
   Second, S. 2516, as introduced, would have required the U.S. Marshal Service to report quarterly to the Attorney General (who must transmit the report to Congress) on use of the administrative subpoenas. While a reporting requirement is useful, the requirement as described in the original S. 2516 was overly burdensome and insufficiently specific. The substitute amendment, as in the Capturing Criminals Act, would require the Attorney General to report for the next three years to the Judiciary Committees of both the House and Senate with the following information about the use of administrative subpoenas in fugitive investigations: the number issued, by which agency, 
   identification of the charges on which the fugitive was wanted and whether the fugitive was wanted on federal or state charges. 
   Third, although the original S. 2516 outlined the procedures for enforcement of an administrative subpoena, it was silent on the mechanisms for contesting the subpoena by the recipient. The substitute amendment expressly addresses this issue. As set forth in the Capturing Criminals Act, this substitute amendment would allow a person who is served with an administrative subpoena to petition a court to modify or set aside the subpoena on grounds that compliance would be ``unreasonable or oppressive'' (a standard used in Fed. R. Crim. P. 17 for trial subpoenas) or would violate constitutional or other legal rights of the person. 
   Fourth, the original S. 2516 did not provide, or set forth a procedure, for the government to command a custodian of records not to disclose or to delay notice to a customer about the existence of the subpoena. This is particularly critical in fugitive investigations when law enforcement does not want to alert the fugitive that the police are on his/her trail. The substitute amendment incorporates from the Capturing Criminals Act the express authority for law enforcement to apply for a court order directing the custodian of records to delay notice to subscribers of the existence of the subpoena on the same terms applicable in current law to other subpoenas issued to phone companies and other electronic service providers and to banks. 
   Fifth, the original S. 2516 did not provide any immunity from civil liability for persons complying with administrative subpoenas in fugitive investigations. As in the Capturing Criminals Act, the substitute amendment would provide immunity from civil liability for good faith compliance with an administrative subpoena, including non-disclosure in compliance with the terms of a court order. 
   Sixth, S. 2516, as introduced, would have authorized use of an administrative subpoena upon a finding by the Attorney General that the documents are ``relevant and material,'' which is further defined to mean that ``there are articulable facts that show the fugitive's whereabouts may be discerned from the records sought.'' Changing the standard for issuance of a subpoena from ``relevancy'' to a hybrid of ``relevant and material'' sets a confusing and bad precedent. Accordingly, the substitute amendment would authorize issuance of an administrative subpoena for documents if the Attorney General finds based upon articulable facts that they are relevant to discerning the fugitive's whereabouts. 
   Seventh, the original S. 2516 authorized the Attorney General to issue guidelines delegating authority for issuance of administrative subpoenas only to the Director of the U.S. Marshals Service, despite the fact that the FBI, and the Drug Enforcement Administration also want this authority to find fugitives on charges over which they have investigative authority. The substitute amendment would authorize the Attorney General to issue guidelines delegating authority for issuance of administrative subpoenas to supervisory personnel within components of the Department. 
   Eighth, the original S. 2516 did not address the issue that a variety of administrative subpoena authorities exist in multiple forms in every agency. The substitute amendment incorporates from the Capturing Criminals Act a requirement that the Attorney General provide a report on this issue. 
   Finally, as introduced, S. 2516 authorized the U.S. Marshal Service to establish permanent Fugitive Apprehension Task Forces. By contrast, the substitute amendment would authorize $40,000,000 over three years for the Attorney General to establish multi-agencytask forces (which will be coordinated by the Director of the Marshals Service) in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the States, so that the Secret Service, BATF, the FBI and the States are able to participate in the Task Forces to find their fugitives. 
   This Thurmond-Biden-Leahy substitute amendment makes necessary changes to this bill that will help law enforcement--with increased resources for regional fugitive apprehension task forces and administrative subpoena authority--bring to justice both federal and state fugitives who, by their conduct, have demonstrated a lack of respect for our nation's criminal justice system.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am sorry I was not on the Senate floor to hear Chairman HATCH earlier this afternoon. I was attending an important confirmation hearing and chairing a meeting of the bipartisan Internet Caucus. I spoke to the issue of judicial nominations last Friday and say, again, with 60 current and longstanding vacancies within the federal judiciary, and seven more on the horizon, we cannot afford to stop or slow down the little progress we are making. 
   Our hearing today included three nominees moved forward to fill positions on the District Court of Arizona that have all been declared judicial emergencies. Each of the nominees was nominated last Friday. They are now having their hearing, they look forward to being voted out of committee on Thursday and approved by the Senate before the week is out--within one week of nomination. This demonstrates what we can do when we want to take action. All the talk about needing six months or more to process and review nominees is just that--talk. If all goes according to schedule, these nominees will be in and out of the Senate in less than one week. 
   We could do that with a number of nominees. Instead, this is a Senate that has kept highly-qualified nominees, such as Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, waiting for years before they get a vote. There is just no reason to have a qualified nominee like Judge Helene White of Michigan held hostage for over 42 months without a hearing. 
   I am disappointed to have seen another hearing come and go without even one nominee to fill one of the many vacancies to the Courts of Appeals around the country. I was encouraged to hear Senator LOTT recently say that he continues to urge the Judiciary Committee to make progress on judicial nominations. The Majority Leader said: ``There are a number of nominations that have had hearings, nominations that are ready for a vote and other nominations that have been pending for quite some time and that should be considered.'' He went on to note that the groups of judges he expects us to report to the Senate will include ``not only district judges but circuit judges.'' Unfortunately, the Committee has not honored the Majority Leader's representations and was only willing to consider a few District Court nominees at today's hearing. Pending before the Committee are a dozen nominees to the Federal Courts of Appeals who are awaiting a hearing--12 nominees, not one of which the Republican Majority saw fit to include in this hearing. Left off the agenda are Judge Helene White of Michigan, who is now the longest pending judicial nomination at over 42 months without even a hearing; Barry Goode, whose nomination to the Ninth Circuit was the subject of Senator FEINSTEIN's statements at our Committee meeting last Thursday and who has been pending for over two years; as well as a number of qualified minority nominees whom I have been speaking about throughout the year, including Kathleen McCree Lewis of Michigan, Enrique Moreno of Texas and Roger Gregory of Virginia. 
   I noted for the Senate last Friday that there continue to be multiple vacancies on the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, Tenth and District of Columbia Circuits. With 20 vacancies, our appellate courts have nearly half of the total judicial emergency vacancies in the federal court system. I know how fond our Chairman is of percentages, so I note that the vacancy rate for our Courts of Appeals is more than 11 percent nationwide. Of course that vacancy rate does not begin to take into account the additional judgeships requested by the Judicial Conference to handle their increased workloads. If we added the 11 additional appellate judges being requested, the vacancy rate would be 16 percent. By comparison, the vacancy rate at the end of the Bush Administration, even after a Democratic Majority had acted in 1990 to add 11 new judgeships for the Courts of Appeals, was only 11 percent. Even though the Congress has not approved a single new Circuit Court position 
   within the federal judiciary since 1990, the Republican Senate has by design lost ground in filling vacancies on our appellate courts. 
   At our first Judiciary Committee meeting of the year, I noted the opportunity we had to make bipartisan strides toward easing the vacancy crisis in our nation's federal courts. I believed that a confirmation total of 65 by the end of the year was achievable if we made the effort, exhibited the commitment, and did the work that was needed to be done. I urged that we proceed promptly with confirmations of a number of outstanding nominations to the Court of Appeals, including qualified minority and women candidates. 
   Yet only five nominees to the appellate courts around the country have had nomination hearings this year and only three of those five have been reported by the Committee to the Senate and confirmed--only three all year. The Committee included no Court of Appeals nominees at the hearings on April 27 and July 12, and there are no Court of Appeals nominee at the hearing today. The Committee has yet to report the nomination of Allen Snyder to the District of Columbia Circuit, although his hearing was 11 weeks ago, or the nomination of Bonnie Campbell to the Eighth Circuit, although her hearing was eight weeks ago. The Republican candidate for President talks about final Senate action on nominations within 60 days and we cannot get the Committee to report some nominations within 60 days of their hearing. 
   There is no good reason to have a qualified nominee such as Judge Helene White of Michigan held hostage for over 42 months without a hearing--42 months, and she has not even gotten a hearing. We had two men who were nominated last Friday, and they had a hearing today. They will probably be confirmed this week. Helene White has been held hostage for over 42 months without a hearing. She is the record holder for judicial nominees who have had to wait for a hearing--and her wait continues. It is insulting to the people of Michigan, insulting to the court, and insulting to her. The people of Michigan deserve a vote up or down on this outstanding lawyer and Judge from Michigan.  
   Now why do I keep mentioning this? I keep mentioning it because, frankly, we are doing a poor job in confirming judges. I compare this to the last year of President Bush's term. We had a Democratic majority in the Senate. We confirmed twice as many judges then as this Senate is confirming now with a Republican majority and a Democratic President. Something was said the other day that, well, the Democrats are in the minority, and that is probably why they complain so. Well, heavens, I would be happy to have the complaints of the Republicans when they were in the minority. The Democrats moved twice as many judges for a Republican President as Republicans are moving for a Democratic President. It is a simple fact. 
   The soon-to-be presidential nominee of the Republican Party has said--and I agree with him--that this is wrong, the Senate ought to vote these people up or down in 60 days. Of course, we could do that. There is a concern that has been expressed--and rightly so--that so many nominees are held without any vote. Nobody votes against them, but nobody gets an opportunity to vote for them; they just sit there. And even though the criticism stings, the fact is that, on average, women and minorities take longer to go through this Senate than white males do. Some women, some minorities have gone through very quickly, but most have taken longer. 
   I said earlier that I do not see any sense of bias or sexism in our chairman. I have known him for over 20 years, and I have never heard him make a biased remark or a sexist remark during that whole time. But something is happening, somewhere they are being held up. It is wrong. One of the things that most Republicans and Democrats ought to be able to agree on is what Governor Bush said: Do it and vote them up or down in 60 days. Let's make a decision. 
   Some of these people got held up for 2 or 3 or 4 years. When 
   they finally got a vote, they passed overwhelmingly. But for 2 or 3 or 4 years they were humiliated, caused to dangle, have their law practices fall apart, have people question what was going on. Why? Because one or two Senators thought they should be held up. Well, let those one or two Senators vote against them. We are paid to vote yes or no, not maybe. I do not know whether it is because they are women, because they are Hispanic, because they are too liberal, or too conservative, too active, not active enough, that people don't want them to be confirmed. Let them vote against them. 
   I argued, when we had a very distinguished African American justice of a State supreme court, that we ought to let him at least have a vote. We had a vote after 2 years and, on a party line vote, he was voted down. Every single Republican voted against him, and every single Democrat voted for him, even though he had the highest rating of the American Bar Association, even though he was a justice of his state's highest court, and even though he was one of the most outstanding nominees either of a Democratic or Republican President to come before the Senate. At least he had a vote. I think the vote was wrong; he should have been confirmed. But at least he had a vote. 
   I also worry about are all these people who are not even given a vote. 
   Senator HATCH compared this year's confirmation total against totals from other Presidential election years. The only year to which this can be favorably compared is 1996 when the Republican majority in the Senate refused to confirm even a single appellate court judge to the Federal bench. The total that year was zero. That is hardly a comparison in which to take pride. I say let us compare 1992, in which there was a Democratic majority in the Senate and a Republican President. We confirmed 11 court of appeals nominees during that Republican President's last year in office--11 court of appeals nominees, and 66 judges in all. In fact, we went out in October of that year. We were having hearings in September. We were having people confirmed in October. 
   So do not come here and say the Democrats are not well grounded in complaining about what is happening. We established the way nonpartisanship can work in confirming judges. We did it for Republican Presidents. Obviously, it is not being done for a Democratic President. What we did in 1992, between July 24 and October 8, was the Senate confirmed 32 judicial nominees. We ought to try to do the same here, basically, from now until about the time we go out. Again, the last time that happened at the end of a President's term, the Democrats helped get 32 judges through during that period of 10 weeks at the end of the Congress. Well, we ought to do the same here. The Republicans ought to be willing to do the same thing. 
   In fact, in 1992 the Committee held 15 hearings--twice as many as this Committee has found time to hold this year. Late that year, we met on July 29, August 4, August 11, and September 24, and all of the nominees who had hearings then were eventually confirmed before adjournment. We have a long way to go before we can think about resting on any laurels. 
   Having begun so slowly in the first half of this year, we have much more to do before the Senate takes its final action on judicial nominees this year. We cannot afford to follow the ``Thurmond Rule'' and stop acting on these nominees now in anticipation of the presidential election in November. We must use all the time until adjournment to remedy the vacancies that have been perpetuated on the courts to the detriment of the American people and the administration of justice. That should be a top priority for the Senate for the rest of this year. In the last 10 weeks of the 1992 session, between July 24 and October 8, 1992, the Senate confirmed 32 judicial nominations. I will work with the Republican Majority to try to match that record. 
   One of our most important constitutional responsibilities as United States Senators is to advise and consent on the scores of judicial nominations sent to us to fill the vacancies on the federal courts around the country. I continue to urge the Senate to meet its responsibilities to all nominees, including women and minorities. That these highly qualified nominees are being needlessly delayed is most regrettable. The President spoke to this situation earlier this month in his appearance before the NAACP. The Senate should join with the President to confirm these well-qualified, diverse and fair-minded nominees to fulfill the needs of the federal courts around the country. 
   The Arizona vacancies are each judicial emergency vacancies. Two were authorized in appropriations legislation last year when the Republicans Majority continued its refusal to consider a bill to meet the judicial Conference's recommendation for 72 additional judges around the country. All we were able to authorize were a few judgeships in Arizona, Florida and Nevada. That points out one of the reasons that the comparisons that Chairman HATCH is seeking to draw to the vacancy rates at the end of the Bush Administration are incorrect. During President Reagan's Administration and again during the Bush Administration, Congress added a significant number of new judgeships. The so-called vacancy rate that Senator HATCH is so fond of citing at the end of the Bush Administration is highly inflated by the addition of 85 new judgeships in 1990 and by the addition of 87 new judgeships in 1984, of which many where yet to be filled. By contrast the vacancies currently plaguing the federal courts are longstanding and in spite of Republican intransigence against authorizing additional judgeships requested by the Judicial Conference since 1996. If those additional judgeships were taken into account, the vacancy rate today would be over 13 percent with over 120 vacancies--hardly a comparison that the Republican majority would want to make, but that would be comparing comparable figures. 
   In addition, even running the gauntlet and getting a confirmation hearing does not automatically guarantee someone a vote before the current Judiciary Committee. Bonnie Campbell, nominated by the President on March 2, 2000, has completed the nomination and hearing process and is strongly supported by Senator GRASSLEY and Senator HARKIN from her home state. But her name continues to be left off the agenda at our executive meetings for the last several weeks. She is a former Iowa Attorney General and former high ranking Justice Department official who has worked extensively on domestic violence and crime  victims matters. Allen Snyder is another well-respected and highly-qualified nominee who got a hearing but no Committee vote. He was nominated on September 22, 1999, received the highest rating from the ABA, enjoys the full support of his home state Senators, and had his hearing on May 10, 2000. There are and have been many others. 
   I continue to urge the Senate to meet its responsibilities to all nominees, including women and minorities. That highly-qualified nominees are being needlessly delayed is most regrettable. The Senate should join with the President to confirm well-qualified, diverse and fair-minded nominees to fulfill the needs of the federal courts around the country. 
   More than two years ago Chief Justice William Rehnquist warned that ``vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary.'' The New York Times reported last year how the crushing workload in the federal appellate courts has led to what it calls a ``two-tier system'' for appeals, skipping oral arguments in more and more cases. Law clerks and attorney staff are being used more and more extensively in the determination of cases as backlogs grow. Bureaucratic imperatives seem to be replacing the judicial deliberation needed for the fair administration of justice. These are not the ways to 
   continue the high quality of decisionmaking for which our federal courts are admired or to engender confidence in our justice system. 
   When the President and the Chief Justice spoke out, the Senate briefly got about its business of considering judicial nominations last year. Unfortunately, last year the Republican majority returned to the stalling tactics of 1996 and 1997 and judicial vacancies are again growing in both number and duration. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote at the end of 1997: ``The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.'' The Senate is not defeating judicial nominations in up or down votes on their qualifications but refusing to consider them and killing them through inaction. 
   During Republican control it has taken two-year periods for the Senate to match the one-year total of 101 judges confirmed in 1994, when we were on course to end the vacancies gap. Nominees like Judge Helene White, Barry Goode, Judge Legrome Davis, and J. Rich Leonard, deserve to be treated with dignity and dispatch--not delayed for two and three years. We are still seeing outstanding nominees nitpicked and delayed to the point that good women and men are being deterred from seeking to serve as federal judges. Nominees practicing law see their work put on hold while they await the outcome of their nominations. Their families cannot plan. They are left to twist in the wind. All of this despite the fact that, by all objective accounts and studies, the judges that President Clinton has appointed have been a moderate group, rendering moderate decisions, and certainly including far fewer ideologues than were nominated during the Reagan Administration. 
   Federal law enforcement relies on judges to hear criminal cases, and individuals and businesses pay taxes to exercise their right to resolve civil disputes in the federal courts. As workloads continue to grow and vacancies are perpetuated, the remaining judges are being overwhelmed and the work of the federal judiciary is suffering. 
   Our independent federal judiciary sets us apart from virtually all others in the world. Every nation that in this century has moved toward democracy has sent observers to the United States in their efforts to emulate our judiciary. Those fostering this slowdown of the confirmation process and other attacks on the judiciary are risking harm to institutions that protect our personal freedoms and independence. 
   What progress we started making two years ago has been lost and the Senate is again failing even to keep up with normal attrition. Far from closing the vacancies gap, the number of current vacancies has grown from 57, when Congress recessed last year, to 60. Since some like to speak in terms of percentage, I should note that the judicial vacancy rate now stands at over seven percent of the federal judiciary (60/852). If one considers the 63 additional judges recommended by the judicial conference, the vacancies rate would be over 13 percent (123/915). 
   What is most significant about the recent trend of judicial vacancies and vacancy rates is that the vacancies that existed in 1993 (after the creation of 85 new judgeships in 1990) had been cut almost in half in 1994, when the rate was reduced to 7.4% with 63 vacancies at the end of the 103rd Congress. We continued to make progress even into 1995. In fact, the vacancy rate was lowered to 5.8% after the 1995 session, and before the partisan attack on federal judges began in earnest in 1996 and 1997. 
   Progress in the reduction of judicial vacancies was reversed in 1996, when Congress adjourned leaving 64 vacancies, and in 1997, when Congress adjourned leaving 80 vacancies and a 9.5% rate. No one was happier than I that the Senate was able to make progress in 1998 toward reducing the vacancy rate. I praised Senator HATCH for his effort. Unfortunately, the vacancies are now growing again. 
   Let me also set the record straight, yet again, on the 
   erroneous but oft-repeated argument that ``the Clinton Administration is on record as having stated that a vacancy rate just over 7% is virtual full-employment of the judiciary.'' That is not true. 
   The statement can only be alluded to an October 1994 press release. That press release cannot be construed or even fairly misconstrued in this manner. That press release was pointing out at the end of the 103rd Congress that if the Senate proceeded to confirm the 14 nominees then on the Senate calendar, it would have reduced the judicial vacancy rate to 4.7%, which the press release then proceeded to compare to a favorable unemployment rate of under 5%. 
   This was not a statement of administration position or even a policy statement but a poorly designed press release that included an ill-conceived comment. Job vacancy rates and unemployment rates are not comparable. Unemployment rates are measures of people who do not have jobs not of federal offices vacant without an appointed office holder. 
   When I learned that some Republicans had for partisan purposes seized upon this press release, taken it out of context, ignored what the press release actually said and were manipulating it into a misstatement of Clinton administration policy, I asked the Attorney General, in 1997, whether there was any level or percentage of judicial vacancies that the administration considered acceptable or equal to ``full employment.'' 
   The Department responded:  
   There is no level or percentage of vacancies that justifies a slow down in the Senate on the confirmation of nominees for judicial positions. While the Department did once, in the fall of 1994, characterize a 4.7 percent vacancy rate in the federal judiciary as the equivalent of the Department of Labor `full employment' standard, that characterization was intended simply to emphasize the hard work and productivity of the Administration and the Senate in reducing the extraordinary number of vacancies in the federal Article III judiciary in 1993 and 1994. Of course, there is a certain small vacancy rate, due to retirements and deaths and the time required by the appointment process, that will always exist. The current vacancy rate is 11.3 percent. It did reach 12 percent this past summer. The President and the Senate should continually be working diligently to fill vacancies as they arise, and should always strive to reach 100 percent capacity for the federal bench.  
   At no time has the Clinton administration stated that it believes that 7 percent vacancies on the federal bench is acceptable or a virtually full federal bench. Only Republicans have expressed that opinion. As the Justice Department noted two years ago in response to an inquiry on this very questions, the Senate should be ``working diligently to fill vacancies as they arise, and should always strive to reach 100 percent capacity for the federal bench.'' 
   Indeed, I informed the Senate of these facts in a statement in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD on July 7, 1998, so that there would be no future misunderstanding or misstatement of the record. Nonetheless, in spite of the facts and in spite of my July 1998 statement, these misleading statements continue to be repeated. 
   The Senate should get about the business of voting on the confirmation  of the scores of judicial nominations that have been delayed with justification for too long. We must redouble our efforts to work with the President to end the longstanding vacancies that plague the federal courts and disadvantage all Americans. That is our constitutional responsibility. It should not be shirked. 
   I am sorry that Senator HATCH feels that he is being attacked from all sides. I regret that some on his side of the aisle and other critics have sought to prevent him from doing his duty. I 
   have gone out of my way to compliment the Chairman when praise was warranted and to keep my criticism from becoming personal. 
   With respect to the Senate's treatment of nominees who are women or minorities, I remain vigilant. I have said that I do not regard Senator HATCH as a biased person. I have also been outspoken in my concern about the manner in which we are failing to consider qualified minority and women nominees over the last four years. From Margaret Morrow and Margaret McKeown and Sonia Sotomayor, through Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, and including Judge James Beatty, Judge James Wynn, Roger Gregory, Enrique Moreno and all the other qualified women and minority nominees who have been delayed and opposed over the last four years, I have spoken out. The Senate may never remove the blot that occurred last October when the Republican Senators emerged from a Republican Caucus to vote lockstep against Justice Ronnie White to be a Federal District Court Judge in Missouri. 
   The United States Senate is the scene where some 50 years ago, in October 1949, the Senate confirmed President Truman's nomination of William Henry Hastie to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the first Senate confirmation of an African American to our federal district courts and courts of appeal. This Senate is also where some 30 years ago the Senate confirmed President Johnson's nomination of Thurgood Marshall to the United States Supreme Court. 
   And this is where last October, the Senate wrongfully rejected President Clinton's nomination of Justice Ronnie White. That vote made me doubt seriously whether this Senate, serving at the end of a half century of progress, would have voted to confirm Judge Hastie or Justice Marshall. 
   On October 5, 1999, the Senate Republicans voted in lockstep to reject the nomination of Justice Ronnie White to the federal court in Missouri--a nomination that had been waiting 27 months for a vote. For the first time in almost 50 years a nominee to a federal district court was defeated by the United States Senate. There was no Senate debate that day on the nomination. There was no open discussion--just that which took place behind the closed doors of the Republican caucus lunch that led to the party-line vote. 
   It is unfortunate that the Republican Senate has on a number of occasions delayed consideration of too many women and minority nominees. The treatment of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon are examples from earlier this year. Both of these nominees were eventually confirmed this past March by wide margins. 
   I have been calling for the Senate to work to ensure that all nominees are given fair treatment, including a fair vote for the many minority and women candidates who remain pending. According to the report released last September by the Task Force on Judicial Selection of Citizens for Independent Courts, the time it has been taking for the Senate to consider nominees has grown significantly and during the 105th Congress, minorities and women nominees took significantly longer to gain Senate consideration than white male nominees: 60 days longer for non-whites, and 65 days longer for women than men. The study verified that the time to confirm female nominees was now significantly longer than that to confirm male nominees--a difference that has defied logical explanation. They recommend that ``the responsible officials address this matter to assure that candidates for judgeships are not treated differently based on their gender.'' 
   On July 13, 2000, President Clinton spoke before the NAACP Convention in Baltimore and lamented the fact that the Senate has been slow to act on his judicial nominees who are women and minorities. He said: ``The quality of justice suffers when highly-qualified women and minority candidates, fully vested, fully supported by the American Bar Association, are denied the opportunity to serve for partisan political reasons.'' He went on 
   to say: ``The face of injustice is not compassion; it is indifference, or worse. For the integrity of the courts and the strength of our Constitution, I ask the Republicans to give these people a vote. Vote them down if you don't want them on.'' I agree with the President. 
   The Senate should be moving forward to consider the nominations of Judge James Wynn, Jr. and Roger Gregory to the Fourth Circuit. When confirmed, Judge Wynn and Mr. Gregory will be the first African-Americans to serve on the Fourth Circuit and will each fill a judicial emergency vacancy. Fifty years has passed since the confirmation of Judge Hastie to the Third Circuit and still there has never been an African-American on the Fourth Circuit. The nomination of Judge James A. Beatty, Jr., was previously sent to us by President Clinton in 1995. That nomination was never considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee or the Senate and was returned to President Clinton without action at the end of 1998. It is time for the Senate to act on a qualified African-American nominee to the Fourth Circuit. President Clinton spoke powerfully about these matters last week. We should respond not by misunderstanding or mischaracterizing what he said, but by taking action on this well-qualified nominees. 
   In addition, the Senate should act favorably on the nominations of Judge Helene White and Kathleen McCree Lewis to the Sixth Circuit, Bonnie Campbell to the Eighth Circuit, and Enrique Moreno to the Fifth Circuit. Mr. Moreno succeeded to the nomination of Jorge Rangel on which the Senate refused to act last Congress. These are well-qualified nominees who will add to the capabilities and diversity of those courts. In fact, the Chief Judge of the Fifth Circuit declared that a judicial emergency exists on that court, caused by the number of judicial vacancies, the lack of Senate action on pending nominations, and the overwhelming workload. 
   I am disappointed that the Committee has not reported the nomination of Bonnie Campbell to the Eighth Circuit. She completed the nomination and hearing process two months ago and is strongly supported by Senator GRASSLEY and Senator HARKIN from her home state. She will make an outstanding judge. 
   Filling these vacancies with qualified nominees is the concern of all Americans. The Senate should treat minority and women and all nominees fairly and proceed to consider them without delay. 
   I think it was unfortunate that the chairman tried to assign blame for the Senate's lack of progress on a number of legislative items. I disagree with that assessment. He knows, as I do, that the Democratic leader made a proposal that would have moved the H-1B legislation and allowed votes on the humanitarian immigration issues. The Republicans refused Senator DASCHLE's offer. We all know the Democrats have not opposed the religious liberty bill Senator KENNEDY helped develop. We all know we have been pressing for reauthorization of the Violence Against Women's Act for many months. It is not fair to suggest Democrats are holding that up. 
   I will give you one other example. I am getting calls from police organizations, and I see the distinguished assistant minority leader, the Senator from Nevada, who served as a police officer. He will understand this. I am getting calls from police organizations all over the country. 
   They ask me: Why hasn't the Campbell-Leahy bill to provide more bulletproof vests passed? Why hasn't it gone through the Senate? I tell my friend from Nevada what I told them. I said: My friend from Nevada, who is the Democratic whip, has checked, as I have, with every single Democrat, and every single Democrat is willing to pass it this minute by unanimous consent. We said that to the Republican leader. 
   We were told there was an objection on the Republican side. My goodness. Have we gotten so partisan that a bill  sponsored by the distinguished Senator from Colorado, Mr. CAMPBELL, by myself and the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. HATCH, a bill to provide bulletproof vests--cosponsored by the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. REID, as well--that a bill to provide bulletproof vests for law enforcement officers is being stalled by Republican objections? That is wrong. 
   If that bill were allowed to come to the floor for a vote, I am willing to bet--in fact, I know because we have already checked--that every Democratic Senator would vote for it. But I am also willing to bet that virtually every Republican Senator would vote for it. This is not a Democrat or Republican bill. In fact, Senator CAMPBELL and I have specifically worked to make sure it is not a partisan bill. 
   So I tell my friends from law enforcement: Please call the other side of the aisle. I am convinced that a majority of Republicans support it, but somebody on the Republican side is holding it up. The Democrats are willing to pass it immediately. 
   The chairman of the Judiciary Committee knows we were working toward a bankruptcy bill until the Republicans decided to end bipartisan discussion and negotiate among themselves and not negotiate with the Democrats. 
   He knows we should have passed the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act weeks, if not months, ago. I tell the business community that continuously asks me that every single Democrat is willing to move forward with it. It has been stalled on the Republican side. 
   In fact, let me take a bill involving the two of us. The Hatch-Leahy juvenile crime bill passed the Senate in May of 1999. Again, I ask my friend from Nevada: As I recall, that passed with 73 votes, Democrats and Republicans, the majority of both parties. It passed the Senate with 73 votes. 
   My friend from Utah is the chair of the House-Senate conference. But we haven't convened in almost a year. It is a bill that should have been enacted last year. But we will not even have a conference. Seventy-three Senators voted for that bill--73. We can't get the conference to meet on it and the Senate controls the conference. 
   These are a lot of items, such as the H-1B legislation, the religious liberty bill, the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization, the bulletproof vest bill, the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act, the Hatch-Leahy juvenile crime bill, the bankruptcy bill. These are things that can move forward. But there seems to be no movement from the other side. 
   I will continue to try to find ways to work with the distinguished chairman, my friend from the Judiciary Committee, to make progress. I point out that we worked together on civil asset forfeiture reform, and it passed. We worked together on intellectual property and antitrust matters. Those measures pass with a majority of Republicans and Democrats joining us. But now we find legislation on the bulletproof vest bill, which most of us agree on, that we cannot get passed. We find nominations on which we cannot get a vote--even when the soon to be Republican nominee for the Presidency, Governor Bush, said we ought to vote them up or down within 60 days. We can't get votes on them. Some stay stalled for months and years by humiliating delay. 
   I have spoken about how humiliating it must be to somebody who is nominated for a judgeship--the pinnacle of their legal career. They get nominated. The American Bar and others looked at them, and said: This is an outstanding person, an outstanding lawyer, and they would be a terrific jurist. Usually we get inundated with letters from lawyers--Republicans and Democrats alike--who say they know this man or woman and he or she would make a superb judge. The FBI and others do the background check --as thorough as you can imagine, such that most people in private life would never be able to put up with it. Their privacy is just shredded. They come back and say: This is an outstanding person. 
   If they are in private practice, they are congratulated by their partners in their firm. They say how wonderful it is. They realize, of course, that the nominee can't take on any more new cases because no one wants conflicts of interest. They kind of suggest as soon as they have this party that the nominee can sort of move out so the rest of the law firm can go forward. 
   The nominees wait and wait and wait and wait. Nobody is against them, but they can't get a hearing. They can't get a vote. Then, if the public pressure grows enough, if they are in a high profile, they may get a hearing. Then if the pressure continues, they may get a Committee vote. And then, if the pressure really builds and the Democratic leader and the Democratic caucus insist, they may get a Senate vote on confirmation. When they get voted, they get confirmed--with the exception of Justice White--by 90 to 10, or 95 to 5, and many times unanimously. But their lives has been put on hold for 2 or 3 years. Their authority as a judge has been diminished because of that. It is humiliating to them. 
   Frankly, it is humiliating to the Senate. It is beneath this great body. I have served here for over 25 years. I can't think of any greater honor that could come to me than to have the people of Vermont allow me to serve here. I should put on my tombstone, other than husband and father, that I was a United States Senator. 
   I have always thought of this Senate as the conscience of the Nation. We are not handling the conscience of this Nation very well. 
   We have a responsibility to uphold the judiciary. If we allow it to be tattered, if we allow it to be shredded, if we allow it to be humiliated, how can a democracy of a quarter of a billion people uphold our laws? How can the country have respect both for the laws and the courts that administer them, if we in the Senate, the most powerful legislative body in this country, don't show that same respect? If we diminish that, it will be an example to be followed by the rest of the people in this country. 
   There are only 100 of us who have the privilege of serving here at any given time to represent a quarter of a billion Americans. Sometimes we should think more of that responsibility than partisan politics. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I would like to mark the end of an era in Vermont. Jeff Kaufman, host of Vermont's award-winning program, ``The Talk of Vermont,'' will hang up his headphones at the end of this week. After 5 years on the air in Middlebury, Jeff and his family are leaving the Green Mountain State for the arguably less green pastures of Southern California. 
   A fixture on Vermont morning radio and a catalyst for thoughtful and provocative discussion of the key issues facing our state and nation, Jeff has not only brought wit and wisdom to the airwaves, but he has consistently managed to recruit big-name guests--Lily Tomlin, Ted Williams, Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist--to our small-market corner of the world, while never neglecting lesser-known local voices. Above all else, Jeff does his homework--he is equally adept at understanding the intricacies of missile defense as he is the physics of baseball. 
   While living in Middlebury, Jeff did not just entertain his listeners on the radio, but he became a valued member of the community, whether it was raising money for flood victims or serving as a member of the Citizens of Middlebury. 
   I am certain that I speak for my colleagues in the Vermont Congressional delegation--each of us has had the pleasure of Jeff's unique brand of inquisition--when I say that he will be a tough act to follow. He has provided an extraordinary service to Vermonters who have benefitted from his professionalism, his insights and his curiosity. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Jeff for a job well done and to wish him and his family well in every future endeavor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will try not to delay my good friend from Kansas too long. I know he, like others, wishes to leave. 
   I speak only because I am disappointed the Senate has not yet passed the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 that is S. 2413. The Senate Judiciary Committee passed this bill unanimously on June 29. All Members, Republicans and Democrats, voted for it. Since then, I have checked with the Democratic caucus. All 45 Democratic Senators support this bill. All 45 are perfectly agreeable to have it either come to an immediate vote or passed by unanimous consent. 
   But it still has not passed the full Senate. This is very disappointing to our nation's law enforcement officers who need life-saving bulletproof vests to protect themselves. Protecting and supporting our law enforcement community should not be a partisan issue. 
   Senator CAMPBELL and I worked together closely and successfully with the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the last Congress to pass the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998 into law. Senator HATCH is an original cosponsor this year's bill to reauthorize this grant program. Senators SCHUMER, KOHL, THURMOND, REED, JEFFORDS, ROBB, REID, SARBANES, our late colleague, Senator Coverdell, BINGAMAN, ASHCROFT, EDWARDS, BUNNING, CLELAND, HUTCHISON, and ABRAHAM also cosponsored our bipartisan bill. 
   I mention this because I have been receiving calls from a number of people in the law enforcement community asking why it has not passed. I did not know the answer. As I said, I checked and found the 45 Democratic Senators all said they had no objection to it being passed by voice vote today, yesterday, whenever--but we have been told a Republican Senator has stopped this bill from passing. He has a hold on the bill, a bill that is intended to provide protection to our Nation's law enforcement officers. 
   According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, more than 40 percent of the 1,182 officers killed by a firearm in the line of duty since 1980 could have been saved if they had been wearing body armor. Indeed, the FBI estimates that the risk of fatality to officers while not wearing body armor is 14 times higher than for officers wearing it. 
   When we introduced the original Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998, President Clinton invited Senator CAMPBELL and me down for the signing of it. Shortly after it was passed into law, we funded 92,000 new bulletproof vests for our Nation's police officers. You can now make application on web sites. The whole thing has worked extremely well. 
   To better protect our nation's law enforcement officers, Senator CAMPBELL and I introduced the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998. President Clinton signed our legislation into law on June 16, 1998 (Public Law 105-181). 
   The law created a $25 million, 50 percent matching grant program within the Department of Justice to help state and local law enforcement agencies purchase body armor for fiscal years 1999-2001. 
   In its first year of operation, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program funded 92,000 new bulletproof vests for our nation's police officers, including 361 vests for Vermont police officers. Applications are now available at the program's web site at http://vests.ojp.gov/ for this year's funds. 
   The entire process of submitting applications and obtaining federal funds is completed through this web site. 
   The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 builds on the success of this program by doubling its annual funding to $50 million for fiscal years 2002-2004. It also improves the program by guaranteeing jurisdictions with fewer than 100,000 residents receive the full 50-50 matching funds because of the tight budgets of these smaller communities and by making the purchase of stab-proof vests eligible for grant awards to protect corrections officers in close quarters in local and county jails. 
   More than ever before, police officers in Vermont and around the country face deadly threats that can strike at any time, even during routine traffic stops. Bulletproof vests save lives. It is essential the we update this law so that many more of our officers who are risking their lives everyday are able to protect themselves. 
   The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 will provide state and local law enforcement agencies with more of the assistance they need to protect their officers. 
   Our bipartisan legislation enjoys the endorsement of many law enforcement organizations, including the Fraternal Order of Police and the National Sheriffs' Association. 
   We need to recognize the hard work of those who have sworn to serve and protect us. And we should do what we can to protect them, when a need like this one comes to our attention. 
   Our nation's law enforcement officers put their lives at risk in the line of duty every day. No one knows when danger will appear. 
   Unfortunately, in today's violent world, even a traffic stop may not necessarily be ``routine.'' Each and every law enforcement officer across the nation deserves the protection of a bulletproof vest. 
   I hope this mysterious ``hold'' on the other side of the aisle will soon disappear. The Senate should pass without delay the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, S. 2413, to ensure that each and every law enforcement agency in Vermont and across the nation can afford basic protection for their officers. 
   I just want to speak a little bit personally about this. I spent the first 8 years of my public life in law enforcement. I have said many times on the floor of the Senate that it was in so many ways the most rewarding career I had. 
   I got to know the men and women in law enforcement who are called upon to go out at 3 o'clock in  the afternoon or 3 o'clock in the morning and put their lives on the line for us. 
   I thought this legislation was something that would help. I have received hundreds of letters and e-mails from police officers across the country who use the Campbell-Leahy law to get themselves bulletproof vests. I know Senator CAMPBELL has, too. We joke about it, but we call it the Campbell-Leahy, Colorado-Leahy, Campbell-Vermont law--police officers know what it is. It is the bulletproof vest law. 
   I was so glad to tell the leaders of law enforcement, the sheriffs, the police officers, and others that we had put together, once again, a bipartisan coalition and were moving through the reauthorization in what has proven to be one of the most successful pieces of law enforcement legislation we have had. 
   That is why when they started calling me and asking, ``why hasn't it passed; if everybody supports it, why hasn't it passed,'' I had to tell them an anonymous Republican Senator has stopped it from passing. Whoever that Senator might be has a right to object to it going forward under our practices, if not under our rules. 
   I ask if that Senator might be willing to put first, and foremost, the needs of our law enforcement officers. If they do not like the bill, then let's bring it to a rollcall vote and they can vote against it. I suspect it will be a 98-1 vote on this. I know every Democrat is going to vote for it because they have told me they will. Every single Republican I have talked with said they will vote for it. I suspect the vast majority of the Senate will vote for it. 
   I call on that anonymous Senator to step forward and either allow us to pass it by a voice vote or let us bring it to a rollcall vote and vote it up or down. The President has assured me personally that he will sign this bill. He has no hesitation signing it. He wants to sign it. 
   Senator CAMPBELL and I will support it throughout the appropriations process to get the money. The most conservative, most liberal, and the moderate Senators in this body have all supported it. Let's do the right thing. Let's tell the same police officers we ask to go out at 3 o'clock in the morning to protect us that we will not do the closed-door withholding of the bulletproof vest legislation.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad to see the Senate confirming Judge Johnnie Rawlinson to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals today. She will be an outstanding member of that Circuit. I thank Senator REID for all of his hard work on this nomination. I also commend our Democratic Leader for getting Judge Rawlinson and the other nominations reported yesterday confirmed by unanimous consent today. No one has worked harder than Senator DASCHLE to try to get the Senate to act on President Clinton's judicial nominees and I thank him for his dedicated efforts. 
   On July 13, 2000, President Clinton spoke before the NAACP Convention in Baltimore and lamented the fact that the Senate has been slow to act on his judicial nominees who are women and minorities. He said: ``The quality of justice suffers when highly-qualified women and minority candidates, fully vetted, fully supported by the American Bar Association, are denied the opportunity to serve for partisan political reasons.'' He went on to say: ``The face of injustice is not compassion; it is indifference, or worse. For the integrity of the courts and the strength of our Constitution, I ask the Republicans to give these people a vote. Vote them down if you don't want them on.'' I wholeheartedly agree with the President. 
   I was encouraged to hear Senator LOTT recently and repeatedly say that he continues to urge the Judiciary Committee to make progress on judicial nominations. The Majority Leader said: ``There are a number of nominations that have had hearings, nominations that are ready for a vote and other nominations that have been pending for quite some time and that should be considered.'' He went on to note that the groups of judges he expects us to report to the Senate will include ``not only district judges but circuit judges.'' 
   The United States Senate is the scene where some 50 years ago, in October 1949, the Senate confirmed President Truman's nomination of William Henry Hastie to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the first Senate confirmation of an African American to our federal district courts and courts of appeal. This Senate is also where some 30 years ago the Senate confirmed President Johnson's nomination of Thurgood Marshall to the United States Supreme Court. 
   And this is where last October, the Senate wrongfully rejected President Clinton's nomination of Justice Ronnie White. That vote made me doubt seriously whether this Senate, serving at the end of a half century of progress, would have voted to confirm Judge Hastie or Justice Marshall. 
   On October 5, 1999, the Senate Republicans voted in lockstep to reject the nomination of Justice Ronnie White to the federal court in Missouri--a nomination that had been waiting 27 months for a vote. For the first time in almost 50 years a nominee to a federal district court was defeated by the United States Senate. There was no Senate debate that day on the nomination. There was no open discussion--just that which took place behind the closed doors of the Republican caucus lunch that led to the party-line vote. 
   It is unfortunate that the Republican Senate has on a number 
   of occasions delayed consideration of too many women and minority nominees. The treatment of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon are examples from earlier this year. Both of these nominees were eventually confirmed this past March by wide margins. 
   I have been calling for the Senate to work to ensure that all nominees are given fair treatment, including a fair vote for the many minority and women candidates who remain pending. 
   The bipartisan Task Force on Judicial Selection of Citizens for Independent Courts has recommended that the Senate complete its consideration of judicial nominations within 60 days. 
   Governor Bush of Texas recently also proposed that presidential nominations be acted upon by the Senate within 60 days. 
   Of the 34 judicial nominations currently pending, 26 have already been pending for more than 60 days without Senate action. Already this Congress 83 nominees, including 56 eventually confirmed, have had to wait longer than 60 days for Senate action. I urge the Senate to do better. 
   The Senate should be moving forward to consider the nominations of Judge James Wynn, Jr. and Roger Gregory to the Fourth Circuit. When confirmed, Judge Wynn and Mr. Gregory will be the first African-Americans to serve on the Fourth Circuit and will each fill a judicial emergency vacancy. Fifty years has passed since the confirmation of Judge Hastie to the Third Circuit and still there has never been an African-American on the Fourth Circuit. The nomination of Judge James A. Beaty, Jr., was previously sent to us by President Clinton in 1995. That nomination was never considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee or the Senate and was returned to President Clinton without action at the end of 1998. It is time for the Senate to act on a qualified African-American nominee to the Fourth Circuit. President Clinton spoke powerfully about these matters last week. We should respond not be misunderstanding or mischaracterizing what he said, but by taking action on this well-qualified nominees. 
   In addition, the Senate should act favorably on the nominations of Judge Helene White and Kathleen McCree Lewis to the Sixth Circuit, Bonnie Campbell to the Eighth Circuit, and Enrique Moreno to the Fifth Circuit. Mr. Moreno succeeded to the nomination of Jorge Rangel on which the Senate refused to act last Congress. These are well-qualified nominees who will add to the capabilities and diversity of those courts. In fact, the Chief Judge of the Fifth Circuit declared that a judicial emergency exists on that court, caused by the number of judicial vacancies, the lack of Senate action on pending nominations, and the overwhelming workload. 
   I am sorely disappointed that the Committee has not reported the nomination of Bonnie Campbell to the Eighth Circuit. She completed the  nomination and hearing process two months ago and is strongly supported by Senator GRASSLEY and Senator HARKIN from her home state. She will make an outstanding judge. 
   Filling these vacancies with qualified nominees is the concern of all Americans. The Senate should treat minority and women and all nominees fairly and proceed to consider them. 
   To reiterate, I commend and congratulate Judge Johnnie Rawlinson from Nevada who was confirmed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. She is going to do an outstanding job on that circuit. Senator Harry REID of Nevada, who worked so hard, deserves special mention as, of course, does Senator Dick BRYAN for joining in support of her nomination. 
   I hope this is a mark that maybe we will do better in the Senate and start moving judges, similar to what a Democratic-controlled Senate did in the last year of President George Bush's term in office when we moved judicial nominations right through to practically the last day we were in session. 
   There has been a lot of talk about what should be done or should not be done, what is being held up or should not be held up. Whether it is an accident or otherwise, it is a fact that women and minorities take a disproportionate amount of time to go through the system. That does not look well for the Senate. 
   If I could make a recommendation, I would join an unusual ally in that. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas Presidential nominations should be acted upon by the Senate within 60 days. He said:  
   The Constitution empowers the President to nominate officers of the United States, with the advice and consent of the Senate. That is clear-cut, straightforward language. It does not empower anyone to turn the process into a protracted ordeal of unreasonable delay and unrelenting investigation. Yet somewhere along the way, that is what Senate confirmations became --lengthy, partisan, and unpleasant. It has done enough harm, injured too many good people, and it must not happen again.  
   Governor Bush is right. President Clinton has said virtually the same thing. I have said the same thing. The fact is, if you do not want somebody to be a judge, then vote them down, but do not do this limbo thing where sometimes they wait for years and years. Marsha Berzon waited 2 1/2 years just to get a vote. They were not going to vote on this woman. When she finally came to a vote, she was confirmed overwhelmingly. 
   Richard Paez is a distinguished jurist, an outstanding Hispanic American. He waited not 1 year, not 2 years, not 3 years, but he waited 4 years for a vote, and then when his nomination was voted on, it was overwhelming. 
   Let us do better. Let's move on some of the names that are here, such as Kathleen McCree Lewis, Helene White, Bonnie Campbell, Enrique Moreno, and others who have been held up so long. Let's move on them. It can be done. 
   Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Kansas for his forbearance. He has now done enough penance for 1 day. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as have so many of my colleagues, I speak with a sense of loss and sadness about the passing of our friend, Paul Coverdell. Over the years serving in the Senate, I have seen too often the flowers on a Senator's desk and known, by that unique tradition of our body, the reflection that we have lost somebody in an untimely fashion--no one more untimely than the Senator from Georgia. 
   I have had the honor to serve with many Senators during the time the people of Vermont have been kind enough to let me be here. Each of these Senators has brought special qualities. It might be a knack for fiery oration or professorial intelligence. But Paul Coverdell brought a special formula of kindness and quiet persistence. 
   I first knew Paul when he was director of the Peace Corps. I was chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee which handled his budget. I recall times when there would be an issue that would come up of some contention. I remember President Bush calling and saying: Pat, sit down with Paul. I assure you you can work it out. 
   We would sit quietly in my office. We would go over the issues, and we would work it out. We would work it out because I knew that Paul Coverdell would keep his word; he knew I would mine. I also knew that neither of us would read about the intricacies of our agreements in the paper the next day. We would keep each other's confidence. 
   When he came to the Senate, he was first and foremost a tireless champion for the interests of the people of Georgia. We all remember his relentless advocacy for some of the military bases in his home State and how proud he was to represent the State that hosted the Olympic games in 1996. In that regard he entered the sometimes messy realm of appropriations to bring full Federal support to that gigantic effort. 
   In many ways, these efforts were an embodiment of the people of Georgia, possessing a boundless energy, ambition, and generosity. 
   What I remember most, though, about Paul Coverdell--and so many of our colleagues have said the same thing--is how he worked on everything with a paradoxically quiet energy. He was not one to seek the cameras and head to the floor to yell about every disagreement. If he had a disagreement, he would call you. He would go and work with you face to face. He was often convincing. I know he changed my mind on issues. 
   I think one of the reasons he was so convincing is that he was always open-minded and attentive. I don't think there is any case more obvious about that than the Senate's recent consideration of the supplemental appropriation for antidrug assistance in Colombia. 
   There were many disagreements on this aid package. But everybody, whether they were on his side or on the opposite side, admired the strength of his conviction and the depth of the knowledge of the region. 
   I was privileged to work closely with him on a resolution on a recent presidential election in Peru. Senator Coverdell and I believed strongly that it was important for the United States to send a strong message throughout the hemisphere in support of democracy and to condemn the blatant subversion of democracy by the Fujimori government. Again, it was the strength of Paul's convictions and willingness to stand for the most important principles this country stands for. That is why the resolution was there. 
   Our mutual concern for international human rights extended to the effort to establish a global ban of antipersonnel landmines. I was so pleased to work with Paul on this issue. He would always consider my proposals thoughtfully and thoroughly. He brought a very special perspective. For him, banning landmines was about protecting Peace Corps volunteers and the communities they served. He had this unique way of looking at an issue that went way beyond warring parties. He was concerned about innocent civilians. 
   Paul took part in these debates and he worked behind the scenes with a  big-hearted kindness. He was one of the kindest people to grace this floor, and there was a certain peacefulness about him that was always pleasantly contagious. In a sometimes very divisive Senate, that peacefulness was so respected. 
   That is why when I look at the flowers, like many of us who have served here a long time, I think we have seen those flowers too often. But it is hard to think of a time when both Republicans and Democrats have felt the pain more than on this occasion. Paul, we will all miss you. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for and cosponsorship of the Hatch-Durbin amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations bill to increase funding for the Office of Generic Drugs (OGD) at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by $2 million. 
   As we all know, the high costs of prescription drugs are on the minds of Americans because having access to affordable prescription drugs is essential for people of all ages. Over the next 5 years, the patents of name brand drugs with approximately $22 billion in sales will expire. Consumers will save millions of dollars from generic prescription drug alternatives. This will help to alleviate cost pressures facing some of our most vulnerable citizens--seniors and the chronically ill. 
   The FDA will be able to help make drugs more affordable only if it has adequate resources to review and approve generic drug applications in a timely manner. In recent years, I have worked with Senators SPECTER, HARKIN, and other cosponsors of this amendment to urge our colleagues to increase funds for the Office of Generic Drugs. These efforts have paid off in a reduction in the backlog of generic drug applications. Unfortunately, the President did not request an increase for the Office of Generic Drugs for the 2001 fiscal year. However, the workload for the office continues to increase and for the first time in several years, the backlog of applications has increased rather than continue to decline. 
   An increase of $2 million for the Office of Generic Drugs will be used for training and the upgrade of information technology systems that will allow for the electronic submission and review of generic drug applications. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. This amendment will put the review record of the Office of Generic Drugs back on course.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my congratulations to Franklin County, Vermont, one of five counties recently honored with the 2000 Community of Excellence Award from the organization Communities Can! 
   Franklin County is a small, sparsely populated area in northwestern Vermont. This county's close proximity to Lake Champlain and its rolling hills make it ideal for agriculture. In fact, the county has long been known as a state leader in dairy and maple syrup production. As with many rural areas, Franklin County has limited resources, but with the innovation and sense of community responsibility that has characterized Vermonters for centuries, leaders in the community have established a comprehensive network of educators, health care providers, and mental health workers to coordinate vital services for area children. 
   Communities Can! is a network of communities committed to ensuring that all children and families, including those with disabilities and special needs, have the services and support they need. Franklin County has been a part of this exemplary collaboration since its inception. Each year the organization recognizes five counties from across the country with the Community of Excellence Award. In order to be eligible for this prestigious award, a county must show that it identifies young children and families in need of services; provides affordable, convenient assistance; and includes family members in all levels of decision making. Receiving this award is a significant achievement. 
   It takes strong teamwork to bring all of these essential human services together to improve the lives of children and their families in a community. Thanks to the work of Mark Sustic, Coordinator of Early Childhood Programs; Peggy Durgin, Early Intervention/Team Coordinator; Paula Irish, Mental Health and Disabilities Coordinator for Head Start; Pam McCarthy, Director of the Family Center; and, Tracey Wagner, Chair of the Regional Interagency Coordinating Council, children and families in Franklin County receive the support and services they need to develop and flourish. I had the pleasure of meeting these remarkable community leaders this spring when they came to Washington to receive their award. These dedicated Vermonters make the most of the limited resources in their rural county by coordinating a comprehensive set of services including pre-kindergarten education, health care, parent education, special needs services, day care, and prenatal care.  
   I am proud of the people of Franklin County for their creativity and ingenuity in meeting the needs of families and children. They serve as an inspiring example to other communities in Vermont, and indeed, the entire country.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I do not like the marriage penalty. I think it is poor public policy. Unfortunately, the Senate Finance Committee has presented us with a bill, sponsored by Senator ROTH, that does not completely eliminate the marriage penalty. What this bill would do instead is direct a majority of its tax benefits to married couples who already benefit from a marriage bonus and to certain individuals who have never even been married. Hard working married couples in Vermont deserve an honest, targeted measure to eliminate the marriage penalty, not the proposal that is before us today. 
   Of the 65 marriage penalties in the Tax Code, the Republican bill eliminates only one and partially addresses only two more. It would do absolutely nothing to get rid of the 62 other marriage penalties in areas such as the Hope and Lifetime Learning Credits, Individual Retirement Accounts, and the taxation of Social Security benefits, programs that are important to Vermonters. In addition, by increasing the deduction and expanding brackets, this bill would benefit married couples who experience a marriage bonus, at a cost of $55.6 billion over five years and $40 billion per year after that. 
   I support the alternative amendment, proposed by Senator MOYNIHAN, because it would eliminate all 65 marriage penalties in the Tax Code for couples with up to $100,000 in adjusted gross income. This common sense plan would accomplish this relief by allowing married couples to calculate their tax liability jointly or as single individuals. The alternative would also significantly shrink the marriage penalty for couples with between $100,000 and $150,000 in adjusted gross income. According to the Vermont Department of Taxes, in 1998, 113,132 married couples in Vermont had an adjusted gross income under $150,000. That is 94.5 percent of all married couples ion Vermont that filed taxes that year. Under Senator MOYINHAN's proposal, Vermonters get more bank for their buck and those married couples who are truly hurt by the marriage penalty get a break. 
   Senator ROTH's bill, when fully phased in, would cost American taxpayers $40 billion a year, $10 billion more than Senator MOYNIHAN's proposal, but would leave 62 marriage penalties untouched. In addition, an analysis by the Department of Treasury indicates that only 40 percent of the benefits of this bill would actually reduce the marriage penalty. This means that 60 percent of the benefits are directed to other cuts--expensive cuts that do nothing to provide senior citizens with a prescription drug benefit, nothing to improve our children's education, nothing to help repay our national debt. 
   If the Republican bill is enacted, we will have made little progress in eliminating the marriage penalty--one small step as opposed the giant leap that we would get with Senator MOYNIHAN's alternative. I support an end to the marriage penalty and I will continue to work with other Senators to pass affordable legislation that is targeted at eliminating all of the marriage penalties in our Tax Code. Vermonters and all hard working Americans deserve nothing less.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the Senate debates the FY 2001 Interior and Related Appropriations Act, I would like to take a moment to ask the distinguished subcommittee Chairman and Ranking Member a clarifying question concerning Section 329 of the bill. That section, as my colleagues know, contains language concerning the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. 
   Mr. President, the Senate has clearly expressed its views regarding the Kyoto Protocol in S. Res. 98, the Byrd-Hagel resolution adopted unanimously by the Senate on July 25, 1997. That resolution calls on the Administration to support an approach to climate change that protects the economic interests of the United States and seeks commitments from developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Administration is aggressively engaging developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through international projects and activities emphasizing market-based mechanisms and environmental technology. Furthermore, the U.S. is currently engaged in climate change negotiations to ensure meaningful participation of developing countries and to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions reductions are achieved in the most cost-effective manner. 
   Mr. President, I ask my friend from West Virginia if my understanding is correct that Section 329 of the FY 2001 Interior bill is not intended to restrict the Administration from engaging in these international negotiations related to both the Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was ratified by the Senate in 1992, and the Kyoto Protocol to that Convention? Am I also correct in my understanding that Section 329 is not intended to restrict international programs or activities to encourage commitments by developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in Vermont, small businesses and family farms form the backbone of our economy. I have always been a strong supporter of targeted estate tax relief for these family-owned farms and small businesses. Targeted relief would help families in Vermont keep their property intact and in the family. 
   What we have are two very different approaches to estate tax relief. 
   Under the Republican proposal, H.R. 8, relief from the estate tax would be phased in gradually over ten years and the initial benefits would be directed towards the wealthiest estates, those valued at over $20 million. Under this proposal, not a single small business or family farm would be removed from  the tax next year or even 9 years from now. That is because H.R. 8 does not actually repeal the estate tax until the next decade. This proposal would cost American taxpayers $105 billion in the first ten years and $50 billion in each year after that. 
   Under the second proposal, the Democratic Alternative put forth by Senator MOYNIHAN, thousands of additional farms and small businesses would be exempt from the estate tax in the very first year after its enactment. Under the Democratic Alternative, business owners and farmers would be able to leave $2 million per individual and $4 million per couple without paying estate tax in 2001. By 2010, business owner's and farmer's assets totaling $8 million would be exempt. This proposal would cost approximately $64 billion over 10 years. 
   We now have a choice between a proposal that would provide immediate relief to small business owners and farmers at a cost we can afford and a fiscally irresponsible measure that would provide a windfall to the wealthiest estates at a high cost to Vermonters and the American public. I choose the affordable, immediate, targeted relief that we have with the Democratic proposal--a proposal that I believe is a better deal for Vermonters.

   Mr. LEAHY. The New York Times article said that had the estate tax been repealed in 1997, as the Republicans now propose, more than half of the tax savings would have gone to the slightly more than 400 individuals who died that year leaving estates valued at $20 million or more. Only about 400 estates in the entire nation, Mr. President. 
   In other words, under the Republican proposal, once again, only the wealthiest individuals would reap the majority of the benefits. Only gradually would any benefits trickle down to the small business owners and farmers who Republicans are professing to help. Under the Republican proposal hard working Vermonters would bear the burden of a windfall to the wealthy. 
   In Vermont, in 1998, 227 estates were subject to the estate tax. If the Republican proposal were adopted in 1997, not a single one of those estates would have been removed from the rolls in the following year. Under the Democratic Alternative, small business owners and farmers would have received immediate relief. When all is said and done, with the Democratic Alternative, approximately two-thirds of all estates would not be subject to the estate tax. 
   Do we want relief for our farmers and small business owners now, at a cost we can afford? Or do we want an unworkable partisan solution that will lead inevitably to a presidential veto, endless debate, and empty campaign slogans? I think that Vermonters deserve the immediate relief that is available under the Democratic proposal, relief that would keep small businesses and family owned farms intact, relief that is balanced and affordable.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am concerned at the continuing lack of any real, strong effort to confirm Federal judges this year compared to the situation in the last year of President Bush's term in office with a Democratic controlled Senate. We confirmed 66 judges--actually confirmed judges and had hearings right through September. Now we have very, very few hearings. 
   While I am glad to see the Judiciary Committee moving forward with a few of the many qualified judicial nominees to fill the scores of vacancies that continue to plague our Federal courts, I am disappointed that there were no nominees to the Court of Appeals included at this hearing. I have said since the beginning of this year that the American people should measure our progress by our treatment of the many qualified nominees, including outstanding women and minorities, to the Court of Appeals around the country. The committee and the Senate are falling well short of the mark. 
   With 21 vacancies on the Federal appellate courts across the country, and nearly half of the total judicial emergency vacancies in the Federal courts system in our appellate courts, our courts of appeals are being denied the resources that they need. Their ability to administer justice for the American people is being hurt. There continue to be multiple vacancies on the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, Tenth and District of Columbia Circuits. The vacancy rate for our courts of appeals is more than 11 percent nationwide--and that does not begin to take into account the additional judgeships requested by the  Judicial Conference to handle their increased workloads. If we added the 11 additional appellate judges being requested, the vacancy rate would be 16 percent. Still, not a single qualified candidate for one of these vacancies on our Federal appellate courts is being heard today. 
   At our first executive business meeting of the year, I noted the opportunity we had to make bipartisan strides toward easing the vacancy crisis in our nation's Federal courts. I believed that a confirmation total of 65 by the end of the year was achievable if we made the effort, exhibited the commitment, and did the work that was needed to be done. I urged that we proceed promptly with confirmations of a number of outstanding nominations to the court of appeals, including qualified minority and women candidates. Unfortunately, that is not what has happened. 
   Just as there was no appellate court nominee included in the April confirmation hearing, there is no appellate court nominee included today. Indeed, this committee has not reported a nomination to a court of appeals vacancy since April 12, and it has reported only two all year. The committee has yet to report the nomination of Allen Snyder to the District of Columbia Circuit, although his hearing was 8 weeks ago; the nomination of Bonnie Campbell to the Eighth Circuit, although her hearing was 6 weeks ago; or the nomination of Judge Johnnie Rawlinson, although her hearing was 4 weeks ago. Left waiting for a hearing are a number of outstanding nominees, including Judge Helene White for a judicial emergency vacancy in the Sixth Circuit; Judge James Wynn, Jr., for a judicial emergency vacancy in the Fourth Circuit; Kathleen McCree Lewis, another outstanding nominee to the multiple vacancies on the Sixth Circuit; Enrique Moreno, for a judicial emergency vacancy in the Fifth Circuit; Elena Kagan, to one of the multiple vacancies on the District of Columbia Circuit; and Roger L. Gregory, an outstanding nominee to another judicial emergency vacancy in the Fourth Circuit. 
   I deeply regret that the Senate adjourned last November and left the Fifth Circuit to deal with the crisis in the Federal administration of justice in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi without the resources that it desperately needs. It is a situation that I wished we had confronted by expediting consideration of nominations to that court last year. I still hope that the Senate will consider them this year to help that circuit. 
   I continue to urge the Senate to meet its responsibilities to all nominees, including women and minorities. That all of these highly qualified nominees are being needlessly delayed is most regrettable. The Senate should join with the President to confirm these well-qualified, diverse and fair-minded nominees to fulfill the needs of the Federal courts around the country. 
   During the committee's business meeting on June 27, Chairman HATCH noted that the Senate has confirmed seven nominees to the courts of appeals this year--as if we had done our job and need do no more. What he failed to note is that all seven were holdovers who had been nominated in prior years. Five of the seven were reported to the Senate for action before this year, and two had to be reported twice before the Senate would vote on them. The Senate took more than 49 months to confirm Judge Richard Paez, who was nominated back in January 1996, and more than 26 months to confirm Marsha Berzon, who was nominated in January 1998. Tim Dyk, who was nominated in April 1998, was confirmed after more than two years. This is hardly a record of prompt action of which anyone can be proud. 
   Chairman HATCH then compared this year's total against totals from other presidential election years. The only year to which this can be favorably compared was 1996 when the Republican majority in the Senate refused to confirm even a single appellate court judge to the Federal bench. Again, that is hardly a comparison in which to take pride. Let us compare to the year 1992, in which a Democratic majority in the Senate confirmed 11 Court of Appeals nominees during a Republican President's last year in office among the 66 judicial confirmations for the year. That year, the committee held three hearings in July, two in August, and a final hearing for judicial nominees in September. The seven judicial nominees included in the September 24 hearing were all confirmed before adjournment that year--including a court of appeals nominee. We have a long way to go before we can think about resting on any laurels. 
   Having begun so slowly in the first half of this year, we have much more to do before the Senate takes its final action on judicial nominees this year. We should be considering 20 to 30 more judges this year, including at least another half dozen for the court of appeals. We cannot afford to follow the ``Thurmond Rule'' and stop acting on these nominees now in anticipation of the presidential election in November. We must use all the time until adjournment to remedy the vacancies that have been perpetuated on the courts to the detriment of the American people and the administration of justice. That should be a top priority for the Senate for the rest of this year. In the last three months in session in 1992, between July 12 and October 8, 1992, the Senate confirmed 32 judicial nominations. I will work with Chairman HATCH to match that record. 
   One of our most important constitutional responsibilities as United States Senators is to advise and consent on the scores of judicial nominations sent to us to fill the vacancies on the federal courts around the country. I look forward to our next confirmation hearing and to the inclusion of qualified candidates for some of the many vacancies on our Federal Court of Appeals.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, with my friend from New Jersey, Senator TORRICELLI, to protect the personal privacy of consumers whose information is held by firms filing for bankruptcy protection. 
   The Privacy Policy Enforcement in Bankruptcy Act would prohibit the sale of personally identifiable information held by a failed business if the sale or disclosure of the personal information would violate the privacy policy of the debtor in effect when the personal information was collected. Personally identifiable information, under our legislation, includes name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, Social Security number, credit card number, date of birth and any other identifier that permits the physical or online contacting of a specific individual. 
   This legislation is needed because the customer databases of failed Internet firms now can be sold during bankruptcy, even in violation of the firm's stated privacy policy. That is wrong. 
   Toysmart.com, for example, an online toy store, recently filed for bankruptcy and its databases and customer lists were put up for sale as part of the liquidation of the firm's assets. This personal customer information was put on the auction block even though Toysmart.com promised otherwise on its web page. 
   Toysmart.com's web site states that ``personal information voluntarily submitted by visitors to our site, such as name, address, billing information and shopping preferences, is never shared with a third party.'' Toysmart.com's privacy statement continues: ``When you register with toysmart.com, you can rest assured that your information will never be shared with a third party.'' 
   But on June 8, 2000, one day before filing for bankruptcy, Toysmart.com advertised in the Wall Street Journal  to sell its customer lists and databases. That was a clear violation of Toysmart.com's web site privacy policy. The Federal Trade Commission has filed suit against Toysmart.com for this violation and I commend the FTC for its action. 
   Yesterday, the Walt Disney Company, the parent company of Toysmart.com, announced that it would try to purchase Toysmart.com's customer information from the bankruptcy court. I applaud Disney for taking this step. There is no guarantee, however, that Disney will be the top bidder for this information and other corporate parents may not be as responsible if one of their subsidiaries fails. Indeed, two other failed web businesses, Boo.com and Craftshop.com, have reportedly sought buyers for its personal customer data. 
   That is why this Congress should pass the Privacy Policy Enforcement in Bankruptcy Act this year. Consumers deserve this privacy protection. 
   Mr. President, it is wrong to use our nation's bankruptcy laws as an excuse to violate a customer's personal privacy. Customers have a right to expect an online firm to adhere to its privacy policies whether it is making a profit or has filed for bankruptcy. 
   I commend Senator TORRICELLI for joining with me to introduce the Privacy Policy Enforcement in Bankruptcy Act. Our legislation will close this loophole in the Bankruptcy Code and ensure that online and offline firms keep their promises to protect the personal privacy of their customers. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this basic privacy protection legislation.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN for including an amendment I have offered to increase funding for the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as part of the managers' package. My amendment would provide an increase of $2.5 million for the Office of Civil Rights to protect the civil rights of Americans. I want to take a moment to explain why I believe this funding increase is so important. 
   The Office of Civil Rights at HHS has the responsibility to enforce civil rights laws in the health and human service setting throughout the United States. What does this mean? Essentially, the Office of Civil Rights oversees anyone who receives funding from HHS--hospitals, managed care organizations, nursing homes, and social service agencies among others--to ensure they are complying with civil rights statutes. Although it enforces a wide array of civil right laws, the bulk of OCR's efforts center around enforcement of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which addresses discrimination in federally funded programs, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
   The civil rights challenges that confront OCR continue to grow. A few of the issues the office is focusing on include racial and ethnic disparities in health; ensuring that individuals with disabilities avoid unnecessary institutionalization and can live in their communities; and fighting discrimination among minorities and individuals with disabilities in managed care. 
   It seems to me that this office already has a pretty big workload. Well, it is about to become much larger. In addition to the important efforts the OCR currently works on, this office will soon be responsible for implementing and enforcing the proposed medical privacy regulations. The administration has been required to establish safeguards to protect personal medical information of Americans because this Congress missed its own self-imposed deadline. If we're not going to do our job in Congress, we should at least support the Office that will have to do it for us. 
   In 1996, Congress passed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This legislation set a self-imposed deadline for Congress to pass comprehensive medical privacy legislation by August 1999. If Congress was unable to meet the deadline, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services was required by law to establish medical privacy protection through regulation. Secretary Shalala issued her draft regulations last fall and there was a public comment period that extended until this past February. Currently, HHS is working to finalize the draft regulations which should be issued later this year. 
   I have been on this Senate floor countless times to talk about the need to establish privacy protections for personal medical information. It angers me that this Congress could not even move privacy protections through the committee process, let alone, to actually have a debate on this critical issue before the full Senate. We couldn't do the job on our own and we have instead shifted the responsibility to the administration. This Congress has the responsibility to protect the privacy of Americans--and that includes the protection of their medical records. The place for these protections is in legislation--not regulation. But that's not the issue right now. The issue before us is the need to adequately fund the office that will have the sole responsibility for enforcing these essential privacy protections. 
   The FY 2000 Budget for the Office of Civil Rights is $22 million. This figure has remained unchanged since 1980. I find this hard to believe. The Office has seen its enforcement responsibilities increase dramatically with the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act and other major legislation. Add the impending implementation of the medical records privacy regulation and it becomes clear that this budget must come in line with the current times and allow the Office to do what they must--protect the civil rights of Americans. 
   This additional funding provided in this amendment will help the Office of Civil Rights do the job we have asked them to do. I do not think this increase is nearly enough. However, I recognize that we have limited funds for a wide range of important programs. I am hopeful that this will be the first of many steps to increase the resources for this office. Again, I want to thank my colleagues for their support of this amendment and for their support of the important work of this office.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the remarks of the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Senator KENNEDY, who has taken a strong, personal interest in the human rights conditions in the Colombia aid portion of this bill. 
   Senator KENNEDY and I, with the support of other Senators, both Democrats and Republicans, including some strong supporters of this Colombia aid package, wrote these conditions which passed the Senate on June 22. The Senate version, which passed overwhelmingly, did not contain the presidential waiver that was included by the conferees. There was virtually no meaningful opportunity for most Senators, especially Democrats, to participate in the Conference on the Colombia aid package, and I am disappointed that the waiver was included. 
   If the Administration had a history of giving the protection of human rights in Colombia the attention it deserves there would be no need for these conditions. Unfortunately, the Administration, as well as the Colombian Government, have consistently misrepresented, and overstated, the Colombian Government's efforts to punish human rights violators. This causes me great concern. There is no need for  the waiver and no justification for waiving these conditions. 
   Senator KENNEDY has described the situation in detail so I will not repeat what he has said. However, I do want to respond to a couple of the State Department's claims: 
   The State Department has said that ``dramatic steps have been taken [by the Colombian Government] to deal with the legacy of human rights abuses.'' It cites a change in Colombian law, such that ``military officers responsible for human rights violations are tried in civilian courts.'' That is a gross misrepresentation of what actually occurs. The Colombian Armed Forces have systematically, and successfully, sought to avoid civilian court jurisdiction of human rights crimes by many of its members. 
   The State Department has also said that ``President Pastrana has stated repeatedly that he will not tolerate collaboration, by commission or omission, between security force members and paramilitaries.'' I am sure President Pastrana, who I greatly admire, has said that. But the reality is that this collaboration has existed for years, and virtually nothing has been done about it. In fact, it is only recently, when pressed, that the Administration and the Colombian Government even acknowledged that it was going on. To date, little has been done to stop it. 
   This is not to say that the Colombian Government has done nothing to address the human rights problems. It has, and I want to recognize that. But that is no argument for waiving these conditions. Far more needs to be done, especially to punish those who violate human rights. 
   There is no doubt that the Administration believes that supporting ``Plan Colombia'' is in our national security interests. However, the Administration has also said, repeatedly, that promoting human rights is a key goal of ``Plan Colombia.'' The Colombian Government has said the same thing. If those pronouncements means anything, they mean that it is not in our national interests to provide assistance to the Colombian Armed Forces if the basic human rights conditions in this bill are not met, particularly when the Colombian Government has said these conditions are fully consistent with its own policies. This is not asking too much. These are not unreasonable conditions. To the contrary, they are the minimum that should be done to ensure that our aid does not go to forces that violate human rights. There is no reason whatsoever that the Administration cannot use the leverage of this aid package to ensure that these conditions are met, and I fully expect the Administration to do so.

It calls on the British Government to fully and faithfully implement the recommendations included in the Patten Commission report. It also commends the parties to the Good Friday Agreement for progress to date in implementing all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and urges them to move expeditiously to complete the implementation. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that documents which raise concerns about police reform legislation be included at the end of my remarks. I urge my colleagues to approve this resolution.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am please to be a cosponsor of the amendment offered by Senator DASCHLE to the FY 2001 Labor HHS Appropriations bill which will protect people from having their personal, genetic information used against them by their employers or their health insurance companies. The provision is identical to the legislation that Senator DASCHLE introduced earlier this year and which I have also cosponsored. 
   If adopted, the Daschle amendment will bar insurance companies from raising premiums or denying patients health care coverage based on genetic information. Employers will also be prohibited from using genetic information in hiring practices. Because a right without a remedy is not right at all, these measures also provide an individual who has suffered genetic discrimination with the right to take legal action. This is an essential protection to ensure that discrimination does not occur. 
   With the latest breakthrough earlier this week of the Human Genome Project in mapping human genetic make-up, protecting Americans from genetic discrimination--an issue that was already important--has become critical. We must support the advancement of science and discovery through research. But while we are embracing these new discoveries, we must also provide safeguards to ensure the protection of this new and potentially very sensitive and personal information. In order to help Americans embrace scientific discoveries we must ensure these discoveries will not cause personal harm. 
   This February, in recognition of the need to prevent abuse and misuse of genetic information, President Clinton signed an Executive Order that prevents federal agencies from discriminating against workers if they discover through genetic testing that they have a predisposition to a disease or some other conditions. President Clinton expressed his support for legislation to prevent genetic discrimination which will extend beyond the reach of the Executive Order. The Genetic Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance and Employment Act and today's amendment will allow Vermonters--and all Americans--to undergo genetic testing without being afraid that their employer or their insurance company will use this information to discriminate against them. 
   No one wants to find out they may be predisposed to a certain disease and then have to worry about losing their job. These important measures would give them the assurance and protection that their personal information will be protected and will not be used against them.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this statement is part of my continuing effort to bring clarity to the facts underlying the oversight investigations on campaign finance being pursued by Senator SPECTER within the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts. Staying focused on the facts becomes even more important as the volume of the political rhetoric continues to increase. 
   Although oversight is an important function, there are obvious dangers of conducting oversight of pending matters. Applying, or seeming to apply, political pressure to pending matters has real consequences, which we are now seeing first-hand. Recently, the Judiciary Committee received requests for information from the defense attorney for Wen Ho Lee, a criminal defendant facing charges of improperly downloading classified information from computers at Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratory. Mr. Lee's defense attorney wants the Republican report on this matter, as well as other documents gathered during oversight, presumably to aid his defense or at least to get potential impeachment materials for prospective government witnesses. 
   Just today we learned that the Committee has now also been dragged into the pending case of Maria Hsia, a criminal defendant who was recently convicted of campaign finance violations and is awaiting sentencing. Ms. Hsia's attorney apparently found the questioning of the Justice Department prosecutor in charge of her case at last week's hearing so offensive that it is now the basis for a claim that Ms. Hsia's sentencing should be delayed because to set a sentencing date now would only serve political purposes. 
   Indeed, at a hearing of the Specter investigation on June 21, 2000, a Republican member of the Judiciary Committee queried Robert Conrad, the current head of the Justice Department Campaign Financing Task Force about the Hsia sentencing, despite Conrad's statements that he could not properly discuss pending matters. The Republican member stated that he expected Conrad to pursue Hsia's sentencing vigorously, and asked whether the government had filed a sentencing memorandum. After Conrad explained that the sentencing submissions had not yet been made, the Republican member stated: ``I would expect that you would pursue vigorously the sentencing phase  of that case and that you personally would oversee it ..... I have seen some cases previously involving these very matters in which I believe the Department of Justice was not sufficiently aggressive toward sentencing.'' He then expounded his view that the ``only way'' a person convicted at trial could get a downward departure at sentencing is to cooperate fully and stated ``I would expect that you would treat this like any other case, that unless the defendant was prepared to testify fully and completely and provide information that you can verify, that 
   you would not accept a recommendation of any downward departure.'' These comments clearly conveyed the Republican member's view that Maria Hsia should be treated harshly at sentencing, 
   The Specter investigation has broken long-standing precedent and routinely demanded documents and testimony involving ongoing criminal matters. I have warned repeatedly that such interference risks that prosecutions may be compromised, more work will be generated for prosecutors, and political agendas will appear to take precedence over effective and fair law enforcement. Nevertheless, at Senator SPECTER's request, the majority on the Judiciary Committee has approved subpoenas in a number of ongoing criminal cases, including Wen Ho Lee, Peter Lee, who remains on probation and under court supervision, multiple campaign finance cases and investigations, and the Loral/Hughes matter. 
   With respect to the Loral/Hughes matter, the Judiciary Committee approved issuance of a subpoena on May 11, 2000, to the Justice Department for ``any and all'' Loral and Hughes documents, over the objection of Wilma Lewis, the United States Attorney in D.C., which is conducting the investigation. Ms. Lewis explained that the United States Attorney's Office has ``an open active investigation'' into allegations of the unlicensed export of defense services and that thousands of documents in the possession of her office could be responsive to the pending requests from this Committee. Ms. Lewis explained that her office is at an ``important point'' in the investigation and will be making ``critical prosecutorial decisions and recommendations'' in the near future. She noted that if this Committee were to subpoena responsive documents from her office, not only would we adversely affect the investigation from a litigation standpoint, we also would be diverting the attention of the key prosecutors in that case. Instead of working diligently to conclude their investigation, these prosecutors would now be required to sift through thousands of documents and to redact those documents to protect grand jury material. The majority on the Senate Judiciary Committee refused to honor the U.S. Attorney's request and approved the subpoena. 
   The subject of the Vice President's attendance at coffees was the focus of inquiry at the Judiciary Committee's recent hearing with the Attorney General this week. In summary, the Vice President indicated in response to general questions during an interview with Justice Department prosecutors on April 18, 2000, that he had no concrete recollection of attending the coffees though may have attended one briefly. He fully acknowledged the fact that coffees took place and explained his understanding of their purpose. 
   Two days after the interview, on April 20th, the Vice President's attorney, James Neal, sent a letter to Conrad clarifying the Vice President's recollection since he had not been advised before the interview that this subject matter would come up. Neal explained that the Vice President ``understood your questions about Coffees to concern the Coffees hosted by the President in the White House.'' Based upon a record review, the Vice President ``was designated to attend four White House Coffees. The Vice President hosted approximately twenty-one Coffees in the Old Executive Office Building. He did not understand your questions to include the OEOB Coffees.'' Indeed, Conrad refers repeatedly in his questions on this subject to ``White House coffees'' or ``White House hosted ..... coffees''. 
   There is absolutely nothing unusual about witnesses in depositions or even in testimony at Congressional hearings supplementing or clarifying the record after the completion of their testimony. In fact, this common practice is embodied in Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which grants deponent thirty days after the transcript is available to review the transcript and recite any changes in the testimony given. The same rules apply to depositions taken in criminal matters, under Rule 15(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. 
   At the June 27th Judiciary Committee hearing, one Republican member asserted that ``there is a question of the coffees,'' without identifying the question. To the extent this implies that there is something wrong with clarifying a record with a letter shortly after providing testimony, this can be summed up as just more partisan haze.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week, the Supreme Court reaffirmed its landmark decision in Miranda v. Arizona. I applaud that decision. Miranda struck a balance between the needs of law enforcement and the rights of a suspect that has worked well for 34 years. There is no reason to upset that balance now. 
   Shortly after Miranda was decided in 1966, I became State's Attorney for Chittenden County, Vermont. I remember clearly the immediate impact that this momentous decision had upon law enforcement, prosecutors, criminal defendants and the criminal justice system as a whole. The Supreme Court's pronouncement that all suspects in custody needed to be advised of certain constitutional rights, including the privilege against self-incrimination, before being questioned was as new then as it is familiar today. 
   The Miranda decision put into place a fair and bright-line rule that both protects the rights of the accused and has proven workable for law enforcement. Statements stemming from custodial interrogation of a suspect are inadmissible at trial unless the police first provide the suspect with a set of four specific warnings: (1) you have the right to remain silent; (2) anything you say may be used as evidence against you; (3) you have the right to an attorney; and (4) if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you. 
   These warnings are necessary to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings and so ensure that any statement obtained from the suspect is truly the product of his free choice. As author and former Federal prosecutor Scott Thurow wrote in an opinion article in Wednesday's New York Times: ``The requirement to recite Miranda is an important reminder to the police that the war on lawlessness is always subject to the guidance of the law.'' 
   Over the last 34 years, the Miranda rule has developed into a bedrock principle of American criminal law. The required issuance of Miranda warnings has been incorporated in local, State and Federal police practice across this nation. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say, as the Court said this week, that Miranda warnings ``have become part of our national culture.'' 
   Two years after Miranda was decided, Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. 3501, which laid down a rule that purported to overrule Miranda and to restore the case-by-case, totality-of-the-circumstances test of a confession's ``voluntariness'' that the Miranda decision found constitutionally inadequate. The validity of section 3501 did not come before the Court until now because no Administration of either party sought to use it, out of concern for its dubious constitutionality. The issue was finally presented only because an organization of conservative activists maneuvered a case before the most conservative Federal appeals court in the country. To her credit, Attorney General Reno declined to argue that Miranda had been invalidated by section 3501. She also declined to ask the Supreme Court to overrule Miranda, on the ground that it has proved to be workable in practice and in many respects beneficial to law enforcement. 
   The Court's decision this week in Dickerson v. United States--announced by the Chief Justice and joined by six other Justices--erased any doubt that the protections announced in Miranda are constitutionally required and cannot be overruled by an act of Congress. Section 3501's attempt to authorize the admission at trial of statements that would be excluded under Miranda is therefore unconstitutional, as I have long believed. 
   This week's resounding reaffirmation of the Miranda rule should put to rest the issue of Miranda's continuing vitality. Most law enforcement officers made their peace with Miranda long ago: It is time for the rest to do the same. That is why I am disturbed by Justice Scalia's parting shot in Dickerson. In a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Thomas, Justice Scalia vowed to continue to apply section 3501 until such time as it is repealed. 
   Mr. President, that time has come. I am introducing a bill today, together with my good friend, Senator FEINGOLD, to repeal section 3501. I can think of no good reason to allow this patently unconstitutional statute to remain on the books. On the contrary, leaving section 3501 on the books is sure to invite more unwarranted attacks on Miranda by the same conservative activists who brought us the Dickerson case. Enough is enough. Whatever you think of Miranda's reasoning and its resulting rule, seven Supreme Court Justices have reaffirmed its constitutional pedigree. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to uphold their oaths to defend the Constitution by repudiating an unconstitutional statute.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Attorney General of the United States testified yesterday for almost 4 hours before the Senate Judiciary Committee to answer yet more questions about campaign finance investigations and independent counsel decisions. She did so with her typical candor and integrity. 
   Not willing to settle for the fact that this hearing revealed nothing new, certain Republican Members have today sought to muddy the waters and twist the facts. I would like to cut through this political haze and set the record straight. 
   These are rumored recommendation to appoint a special counsel. 
   It is not the ``established custom'' and ``practice'' of the Judiciary Committee or its subcommittees to announce publicly confidential Justice Department information relating to pending matters. Although Senator SPECTER did so this past week when he held a press conference and spoke on national television about a reported recommendation of the Justice Department's Campaign Finance Task Force Chief Robert Conrad, that disclosure was highly unusual. Although the Senator has characterized this information as obtained by way of ``official investigation,'' such information nor its source has been shared with me or, to my knowledge, with any Democratic Member of the Committee or the Senate. 
   The only public statements of Mr. Conrad were made at a Judiciary Subcommittee hearing on June 21, 2000. In response to questions from Senator SPECTER regarding recommendations to the Attorney General with respect to a special prosecutor, Mr. Conrad stated, ``That, I don't feel comfortable discussing in public. I would perceive whether I have done that or not as something that pertains to an ongoing investigation.'' (Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, ``Oversight Hearing on 1996 Campaign Finance Investigations''). Senator SPECTER pressed him to discuss the matter in private, to which Mr. Conrad responded a firm, ``no, I am not suggesting that. I am suggesting that my obligations as a prosecutor would prevent me from discussing that.'' 
   At the Judiciary Committee hearing yesterday, the Attorney General also declined to respond to any questions on recommendations that may or may not have been made regarding appointment of a special counsel. She said, ``With respect to the present matter, as I said at the outset, I am not going to comment on pending investigations ..... I think it imperative for justice to be done that an investigation be conducted without public discussion so that it can be done the right way.'' 
   Other than the Attorney General and Mr. Conrad's public refusals to confirm or deny the existence of any recommendation, or to reveal the subject matter of any such recommendation, we have only Senator SPECTER's representation of information purportedly obtained from unknown sources and press accounts from unidentified ``government officials'' that Mr. Conrad has made any recommendation to the Attorney General about appointment of a special counsel. We have no confirmation from the principals involved that such a recommendation has actually been made nor of the subject matter of any such recommendation. Before Members of Congress invite the American public to think the worst about the Vice President and put him in the position of trying to prove his innocence of allegations, which even the anonymous sources have not detailed, we should heed the advise of the Attorney General to ``be careful as you comment that you have the facts.'' 
   Despite the fact that the Attorney General has appointed seven independent counsels to investigate matters involving the President and various Cabinet Officers, and appointed a special counsel to investigate the tragic events at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, Republican Members continue to press the charge that Attorney General Reno refused to appoint an independent counsel for campaign finance matters for some illegitimate reason. This charge is unfounded and refuted even by those people who disagreed with the Attorney General's decisions not to seek appointment of independent counsels for campaign finance matters, including the following.  
   I do not believe for one moment that any of her decisions, but particularly her decisions in this matter, have been motivated by  anything other than the facts and the law which she is obligated to follow.  
   Quoting FBI Director Louis Freeh, August 4, 1998.  
   At the end of the process, I was completely comfortable with [the Attorney General's] decision not to seek an independent counsel and with the process by which she reached that decision.  
   Quoting Charles La Bella, Former Campaign Finance Task Force Supervisory Attorney, May 3, 1998. 
   The integrity and the independence of the Attorney General are ``beyond reproach,'' quoting Charles La Bella, Former Campaign Finance Task Force Supervisory Attorney, August 4, 2000. 
   The Attorney General ``made no decisions to protect anyone,'' quoting Charles La Bella, Former Campaign Finance Task Force Supervisory Attorney, May 2, 2000.  
   [A]ll of the Attorney General's decisions were made solely on the merits, after full--indeed exhaustive--consideration of the factual and legal issues involved and without any political influence at all.  
   Quoting Robert Litt, Former Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General, June 21, 2000. 
   In response to whether he had any doubt about Attorney General Reno's integrity: ``No, I do not,'' said Larry Parkinson, FBI General Counsel, May 24, 2000. 
   The only political pressure on the Attorney General has come from the Republican majority. I believe that it was on March 4, 1997 that Senator LOTT first introduced a Senate resolution proposing a sense of the Congress that the Attorney General should apply for the appointment of another independent counsel to investigate illegal fund-raising in the 1996 presidential election campaign. 
   Within 48 hours, on March 6, 1997, Senator HATCH had his own resolution to this effect added to the Judiciary Committee agenda. Ironically, Chairman HATCH made clear that we would not ask for an independent counsel to investigate the Vice President and telephone calls made from his White House office. He characterized the criticism of the Vice President as ``scurrilous criticism.'' He said that he did ``not think that the speculation surrounding the Vice President is as serious as some would make it'' and indicated that he would not participate in making a big deal out of it. Even assuming that he had been engaged in a technical violation, the Chairman said that he would not call in an independent counsel to investigate those matters. 
   Rather than act in a fair, balanced and bipartisan way, on March 13, 1997, the ten Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee served a letter on the Attorney General requesting the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate possible fund-raising violations. 
   The very next day, March 14, 1997, we were called upon to debate on the Senate floor the Republican Senate resolution that the Attorney General should call for the appointment of an independent counsel. During the five days of Senate debate, Senator BENNETT observed that he viewed the coffees at the White House as inappropriate but not illegal:  
   [C]learly, it does not call for the appointment of an independent counsel. It is something we can talk about in the political arena. It is on the legal side of the line.  
   Nonetheless, when the time came to vote on the resolution the Republicans adopted it on a straight party-line vote. They then proceeded to table an alternative resolution, S.J. Res. 23, that would have called upon the Attorney General to exercise her best professional judgment, without regard to political pressures and in accordance with the standards of the law and the established policies of the Department of Justice to determine whether the independent counsel process should be invoked. That more even-handed language that did not prejudge the outcome or tell the Attorney General what to do was, likewise, opposed by every Republican Senator. 
   Thus, by their votes on March 14, 1997, every Republican Senator had evidenced that his or her mind was made up on these issues and as a party they marched lockstep to the conclusion that an independent counsel should be appointed. The House Republicans then refused to consider the resolution and it died without final action. Even after the multimillion dollar investigation by the Governmental Affairs Committee chaired by Senator THOMPSON into allegations of campaign finance, and the investigations by the Burton committee and in spite of the 20 convictions achieved by the Campaign Finance Task Force within the Department of Justice, the Specter investigation is now revisiting certain events from 1996. 
   The American people know a partisan endeavor when they see one. The American people know that the upcoming nomination and election of the next President of the United States are no justification for dragging these matters back into the Senate for more politics of personal destruction and innuendo and leaks and partisan investigating for short-term political gain. I had hoped that we had our fill of these efforts when the Senate rejected the efforts by Kenneth Starr and the House Republicans to force President Clinton out of the office to which he was twice elected by the American people. Regrettably, I was wrong and, apparently, some on this Committee are still engaged in destructive partisanship. 
   The Pendleton Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;607, prohibits the solicitation of campaign contributions, as defined by the Federal Election Campaign Act, on federal property. The Department of Justice has exercised a policy--through both Democratic and Republican Administrations--of declining to prosecute violations of section 607 that do not have some sort of aggravating factors like coercion of involuntary political donations. Indeed, the uncontroverted record of enforcement of the Pendleton Act demonstrates that both Republican and Democratic Justice Departments have applied this policy and declined to take action repeatedly over the past decades. By way of example, in 1976, the Justice Department declined to prosecute officials responsible for sending letters signed by President Ford to federal employees at their workplaces soliciting contributions on behalf of Republican congressional candidates. In 1988, prosecution was declined when two Republican Senators sent solicitation letters as part of a computerized direct-mailing to employees of the Criminal Division of the Justice Department. In response to my question at the hearing yesterday, the Attorney General confirmed that this remained the Justice Department's policy. 
   There is no evidence that fund-raising telephone calls, which the Vice President has acknowledged making from the White House, implicated any ``aggravating factors'' warranting prosecutorial attention. Nevertheless, and in the absence of such evidence, some have claimed that because a hard money component of the DNC media fund used to pay for television advertising in 1995 and 1996 may have been discussed at a meeting 
   attended by the Vice President and fourteen others on November 21, 1995, the Vice President's statements two years later that he believed the media fund to be entirely of soft money were false. Yet, as the Attorney General testified yesterday, only two participants--not four as Senator SPECTER stated this morning--even recalled that the hard money component of the media fund had been mentioned at the 1995 meeting. 
   The Attorney General testified that thirteen participants did not recall any such discussion and:  
   [w]hile the Vice President was present at the meeting, there is no evidence that he heard the statements or understood their implications so as to suggest the falsity of his statements 2 years later that he believed the media fund was entirely soft money, nor does anyone recall the Vice President asking any questions or making any comments at the meeting about the media fund, much less questions or comments indicating an understanding of the issues of the blend of hard and soft money needed for DNC media expenditures.  
   The Attorney General explained that the Justice Department lawyers had:  
   concluded in this instance--that the range of impressions and vague misunderstandings among all the meeting attendees is striking and undercuts any reasonable inference that a mere attendance at the meeting should have served to communicate to the Vice President an accurate understanding of the facts.  
   The Attorney General did not ``discount'' the information provided by David Strauss, who was present at the time of the November 21, 1995 meeting in considering whether to appoint an independent counsel to investigate the Vice President and his knowledge of the hard money component of the  media fund. Rather, as the Attorney General patiently explained yesterday, she fully considered the notes and the fact that Strauss himself believed the media campaign had been financed entirely with soft money. Indeed, this issue is discussed in full in the ``Notification to the Court Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 592(b) of Results of Preliminary Investigation'' publicly filed on November 24, 1998. 
   As the Attorney General explained, the fact that Strauss's contemporaneous notes reflect discussion of the hard/soft money split, does not bear on the Vice President's recollection of the matter. Any discussion about ``recorded recollection'' misses the boat. Federal Rule of Evidence 803(5) states that a:  
   memorandum or record concerning a matter about which a witness once had knowledge but now has insufficient recollection to enable the witness to testify fully and accurately, shown to have been made or adopted by this witness when the matter was fresh in the witness' memory and to reflect that knowledge correctly  
   Will not be considered hearsay. However, regardless of whether Strauss's notes could be admissible at a hypothetical trial, the fact remains that they are irrelevant on the question of what the Vice President, not Strauss, knew or heard. 
   Although it was insinuated that thirteen memoranda from Harold Ickes are evidence as to the Vice President's knowledge of the hard money component of the media fund, as the Attorney General testified yesterday, only six or seven of those memoranda predated the 
   telephone calls. In addition, as set forth in publicly filed court documents, there was no evidence that the Vice President had read them and the Attorney General testified that the Vice President's staff ``corroborated his statement that he did not, as a matter of practice, read Ickes' memos.'' 
   As to the Standard of Proof to Move from a Preliminary Investigation to Independent Counsel, Republicans have repeatedly suggested that an independent counsel should have been appointed for the Vice President and have focused on whether there was ``specific and credible information'' regarding wrongdoing. This is a mischaracterization of the applicable standard under the now-lapsed Independent Counsel law. As the Attorney General clarified yesterday, that standard is only relevant to whether a preliminary investigation within the Justice Department should be commenced. Indeed, such an inquiry was conducted, and concluded, with regard to the Vice President on two occasions. The Attorney General also testified accurately that in order to seek an independent counsel following the conclusion of a preliminary investigation, she needed ``reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted'' of the matters that had been under investigation. This standard was also accurately reflected in the Attorney General's notifications to the court on this issue, in which she found no such ``reasonable grounds'' as to the Vice President. 
   Regarding the Hsi Lai Temple Matter, Republican Members questioned the Attorney General about the Vice President's visit on April 29, 1996 to the Hsi Lai Temple in Los Angeles and speculated that he was not fully forthcoming about his understanding of the nature of the event. The Vice President has consistently insisted that he was not aware this event was a fundraiser. Senator SMITH observed yesterday:  
   I don't understand for the life of me why any individual would deny that he or she attended a fundraiser. Attending a fundraiser is not a bad thing.  
   Perhaps, the answer is as simple as this: that the Vice President did not know the temple event was a fund-raiser, just as he says. 
   The record is clear that the Vice President was initially scheduled to attend a fund-raising luncheon at a restaurant in Los Angeles on April 29, 1996, and that after the lunch, he was supposed to go to the temple, about 20 minutes away, for a community outreach event. No tickets were to be sold and no fund-raising was to take place at the temple. A few weeks before the events, the Vice President's schedulers determined there was not enough time for two events. The guests previously invited to the restaurant luncheon were told they could attend a luncheon at the temple dining hall after the formal ceremonies. 
   Although the luncheon at the temple was a DNC-sponsored event, no tickets were sold, no campaign materials were displayed, no table was set up to solicit or accept contributions, and the Vice President spoke about brotherhood and religious tolerance, not fund-raising. Attendees included a Republican member of the Los Angeles County Commission. 
   Notwithstanding these facts, Republican Senators have insisted that an email from an aide to the Vice President on March 15, 1996, suggests that the Vice President knew the Hsi Lai Temple event was a fund-raiser. This conclusion is wrong and ignores relevant facts. First, the original plan had been for the Vice President to participate both in a fund-raiser at a restaurant and a visit to the temple on April 29, 1996. Later that day he was to attend another fund-raiser at a private home in San Jose. The email to which the Republicans referred at the hearing, dated March 15, 1996, is from an aide and states in relevant part: ``we've confirmed the fundraisers for Monday, April 29th. The question is whether you wish to seriously consider [another invitation in New York.].'' The Vice President replied by email that ``if we have already booked the fundraisers then we have to decline.'' Obviously, the fund-raisers to which these emails refer are the one fundraiser originally scheduled at a restaurant in Los Angeles, later cancelled, and the fundraiser in San Jose. They do not refer to the Hsi Lai temple visit. 
   Regarding oversight of the Peter Lee case, Senator SPECTER has claimed that the Peter Lee case is a closed matter and that it was somehow appropriate to interview the district court judge in that case. The record should be clear that the Lee case is in fact pending in at least two respects. First, Lee filed a motion to terminate his probation on September 28, 1999. Opposition to the motion was filed by the government on October 6, 1999. A decision on that motion had not yet been rendered at the time of the Senator's interview of the judge in February 1999 and may remain pending today. In addition, until either this motion is granted or Lee's term of probation expires, Lee will remain under the supervision of the court and the Probation Department. Should he commit any violations, his probation could be revoked by the judge and he could be sentenced to a term of imprisonment. 
   Concerning the idea that Judiciary Committee Senators should have standing in independent counsel matters, I have heard the suggestion that the Judiciary Committee should have standing to seek judicial review of the Attorney General's decisions on special counsel matters. This proposal seeks yet again to politicize the integrity of the process. It also ignores the fact that the independent counsel law is no longer in effect. The special counsel process is simply governed by Attorney General regulations. Surely this Committee should not have standing to intervene in the application of internal Justice Department regulations. 
   I have expressed concern about the damage that can be done to the integrity of the criminal justice system if the majority in Congress politicizes prosecutorial decision-making, including by interfering in ongoing criminal matters and pending investigations. Authorizing the majority of a standing Congressional Committee to initiate a criminal investigation is a bad idea.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing S. 1515, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act Amendments of 2000, and sending it to President Clinton for his signature into law. I want to congratulate the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, and the Senator from New Mexico, Senator BINGAMAN, for their leadership on this bill. 
   During the Senate Judiciary Committee consideration of this legislation last year, I offered an amendment on behalf of Senator BINGAMAN to add the category of renal disease affecting uranium miners to the coverage of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. I am pleased to report that our amendment has been retained in the final version of this legislation. I know that Senator BINGAMAN sought higher compensation levels for radiation exposure victims in his original legislation, but has agreed to this bipartisan compromise to ensure the bill's final passage into law this year and to expedite compensation to radiation exposure victims in New Mexico. 
   I want to commend Senator HATCH and Senator BINGAMAN for a job well done.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Minnesota for his customary courtesy. 
   Over the past decade, the Internet has grown, as we know, from relative obscurity to what is today, both an essential commercial tool and increasingly an essential educational tool. With that expansion, we have had some remarkable gains. We have also seen new dangers for our children. Congress has reacted. We struggle with legislation that will protect the free flow of information, as required by the first amendment, while at the same time we shield our children from some of the inappropriate material that can be found on the Internet. 
   The distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. MCCAIN, spoke of his concern. I share his concern that much of the material available on the Internet may not be appropriate for children. I commend the Senator from Arizona for his good-faith effort to find a solution, but I cannot support the proposal he has urged. This amendment, his proposal, would require schools and libraries to certify, install, and enforce an Internet filtering program under the supervision of the Federal Communications Commission, and also under threat both of losing their e-rate discounts in the future and the financial liability of reimbursing discounted funds they have already spent. 
   In my view, as well intentioned as it might be, the amendment would substantially harm and not help the children of this Nation. I do not support it. 
   We have to tread cautiously and carefully in this arena but also understand a lot of schools and libraries have found a pretty practical way of doing this. 
   For example, many schools and libraries put their screens in the main reading room. One has to assume not too many kids are going to go pulling up inappropriate things on the web sites when their teachers, their parents, and everybody else are walking back and forth and looking over their shoulder saying: What are you looking at? It is one thing if you are looking at NASA's home page. It is another thing if you are looking at wicked dungeons or something, if there is such a thing. 
   Past legislative efforts to protect children by imposing content-based restrictions on the Internet have failed to respect our first amendment principles and pass constitutional muster. In 1997, the Supreme Court unanimously struck down the Communications Decency Act, which this body approved 84-16. 
   Just last week, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals held that the Child Online Protection Act is likely an unconstitutional, content-based restriction on protected speech. 
   I opposed this legislation--in fact, I was the only vote against it when it was offered as an amendment to the Internet Tax Freedom Act, S. 442, and spoke against it when it was included in the Omnibus Appropriations measure in October 1998. I predicted the courts would rule as they have done. 
   The McCain amendment to H.R. 4577 is likely to go the way of its predecessors. First, the amendment would require that schools and libraries obtaining e-rate discounts for telecommunications services use blocking and filtering software that makes inaccessible obscene material and child pornography, even if local authorities determine that other strategies are more appropriate for both students and library patrons. As the National Association of Independent Schools noted in commenting on this proposal last year:  
   *.*.* it is an individual school's decision to determine how best to address this issue in a way that is commensurate with its mission and philosophy--whether it be part of the teaching and learning process, the inclusion of appropriate use policies or enforceable language in parent/student enrollment contracts, or even filters. It is certainly not the role of the federal government to proscribe a course of action that interferes with what is decidedly a local matter.  
   Second, the amendment would invite the FCC to be the de facto national censor, collecting from schools and libraries around the country so-called ``certifications'' that they are implementing blocking and filtering programs on their computers with Internet access. The FCC would be responsible for policing these schools and libraries to ensure that they are fulfilling the promises they make in the certifications, and are in fact blocking computer access to obscene material and child pornography. The FCC would also be the ultimate enforcer in the scheme outlined in the amendment since the FCC has the responsibility for determining when the schools and libraries have failed to comply with the filtering requirements of the law and when ``the provision of services at discount rates ..... shall cease ..... by reason of the failure of a school to comply with the requirements.'' 
   We should not underestimate the power this would place in the FCC since the e-rate is a valuable privilege, particularly for 
   schools and libraries in poor areas and in rural areas with high costs for telecommunications services. The e-rate, passed as part of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, provides schools and libraries with deep discounts in telephone services and Internet access. Protecting children from viewing or receiving potentially inappropriate information is of the utmost importance. Yet, to ensure their continued eligibility for the e-rate, and to avoid having to reimburse past financial discounts, we can anticipate that schools and libraries will go overboard and block out material deemed by some to be inappropriate. Would, for example, online chat rooms focused on the works of Vladimir Nabokov and including discussion of the classic Lolita be off limits, let alone the work itself, since some may view it as pornographic? The film version of this book had a very difficult time finding a distributor due to the nature of the subject matter. 
   School boards and libraries faced with the risk of losing their e-rate can be expected to implement highly restrictive programs. This broad ``self-censoring'' imposed by the McCain amendment on schools and libraries will lead to a chilling of free speech to the detriment of our nation's children and library patrons. 
   Another consequence will be to re-make the FCC into an updated version of the Meese Commission on pornography, but with far greater enforcement powers and coercive effect. 
   As part of the certification process mandated in the amendment, we can expect schools and libraries to submit their plans for Internet filtering to the Commission for guidance on whether the proposals are acceptable. In practical terms, this would require the FCC to make literally thousands of determinations as to what constitutes ``obscene'' or ``child pornography'' in order to provide comfort to schools and libraries seeking guidance. The financial risks are too great for schools and libraries to simply wait for the FCC to find their filtering and compliance plan to be insufficient. This will, in the end, defeat the local decision-making to which this amendment pays lip service. 
   On the contrary, the amendment if enacted may lead to the Orwellian nightmare fully realized. The FCC, an unelected administrative agency, will be in the position to regulate the dissemination of knowledge and control what our children can read, view, and learn at school or at the library. 
   Taken as a whole, the problematic aspects of the McCain amendment will harm schools and libraries and decrease the value of the Internet as an important educational tool. By requiring a certification to the FCC, the amendment places yet another regulatory burden on financially strapped schools and libraries. 
   The distinguished Senator from Utah and I have put forward a proposal that addresses this problem and avoids the pitfalls inherent to the McCain amendment. We offered this proposal as an amendment to S. 254, the juvenile justice bill, and it was agreed to on May 13, 1999, by a vote of 100-0. Our Internet filtering proposal would leave the solution to protecting children in schools and libraries from inappropriate online materials to local school boards and  communities. It would require Internet Service 
   Providers with more than 50,000 subscribers to provide residential customers, free or at cost, with software or other filtering systems that will prevent minors from accessing inappropriate material on the Internet. A survey would be conducted at set intervals after enactment to determine whether ISPs are complying with this requirement. The requirement that ISPs provide blocking software would become effective only if the majority of residential ISP subscribers lack the necessary software within set time periods. 
   This Internet filtering proposal seems to be a sensible thing to do. As I said, it passed 100-0. Unfortunately, progress on this proposal has been stalled as the majority in Congress has refused to conclude the juvenile justice conference. This is just one of the many legislative proposals contained in the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, S. 254, designed to help and safeguard our children--which is why that bill passed the Senate by an overwhelming majority over a year ago. 
   I would like to see us go back to our filtering proposal. We have already voted on it. It is a workable solution. It would bring about what we want to do. 
   I commend Senator MCCAIN for his leadership and dedication to the subject. I hope we will work together on the issue. We share an appreciation of the Internet as an educational tool, we appreciate it as a venue for free speech, but we also are concerned about protecting our children from inappropriate material whether they are at home, at school, or in the library. 
   Ultimately, it is not going to be just a question of passing a law to do this. I suggest parents do with their children today what my parents did with my brother, sister, and me when we were growing up: Pay some attention to what their children read. 
   I was fortunate. I began reading when I was 4, but I had parents who actually talked about what I might read. Parents may want to spend some time on the Internet with their children. There is software that can help to protect their children, and parents should work with that. They ought to take a greater interest in what they are doing and not just assume Congress can somehow pass laws that keep getting knocked down, justifiably so, under the first amendment. Rather, they can work with the tools we can give for their children. 
   I thank my dear friend from Minnesota for his courtesy.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I described this amendment earlier this morning on the floor. But for those who came in late, this is an amendment that Senator HATCH and I offered on the juvenile justice bill. You may recall when we voted on that, the vote was 100-0. 
   It is a filtering proposal that leaves the solution on how best to protect children from inappropriate online materials accessible on computers in schools and libraries to the local school boards and communities. 
   Anybody who spends any time on the Internet knows that there is inappropriate material for children on there. And oftentimes you might hit it accidentally. 
   Having said that, we also know that you should not block out certain online material because somebody thinks that Mark Twain is inappropriate or they may believe that James Joyce is inappropriate, or other such things, or it may be even the paintings on the Sistine Chapel that some may believe are inappropriate because there are nude figures in there. You have to have some kind of balance. 
   I think that local communities can do that. I know of libraries, for example, that put computers monitors that have Internet access right out in the main reading room. This is one form of blocking because there are not too many children who are going to be downloading wild, offensive things when they know their parents, their teachers, and the librarians are going to be walking back and forth and seeing it. 
   As I explained earlier today, I have serious concerns with the McCain proposal to require schools and libraries to send certifications to the FCC about their installation of certain blocking software and the risk that the FCC will become a national censorship office, with the responsibility of both policing local enforcement of the Internet access policy and exacting punishment in the form of ordering E-rate discounts to stop and carriers be reimbursed. 
   The Hatch-Leahy amendment would require large Internet service providers with more than 50,000 subscribers to provide residential customers, either for free or at low cost, software or other filtering systems that can protect them. It is relatively easy to do this. 
   I would encourage parents, if this passes, to get that software and also spend some time seeing what their children are looking at on the Internet. This requirement on large Internet Service Providers would only become effective if surveys conducted jointly by the FTC and the Department of Justice demonstrate that voluntary efforts are not working. 
   Senator MCCAIN has worked very hard on this. I commend him for it. 
   Any one of us who has young children has to worry about this. We also have to worry about what they are reading in the library or what they pick up at the corner bookstore or anything else.  
   But before we reach a point where we assume we can be the parent of every child in this country, I think we ought to give to the parents the tools to use, and let them make the kind of judgments and show the kind of observation of their children that parents should, and that my parents did and that I do with my children. 
   I think the reason the Hatch-Leahy amendment passed 100-0 earlier in the juvenile justice bill is because it is a reasonable compromise. It is a reasonable compromise. I hope it will be added on to this bill. I look forward to working with Senator MCCAIN as this bill moves to conference to address the serious concerns I and others have with his proposal. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to call the Senate's attention to a recent tribute to the late Justin Brande authored by Professor Carl Reidel of the University of Vermont. 
   In his article, Professor Reidel captures the spirit of one of the most influential pioneers of 20th Century Vermont environmental stewardship. Justin Brande of Cornwall was among the founders of the Lake Champlain Committee and the Vermont Natural Resources Council, two of the most enduring and effective conservation organizations in our state. 
   Vermonters committed to stewardship of the land, to clean water and to family farms owe a debt to Justin Brande. He was a leader in organic agriculture and a selfless volunteer for countless community and stewardship organizations who earned the sincere respect of all. 
   I request that the text of Dr. Reidel's article be prined in the RECORD and note that his words serve as a wonderful reminder of a life well led and a  Vermonter whose legacy will nurture future generations. Vermont has been greatly improved because of both Justin Brande and Carl Reidel.  
   Brande Exemplifies Secret of Vermont  
   ``What's Vermont's secret?'' a friend in Minnesota asked after I gave a talk in 1975 about Vermont's innovative environmental laws. He couldn't understand how such a small state could be ``so creative, even bold.'' 
   I replied that I didn't know. I had only lived in Vermont two years. 
   I'm confident now that I know the secret of Vermont. It is people like Justin Brande, who lived in Cornwall from 1951 until he died on April 11 at the age of 83. Like so many who come to live in Vermont from elsewhere, Justin and Susan Brande knew they were coming home when they moved here. And the Vermont Constitution asserts that they are real Vermonters: ``Every person of good character, who comes to settle in this State ..... shall be deemed a free denizen thereof, and entitled to all rights of a natural born subject of this state .....'' (Chapter II, 66). 
   After graduating from Williams College and several years of legal studies, Justin married Susan Kennedy and moved to Vermont. They settled on a dairy farm in Cornwall, where they raised eight children. In the late '60's Justin sold their herd and enrolled at the University of Vermont, where he earned a master's degree in resource economics. He continued to work his land, honing the ability to farm organically long before most people heard of ``organic'' agriculture. I can't guess how many people he taught over the years to make compost and garden in ways that made pesticides and chemical fertilizers unnecessary by drawing on the inherent health of the land. 
   Early on Justin became involved in his community as a relentless advocate for the land--a free denizen who may have participated in the founding of more Vermont environmental institutions than anyone I have known. And always as a volunteer. He has been a delegate or alternate on the Addison County Regional Planning Commission since its founding. He helped establish the Lake Champlain Committee, and was a founder and the first director of the Vermont Natural Resources Council. 
   In recent years he co-founded the Smallholders Association, which advocates ownership of small, sustainable farms and businesses. Once again, he was ahead of others in seeing the dangers of large enterprises out of scale with Vermont. He argued that his call for moderation and limits was ``not nostalgia for the past, but a real workable model for today and the future *.*.* a truly humane, democratic and sustainable society.'' 
   Former Sen. Art Gibb recalls him as ``a man ahead of his time, a voice crying in the wilderness'' in his advocacy for land protection. Gov. Deane Davis who, with Gibb, crafted Act 250, said of him that ``although a staunch environmentalist, he came to problems open-minded until all the evidence was in. Then he took his stand. Justin got me started, and kept after me until Act 250 was signed into law.'' 
   My first encounter with Justin was shortly after I came to UVM in 1972 to direct the new Environmental Program. One of the first to teach in the program, his courses seemed to cover everything from cosmology to composting, with no student surviving without new respect for the English language and permanent doubts about conventional economics. 
   When he offered a course in ``organic gardening''--the first at UVM--the dean of the College of Agriculture chided me for allowing such ``nonsense'' in a classroom. It wasn't the first or last time that Justin Brande defined conventional thinking. 
   The secret of Vermont exemplified in Justin Brande's life is not, however, to be found in this summary of his accomplishments. Rather, it is in the words of the Constitution, which define a free denizen of Vermont as a ``person of good character.'' Justin passed the test in every way. 
   He was a person of unusual integrity--a man who lived his convictions, every day, in every place. Never a traitor to his beliefs, Justin taught me and many others by example the deeper meanings of personal integrity. 
   He was a man of courage who was himself in the presence of anyone, be it a fellow farmer, college president, governor or member of Congress. Friend or foe did not daunt him, because he always put principle above reputation. 
   He was a man who cared enormously, for family and friends, for Vermont, for Lake Champlain, for land and life itself. Justin and I enjoyed a good debate. We could disagree strongly, but never with an unkind word. 
   Once, at the end of a lively discussion, he said to me: ``What I like about you, Reidel, is that you are often in error, but never in doubt.'' 
   I have no doubts whatsoever that the secret of Vermont is people like Justin Brande, the every-day denizens who are the real heroes of this state.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, I am pleased to introduce at the request of the Administration ``The 21st Century Law Enforcement and Public Safety Act.'' This bill reflects the continuing aggressive approach of this Administration and this Department of Justice, under the leadership of Attorney General Janet Reno, to keep the both the violent and property crime rates in this country going down. 
   Under the Attorney General's leadership and the programs established by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, the nation's serious crime rate has declined for eight straight years. We are seeing the lowest recorded rates in many years. Murder rates have fallen to their lowest levels in three decades. Even juvenile crime rates have also been falling. According to the FBI's latest crime statistics release, on May 7, 2000, in just the last year, there has been a seven percent decline in reported serious violent and property crime from 1998 totals. Both murder and robbery registered eight percent drops, while forcible rape and aggravated assault figures each declined by seven percent from 1998. This is cause for commendation for the Attorney General and our Federal, State and local law enforcement officers, to whom all Americans owe an enormous thanks for a job well done. 
   This Administration has not rested on its laurels, however. Instead, the Administration has crafted the bill I introduce on their behalf today. It contains a number of good ideas to which the Judiciary Committee and the Congress should pay attention. Unfortunately, the Committee and the Congress has spent more time on symbolic issues, such as a proposed amendments to the Constitution to protect the flag and crime victims than to other concrete steps we could take to combat crime and school violence. Indeed, the majority in Congress has stalled any conference action on the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice legislation, S. 254, which passed the Senate by a substantial majority in May, 1999. 
   The Administration's bill contains five titles focusing on various aspects of crime. Title I contains proposals for supporting local law enforcement and promoting crime-fighting technologies, including expanding the purpose of COPS grants by funding an increase in the number of prosecutors as well as police; authorizing grants to improve the technology used for investigations in underserved rural areas--less than 25,000 people; and extending the Leahy-Campbell Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act. 
   Title II contains many proposals for breaking the cycle of drugs and violence. Title III would promote investigative and prosecutorial tools for fighting terrorism and international crime. Title IV would reauthorize certain VAWA programs and provide other assistance to victims of crime and consumer fraud. In addition, this title contains important proposals to prevent and punish abuse and neglect of the elderly and other residents in nursing homes and health care facilities and environmental crimes. The last title would strengthen federal criminal laws to combat white collar crime, including in correction facilities and involving the theft of government property. 
   While I have concerns with certain parts of the bill, such as proposals for increases in mandatory minimum penalties, a new death penalty provision and broad administrative subpoena authority, I support many other parts, such as the Extension of Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act to assist law enforcement in Vermont and across the nation obtain bulletproof vests and stay safe on the job. 
   Again, I commend the Attorney General and the Administration for this important legislation and their efforts to keep Americans safe from crime.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support the Violence Against Women Act of 2000 (VAWA II). As we head into the 21st century, violence against women continues to affect millions of women and children in this country. Whether you live in a big city or a rural town, domestic violence can be found anywhere. 
   I witnessed the devastating effects of domestic violence early on in my career, when I was the Vermont State's Attorney for Chittenden County. In those days, long before the passage of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), there were not support programs and services in place to assist victims of these types of crimes. Today, because of the hard work and dedication of those in Vermont and around the country who work on these problems every day, an increasing number of women and children are seeking services through domestic violence programs and at shelters around the nation. 
   Since the passage of VAWA in 1994, I have been privileged to work with groups such as the Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault and the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services who have worked to help put a stop to violence against women and provided assistance to those who have fallen victim to it. I am proud today to support the Violence Against Women Act of 2000, a Federal initiative designed to continue the success of VAWA by reauthorizing Federal programs to prevent violence against women. 
   Six years ago, VAWA passed Congress as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. That Act combined tough law enforcement strategies with safeguards and services for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. I am proud to say that Vermont was the first State in the country to apply for and receive funding through VAWA. Since VAWA was enacted, Vermont has received almost $7 million in VAWA funds. 
   This funding has enabled Vermont to develop specialized prosecution units and child advocacy centers throughout the state. Lori Hayes, Executive Director of the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services, and Marty Levin, Coordinator of the Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, have been especially instrumental in coordinating VAWA grants in Vermont. Their hard work has brought Vermont grant funding for encouraging arrest policies as well as for combating rural domestic violence and child abuse. These grants have made a real difference in the lives of those who suffer from violence and abuse. Reauthorization of these vital programs in VAWA II will continue to build on these successes. 
   We have tolerated violence against women for far too long and this bill continues to move us toward reducing violence against women by strengthening law enforcement through the extension of STOP grants, which encourage a multi-disciplinary approach to improving the criminal justice system's response to violence against women. With support from STOP grants, law enforcement, prosecution, courts, victim advocates and service providers work together to ensure victim safety and offender accountability. 
   The beneficial effects of STOP grants are evident throughout Vermont. From the Windham County Domestic Violence Unit to the Rutland County Women's Network and Shelter, STOP grants have resulted in enhanced victim advocacy services, increased safety for women and children, and increased accountability of perpetrators. The Northwest Unit for Special Investigations in St. Albans, Vermont, has established a multi-disciplinary approach to the investigation of adult sexual assault and domestic violence cases with the help of STOP funds. By linking victims with advocacy programs at the time of the initial report, the Unit finds that more victims get needed services and support and thus find it easier to participate in the investigation and subsequent prosecution. The State's Attorney's Office, which has designated a prosecutor to participate in the Unit, has implemented a new protocol for the prosecution of domestic violence cases. The protocol and multi-disciplinary approach are credited with an 80 percent conviction rate in domestic violence and sexual assault cases. 
   Passing VAWA II will continue grants which strengthen pro-arrest policies and enforcement of protection orders. In a rural state like Vermont, law enforcement agencies greatly benefit from cooperative, inter-agency efforts to combat and solve significant problems. Last year, approximately $850,000 of this funding supported Vermont efforts to encourage arrest policies. 
   Vermont will also benefit from the extension of Rural Domestic Violence and Child Victimization Enforcement Grants under VAWA II. These grants are designed to make victim services more accessible to women and children living in rural areas. I worked hard to see this funding included in the original VAWA in 1994, and I am proud that its success has merited an increased authorization for funding in VAWA II. Rural Domestic Violence and Child Victimization Enforcement Grants have been utilized by the Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, the Vermont Attorney General's Office, and the Vermont Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services to increase community awareness, to develop cooperative relationships between state child protection agencies and domestic violence programs, to expand existing multi disciplinary task forces to include allied  professional groups, and to create local multi-use supervised visitation centers. 
   This bill will also reauthorize the National Stalker and Domestic Violence Reduction Grant. This important grant program assists in the improvement of local, state and national crime databases for tracking stalking and domestic violence. 
   As we work to prevent violence against women, we must not forget those who have already fallen victim to it. This bill recognizes that combating violence against women includes assistance measures as well as preventive ones, providing assistance to victims of domestic and sexual violence in a number of ways. 
   The National Domestic Violence Hotline, which has already assisted over 180,000 callers, will be able to continue its crucial operation. Much like the state hotline that the Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault helped to establish in Vermont, the National Hotline reaches victims who otherwise have nowhere to turn. 
   I am particularly pleased to see that VAWA II will also authorize a new grant program for civil legal assistance. In the past, funding for legal services for victims of domestic violence was dependent on a set-aside in the STOP grant appropriation. This separate grant authorization will allow victims of violence, stalking and sexual assault, who would otherwise be unable to afford professional legal representation, to obtain access to trained attorneys and advocacy services. These grants would support training, technical assistance and support for cooperative efforts between victim advocacy groups and legal assistance providers. 
   As enacted, the Violence Against Women Act has funded programs that provide shelter to battered women and children. I am pleased to see that VAWA II expands this funding, so that facilities such as the Women Helping Battered Women Shelter in Burlington, Vermont, will continue to be able to serve victims in their most vulnerable time in need of shelter. 
   In addition to this funding, I am excited to see the addition of a provision for transitional housing assistance in VAWA II. This grant for short-term housing assistance and support services for homeless families who have fled from domestic violence environments was one of the biggest priorities for my State and I am pleased to see its inclusion in this legislation. 
   Despite the overwhelming benefits of this legislation, I do think there are some problems with this bill and it is my hope that we can work to fix them. For example, this legislation does not go far enough in providing the comprehensive housing assistance that state and victim's coalitions need in combating this problem. In Vermont, the availability of affordable housing is at an all time low. Providing victims of domestic violence with a safe place to reside after a terrifying experience should be a priority. I would like to see additional support for groups that addresses the need for funding for underserved populations. I had proposed a more extensive program of transitional housing assistance than we were able to keep in the bill. It is my hope that we can continue to work to expand these transitional living opportunities in the coming weeks as Congress takes up this bill. 
   Another area of concern that I wish to see addressed in this bill is the absence of a redefinition of ``domestic violence'' to include ``dating relationships'' in its provisions and grants. As written, VAWA II amends the definition of ``domestic violence'' for grants to reduce violence against women on campus to include dating relationships. I would like to see this definition amended to include all women. The Bureau of Justice Statistics report indicates that more than four in every 10 incidents of domestic violence involves non-married persons, and further, that the highest rate of domestic violence occurs among young people aged 16-24. Yet, VAWA, as currently enacted, does not authorize prosecution of their offenders. We cannot ignore this increasingly at risk segment of the population. 
   I was also pleased to see a new provision in VAWA II that would enhance protections for older women from domestic violence and sexual assault. Last year I introduced the Seniors Safety Act which would enhance penalties for crimes against seniors. This provision in VAWA II is an important complement to that legislation and I am glad to see we have been able to generate wide support. 
   The bill is also designed to help young victims of crime through funding for the establishment of safe and supervised visitation centers for children in order to reduce the opportunity for domestic violence. Grants will also be extended to continue funding agencies serving homeless youth who have been or who are at risk of abuse and to continue funding for victims of child abuse, including money for advocates, training for judicial personnel and televised testimony. 
   Many of the most successful services for victims start at the local level, such as Vermont's model hotline on domestic violence and sexual assault. The Violence Against Women Act II recognizes these local successes and continues grant funding of community demonstration projects for the intervention and prevention of domestic violence. 
   When VAWA passed Congress, it was one of the first comprehensive Federal efforts to combat violence against women and to assist the victims of such violence. Today's bill gives us an opportunity to continue funding these successful programs, to improve victim services, and to strengthen these laws so that violence against women is eliminated. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation and hope we can work together to ensure the swift passage of the Violence Against Women Act of 2000.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, the ``Artist-Museum Partnership Act,'' which would encourage the donation of original works by artists, writers and composers to museums and other public institutions, thus ensuring the preservation of these works for future generations. This bill would achieve this by restoring tax equity for artists. Artists who donate their self-created works, like art collectors who donate identical pieces, would be allowed to take a tax deduction equal to the fair market value of the work. 
   Under current law, art collectors who donate works to qualified charitable institutions may take a tax deduction equal to the fair market value of the work. This serves as a powerful and effective incentive for collectors to donate works to public museums, galleries, libraries, colleges and other institutions rather than keep them hidden from the public eye. Unfortunately, artists who create those same works may not take such a deduction. Instead, artists may only deduct the material cost of the work which is, in most cases, a nominal amount. This is simply unfair to artists in Vermont, and artists across the nation, who want to donate their works for posterity. 
   Prior to 1969, artists and collectors alike were able to take a deduction equivalent to the fair market value of a work, but Congress changed the law with respect to artists in the Tax Reform Act of 1969. Since then, fewer and fewer artists have donated their works to museums and cultural institutions. The sharp decline in donations to the Library of Congress clearly illustrates this point. Until 1969, the Library of Congress received 15 to 20 large gifts of manuscripts from authors each year. In the four years following the elimination of the deduction, the library received only one gift. Instead, many of these works have been sold to private collectors, and are no longer available to the general public. 
   For example, prior to the enactment of the 1969 law, Igor Stravinsky planned to donate his papers to the Music Division of the Library of Congress. But after the law passed, his papers were sold instead to a private foundation in Switzerland. We can no longer afford this massive loss to our cultural heritage. This loss was an unintended consequence of the tax bill that should now be corrected. 
   Over thirty years ago, Congress changed the law for artists in response to the perception that some taxpayers were taking advantage of the law by inflating the market value of self-created works. Since that time, however, the government has cut down significantly on the abuse of fair market value determinations. Under this legislation, artists who donate their own paintings, manuscripts, compositions, or scholarly compositions, would be subject to the same new rules that all taxpayer/collectors who donate such works must now follow. This includes providing relevant information as to the value of the gift, providing appraisals by qualified appraisers, and, in some cases, subjecting them to review by the Internal Revenue Service's Art Advisory Panel. 
   In addition, donated works must be accepted by museums and libraries, which often have strict criteria in place for works they intend to display. The institution must also certify that it intends to put the work to a use that is related to the institution's tax exempt status. For example, a painting contributed to an educational institution must be used by that organization for educational purposes. It could not be sold by the institution for profit. Similarly, a work could not be donated to a hospital or other charitable institution, that did not intend to use the work in a manner related to the function constituting the donee's exemption under section 501 of the tax code. Finally, the fair market value of the work could only be deducted from the portion of the artist's income that has come from the sale of similar works, or related activities. 
   In addition to restoring tax equity for artists and collectors, this bill would also correct another disparity in the tax treatment of self-created works--the difference between how the same work is treated before and after  an artist's death. While artists may only deduct the material costs of donations made during their lifetime, donations of those same works after death are deductible from estate taxes at the fair market value of the work. In addition, when an artist dies, works that are part of his or her estate are taxed on the fair market value. 
   The time has come for us to correct an unintended consequence of the 1969 bill and encourage rather than discourage the donations of art works by their creators. The public benefit to the nation, when artists are encouraged to contribute their works during their lifetimes, cannot be overemphasized. It allows historians, scholars, and the public to learn directly from the artist about his or her work. From artists themselves, we can learn how a work was intended to be displayed or interpreted and what influences affected the artist. 
   In Vermont, we were lucky enough to have Sabra Field, a well known artist who has been creating wood block prints for the past 40 years, donate over 500 of her own original prints to Middlebury College, at their behest. With those prints, Middlebury will establish the Sabra Field Collection so that students of the college as well as Vermonters and visitors to our state will be able to view her original works on display. We Vermonters owe her our thanks for her incredible generosity. Under current law, Ms. Field, whose prints have sold for up to $4,000 on the market, was unable to deduct the fair market value of the donated works from her taxes, as a collector of those same works would have been able to. In that instance, the public's gain was Ms. Field's loss. This legislation would create a win-win situation for all. 
   The Senate recently recognized the importance of the arts in our children's education when it passed a resolution designating March 2000 as ``Arts Education Month.'' The Artist-Museum Partnership Act could make a critical difference in an artist's decision to donate his or her work, rather than sell it to a private party, where it may become lost to the public forever. I cannot think of a better way to enhance arts education than to encourage the donation of art works by living artists, a few of whom we are lucky enough to have in Vermont, to public institutions across the nation. 
   I want to thank my colleagues Mr. BENNETT and Mr. LIEBERMAN for cosponsoring this bipartisan legislation. Mr. President, I would also like to submit to the record a letter from the Association of Art Museum Directors, in support of this bill.

   Mr. LEAHY. The Senator does make a good point about the point of order. We should either be consistent on these points of order or not have them, one or the other. 
   The Senator is correct that when a similar motion was made from the Republican side of the aisle yesterday, Senators on this side of the aisle who wanted to make a point of order refrained because there have been a number of amendments accepted on this bill by both Republicans and Democrats that were subject to the point of order of which the Senator from California speaks. We all refrained from making them. 
   The Senator from California raises a legitimate point that now, at the end of the bill, on her amendment, which is no more subject to a point of order than those other amendments where a point of order was waived, suddenly she faces the only point of order in this whole bill. I can understand her concern, and I share her concern.

   This is not a perfect bill, by any means. It does not do anywhere near enough on debt forgiveness, which is something we are going to have to address, I hope, in conference, and I hope we will have a larger allocation for that. It does not do enough on infectious diseases for the poorest of the poor countries, especially in Africa. It does not do enough for Mozambique and other areas. But it is a considerably well-balanced bill within the resources we had. I do compliment the senior Senator from Kentucky in working as hard as he has to accommodate Senators on both sides of the aisle to do that.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to also thank the distinguished majority leader for his work in bringing this up. This can sometimes be a contentious bill, as he knows. His efforts in working also with the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator DASCHLE, paid off. And the distinguished majority leader had the patience to allow Senator MCCONNELL and me to work through an awful lot of amendments on both sides of the aisle. 
   I thank the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. REID. We heard periodically the crunch in the Cloakroom as he broke a few arms, but we moved it through and got an overwhelming vote. 
   Senator MCCONNELL showed close cooperation with me and with Senators on both sides of the aisle throughout the process. I enjoy working with him. I know he agrees we need more resources for some of these issues, and we will work together to get them. 
   We have many interests around the world. We know U.S. leadership costs money. I think Senator MCCONNELL and I have tried to show a bipartisan cohesion on that. 
   I thank the staff. They spent many long days and late nights, many long weekends in getting this far. I appreciate that. Robin Cleveland, Senator MCCONNELL's chief of staff on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, as always, has been a pleasure to work with. She shows enormous competence and knowledge. I appreciate that. Her assistant, Jennifer Chartrand, was indispensable to this. Jay Kimmitt on the committee staff and Billy Piper on Senator MCCONNELL's personal staff have all been of great help. 
   On the Democratic side, I mention several. First, I want to mention Cara Thanassi of my staff who was there from start to finish. Ms. Thanassi, on the floor now with me, is a Vermonter. She will be heading back to graduate school, only after she spends a month in East Timor. I am proud of her and what she has done for the Senate. She has shown the best attributes of a true Vermonter. 
   J.P. Dowd, my legislative director, helped on the Senate floor during the many busy times of the last few days. Of course, Tim Rieser, the Democratic clerk on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, has worked on these issues in the Senate for nearly 15 years. He probably has as great an institutional memory on the foreign policy issues as anybody in the Senate staff or Senate and was truly indispensable. 
   Again, I thank the leader for his help in getting the Senate this far. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the legislation to improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, NICS. The NICS Partnership Act authorizes the Department of Justice to reimburse states for serving as points of contact under the NICS. Our legislation also requires the Attorney General to issue a report to Congress on the appropriate formula to reimburse states for their reasonable costs to serve as points of contact for access to the NICS. I am pleased that Senators HATCH, ROBB, DURBIN, KOHL, SCHUMER, and CLELAND are original cosponsors of this bipartisan bill. 
   The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1994 established the NICS and required federal firearm licensees to conduct a background check on the  purchaser of any firearm sale after November 30, 1998. In its first 18 months of operation, the NICS has been a highly effective system for keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and children. Having processed 10 million inquires during this time, the NICS has ensured the timely transfer of firearms to law-abiding citizens, while denying transfers to more than 179,000 felons, fugitives and other prohibited persons. That is a remarkable record in preventing crime and protecting public safety. 
   This success, however, has come at an unfair cost to many states. The NICS is mandated by Federal law, the Brady Act, but many states are picking up the tab for conducting effective Brady background checks. Congress should remedy this inequity. Effective Brady background checks are the responsibility of the Federal government under Federal law. As a result, it is only fair for Congress to reimburse states for their reasonable costs needed to conduct effective Brady background checks. 
   Because more comprehensive criminal history records are currently available at the state and local level in many states, instead of the Federal level, these states have elected to serve as points of contact (POCs) to access the NICS. A state POC is a state agency that agrees to conduct Brady background checks, including NICS checks, on prospective gun buyers. In states that have agreed to serve as POCs, federal firearm licensees contact the state POC for a Brady background check rather than contacting the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). These POC background checks review more records of people in prohibited categories, such as people who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution or are under a domestic violence restraining order. 
   Indeed, in my home state of Vermont, for example, which serves as a POC, approximately 28 percent of all denials of prohibited persons seeking firearm purchases are based on state charges which would not have been available for review at the FBI's criminal record repository. These purchasers were denied because a relief from abuse order had been issued against them, they had been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of family violence, they were wanted in the State of Vermont, or they had been convicted of a felony in Vermont and not fingerprinted. These results demonstrate the value of having the states act as POCs for NICS. 
   Currently, the following 15 states serve as a full POC for NICS: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont and Virginia. Another 11 states serve as partial POCs for NICS by performing checks for handgun purchases while the FBI processes checks for long gun purchases: Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Indiana, Maryland, New Hampshire, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin. Thus, more than half the states serve as full or partial POCs under the NICS. 
   In fact, of the 8,621,000 background checks conducted last year, 4,538,000 were handled by the FBI and 4,083,000--almost half--were handled by state POCs. So while some states relied on the FBI to conduct Brady background checks and paid nothing, the states that elected to conduct more effective background checks paid the full cost of them. That is unfair to states that are doing the right thing. 
   The State of Vermont, for instance, pays about $110,000 a year for its POC system to run effective Brady background checks on all firearms purchased through federal firearms licensees. In other POC states, the burden is higher on state legislatures to come up with funding sources to pay for effective Brady background checks.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this year's foreign operations bill provides $934 million in emergency supplemental funding toward the administration's request for plan Colombia. 
   I again want to express my appreciation to Senator MCCONNELL, and other members of the Appropriations Committee, for supporting provisions in the bill that will help protect human rights and strengthen the rule of law in Colombia. 
   I have repeatedly expressed concerns about the administration's proposal, particularly the dramatic increase in military assistance. I am troubled about what we may be getting into. The administration has yet to give me sufficient details about what it expects to achieve, in what period of time, what the long-term costs are, or what the risks are. 
   What the administration has said is that in addition to reducing the amount of drugs supplied from abroad, Plan Colombia is intended to prevent increases in drug addiction, violence, and crime here at home. 
   Those are goals that I strongly support, and I commend Senator WELLSTONE for his amendment. It would provide $225 million for substance abuse prevention and treatment programs in the United States. 
   According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, drug abuse kills 52,000 Americans each year. It costs our society nearly $110 billion annually. It has strained the capacity of our criminal justice system and our medical facilities, and brought violence and tragedy to families, schools, and communities throughout this country. 
   As of 1996, there were more than 13.6 million illicit drug users in the United States. Some 50 percent of adults in immediate need of drug treatment are not receiving it, and many treatment programs have lines out the door. 
   Eighty percent of adolescents who need treatment--those who will, if not provided treatment, sustain the demand for drugs in the future--cannot get it. 
   We should help Colombia. I support President Pastrana's efforts to combat the violence, corruption, and poverty which plagues his country. But I am not convinced that the administration's request for Plan Colombia will effectively address those problems, nor is it likely to reduce the flow of drugs into our country or ameliorate the drug problem here at home. 
   We do know, however, that substance abuse treatment and prevention programs work. A frequently cited Rand study showed that, dollar for dollar, providing treatment to cocaine users is 10 times more effective than drug interdiction efforts, and 23 times more cost effective than eradicating coca at its source. Scientific advances promise to make future treatment and prevention programs even better.  
   Ultimately, reducing the demand for drugs--which is what these programs do--is the only long-term solution to reducing the flow of illegal drugs from Colombia and elsewhere. 
   Mr. President, I commend Senator WELLSTONE for his leadership on this issue and I urge other Senators to support his amendment.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there has been discussion of the great honor that the distinguished senior Senator from Hawaii earned. He actually earned it when I was a child. He earned it on the battlefield in Europe, particularly in Italy, my mother country. 
   I will speak further on this at a more appropriate time. But I have served with DAN INOUYE for 25 years, and only because I was managing this bill was I not with him when he received the honor today. I talked to him before. I told him how enormously proud I am of him--all of his colleagues are proud of him--for the 25 years that I have served with him. 
   While he did not receive the honor at the time it was due--and many know why--his bravery was so well demonstrated at a time in this country when our sense of inclusion of people of all races was not as good as it is today. But I think the feeling of veterans and the feeling of historians have vindicated his achievements throughout all of this time. 
   I think of one thing. I was overseas for the 50th anniversary of D-Day, and when DAN INOUYE walked onto the stage when his name was announced, veterans from all over this country cheered and applauded. He was accompanied by another distinguished Member of this body who was also cheered, from the Presiding Officer's State, Senator Dole. It was an emotional moment for all Senators who were there to see two such loved Members of this body received that way. 
   Today we open a new chapter in our country--closing not a very good chapter--and we did the right thing telling everybody that DAN INOUYE earned the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to be sure there is no misunderstanding about my purpose in offering this amendment, which would reduce funding in the bill by a total of $21 million for programs to combat tuberculosis and malaria. The funding for these activities was included at my request, and I want to express my appreciation to Chairman MCCONNELL for that. 
   Like every Senator, I would like to see the highest possible levels of funding to combat these two dreaded diseases, which cause immeasurable suffering in developing countries. I have worked to do that for several years, and I fully intend to continue doing so. If our FY01 budget allocation would permit it, I would recommend higher funding for global health programs, including to combat TB and malaria. 
   However, we are forced to make excruciating choices. I want to be sure that we allocate our resources wisely, and that we also have sufficient resources to support vital programs to combat anti-microbial resistance, which is a worldwide problem of great urgency and immense proportions, and to strengthen disease surveillance in developing countries. 
   The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that in addition to providing increased funding above the current levels for programs to combat TB and malaria, we are also able to at least maintain, and preferable increase funding for anti-microbial resistance and surveillance. My hope is that effects of this amendment will only be temporary, that we will receive a higher allocation in the Conference, and that we will then be able to provide higher levels of funding for all of these critically important health activities.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as a former prosecutor, I am well aware that fugitives from justice are an important problem and that their capture is an essential function of law enforcement. According to the FBI, nearly 550,000 people are currently fugitives from justice on federal, state, and local felony charges combined. This means that there are almost as many fugitive felons as there are citizens residing in my home state of Vermont. 
   The fact that we have more than one half million fugitives from justice, a significant portion of whom are convicted felons in violation of probation or parole, who have been able to flaunt courts order and avoid arrest, breeds disrespect for our laws and poses undeniable risks to the safety of our citizens. We must do better. The Leahy-Kohl ``Capturing Criminals Act of 2000,'' which I introduce today, will provide additional tools and resources to our federal law enforcement agencies to pursue and capture fugitive felons on both federal and state charges. 
   Our federal law enforcement agencies should be commended for the job they have been doing to date on capturing federal fugitives and helping the states and local communities bring their fugitives to justice. The U.S. Marshals Service, our oldest law enforcement agency, has arrested over 120,000 federal, state and local fugitives in the past four years, including more federal fugitives than all the other federal agencies combined. In prior years, the Marshals Service spearheaded special fugitive apprehension task forces, called FIST Operations, that targeted fugitives in particular areas and was singularly successful in arresting over 34,000 fugitive felons. 
   Similarly, the FBI has established twenty-four Safe Streets Task Forces exclusively focused on apprehending fugitives in cities around the country. Over the period of 1995 to 1999, the FBI's efforts have resulted in the arrest of a total of 132,292 fugitives, including 64,336, who were state fugitives. 
   The Capturing Criminals Act would help our law enforcement agencies keep the pressure on fugitives by authorizing the Attorney General to establish regional Fugitive Apprehension Task Forces, to be coordinated by the United States Marshals Service; authorizing administrative subpoenas for use in obtaining records relevant to finding federal and state fugitives; and, finally, requesting a comprehensive report on the administrative subpoena authorities held by federal agencies, which vary in scope, enforcement and privacy safeguards. 
   ``Administrative subpoena'' is the term generally used to refer to a demand for documents or testimony by an investigative entity or regulatory agency that is empowered to issue the subpoena independently and without the approval of any grand jury, court or other judicial entity. I am generally skeptical of administrative subpoena power. Administrative subpoenas avoid the strict grand jury secrecy rules and the documents provided in response to such subpoenas are, therefore, subject to broader dissemination. Moreover, since investigative agents issue such subpoenas directly, without review by a judicial officer or even a prosecutor, fewer ``checks'' are in place to ensure the subpoena is issued with good cause and not merely as a fishing expedition. 
   Nonetheless, unlike initial criminal inquiries, fugitive investigations present unique difficulties. Law enforcement may not use grand jury subpoenas since, by the time a person is a fugitive, the grand jury phase of an investigation is usually over. Use of  grand jury subpoenas to obtain phone or bank records to track down a fugitive would be an abuse of the grand jury. Trial subpoenas may also not be used, either because the fugitive is already convicted or no trial may take place without the fugitive. 
   This inability to use trial and grand jury subpoenas for fugitive investigations creates a disturbing gap in law enforcement procedures. Law enforcement partially fills this gap by using the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C.  1651(a), which authorizes federal courts to ``issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.'' The procedures, however, for obtaining orders under this Act, and the scope and non-disclosure terms of such orders, vary between jurisdictions. 
   Thus, authorizing administrative subpoena power will help bridge the gap in fugitive investigations to allow federal law enforcement agencies to obtain records useful for tracking a fugitive's whereabouts. The Leahy-Kohl Capturing Criminals Act makes clear that the approval of a court remains necessary to obtain an order for nondisclosure of the subpoena and production of the requested records to the subscriber or customer to whom the records pertain. 
   I am certainly not alone in recognizing the problem this nation has with fugitives from justice. Senators THURMOND and BIDEN have introduced the ``Fugitive Apprehension Act,'' S. 2516, specifically to address the difficulties facing law enforcement in this area. I commend both my colleagues for their leadership. While I agree with the general purposes of S. 2516, aspects of that bill would be problematic. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee to resolve the differences in our bills. 
   Without detailing all of the differences in the bills, let me provide some examples. As introduced, S. 2516 would limit use of an administrative subpoena to those fugitives who have been ``indicted,'' which fails to address the fact that fugitives flee after arrest on the basis of a ``complaint'' and may flee after the prosecutor has filed an ``information'' in lieu of an indictment. The Leahy-Kohl ``Capturing Criminals Act,'' by contrast, would allow use of such subpoenas to track fugitives who have been accused in a ``complaint, information or indictment.'' 
   In addition, S. 2516 requires the U.S. Marshal Service to report quarterly to the Attorney General (who must transmit the report to Congress) on use of the administrative subpoenas. In my view, while a reporting requirement is useful, the requirement as described in S. 2516 is overly burdensome and insufficiently specific. The Leahy-Kohl ``Capturing Criminals Act'' would require the Attorney General to report for the next three years to the Judiciary Committees of both the House and Senate with the following information about the use of administrative subpoenas in fugitive investigations: the number issued, by which agency, identification of the charges on which the fugitive was wanted and whether the fugitive was wanted on federal or state charges. 
   Although S. 2516 outlines the procedures for enforcement of an administrative subpoena, it is silent on the mechanisms for both contesting the subpoena by the recipient and for delaying notice to the person about whom the record pertains. The Leahy-Kohl ``Capturing Criminals Act'' expressly addresses these issues. 
   This legislation will help law enforcement--with increased resources for regional fugitive apprehension task forces and administrative subpoena authority--bring to justice both federal and state fugitives who, by their conduct, have demonstrated a lack of respect for our nation's criminal justice system. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure swift passage of this legislation.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have often expressed my opposition to our anachronistic and self-defeating policy toward Cuba, so I will be very brief. I strongly support this amendment and congratulate the senior Senator from Connecticut, Senator DODD, who has been the leader on this issue for quite some time. 
   It is profoundly ironic that the United States is about to lift sanctions against North Korea, where we have 37,000 American troops poised to go to war on a moment's notice, and yet we continue to impose an economic blockade against a tiny island that poses no security threat to the United States. 
   If the Elian Gonzalez fiasco has taught us anything, it is that Cubans and Americans are far more alike than different, and that the views of the Cuban-American community in Miami are both outdated and at odds with the overwhelming majority of Americans. Of course we abhor the repressive policies of Fidel Castro, but the issue is how best to prepare for the day when he is no longer ruling Cuba. That day is approaching, and the longer we wait to use the intervening period to build closer relations with that island nation, the worse it will be. 
   This amendment is extremely modest. As Senator DODD has said, it would normally be adopted on a voice vote. It should be. What is wrong with a commission, representing a wide range of views, to review a policy that has, by any objective standard, failed miserably? It is long overdue. 
   So Mr. President, I wholeheartedly support this amendment. When I visited Cuba a year ago the Cuban officials I met with repeatedly blamed the U.S. embargo for all that is wrong in Cuba. I could not disagree more. A great deal of the misery that the Cuban people suffer is caused by the absurd and oppressive policies of their own government. But the embargo is not blameless, and it is a convenient excuse. 
   We should eliminate that excuse. We should seek to promote democracy and better relations with Cuba through the power of our ideas and our economy, just as we are about to do with North Korea, and just as we are doing with China, Vietnam, and other countries with which we have profound disagreements. This amendment will set the stage for a new day in our relations with Cuba, and I urge other Senators to support it.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, violent crime motivated by prejudice is a tragedy that demands attention from all of us. It is not a new problem, but recent incidents of violent crimes motivated by hate and bigotry have shocked the American conscience and made it painfully clear that we as a nation still have serious work to do in protecting all Americans from these crimes and in ensuring equal rights for all our citizens. The answer to hate and bigotry must ultimately be found in increased respect and tolerance. But strengthening our federal hate crimes legislation is a step in the right direction. 
   Bigotry and hatred are corrosive elements in any society, but especially in a country as diverse and open as ours. We need to make clear that a bigoted attack on one or some of us diminishes each of us, and it diminishes our nation. As a nation, we must say loudly and clearly that we will defend ourselves against such violence. All Americans have the right to live, travel and gather where they choose. In the past we have responded as a nation to deter and to punish violent denials of civil rights. We have enacted federal laws to protect the civil rights of all of our citizens for more than 100 years. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2000 continues that great and honorable tradition. 
   This legislation strengthens current law by making it easier for federal authorities to investigate and prosecute crimes based on race, color, religion, and national origin. It also focuses the attention and resources of the federal government on the problem of hate crimes committed against people because of their sexual orientation, gender, or disability. This bill will strengthen Federal jurisdiction over hate crimes as a backup, but not a substitute, for state and local law enforcement. In a sign that this legislation respects the proper balance between Federal and local authority, the bill has received strong bipartisan support from state and local law enforcement organizations across the country. This support from law enforcement is particularly significant to me as a former prosecutor. Indeed, it has convinced me that we should pass this powerful law enforcement tool without further delay. 
   This bill accomplishes a critically important goal--protecting all of our citizens--without compromising our constitutional responsibilities. It is a tool for combating acts of violence and threats of violence motivated by hatred and bigotry. But it does not target pure speech, however offensive or disagreeable. The Constitution does not permit us in Congress to prohibit the expression of an idea simply because we disagree with it. As Justice Holmes wrote, the Constitution protects not just freedom for the thought and expression we agree with, but freedom for the thought that we hate. I am devoted to that principle, and I am confident that this bill does not contradict it. 
   I commend Senator KENNEDY and Senator SMITH for their leadership on this bill, and I am proud to have been an original cosponsor. Senator KENNEDY has been a leader on civil rights for the better part of four decades and has worked hard to tailor this needed remedy to the narrowing restrictions of the current activist Supreme Court. Senator SMITH is someone I am getting to know better through our work on the Innocence Protection Act. He is becoming a worthy successor in the great tradition of Senators of conscience like Senator Mark Hatfield. 
   Now is the time to pass this important legislation. I had hoped that this legislation would become law last year, when it passed the Senate as part of the Commerce-Justice-State 
   appropriations bill. But despite the best efforts of the President, and us all, the majority declined to allow it to become law. 
   Since that failure, the need for this bill has become even more clear. Just two months ago, a white man named Richard Scott Baumhammers apparently went on a racially and ethnically motivated rampage that left his suburban Pittsburgh community in shock. First, he allegedly shot his next-door neighbor, a Jewish woman, six times and then set her house on fire. He then traveled throughout the Pittsburgh suburbs, shooting and killing two Asian-Americans in a Chinese restaurant, an African-American at a karate school, and an Indian man at an Indian-owned grocery. He also shot at two synagogues during his awful journey. This incident followed only a month after Ronald Taylor, an African-American man in the Pittsburgh area, apparently shot and killed three white people during a shooting spree in which he appears to have targeted whites. Policy investigators who searched Taylor's apartment after the shooting found writings showing anti-Semitic and anti-white bias. 
   These ugly incidents join the numerous other recent examples of violent crimes motivated by hate and bigotry that have motivated us to strengthen our hate crimes laws. None of us can forget the story of James Byrd, Jr., who was so brutally murdered in Texas for no reason other than his race. Nor can we erase last summer's images of small children at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles fleeing a gunman who sprayed the building with 70 bullets from a submachine gun. When he surrendered, the gunman said that his rampage had been motivated by his hatred of Jews. 
   And of course, we are still deeply affected and saddened by the terrible fate of Matthew Shepard, killed two years ago in Wyoming as a result of his sexual orientation. Last year, Judy Shepard, Matthew Shepard's mother, called upon Congress to pass this legislation without delay. Let me close by quoting her eloquent words:  
   Today, we have it within our power to send a very different message than the one received by the people who killed my son. It is time to stop living in denial and to address a real problem that is destroying families like mine, James Byrd, Jr.'s ..... and many others across America. ..... We need to decide what kind of nation we want to be. One that treats all people with dignity and respect, or one that allows some people and their family members to be marginalized.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator from Kentucky for his gracious comments. 
   I am very pleased to join my friend from Kentucky, Senator MCCONNELL, who as chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee has done a superb job getting this bill to the floor. 
   The Appropriations Committee reported this bill on May 9 after very little debate. The fact that it sailed through our committee was a reflection of the bipartisan way the bill was put together. We did everything possible to accommodate the wishes of Senators on both sides of the aisle. 
   This bill is $780 million above last year's Senate foreign operations bill. We increased funding for global health programs, which many Senators support. 
   We increased export assistance. We increased funding for a number of other important programs. That is the good news. But this bill is $350 million below last year's enacted level, and $1.7 billion below the President's 2001 budget request. 
   We were not able to fully fund several programs that have broad support, such as the Peace Corps, but I expect that more will be done in the conference committee. 
   The bill also does not respond adequately to the emergency disaster needs in Mozambique, which was devastated by floods earlier this year. We provided only $25 million out of a request of $193 million. I cannot help but compare the billions we have spent to relieve the suffering of people in Bosnia and Kosovo, with our minuscule aid to Southern Africa. 
   The bill provides only $75 million of the $435 million in emergency supplemental and fiscal year 2001 funding for debt relief for the poorest countries, which has bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. This is an international initiative led by the United States. We need to do our share. 
   We also fell short on the International Development Association, the soft-loan window of the World Bank. We are about $85 million short. 
   I have some real concerns about the way the World Bank is handling staff complaints of misconduct, such as harassment and retaliation. 
   I am preparing some proposals for the World Bank to address these problems. 
   Several Senators, both Democrats and Republicans, have written to me urging more funding for the Global Environment Facility, which supports programs to protect the ozone, reduce ocean pollution, and protect biodiversity. We were only able to provide $50 million, out of a request of $175 million. 
   Some have complained that the GEF is funding the Kyoto Protocol. Those critics owe it to the GEF to specify which activities they oppose, rather than making vague objections that are not based on facts. We need to find common ground on addressing these critical environmental problems. 
   Finally, I want to address the emergency funding for Colombia, which was attached to this bill in the committee. I want to help Colombia, which is facing threats from left-wing guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries, and drug traffickers allied with both. 
   I also have a lot of respect for Colombia's President Pastrana. We are already giving hundreds of millions of dollars to Colombia. 
   But I cannot endorse a proposal that would vastly increase our military involvement in Colombia that is so poorly thought out and suffers from so many unanswered questions. 
   Although the administration does not like to talk about it, this is only the first billion-dollar installment of a multiyear, open-ended commitment of many more billions of dollars. 
   Nobody can say what they expect this to cost, what we can expect to achieve, in what period of time, how intensifying a war that cannot be won will lead to peace, or what the risks are to hundreds of American military and civilian personnel in Colombia or to Colombian civilians. I have asked the Administration these questions, but their answers are vague at best. 
   Even the goal is vague. If it is to stop the flow of illegal drugs into the United States, that is wishful thinking. If it is to defeat the guerrillas, this is not the way to do it. I think the American people deserve better answers before we spend billions of their tax dollars on another civil war in South America. 
   Having said that, I very much appreciate Chairman MCCONNELL's willingness to include a number of conditions on the aid, which have strong bipartisan support. If this Colombia aid passes, these human rights conditions and reporting requirements are essential to ensure that the aid is not misused and that human rights are protected. 
   As with many other appropriations bills, we are going to need to get a higher allocation if the President is going to sign this bill. But as the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator STEVENS, has said, this is one step in the process. I believe it is a good start and that we should pass this bill. There is no reason why we cannot wrap it up very quickly. 
   With the distinguished chairman on the floor, I tell him that on my side of the aisle, I urge anybody who has amendments to get them over here and let us try to wrap it up in the morning so that by early tomorrow afternoon we can go on to a different bill. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I mention this only because I know we were in a quorum call and, being in a quorum call, this time would not be taken from the bill. The House of Representatives has passed overwhelmingly--I think with only four votes against it--the Electronic Signature Act. We will be taking it up in a matter of hours. I will speak further on this on the floor today, but I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for this bill. 
   A number of us worked closely--Republicans and Democrats alike--to craft the final package. I was one of the conferees and signed the conference report--indeed I also signed and supported the earlier report based on the agreement we achieved before the last recess weeks ago. I think that it is a good piece of legislation. I think it should pass. It includes consumer protections and balance that were lacking from the House-passed bill and builds upon the narrower provisions of the Senate-passed bill to include some additional provisions regarding record retention. 
   Originally, there were some who wanted to pass a digital signature bill almost for the sake of passing one. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed in both parties but also among the industry. I think most of those in the various industries that will be affected, who want an electronic signature bill, realize they have to have something that would have consumer protection in it. Otherwise, we could see companies that do not have a strong sense of consumer ethics misuse the bill. The public reaction would be such that a subsequent Congress would wipe out all the gains we made. 
   What has happened now is we have written in good protections. The best companies, those companies that value their reputation and are in for the long haul, will follow these rules without any hesitation. But companies that may think of this as a chance to make profits--sudden profits--from people who are not computer literate, people who are just coming across the digital divide, they will be stopped from preying on the innocent. 
   I think it is a good piece of legislation, as I said. A number of us, Republicans and Democrats, worked very hard on this. Now we do have a good bill. In the Senate, Chairman MCCAIN and Senator HOLLINGS, Senator HATCH and I and Senator GRAMM and Senator  SARBANES all participated in this conference, and from the House, Chairman BLILEY and Congressman DINGELL, worked to put this together. On our side Senator WYDEN made significant contributions, as well. 
   I urge, when this does come to the Senate floor, that it be passed, I hope unanimously. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is finally going to be considering the conference report on S. 761, the Electronic Signatures and Global and National Commerce Act.  
   I wish to be compassionate this Thursday evening. Tomorrow when the delayed votes occur, I will be in Vermont. But I am never sorry to be in Vermont. I will regret missing the final tally. I was honored to serve as a conferee and to help develop the conference report. I signed the conference report. I supported final passage. I go back to my native State secure in the knowledge that this will pass overwhelmingly with strong bipartisan support. 
   The legislation is intended to permit and encourage the continued expansion of electronic commerce and promote public confidence in the integrity and reliability of online commerce. These are worthy goals--goals I have long sought to advance. For example, in the last Congress, many of us worked together to pass the Government Paperwork Elimination Act. That gave a framework for the Federal Government's use of electronic forums and also electronic signatures. 
   Many of us have worked together in a very successful, bipartisan effort to promote the widespread use of inscription and to relax outdated export controls in this critical technology for ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of online communications and storing of computer information. We have areas as diverse as enhancing copyright, to patent potential for technology, to addressing the problems of cybercrime. We have been able to work together in a constructive, bipartisan way to make real progress to allow electronic commerce to flourish. 
   The conference report is a product of such bipartisan cooperation. We all know there were some bumps along the way. At one point, industry representatives were warned against even speaking with Democrats. Fortunately, those warnings were not heeded, and the final product is bipartisan. 
   I commend Chairman BLILEY from the other body, and Chairman MCCAIN from this body, for making this a real conference in which all conferees--Republicans and Democrats--had an opportunity to air their concerns and contribute to the final report. 
   All of us might have written some provision differently. But the conference report is, as conference reports should be, a solid and reasonable consensus bill that brought in the best of each of us. 
   It will establish a Federal framework for the use of electronic signatures for contracts and records to preserve essential safeguards and protect consumers. 
   It is geared to the five basic principles articulated by the Democratic Senators in a letter dated March 28, 2000, which assures effective consumer consent for the replacement of paper notices with electronic notices. 
   It ensures that electronic records are accurate. 
   It enhances legal certainty for electronic signatures. 
   It avoids unnecessary litigation. 
   It avoids unintended consequences in areas outside the scope of the bill by providing clear Federal regulatory authority. 
   It avoids facilitating predatory or unlawful practices. 
   This is not rocket science. But they want to make sure the American people can trust the electronic world as they trust paperwork. The American public have enough concern when they go online. They worry whether their privacy will be protected and whether damage by a computer virus will hurt their computer, 
   whether a computer hacker will steal personal information or adopt their identity, wreak havoc with their good name, or whether their children will meet a sexual predator. These are all drags on electronic commerce and show the people have to be concerned. 
   The AARP found that of consumers over the age of 45, half of them worry that electronic contracts will give them less protection than paper contracts. That is what we want to avoid. 
   The United States has been the incubator of the Internet throughout its infancy. And the world closely watches whenever we in our country debate or enact policies that affect the Internet. That is another reason why we must act carefully and intelligently when we pass Internet-related laws. The rest of the world watches and follows our example. 
   We have produced a charter for the next growth phase of e-commerce. This bill will be closely watched, widely read, and will be emulated across the world. Because of that and because most Americans want to make sure we can take our consumer laws for granted, we are presented the most significant consumer issues of a decade or longer. We have improved what the bill almost became considerably, to the benefit of consumers and in the interests of the smooth and sensible forward progress of Internet commerce. 
   This bill does strike a constructive balance. It advances electronic commerce but doesn't terminate or mangle the basic rights of consumers. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is finally considering the conference report on S. 761, ``The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act''. I wish that we could pass it tonight. Tomorrow, when the delayed vote occurs, I will be in Vermont. While I am never sorry to be in Vermont, I will regret missing the final tally. I was honored to serve as a conferee and help develop the conference report. I signed the conference report and support its final passage. I go back to my native State secure in the knowledge that it will pass overwhelmingly. 
   This legislation is intended to permit and encourage the continued expansion of electronic commerce and to promote public confidence in the integrity and reliability of online promises. These are worthy goals, and they are goals that I have long sought to advance. 
   For example, in the last Congress, many of us worked together to pass the Government Paperwork Elimination Act, which established a framework for the federal government's use of electronic forms and electronic signatures. Many of us have worked together in a successful bipartisan effort to promote the widespread use of encryption and relax out-dated export controls on this critical technology for ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of online communications and stored computer information. In areas as diverse as enhancing copyright and patent protections for new technologies and updating our criminal laws to address new forms of cybercrime, we have been able to work together in a constructive, bipartisan way to make real progress on a sound legal framework for electronic commerce to flourish. 
   The conference report is the product of such bipartisan cooperation. I think we all know that there were some bumps along the way. At one point, industry representatives were warned against even speaking with any Democrats. But the final product is bipartisan. It is an example of Congress at work rather than at loggerheads. It is legislators legislating rather than politicians posturing and unnecessarily politicizing important matters of public policy. 
   I commend Chairman BLILEY and Chairman MCCAIN for making this a real conference, in which all conferees, Republican and Democratic, had an opportunity to air their concerns and contribute to the final report. We all might have written some provisions differently, but the conference report is a solid and reasonable consensus bill that will establish a Federal framework for the use of electronic signatures, contracts, and records, while preserving essential safeguards protecting the Nation's consumers. 
   The conference report adheres to the five basic principles for e-sign legislation articulated by the Democrat Senators in a letter dated March 28, 2000. 
   It ensures effective consumer consent to the replacement of paper notices with electronic notices. 
   It ensures that electronic records are accurate, and relevant parties can retain and access them. 
   It enhances legal certainty for electronic signatures and records and avoids unnecessary litigation by authorizing regulators to provide interpretive guidance. 
   It avoids unintended consequences in areas outside the scope of the bill by providing clear federal regulatory authority for records not covered by the bill's ``consumer'' provisions. 
   And, it avoids facilitating predatory or unlawful practices. 
   These principles are not rocket science but are simply intended to ensure that the electronic world is no less safe for American consumers than the paper world. The American public has enough concern when they go online. They worry whether their privacy will  be protected, whether a damaging computer virus will attack their computer, whether a computer hacker will steal their personal information, adopt their identity and wreak havoc with their good names, or whether their kids will meet a sexual predator. These worries are all serious drags on electronic commerce. 
   An AARP survey of computer users over the age of 45 released on March 31st found that almost half of respondents already think that electronic contracts would give them less protection than paper contracts, while only one-third believe they would have the same degree of protection. With this conference report, we have avoided aggravating consumers' worries. Companies doing business online want to reassure consumers and potential customers that their interests will be protected online, not heighten their concern about electronic commerce. Our conference report should be helpful in this regard. 
   Mr. President, the United States has been the incubator of the Internet through its infancy. The world closely watches whenever we debate or enact policies that affect the Internet, and that is another reason why we must act carefully and intelligently whenever we pass Internet-related laws. What we have produced here is the charter for the next growth phase of e-commerce, and this bill will be closely read and widely emulated. Because of the potential this bill had for eviscerating scores of basic state consumer protection laws that most Americans today take for granted, this bill also has presented us with perhaps the most significant consumer issues of a decade or longer--not for what, thank goodness, this bill is in its final form, but for what this bill nearly became in its earlier stages. To the benefit of consumers and in the interest of the smooth and sensible forward progress of Internet commerce, this bill largely strikes a constructive balance. It advances electronic commerce without terminating or mangling the basic rights of consumers. 
   Before I discuss specific provisions of the conference report, I note that I saw in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of the House proceedings a statement by Chairman BLILEY that is formatted like a managers' statement of a conference report. I feel I must clarify that those are Mr. BLILEY's views, not a statement of the managers. In fact, I saw it for the first time today, when I picked up the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, and have not yet had a chance to study it thoroughly. 
   I will now describe how the conference report gives effect to the Democratic Senators' five basic principles. 
   First, the conference report will ensure informed and effective consumer consent to the replacement of paper notices and disclosures with electronic notices and disclosures, so that consumers are not forced or tricked into receiving notices and disclosures in an electronic form that they cannot access or decipher. 
   Under the House bill, a business could obtain a consumer's ``consent'' simply by specifying the hardware and software needed to access the notices and disclosures. This approach would have done little or nothing to protect technologically unsophisticated consumers, who may not know whether they have the necessary hardware and software even if the technical specifications are provided. 
   I maintained that any standard for affirmative consent must require consumers to consent electronically to the provision of electronic notices and disclosures in a manner that verified the consumer's capacity to access the information in the form in which it would be sent. Such a mechanism provides a check against coercion, and additional assurance that the consumer actually has an operating e-mail address and the other technical means for accessing the information. 
   Section 101(c) of the conference report requires the use of a technological check, while leaving companies with ample flexibility to develop their own procedures. The critical language, which Senator WYDEN and I developed and proposed, provides that a consumer's consent to the provision of information in electronic form must involve a demonstration that the consumer can actually receive and read the information. Section 101(c) also provides that if there is a material change in the hardware or software requirements needed to access or retain the information, the company must again verify that the consumer can receive and read the information, or allow the consumer to withdraw his or her consent without the imposition of any conditions, consequences or fees. In addition, prior to any consent, a consumer must be notified of his or her rights, including the right to receive notices on paper and any available option for reverting to paper after an electronic relationship has been established. 
   Senator GRAMM has criticized the conference report on the ground that its technological check on consumer consent unfairly discriminates against electronic commerce. But those most familiar with electronic commerce have never seriously disputed the need for a technological check. In fact, many high tech firms have acknowledged that it is good business practice to verify that their customers can open their electronic records, and many already have implemented some sort of technological check procedure. I am confident that the benefits of a one-time technological check far outweigh any possible burden on e-commerce, and it will greatly increase consumer confidence in the electronic marketplace. 
   Let me make special note of section 101(c)(3), a late addition to the conference report. Without this provision, industry representatives were concerned that consumers would be able to back out of otherwise enforceable contracts by refusing to consent, or to confirm their consent, to the provision of information in an electronic form. At the same time, however, companies wanted to 
   preserve their autonomy as contracting parties to condition their own performance on the consumer's consent. For example companies anticipated that they might offer special deals for consumers who agreed not to exercise their right to paper notices. Section 101(c)(3) makes clear that failure to satisfy the consent requirements of section 101(c)(1) does not automatically vitiate the underlying contract. Rather, the continued validity of the contract would turn on the terms of the contract itself, and the intent of the contracting parties, as determined under applicable principles of State contract law. Failure to obtain electronic consent or confirmation of consent would, however, prevent a company from relying on section 101(a) to validate an electronic record that was required to be provided or made available to the consumer in writing. 
   I should also explain the significance of section 101(c)(6), which was added at the request of the Democratic conferees. This provision makes clear that a telephone conversation cannot be substituted for a written notice to a consumer. For decades, consumer laws have required that notices be in writing, because that form is one that the consumer can preserve, to which the consumer can refer, and which is capable of demonstrating after the fact what information was provided. Under appropriate conditions, electronic communications can mimic those characteristics; but oral notice over the telephone will never be sufficient to protect consumer interests. 
   Second, the conference report will ensure that electronic contracts and other electronic records are accurate and that relevant persons can retain and access them. Consumers must be able to retain electronic records and must have some assurance that they provide reasonable guarantees of the accuracy and integrity of the information that they contain. 
   Under section 101(e) of the conference report, the legal effect of an electronic contract or record may be denied if it is not in a form that can be retained and accurately reproduced for later reference and settlement of disputes. This means that the parties to a contract may not satisfy a statute of frauds requirement that the contract be in writing simply by flashing an electronic version of the contract on a computer screen. Similarly, product warranties must be provided to purchasers in a form that they can retain and use to enforce their rights in the event that the product fails. 
   Third, the conference report will enhance legal certainty for electronic signatures and records and avoid unnecessary litigation by authorizing Federal and State regulators to provide  interpretive guidance. Even with the representation on this conference of Members from committees of varied jurisdiction, we could not begin to think of every circumstance that might arise in the future as to which this legislation will apply. It was therefore essential to provide regulatory agencies with sufficient flexibility and interpretive authority to implement the statutes modified by the legislation. 
   Most importantly, the conference report preserves substantial authority for Federal and State regulators with respect to record-keeping requirements. In a letter dated May 23, 2000, the 
   Department of Justice expressed concern that an early draft of the conference report, produced by certain Republican conferees, would ``seriously undermine the government's ability to investigate, try and convict criminals who alter or hide required records in programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and federal environmental laws.'' The Department explained:  
   Record Retention. As presently drafted, the bill leaves the public at risk for serious waste, fraud, and abuse. For example, under the current bill, there is nothing to prevent a Medicare contractor from retaining its financial records on a spreadsheet (such as Excel or Quattro Pro). However, because those programs generally contain no security features to monitor changes to the files they create, anyone could change one number on a spreadsheet, which would then change all other numbers affected by the impermissible entry, reflecting a financial picture different from the reality. The government could have its hands tied in seeking to establish rules to ensure that such records could not be altered.  
   The Department's concerns regarding the Federal Government were shared by the States, whose regulators need and deserve the same flexibility as Federal regulators. This is particularly true in areas where the States are the primary regulators, as they are with respect to insurance and State-chartered banks. Having pressed this point throughout the conference, I am pleased that the final report treats Federal and State regulators with equal respect, and that it has won the support of the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
   Under earlier drafts of this conference report, as in H.R. 1714 as passed by the House, a requirement that a record be retained could be met by retaining an electronic record that accurately reflected the information set forth in the record ``after it was first generated in its final form as an electronic record.'' By striking that final phrase, we made clear that agencies, through their interpretive authority, can ensure that electronic records remain accurate throughout the period that they are required by law to be retained. For additional certainty, we expressly authorized agencies to set performance standards to assure the accuracy, integrity, and accessibility of records that are required to be retained and, if necessary, to require retention of a record in paper form. We also delayed the effective date of the Act with respect to record retention requirements, to give agencies time to put in place appropriate regulations designed to assure effective and sustainable record retention, and to prevent companies from retaining materials in any easily alterable form that they chose until regulations are forthcoming. Together, these changes will avoid facilitating lax record-keeping practices that could impede the enforcement of program requirements, anti-fraud statutes, environmental laws, and many other laws and regulations. 
   Fourth, the conference report will avoid unintended consequences for laws and regulations governing ``records'' outside its intended focus on business-to-consumer and business-to-business transactions. I was seriously concerned that the sweeping legislation passed by the House would allow hazardous materials transporters to provide truckers with the required description of 
   the materials via electronic mail, so that key information might not be available to clean-up crews in the event an accident disabled the driver. Similarly, I worried that the House bill would allow employers to provide OSHA-required warnings on a Web site rather than on a dangerous machine. 
   The conference report raises no such concerns. For one thing, it specifically excludes from its scope any documents required to accompany the transportation or handling of hazardous materials, pesticides, and other toxic or dangerous materials. For another thing, it expressly preserves all Federal and State requirements that information be posted, displayed or publicly affixed. In addition to allaying concerns about OSHA-warnings, this provision ensures that the bill will not inadvertently undermine Federal and State labeling requirements, such as requirements that poisonous products be labeled with the skull and crossbones symbol. 
   Perhaps more importantly, the scope of the legislation has been narrowed. As reported by the conference committee, the bill covers signatures, contracts and records relating to a ``transaction'' in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, with the critical term--``transaction''--defined to mean ``an action or set of actions relating to the conduct of business, consumer, or commercial affairs between two or more persons.'' The conferees specifically rejected including ``governmental'' affairs in this definition. Thus, for example, the bill would not cover records generated purely for governmental purposes, such as regular monitoring reports on air or water quality that an agency may require pursuant to the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Act, or similar Federal or State environmental laws. 
   Fifth and finally, the conference report avoids the problem created by many earlier drafts, including the House bill, of potentially facilitating unfair and deceptive practices. It does this through a broad savings clause which clarifies that the bill does not limit any legal requirement or prohibition other than those involving the writing, signature, or paper form of a contract. Laws--including common law rules--that prohibit fraud, unfair or deceptive trade practices, or unconscionable contracts are not affected by this Act. A wrongdoer may not argue that fraudulent conduct that complies with the technical requirements of section 101(c) is beyond the reach of anti-fraud laws. By the same token, a consumer is always entitled to assert that an electronic signature is a forgery, was used without authority, or otherwise is invalid for reasons that would invalidate the effect of a signature in written form. 
   This legislation has come a long way in conference. It is far from the reckless bill it was in danger of becoming. Still, it is far from perfect. As a general matter, I believe it may still be unduly preemptive of State regulatory and record-keeping authority. It is ironic that the same Members who claim to be vigilant guardians of States' rights are so quick to impose broad Federal mandates on the States when it suits their political interests. The majority has failed to explain why the expansion of the Internet justifies jettisoning the federalist principles that have governed our Republic for more than two centuries. I have worked hard, in connection with this bill and others, to preserve State 
   authority in areas traditionally reserved to the States, particularly where there is no conflict between the Federal goals and State jurisdiction. We should preempt State authority only when there is a demonstrated need to establish a national standard, and even then, only for as long as is necessary. 
   That being said, the conference report appropriately rejects the massively preemptive approach taken by earlier versions of this legislation, including the House-passed bill. As the National Governors' Association observed in a letter to Congress dated March 14, 2000, ``H.R. 1714's ambiguity with respect to preemption [was] very troubling''. It authorized States to ``modify, limit, or supersede'' the Federal statute by adopting the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), but then rendered this authorization irrelevant by stating that no State law (including UETA) was effective to the extent that it was inconsistent with the Federal statute or technology specific. 
   By contrast, the conference report does not preempt the laws of those States that adopt UETA, so long as UETA is adopted in a uniform manner. Such exceptions to UETA as a State may adopt are preempted, but only to the extent that they violate the principle of technological neutrality or are otherwise inconsistent with the Federal statute. This affords States considerable flexibility; for example, a  State may enact UETA to incorporate the consumer consent procedures set forth in section 101(c). 
   In addition, section 104(a) of the conference report expressly preserves governmental filing requirements. Federal agencies are already working toward full acceptance of electronic filings, pursuant to the schedule established by the Government Paperwork Elimination Act. I am confident that State agencies will follow our lead. Until they are technologically equipped to do so, however, they have an unqualified right under section 104(a) to continue to require records to be filed in a tangible printed or paper form. 
   I have a number of other concerns about the conference report. In particular, I am troubled that the conference report fails to provide a clear Federal rule--or, indeed, any rule at all--concerning how it is intended to affect requirements that information be sent, provided, or otherwise delivered. The absence of a delivery provision is particularly conspicuous given the fact that the prototype for this legislation does include such a provision. Section 8(a) of UETA provides that if a law requires information to be sent in writing to another person (but does not specify a particular method of delivery), the requirement is satisfied if the information is sent in an electronic record that the recipient can retain. Under section 8(b), if a law requires information to be sent by a specified method--whether by regular U.S. Mail, express mail, registered mail, certified mail, or another method--then the information must be sent by the method specified in the other law, except that parties may contract out of regular mail requirements to the extent permitted by the other law. UETA also contains a detailed rule for determining when an electronic record is sent, and when it is received. 
   The conference report touches upon the issue of delivery in section 101(c)(2)(B), but only with respect to specified methods 
   that require verification or acknowledgment of receipt, such as registered or certified mail. What happens to State law requirements that a notice be sent by first-class mail or personal delivery? How about a law that requires information to be provided, sent, or delivered in writing, but does not specify a particular method of delivery? I raised these questions during the conference, but the conference report provides few answers. 
   The conference report does provide some guidance in the case of States that enact UETA. In such States, section 8(a) of UETA will govern with respect to general delivery requirements, and section 8(b)(2) of UETA will govern with respect to requirements that information be delivered by a specified method, subject to section 102(c) of the federal legislation. Section 102(c) prevents States that enact UETA from circumventing the federal legislation through the imposition of new nonelectronic delivery methods. Thus, States enacting UETA may continue to prescribe specific delivery methods, so long as there is an electronic alternative for any nonelectronic delivery methods. 
   This leaves the question of how the Federal legislation will affect Federal delivery requirements and State delivery requirements in non-UETA States. Because our bill is silent on this question, and because repeal and preemption by implication are disfavored, a court or agency interpreting the legislation could reasonably conclude that these Federal and State delivery requirements remain in full force and effect. Indeed, this interpretation is practically compelled by the plain language of the legislative text. It does, however, have the potential to undermine one of our key legislative objectives--that is, the elimination of unintended and unwarranted barriers to electronic commerce. For this reason, it will be tempting to discern in this legislation some sort of plan to permit electronic delivery of information whenever delivery is required by law, even when the law specifies a particular method by which delivery must be made. Let me assure the courts and regulators that have occasion to read these words that this legislator had no such plan. 
   Had we in fact addressed this issue in conference, my goal would have been to ensure that any specific requirement that information be sent or delivered not be relaxed or weakened through this Act. I believe an electronic method of delivery should be at least as reliable, secure, and effective as the method it replaces. Thus, a law that requires information to be delivered to a person by first class mail should not be satisfied simply by posting the information on a Web site; at a minimum, the person must also be notified of the location and availability of the information. Nor is information delivered, in my view, if it is electronically posted for an unreasonably short period of time, or sent electronically in a manner that inhibits the ability of the recipient to store or print the information. 
   Having failed to address the issue of delivery, we may be compelled to revisit the issue at a later date. We will, by then, have the benefit of the Commerce Department's study under section 105(a) of the conference report, regarding the effectiveness and reliability of electronic mail as compared with more traditional methods of delivery. 
   Another troubling provision in the conference report appears at the end of section 101, and concerns the liability of insurance agents and insurance brokers. This provision appeared for the first time in a conference draft produced by the Republican conferees on May 15th. In its original incarnation, this provision gave insurance agents and brokers absolute immunity from liability if something went wrong as a result of the use of electronic procedures. This was not just a shield from vicarious liability, or even from negligence; rather, it was an absolute shield, which would protect insurance agents and brokers from their own reckless or even wilful conduct. No matter that insurance agents and brokers are perfectly capable of protecting themselves through their contracts with insurance companies and their customers. Senator HOLLINGS and I opposed the provision as unnecessary and indefensible as a matter of policy, and we succeeded in transforming it into a clarification that insurance agents and brokers cannot be held vicariously liable for deficiencies in electronic procedures over which they had no control. In this form, the provision remains in the bill as a stark reminder of the power of special interests. 
   Section 104(d)(1) is another political compromise that blemishes this conference report, although I believe its actual impact will be negligible. It provides that Federal agencies may exempt a specified category or type of record from the consumer consent requirements of section 101(c), but only if such exemption is ``necessary'' to eliminate a ``substantial'' burden on electronic commerce, and it will not increase the material risk of harm to consumers. While Chairman BLILEY indicated in his floor statement yesterday that this test should not be read as too limiting, the opposite is true. The test is, and was intended to be, demanding. The exemption must be ``necessary,'' and not merely ``appropriate,'' as Chairman BLILEY suggested. It should also be noted that the conferees considered and specifically rejected language that would have authorized State agencies to exempt records from the consent requirements. 
   Finally, I want to discuss the concept of technology neutrality that is so central to this bill. This legislation is, appropriately, technology neutral. It leaves it to the parties to choose the authentication technology that meets their needs. At the same time, it is undeniable that some authentication technologies are more secure than others. Nothing in the conference report prevents or in any way discourages parties from considering issues of security when deciding which authentication technology to use for a particular application. Indeed, such considerations are wholly appropriate. 
   Pursuant to the Government Paperwork Elimination Act, passed by the previous Congress, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has adopted regulations to permit individuals to obtain, submit and sign government forms electronically. These regulations direct Federal agencies to recognize that different security approaches offer varying levels of assurance in an electronic environment and that deciding which to use in an application depends first upon finding a balance between the risks associated with the loss, misuse or compromise of the information,  and the benefits, costs 
   and effort associated with deploying and managing the increasingly secure methods to mitigate those risks. 
   The OMB regulations recognize that among the various technical approaches, in an ascending level of assurance, are ``shared secrets'' methods (e.g., personal identification numbers or passwords), digitized signatures or biometric means of identification, such as fingerprints, retinal patterns and voice recognition, and cryptographic digital signatures, which provide the greatest assurance. Combinations of approaches (e.g., digital signatures with biometrics) are also possible and may provide even higher levels of assurance. 
   In developing this legislation, the conference committee recognized that certain technologies are more secure than others and that consumers and businesses should select the technology that is most appropriate for their particular needs, taking into account the importance of the transaction and its corresponding need for assurance. 
   Mr. President, the benefits of electronic commerce should not, and need not, come at the expense of increased risk to consumers. I am delighted that we have been able to come together in a bipartisan effort in which Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and House are joining in s-sign legislation that will encourage electronic commerce without sacrificing consumer protections. I want to commend Senator HOLLINGS, Senator SARBANES and Representative DINGELL, the ranking Democrats on the other Committees participating in the House-Senate Conference, for their leadership and steadfast efforts on behalf of our dual objectives. I thank Chairman BLILEY and Chairman MCCAIN for allowing the conference process to work and to result in a report that so many of us can support. I also want to praise Senator WYDEN for his dedication to this project and for never losing sight of the need to create a balanced bill. It has been a privilege to work with all of these distinguished Members on this landmark legislation. 
   I am profoundly grateful to the Administration for its work on this legislation. Andy Pincus, Sarah Rosen Wartell, Michael Beresik, Gary Gensler, and Gregory Baer, in particular, have devoted countless hours to ensuring that the conference report will create a reasonable and responsible framework for electronic commerce. 
   I would also like to thank the Senate and House staff who worked so hard to bring this matter to a reasonable conclusion. On my staff, Julie Katzman and Beryl Howell. In addition, Maureen McLaughlin, Moses Boyd, Carol Grunberg, Marty Gruenberg, Jonathan Miller, Kevin Kayes, Steve Harris, David Cavicke, Mike O'Rielly, Paul Scolese, Ramsen Betfarhad, James Derderian, Bruce Gwinn, Consuela Washington, and Jeff Duncan--all deserve credit for their role in crafting the consensus legislation that the Senate passes today. Thanks, too, to House Legislative Counsel Steve Cope, for his technical assistance and professionalism throughout this conference. 
   This conference report enjoys strong bipartisan and bicameral support. It passed the House of Representatives yesterday by an overwhelming majority. It has been well received by industry and consumer representatives alike, by the States as well as by the Administration. I urge its speedy passage into law.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Department of Defense authorization bill that we will resume on Monday contains a ``buried gem.'' This is an amendment that several Senators from both sides of the aisle have been working on for some time. In addition, many members in the other body also have been very supportive of this effort in general.  
   This ``buried gem'' is a provision that will allow military personnel and dependents stationed overseas to participate in a program very similar to the WIC--the Women, Infants and Children--nutrition program. The WIC program in this country has enjoyed full, bipartisan support for many years, and this new provision provides that our forces abroad will be entitled to benefit from a very similar program with eligibility calculated under very similar rules. 
   The chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, Senator LUGAR, and the ranking member, Senator HARKIN, along with the chairman of the nutrition subcommittee, Senator FITZGERALD, worked together with me and other members of the Committee on this WIC in the military issue. We received valuable input on this recent amendment from the DOD and the military liaison offices, as well as from the Department of Agriculture. We are grateful for that assistance. 
   I know that many of us worked together last year on this issue also. Last year, I introduced the bill, Strengthening Families in the Military Service Act of 1999 (S. 1162), which was designed to provide WIC benefits to military personnel and to certain civilian personnel, stationed overseas. 
   In my floor statement on May 26 of last year, I noted that ``if it makes sense to allow those stationed in the United States to participate in WIC, it makes sense to allow those stationed overseas to have the important nutritional benefits of that program. Why should families lose their benefits when they are moved overseas?'' 
   A former staff person, Janet Breslin, who worked for me as Deputy Chief of Staff of the Senate Agriculture Committee and now is stationed in Japan with her husband, sent me a note saying:  
   WIC can make all the difference to an at-risk baby or pregnant mother. There is a specific need here in Okinawa. Our young families make the long trip to Japan to represent their country. They are separated from family and friends back home. Because we have limited base housing, some are forced to live off-base for months or a year. During this time the family faces the high cost of living in Japan, especially high utility fees and food costs. For many, huge phone bills home put many families in a financial pinch. 
   If these at-risk families were in the United States, they would qualify for WIC, which would provide nutritious dairy and other food products for the family. However, due to a legal quirk, WIC is not available for Americans on overseas military bases. 
   This effort, by you and others, would help reduce the pressure on these young families, improve the health of mother and baby, and enhance the quality of life for Americans serving their country halfway around the world.  
   Janet perfectly summarized why we should provide WIC to our military personnel overseas. 
   My bill, and the amendment included in the DOD bill, provide that the Secretary of Defense will administer such a program under rules similar to the WIC program administered by the Secretary of Agriculture within the United States. 
   For 26 years the WIC program has provided nutritious foods to low-income pregnant, post-partum and breast-feeding women, infants, and children who are judged to be at a nutritional risk. 
   It has proven itself to be a great investment: For every dollar invested in the WIC program, an estimated $3 is saved in future medical expenses. WIC has helped to prevent low birth weight babies and associated risks such as developmental disabilities, birth defects, and other complications. Participation in the WIC program has also been linked to reductions in infant mortality. 
   These same benefits should be provided overseas to military families who are serving our country, living miles from their homes on military bases in foreign lands, and whose nutritional health is at risk. If they were stationed within our borders, their diets would be supplemented by the WIC program, and they would receive vouchers or packages of healthy foods, such as fortified cereals and juices, high protein products, and other foods especially rich in needed minerals and vitamins. 
   My staff has been in direct contact with military officials on this matter and they have expressed a strong desire for this reform. I know that many Vermonters stationed overseas want WIC benefits to be offered at their bases. We should not turn our backs on these Americans stationed abroad. 
   My bill last year, and this amendment, disregard the value of in-kind housing assistance in calculating eligibility which increases the number of women, infants and children that can participate and makes the program similar to the program in the United States. This is the correct approach--let's not shortchange our service personnel stationed overseas. 
   The average monthly food cost would be around $30 to $35 for each participant, based on Department of Defense estimates of the cost of an average WIC food package in military commissaries. As many as 40,000 to 50,000 persons could be eligible for this program, but it is uncertain how many of those would apply. In the United States, 80 percent of those who are eligible actually apply. 
   Administration costs--which include medical, health and nutrition assessments--are likely to be about $10 per month per participant. We know from experience that each dollar spent on WIC is a very wise investment, which is why I am very pleased that this amendment was accepted today. 
   I want to thank several Senate staff members who have worked on this issue, including Ed Barron and Elizabeth Darrow on my staff, Dave Johnson and Carol Dubard with Chairman LUGAR, Mark Halverson and Lowell Unger with Senator HARKIN, and Terry Van Doren with Senator FITZGERALD. Joe Richardson of CRS was also very helpful, as he has been over the years.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, a few months ago, I came to this floor to draw attention to a growing national crisis in the administration of capital punishment and to suggest some solutions. You will recall some of the shocking facts I described:  
   For every 7 people executed, 1 death row inmate is shown some time after conviction to be innocent of the crime. 
   Many of those exonerated have come within hours of being executed, and many have spent a decade or more in jail before they were given a fair opportunity to establish their innocence. 
   Capital defendants are frequently represented by lawyers who lack the funds or the competence to do the job, or who have been disbarred or suspended for misconduct, and, from time to time, by lawyers who sleep through the trial, but the courts turn a blind eye. 
   Inexpensive and practically foolproof means of proving innocence are often denied to defendants.  
   The saddest fact of all, to me, is that the society facing this crisis is not a medieval one; it is America, today, in the 21st Century. As the Governor of Illinois told us when he placed a moratorium on the death penalty in his State earlier this year, something urgently needs to be done to remedy this situation. That is why I have been talking with Senators on both sides of the aisle and all sides of the capital punishment debate. That is why I have been searching for ways to reduce the risk of mistaken executions. 
   That is why I am so pleased that today, with my good friend, the junior  Senator from Oregon (Senator GORDON SMITH), we are introducing the bipartisan Innocence Protection Act of 2000. This bill is a carefully crafted package of criminal justice reforms designed to protect the innocent and to ensure that if the death penalty is imposed, it is the result of informed and reasoned deliberation, not politics, luck, bias or guesswork. 
   Every American child is taught that justice is blind. It is important to remember what justice is supposed to be blind to. Justice should never be blind to the truth, it should never be blind to the evidence, and it should never be blind to the teachings of modern science. What justice should be blind to is ideology, politics, race and money. 
   Too often in this chamber, we find ourselves dividing along party or ideological lines. The bill that Senator SMITH and I are introducing today is not about that, and it is not about whether in the abstract, you favor or disfavor the death penalty. It is about what kind of society we want America to be in the 21st Century. 
   I am optimistic about America's future. I have become all the more optimistic in the past few months as I have seen an outpouring of support across the political spectrum and across the country for common-sense measures to reduce the risk of executing the innocent. 
   Today, Senator SMITH and I are joined by Senators from both sides of the aisle, by some who support capital punishment and by others who oppose it. On the Republican side, I want to thank my friend Senator SUSAN COLLINS of Maine and my fellow Vermonter, Senator JIM JEFFORDS. On the Democratic side, Senators LEVIN, FEINGOLD, MOYNIHAN, AKAKA, KERREY, and WELLSTONE. I also want to thank our House sponsors WILLIAM DELAHUNT and RAY LAHOOD, along with their 39 cosponsors, both Democratic and Republican. Here on Capitol Hill it is our job to represent Americans. The scores of legislators who have sponsored this legislation clearly do represent Americans, both in their diversity and in their readiness to work together for common-sense solutions. 
   The outpouring of bipartisan support we have seen in Congress reflects an emerging public consensus. Opinion polls show Americans divided on the death penalty in the abstract. But they show overwhelmingly that Americans will not tolerate the execution of innocent people, and that Americans expect their justice system to provide everyone with a fair trial and a competent lawyer. A recent Gallup Poll found that 92 percent of Americans believe that people convicted before modern advances in DNA technology should be given the opportunity to obtain DNA testing if such tests might show their innocence. 
   I am also encouraged by the growing chorus of calls for reform of our capital punishment system by criminal justice experts and respected opinion leaders nationwide. George Will wrote in a April 6th column that ``skepticism is in order'' when it comes to capital punishment. Another conservative columnist, Bruce Fein, wrote in The Washington Times on April 25th:  
   A decent respect for life ..... demands scrupulous concern for the reliability of verdicts in capital punishment trials. Otherwise, the death penalty game is not worth the gamble of executing the innocent--a shameful stain on any system of justice--and life sentences (perhaps in solitary confinement) should be the maximum.  
   Mr. Fein writes as one who served as a senior Justice Department official in the Reagan Administration. 
   More recently, on May 11th, the Constitution Project at Georgetown University Law Center established a blue-ribbon National Committee to Prevent Wrongful Executions, comprised of supporters and opponents of the death penalty, Democrats and Republicans, including six former State and Federal judges, a former U.S. Attorney, two former State Attorneys General, and a former Director of the FBI. According to its mission statement, this Committee is ``united in [its] profound concern that, in recent years, and around the country, procedural safeguards and other 
   assurances of fundamental fairness in the administration of capital punishment have been significantly diminished.'' Many of the concerns that the Committee has raised are addressed in the legislation that Senator SMITH and I are introducing today. 
   Just yesterday, the editors of The Washington Times noted that ``the increased use of DNA analysis has in fact revealed some serious flaws in the way the justice system exacts the supreme penalty,'' and succinctly expressed the common sense view of nine out of ten Americans and the basic point that underlies our legislation: ``Surely no one could reasonably object to making sure we execute only the guilty.''

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this report is a good example of how the Senate--when we sit down and work together--can craft sound legislation. 
   New England and Mid-Atlantic farmers who do not usually participate in crop insurance will greatly benefit from this effort. There is funding to help preserve farmland, protect the environment and to give farmers better tools to manage risk. 
   In addition, farmers who have suffered through two years of low prices will get some relief as USDA purchases $200 million worth of apples, cranberries, potatoes, melons, and the like. There will also be major purchases of specialty crops for the school lunch program--this will benefit farmers and school lunch programs. 
   In the beginning, there were a lot of strong differences of opinion on how to reform crop insurance and provide assistance to farmers. In fact, we had a 10-8 split in the Agriculture Committee on how to structure this reform. 
   But Republicans and Democrats worked together and got the job done. Sure, it's more work but that is why we are here. 
   I was very upset yesterday when I learned--after we ended our conference negotiations and worked out all the final deals, and after we terminated the conference and had signed the conference report--that the unfinished bankruptcy bill was going to be thrown into the crop insurance conference report. 
   That is an example of how the Senate should not operate. It would be hard to imagine a more serious breach of trust. 
   I was prepared to discuss the world history of crop insurance from 1860 through the year 2000, which could have put me to sleep while I was talking. In the end, it appears that cooler heads prevailed and decided they would rather pass crop insurance than listen to me speak. 
   I appreciate the role of Senators LUGAR and ROBERTS to get us back on track on crop insurance. 
   For my part, I will continue to work with Senators GRASSLEY, SESSIONS, DASCHLE, HATCH, TORRICELLI, and others on both sides of the aisle to craft a fair balanced and bipartisan bankruptcy bill. If we could do this for crop insurance, we can do it in bankruptcy--if there is the will to get it done. 
   While there are aspects of the crop insurance compromise that I do not like, there clearly was a significant attempt to design a package that benefits all areas of the nation and a wide range of commodities--including specialty crops. This is a very good bill. 
   I appreciate this national focus because a narrowly focused crop insurance bill would not have been helpful to New England and the Mid-Atlantic States. I was pleased to work with many of my colleagues from that region--both Democrats and Republicans--to formulate a package that would also benefit our regions. 
   I appreciate the leadership of Chairman LUGAR and his ranking member Senator HARKIN in working out a good compromise. Also, Senators ROBERTS and KERREY deserve a great deal of thanks for all their work on this issue. 
   I want to point out one general concern. 
   Because of the simultaneous work on Agriculture appropriations some provisions critical to New England and the Mid-Atlantic States, and to many other states, have been omitted from this package--because the plan is to include them in appropriations. 
   It is crucial to me--and Republicans and Democrats in both Houses--that dairy farmers not be left out of Agriculture appropriations bill since this report does not provide them with direct financial assistance. I am counting on some assurances I have received to keep the dairy funding in the appropriations bill. I will be working closely with my appropriations colleagues Senator COCHRAN and his ranking member, Senator KOHL, on this matter. 
   Also, I understand that the House appropriations bill includes $100 million for apple farmers who have been hard-hit by low yields or low quality after two years of unavoidable weather extremes, from floods to drought. Helping  these farmers is extremely important to New England, Mid-Atlantic States, Washington State, California, and other areas. 
   As I pointed out during the conference, farmland protection programs work very well to help preserve farmland as farmland. There is so much need for funding, that our modest program in Vermont could instantly use the full $10 million since there is such a need and desire for this program. 
   Indeed, I had a major role in getting section 388 included in the 1996 farm bill. Similarly, in the 1990 farm bill contained a related farmland preservation program which I drafted called ``Farms for the Future.'' 
   I was pleased that the conference would accept this latest farmland protection proposal found at section 211, the ``Conservation Assistance,'' provision. This provision will be of great help to the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board which has done a tremendous job helping preserve Vermont farms and the farming way of life 
   by buying development easements on farmland property. 
   I was proud to fight to include funding for such a great agency--the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board of Vermont. Providing funding to them as soon as possible will enable them to free up money which could be used to preserve additional farmland in Vermont. 
   I appreciate the willingness of the other Members to include this provision and am anxious to allow the Board to greatly enhance its service to farm families in Vermont. 
   Section 211(b) is also a very important provision for many regions of the country. It allows the Secretary through the CCC to provide financial assistance to farmers for a very wide range of activities such as addressing threats to soil, or water, or related natural resources. 
   In the alternative, it permits funds to be used to help farmers comply with environmental laws or to be used for ``beneficial, cost-effective changes'' to a variety of different efforts or uses needed to conserve or improve soil, or water, or related natural resources. 
   This gives the Secretary a broad range of land preservation and conservation alternatives for funding under that subsection. 
   There is language in this report for a temporary suspension of authority to combine USDA field offices. I am concerned that in small-population states, such as Vermont, cuts in federal staff have been so significant that the offices do not function effectively. During this temporary suspension the Secretary should also suspend staffing cuts. 
   These staff cuts, particularly in the Farm Services Agency, should be halted in very small states so we can figure out what minimal numbers we need to properly run these offices. Indeed, in a small state like Vermont it only makes sense to allow them to hire the staff they need such that USDA can, during the suspension, properly determine which offices should be closed. 
   I want to briefly mention a special crop provision, section 203, which provides $200 million to the Secretary to purchase specialty crops ``that have experienced low prices during the 1998 and 1999 crop years .....'' We expect the Secretary to very aggressively use this authority to purchase apples, cranberries, potatoes, and the other commodities listed. This provision is very important to New England, Mid-Atlantic states and to other areas. 
   I want to thank my colleagues on the crop insurance conference for all their efforts to craft a strong compromise report. I appreciate all the hard work of Chairman LUGAR and his great sense of fairness. As usual, his staff did an excellent job. Keith Luse, his chief of staff, helped carefully balance many competing interests. 
   His chief counsel, Dave Johnson, was extremely helpful and provided outstanding guidance throughout this complicated process. Andy Morton, the chief economist, and Michael Knipe, the lead counsel, provided sound analysis and helpful assistance. 
   Senators KERREY and ROBERTS played a very major role in this effort and I appreciate their contributions. Mike Seyfert of Senator ROBERTS' staff demonstrated great expertise on these complicated issues. Hunt Shipman, with Senator COCHRAN, and Scott Carlson, with Senator CONRAD, were very instrumental during this effort. 
   Bev Paul, with Senator KERREY, was creative and energetic throughout the staff negotiations and of great help in crafting the final compromises. While not a conferee, the Democratic leader, Senator DASCHLE, and his staff, Zabrae Valentine, were very helpful regarding this effort. 
   As always, the ranking member of the committee, Senator HARKIN, was a strong spokesman for farmers and ranchers. His staff, Mark Halverson and Stephanie Mercier, provided help to all of us. 
   The House staff also did a great job and I salute them. The chairman, Mr. COMBEST, as have past chairmen, was very ably represented by his Chief of Staff, Bill O'Conner. Jeff Harrison, the majority legal counsel, did a terrific job drafting and explaining very complex legal language. 
   It is always a pleasure to work with Congressman STENHOLM, the ranking member on the House Agriculture Committee. His staff, including Vernie Hubert, Chip Conley, and John Riley, displayed a thorough understanding of the issues and are a great resource for the Members. 
   My own staffer on these matters, Ed Barron, as usual did a tremendous job, put in endless hours and helped me work out a good package. Also, Melody Burkins, who joined my staff recently, did a terrific job. 
   I have praised the work of Gary Endicott, of Senate Legislative Counsel, many times and do so again today. David Grahn with the Office of General Counsel of USDA has once again greatly assisted the Congress in providing expert technical drafting advice. 
   Ken Ackerman, head of the Risk Management Agency, also provided expert technical advice to the Congress on this bill. 
   Let me bring your attention to another aspect of this report, the Plant Protection Act that has been incorporated into this legislation. This modernization of existing laws provides tools and resources for animal and plant health inspection services for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of USDA so that they can better do their job. 
   This legislation will not only help protect agricultural plants in the United States from pests and disease but will also assist APHIS in dealing with invasive species. The Plant Protection Board has indicated that passage of this Act is their number one recommendation for safeguarding American plants. I want to thank Under Secretary Mike Dunn for his leadership on this important matter. 
   Mr. GRAHAM, Mr. President, Members of the Senate. I come before you today to speak in support of the conference report of the Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 which we are voting on today. 
   First, I believe that this conference report is the beginning of a new era of cooperation between traditional row crop states and speciality crop states. During our development of this legislation, I have worked closely with my colleagues Senators MACK, LUGAR, KERREY, and ROBERTS to address the unique needs of speciality crop producers. This new cooperation speaks well of our ability in the next Congress to cooperatively review the impacts of the 1996 farm bill on American agriculture. I believe that, based on this cooperative effort, we will be successful in ensuring that all American agriculture, not just row crop producers or speciality crop producers, but all of agriculture reaps the benefits from those reforms. 
   Let me say a few words about agriculture in the state of Florida. The image that many of us hold of the state is one of white sand beaches, coral reefs alive with hundreds of tropical fish, or Disney World. While accurate, this image is not complete. 
   Florida has 40,000 commercial farmers. In 1997, Florida farmers utilized a little more than 10 million of the state's nearly 35 million acres to produce more than 25 billion pounds of food and more than 2 million tons of livestock feed. Florida ranks number nine nationally in the value of its farm products and number two in the value of its vegetable crops. 
   Florida agriculture is not only valuable, but diverse. We rank number two nationally in horticulture production with annual sales of over $1 billion. Florida grows 77 percent of U.S. grapefruits and 47 percent of world supply of  grapefruit. The state produces 75 percent of the nation's oranges and 20 percent worldwide. 
   In 1997, Florida's farmers led the nation in the production of 18 major agriculture commodities including: oranges and grapefruits, sugarcane, fresh tomatoes, bell peppers, sweet corn, ferns, fresh cucumbers, fresh snap beans, tangerines, tropical fish, temple oranges, fresh squash, radishes, gladioli, tangelos, eggplant, and houseplants. 
   Florida livestock and product sales were $1.1 billion in 1997. We are the largest milk-producing state in the southeast. We rank 14th nationally in the production of eggs. Florida's horse industry has produced 39 national thoroughbred champions and 47 equine millionaires. Florida also has active peanut, cotton, potato, rice, sweet corn, and soybean industries. 
   As these facts demonstrate, agriculture in Florida means many things to many people. However, all Floridians recognize that agriculture is a critical part of our economy. Each year, Florida agriculture ranges from the second to the third largest industry in the state on an income basis. It is this diverse industry that the Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 will assist. 
   On July 20, 1999, I joined my colleagues Senators MACK, FEINSTEIN, and BOXER in introducing S. 1401, the Specialty Crop Insurance Act of 1999. This legislation sought to reduce the dependence of the specialty crop industry an emergency spending and catastrophic loss insurance coverage by improving its access to quality crop insurance policies. 
   Currently, crop insurance policies available for specialty crops do not cover the unique characteristics associated with the planting, growing, and harvesting of specialty crops. According to a GAO report on USDA's progress in expanding crop insurance coverage for specialty crops, even after an expansion in policies available to specialty corps planned through 2001, the existing crop insurance program will fail to cover approximately 300 specialty crops that make up 15 percent of the market share. In some cases, although crop insurance may exist for a specialty crop, it may not be available in all areas where the crop is grown. For example, the GAO report indicates that crop insurance for grapes is available in selected counties in Arkansas, California, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Washington but not in other growing areas located in Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. 
   In an effort to increase producer participation in buy-up coverage, the Risk Management Agency last year undertook a pilot program to increase the premium subsidies at a total cost of $400 million. In 1999, the Congress enacted this same program which was deemed a success on an emergency basis. 
   This program was not a success for specialty crops. Of the 125,772 producers who bought additional buy-up coverage after this subsidy was offered, 81 percent were producers of program crops. The highest increase in a single commodity was 31,191 additional policies sold to corn producers while the lowest increase was an additional 3 policies sold to pepper producers. Even when corrective action is taken to work on increasing buy-up coverage for all crops, the program that is designed does not have a dramatic effect on specialty crop participation. We need a different approach for this unique sector of U.S. agriculture. 
   The original legislation that I introduced sought to promote the development and use of affordable crop insurance policies designed to meet the specific needs of producers of specialty crops. The Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 will increase specialty crop producer participation in the Federal Crop Insurance Program, encourage higher levels of coverage than provided by catastrophic insurance, and enable better planning and marketing decisions to be made. 
   I am pleased to say, Mr. President, that the crop insurance conference report we are considering today enacts the major provisions of my original bill. With the key support of Senators KERREY and ROBERTS, who have focused their attention on the needs of speciality crop producers, we have forged a bi-partisan piece of legislation that addresses the needs of multiple regions of the country. 
   In addressing speciality crops, the Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 takes the following actions: 
   First, to ensure that the Risk Management Agency utilizes private sector expertise in developing new crop insurance policies, it requires that portions of research and development funds in this bill and research and development funds for new crop insurance policies appropriated to RMA each year be focused on specialty crop product development. The legislation specifically authorizes $20-25 million per year for RMA to enter into public and private partnerships to develop specialty crop insurance policies. 
   Second, it also establishes a process to review new product development and ensure that crop insurance products are available to all agricultural commodities, including specialty crops. 
   Third, the Agriculture Protection Act of 2000 expands the authorization for the Risk Management Agency to conduct pilot programs to increase its flexibility in developing better products for specialty crop producers. Today, we are voting on legislation that will allow pilots to be conducted on a state, regional, and national basis for a period of four years or longer if desired by RMA. This legislation also specifies authority for the Risk Management Agency to conduct a pilot program for timber, a provision I originally introduced on April 22 of 1999 in S. 868, the Forestry Initiative to Restore the Environment. 
   Fourth, to encourage specialty crop producers to buy up to 50/100 coverage once these new policies are developed, the report before us today increases the rate for 50/100 coverage, the initial buy-up level after catastrophic coverage to 67 percent. This will create an incentive for growers to purchase buy-up coverage and bring us closer to meeting our goal of reducing dependence on the CAT program. 
   Fifth, to ensure that aid for farmers who have no crop insurance policies available to them actually receive aid in times of natural disasters, this report modifies the Non-insured Assistance Program (NAP) to eliminate the area trigger, making any grower whose crop is uninsurable and experiences a federally-declared disaster, eligible for these funds. 
   I will not enumerate each of the provisions of this legislation, as almost each page contains a specific remedy for problems faced by specialty crop producers. I commend my colleagues for their efforts to ensure that crop insurance reform passed by the 106th Congress will take into account the needs of all agriculture producers. In particular, I thank Senators MACK, KERREY, and ROBERTS for joining me in my efforts to ensure that the needs of production agriculture in Florida are met. 
   I believe that the provisions in the Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 will ensure that specialty crop producers have access to high quality insurance products designed to meet their needs. 
   Turning away from crop insurance for a moment, I would like to mention a few key times in this package that are just as critical for specialty crop producers. 
   First, this legislation includes $25 million for compensation to growers who have experienced 
   losses due to plum pox virus, Pierce's disease, and citrus canker. To date, citrus canker has spread to over 1600 acres of commercial citrus groves in Florida and is threatening the existence of the industry. The entire lime industry is on the verge of being eliminated. Already, over half of the 3000 acres in lime production have been destroyed or marked for destruction. Once an infected tree is discovered, federal regulation, designed to eradicate this disease, requires the destruction of all trees, healthy or diseased, within a 1,900-foot radius. Literally thousands of citrus trees, which require three to four years to reach maturity, have been burned to the ground during this year's growing season. These funds are a critical first step in the ability of our grower to recover from the devastation that this disease has caused in Florida. 
   Second, this legislation includes a streamlined version of the Plant Protection Act. In 1988, I commissioned a study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Animal and Plant  Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to evaluate the viability of our nation's system of safeguarding America's plant resources from invasive plant pests. In today's global marketplace where international travel is commonplace, the importance of APHIS' role in ensuring that invasive pests and plants do not enter our borders in paramount. The passage of the Plant Protection Act was the number one recommendation of this report which included almost 300 individual recommended actions. Today, we are taking our first step toward a serious commitment to protecting American agriculture from the ravages of diseases like citrus canker or the Mediterranean fruit fly. 
   Third, conference report includes over $70 million for key infrastructure improvements to the fruit and vegetable inspection system that was recently embroiled in controversy when eighty USDA inspectors were arrested for taking bribes to reduce the value of produce and allow receivers to negotiate lower prices with shippers. These funds will restore the integrity of this system. 
   Again, I commend my colleagues for their fine work and perseverance in bringing this conference report to completion and before the Senate for a final vote. Today's action will enact long-term change in our crop insurance program that will provide specialty crop producers with access to affordable crop insurance policies which are designed to meet their specific needs.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a pressing criminal justice problem. The problem stems from a provision slipped into the omnibus appropriations law during the last Congress, without the benefit of any hearings or debate by the Senate. Although some of us from both sides of the aisle objected to the provision at the time, our objections were ignored and the provision became law. It is having devastating effects on federal criminal prosecutions and, as I describe in some detail below, it is no exaggeration to say that this provision is costing lives. 
   In the last Congress, the omnibus appropriations measure for FY 1999 included a provision originally sponsored by former Representative Joseph McDade that was opposed by most members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, both Democrats and Republicans. Indeed, we sent a joint letter to the leadership of the Appropriations Committee urging that this provision be removed from any conference report because, in our view, the McDade law ``would seriously impair the effectiveness of federal prosecutors in their efforts to enforce federal criminal laws and protect our communities.'' 
   Nevertheless, the McDade provision was enacted as part of that appropriations measure and went into effect on April 19, 1999. This law, now codified at 28 U.S.C. &#167;530B, subjects federal prosecutors to the state bar rules, and discipline, of ``each State where such attorney engages in that attorney's duties.'' There has been enormous tension over what ethical standards apply to federal prosecutors and who has the authority to set those standards. 
   This debate over the ethical rules that apply to federal prosecutors was resolved with the McDade law at a time of heightened public concern over the high-profile investigations and prosecutions conducted by independent counsels. Special prosecutors Kenneth Starr and Donald Smaltz were the ``Poster boys'' for unaccountable federal prosecutors. By law, those special prosecutors were subject to the ethical guidelines and policies of the Department of Justice. They defended their controversial tactics by claiming to have conducted their investigations and prosecutions in conformity with Departmental policies. 
   The actions of these special prosecutors provided all the necessary fodder to fuel passage of the McDade law. For example, one of the core complaints the Department had against the McDade law is that federal prosecutors would be subject to restrictive state ethics rules regarding contacts with represented persons. A letter to the Washington Post from the former Chairman of the ABA ethics committee pointed out:  
   [Anti-contact rules are] designed to protect individuals like Monica Lewinsky, who have hired counsel and are entitled to have all contacts with law enforcement officials go through their counsel. As Ms. Lewinsky learned, dealing directly with law enforcement officials can be intimidating and scary, despite the fact that those inquisitors later claimed it was okay for her to leave at any time.  
   I have outlined before my concerns about the tactics of these special prosecutors, such as requiring a mother to testify about her daughter's intimate relationships, requiring a bookstore to disclose all the books a person may have purchased, and breaching the longstanding understanding of the relationship of trust between the Secret Service and those it protects. I was appalled to hear a federal prosecutor excuse a flimsy prosecution by announcing after the defendant's acquittal that just getting the indictment was a great deterrent. Trophy watches and television talk show puffery should not be the trappings of prosecutors. 
   Yet, I opposed the McDade law and continue to believe that this law is not the answer. I firmly support improvements in the disciplinary process for federal prosecutors but this important task may be accomplished without hindering legitimate law enforcement investigative techniques and practices--which is what the McDade law is doing. While subjecting federal attorneys to state bar rules sounds like good policy at first blush, the McDade law has ceded to the vagaries of fifty state bar associations control of how federal prosecutions are to be conducted. I am concerned that Federal prosecutors are being hamstrung because the McDade law makes them answerable to multiple masters. 
   The Department of Justice has been surprisingly quiet, both before and after the McDade law went into effect, about seeking a legislative modification to address the most devastating consequences of this new law for federal law enforcement. Unfortunately, we are fast approaching the end of this Congress without making any progress on addressing the problems created by the McDade law. 
   I have asked the Department of Justice for an update on how the McDade law is working, and whether any of my fears were warranted. The results are in: This law has resulted in significant delays in important criminal prosecutions, chilled the use of federally-authorized investigative techniques and posed multiple hurdles for federal prosecutors. 
   The Justice Department's November, 1999, response to my prior questions on this issue stated that the McDade law ``has caused tremendous uncertainty,'' ``delayed investigations,'' ``creat[ed] a rift between agents and prosecutors,'' ``prevented attorneys and agents from taking legitimate, traditionally accepted investigative steps, to the detriment of pending cases,'' and served as the basis of litigation ``to interfere with legitimate federal prosecutions.'' Yet, these generalities do not fully demonstrate the significant adverse impact this law is continuing to have to slow down or bring to a standstill federal investigations of serious criminal wrongdoing. Let me describe some recent examples.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this bill accomplishes the important goal of eliminating the existing section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act, IIRIRA. I am an original cosponsor of the Senate version of this bill, the Immigration and Naturalization Service Data Management Improvement Act of 2000. 
   Section 110 would mandate that the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) establish an automated system to record the entry and exit of all aliens. If implemented, such a provision would have terrible consequences for States all across our Northern Border. Its repeal will help protect America's economy and reinforce our excellent relationship with Canada. 
   To implement and maintain an automated system for monitoring the entry and exit of ``all aliens,'' INS and Customs agents would have to stop each vehicle or individual entering or exiting the United States at all ports of entry. Canadians, U.S. permanent residents, and many others who are not currently required to show documentation of their status would likely either have to carry some form of identification or fill out paperwork at the points of entry. 
   This sort of tracking system would be extraordinarily costly to implement along the Northern Border, especially since there is no current system or infrastructure to track the departure of citizens and others leaving the United States. 
   Section 110 would also lead to excessive and costly traffic delays for those living and working near the border. These delays would surely have a negative impact on the $2.4 billion in goods and services shipped annually from Vermont to Canada and would likely reduce the $120 million per year that Canadians spend in Vermont. 
   This legislation would replace the existing section 110 with a new provision that requires the Attorney General to implement an ``integrated entry and exit data system.'' This system would simply integrate the arrival and departure data which already is authorized or required to be collected under current law, and which is in electronic format within databases held by the Justice and State Departments. The INS would not be required to take new steps to collect information from those entering and leaving the country, meaning that Canadians will have the same ability to enter the United States as they do today. 
   This bill will ensure that tourists continue to freely cross the border, without additional documentation requirements. This bill will also guarantee that more than $1 billion in daily cross-border trade is not hindered in any way. Just as importantly, Vermonters and others who cross our nation's land borders on a daily basis to work or visit with family or friends should be able to continue doing so without additional border delays. 
   The interconnection between Canada and the United States may be demonstrated most clearly by a store in Derby Line, Vermont. Actually, only part of the store is located in Derby Line--the other side of it is in Rock Island, Quebec. The U.S.-Canadian border runs down the middle of the store, and a white stripe is painted there to mark it. Would the integrated entry and exit data system called for under section 110 have had to monitor the clerks who move from one side of the store to the other collecting goods? This is just one of many examples that would make the implementation of section 110 a destructive folly for Vermont, and I am sure that Senators from other States along the Northern Border can tell similar stories about their States. 
   This is an issue that I have worked on ever since section 110 was originally adopted in 1996. In 1997, along with Senator ABRAHAM and others, I introduced the Border Improvement and Immigration Act of 1997. Among other things, that legislation would have (1) specifically exempted Canadians from any new documentation or paperwork requirements when crossing the border into the United States; (2) required the Attorney General to discuss the development of ``reciprocal agreements'' with the Secretary of State and the governments of contiguous countries to collect the data on visa overstayers; and (3) required the Attorney General to increase the number of INS inspectors by 300 per year and the number of Customs inspectors by 150 per year for the next three years, with at least half of those inspectors being assigned to the Northern Border. 
   I also worked with Senator KENNEDY, Senator ABRAHAM, and other Senators to obtain postponements in the implementation date for the automated system mandated by section 110. We were successful in those attempts, delaying implementation until March 30, 2001. But delays are by nature only a temporary solution; in the legislation we vote on today, I believe we have found a permanent solution that allows us to keep track of the flow of foreign nationals entering and leaving the United States without crippling commerce or our important relationship with Canada. That is why I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, and why I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it today. 
   The Immigration mistakes of 1996: I fought against the adoption of section  110 in 1996, when this Congress passed the IIRIRA. It was wrong at the time, it is wrong today, and I am relieved that we are prepared to do away with it. But our job of rectifying the wrongs of our 1996 immigration legislation is far from over; indeed, it has hardly begun. I would like to use this occasion to draw my colleagues' attention to what I believe our next priorities should be in the immigration area. 
   Expedited removal: First, in the 1996 Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), a bill ostensibly about terrorism, Congress instituted an immigration measure called expedited removal. Under expedited removal, low-level INS officers with cursory supervision have the authority to summarily remove people who arrive at our border without proper documentation, or with facially valid documentation that the officer simply suspects is invalid. No review--administrative or judicial--is available of the INS officer's decision, which is rendered after a so-called secondary inspection interview. Expedited removal was widely 
   critized at the time as ignoring the realities of political persecution, since people being tortured by their government are quite likely to have difficulties obtaining valid travel documents from that government. Its adoption was viewed by many--including a majority of this body--as an abandonment of our historical commitment to refugees and a misplaced reaction to our legitimate fears of terrorism. 
   When we debated the IIRIRA later the same year, I offered an amendment with Senator DEWINE to restrict the use of expedited removal to times of immigration emergencies, which would be certified by the Attorney General. This more limited authority was all that the Administration had requested in the first place, and it was far more in line with our international and historical commitments. This amendment passed the Senate with bipartisan support, but it was removed in one of the most partisan conference committees I have ever witnessed. As a result, the extreme version of expedited removal contained in AEDPA became law, and was implemented in 1997. Ever since, I have attempted to raise consciousness about the problems with expedited removal. 
   Last year, I introduced the Refugee Protection Act (S. 1940) with Senator BROWNBACK and five other Senators of both parties. The bill is modeled closely on the 1996 amendment that passed the Senate, and I was optimistic that it too would be supported by a broad coalition of Senators. It allows expedited removal only in times of immigration emergencies, and it provides due process rights and elemental fairness for those arriving at our borders without sacrificing security concerns. But even as the Refugee Protection Act has gained additional cosponsors, it has been ignored by the Senate leadership. Indeed, the bill has not even received a hearing in the Judiciary Committee, despite my request. 
   Meanwhile, in the little more than three years that expedited removal has been in operation, we already have numerous stories of valid asylum seekers who were forced to leave our country without the opportunity to convince an immigration judge that they faced persecution in their native lands. To provide just one example, ``Dem,'' a Kosovar Albanian, was summarily removed from the U.S. after the civil war in Kosovo had already made the front pages of America's newspapers. During his interview with the INS inspector who had unreviewable discretion over his fate, he was provided with a Serbian translator who did not speak Albanian, rendering the interview a farce. Instead of being embraced as a political refugee, he was put on the next plane back to where his flight had originated. We only know about his story at all because he was dogged enough to make it back to the United States. On this second trip, he was found to have a credible fear of persecution and he is currently in the midst of the asylum process. 
   Perhaps the most distressing part of expedited removal is that there is no way for us to know how many deserving refugees have been excluded. Because secondary inspection interviews are conducted in secret, we typically only learn about mistakes when refugees manage to make it back to the United States a second time, like Dem, or when they are deported to a third 
   country they passed through on their way to the United States. This uncertainty should lead us to be especially wary of continuing this failed experiment. 
   Unjust deportation: Another injustice in the 1996 legislation that we must address is its drastically expanded definition of what makes a legal resident deportable. First, the IIRIRA defined the term ``aggravated felony'' in such a way as to make numerous misdemeanors deportable offenses. Then it applied this new standard retroactively, so that people who had committed crimes in the past that were so minor they did not even serve jail time were now subject to automatic deportation--including people who pleaded guilty to those crimes without any reason to believe there would be immigration consequences for that plea. The effects of this change have been unfair to numerous men and women, and their families, who have worked hard for years to turn their lives around, and have paid taxes, contributed their labor to the American economy, and raised children who are American citizens. I applaud the efforts of those in the House who are working to do away with retroactivity altogether. 
   I have chosen to take a narrower approach to this issue, focusing on the effect that this punitive policy has had on decorated war veterans who are being deported without any administrative or judicial consideration of the equities. I have introduced the Fairness to Immigrant Veterans Act, S. 871, which would ensure that veterans of our Armed Forces who have committed ``aggravated felonies'' have the opportunity to go before an immigration judge and plead their case to stay in the United States. It would also give veterans the right to federal court review of the immigration judges' decisions, and allow them to be released from detention while their claim is pending. If this bill becomes law, we will still be able to deport people who have committed serious crimes and present a danger to the community, regardless of their service record. But we will give veterans every opportunity to show that they and their families deserve a second chance, a chance they have earned through the sacrifices they made for our country. 
   Veterans groups have been very supportive of this legislation, with the American Legion, AMVETS, Vietnam Veterans of America, and the Blinded American Veterans all endorsing the bill. Despite these endorsements and my efforts to promote this legislation, however, the majority has failed even to hold a hearing on this bill. 
   Restoring basic benefits: Unfortunately, the IIRIRA and the AEDPA were not the only 1996 laws that distorted our immigration policy and harmed immigrants. The welfare reform law, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, added to that year's anti-immigration chorus, unreasonably restricting the eligibility of legal immigrants for social safety net provisions. It barred many legal immigrants from receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), food stamps, and Medicaid coverage, even as Congress sought to ensure that Medicaid be preserved for those who were leaving welfare. It has prevented the children of legal immigrants from eligibility under the new Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Under this statute, if legal immigrants (or their children) become sick, or lose their job, they are simply out of luck. These punitive restrictions were aimed not at illegal immigrants--who 
   already were ineligible for most benefits--but at legal immigrants, people who were invited to come here and work, people who paid taxes and contributed to our society in myriad ways. 
   Senators MOYNIHAN and GRAHAM have introduced S. 792, the Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act, to rectify this injustice, and I am a proud cosponsor of their bill. Among other things, the bill would: 
   Permit States to cover all eligible legal immigrant pregnant women and children under Medicaid immediately; 
   Permit states to cover all legal immigrant children under CHIP; 
   Restore SSI eligibility for legal immigrants who arrived here before August 1996 and who are elderly and poor but not disabled by SSI standards;  
   Restore SSI eligibility for legal immigrants who arrived here after August 1996 and become disabled after entering the country; and 
   Restore food stamp eligibility for all pre-August 1996 legal immigrants. 
   This is a vital bill, but the majority has declined even to hold a hearing on it since it was introduced in April 1999. It is difficult to tell whether this inaction results from indifference to the plight of these legal immigrants, or from a belief on the majority's part that immigrants come here to take advantage of the social safety net that our country offers. If it is the latter, I would recommend to my colleagues to remarks made by former Housing and Urban Development Secretary and Republican Vice-Presidential candidate Jack Kemp at a recent press conference designed to highlight the need for Congress to take action on a variety of immigration legislation. Mr. Kemp said that immigrants do not come to the United States because of its welfare system--they come here because they want to make a better life for themselves through hard work. I would add, and I'm sure that Jack Kemp would agree, that they often come here to experience political freedom they cannot obtain in their own countries. 
   Detention: The IIRIRA made the detention of asylum seekers who arrive without proper documents mandatory until they establish a credible fear of persecution. It allowed the INS no discretion, even where asylum applicants had relatives willing to take them in and spare the government the cost of detaining them, or even where the asylum applicants were children. It took this step even though the INS had already issued regulations that prevented asylum applicants from working while their applications were pending--a step that had drastically reduced the filing of frivolous applications. 
   This detention mandate has created serious strains for the INS and has led to often inhumane conditions for people who are fleeing persecution. For example, in October 1998, the Miami Herald reported that the INS--under the pressures created by the 1996 law--had 
   Warehoused some of its detainees to a local jail in the Florida Panhandle. The jailers there constructed an ``electric blanket'' that it ``placed over detainees, who [were] then subjected to intense electric shocks.'' These asylum seekers were forced to remain under the blanket ``for hours, worried about repeated shocks, and when refused bathroom privileges, they often soiled themselves. ..... They [also] endured broken bones, racial slurs, and attacks with Mace and pepper spray.'' 
   The Refugee Protection Act, which I talked about earlier, also addresses the detention issue. It clarifies that the Attorney General is not obligated to detain asylum seekers while their claims are being procesed--the bill preserves the Attorney General's ability to do so, but does not encourage detention. Asylum seekers are not criminals and they do not deserve to be imprisoned or detained without cause. Detention may be appropriate in rare cases, but it should be used sparingly. Detention is also extraordinarily costly for the taxpayers; indeed, the Department of Justice has projected that by the year 2001 it will need bed space for 24,000 INS detainees. The current policy is a humanitarian and fiscal failure, and we must reform it. 
   Conclusion: Although I am proud of the legislation we pass today, we have equally necessary and more challenging tasks ahead of us if we truly want to address the damage done by the laws passed in 1996. I urge my colleagues to focus on these issues and to work during the time we have remaining in this Congress to create sensible immigration laws. Let us not leave it to another Congress to fix the mistakes the majority made 4 years ago.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday some Republicans opposed Tim Dyk's confirmation to the Federal Circuit based on the workload of that court. Last evening I inserted in the RECORD a letter from the Chamber of Commerce that argued for his nomination in terms of the court's important workload and cases. 
   I am troubled that at a time when we are working through the night to try to preserve a digital signature bill to help encourage electronic commerce and protect consumers, when we are trying to work through Republican holds on the H1-B visa bill and increase the availability of high tech workers and improve training of American workers, when we are trying to improve on-line privacy and Internet security, I see such insensitivity to the needs of the Federal Circuit and its role in our economy and in our judicial system. 
   We designed the Federal Circuit to be our patent court. It has extraordinarily complex cases that are of increasing importance as our economy becomes more and more based on technological developments. Prompt and proper adjudication of cases before that court are in many ways critical to the continued growth of our economy and our economic future. 
   I see vacancies on that court as high priorities. I know that the other Democratic Senators share my view. I have been greatly troubled by the perpetuation of this vacancy on the Federal Circuit for more than two years while the Dyk nomination has been held back from Senate action. That is wrong. It is unfair to Tim Dyk and 
   his family. It is short-sighted with respect to the important matters on the docket of the Federal Circuit. 
   That was the point of the Chamber of Commerce letter last August. Filling the vacancy on the Federal Circuit should be a priority of the Senate. The Federal Circuit should have all the resources it needs to do its job and resolve intellectual property disputes intelligently, fairly, and expeditiously. 
   Nonetheless, in spite of all these considerations and what I had hoped was a bipartisan commitment to the growth of our high tech economy, some are arguing that because its caseload numbers are not inflated by prisoner petition, criminal cases or scores of simple civil cases our nation's patent court ought not to have its needs fulfilled. I disagree. 
   Moreover, I have to wonder whether we would even be hearing that argument if a Republican President were  making this nomination. I thank the Chamber of Commerce for showing that business supports the confirmation of Tim Dyk to fill this vacancy on the Federal Circuit and for not playing politics with this nomination. The nature of the Federal Circuit's caseload merits a full complement of judges as authorized by Congress so that its intellectual property docket can get the attention that it deserves and that our economy requires.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of our most important constitutional responsibilities is to provide advice and consent on the scores of judicial nominations sent to us to fill the vacancies on the federal courts around the country. Today we made some progress. We confirmed 16 new judges. For that I thank the Democratic leader and the majority leader, my counterpart on the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, and all those who worked with us to achieve Senate action on these judicial nominees. 
   The Senate has finally begun to consider the judges needed to serve the American people in our federal courts. But before any Senator thinks that our work is done for the year, let us take stock: We are only one-third of the way to the number of judges nominated by a Republican President and confirmed by a Democratic majority in 1992, and only half way to the levels of confirmations achieved in 1984 and 1988. Today we finally passed the level of 17 confirmations achieved in 1996, the year before I became the Ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. That low water mark is no measure of success, however. 
   Today we face more judicial vacancies than when the Senate adjourned in 1994. That means there are more vacancies across the country than when the Republican majority took controlling responsibility for the Senate in January 1995. Over the last six years we have gained no ground in our efforts to fill longstanding judicial vacancies that are plaguing the federal courts. 
   In addition, recall that this is the first action that the Senate has taken on judicial nominees since March 9, when the Senate ended 4-years of delay and finally voted to confirm Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit. For more than two months, for more than 10 weeks, the Senate has not acted to confirm a single judge, not one. That stall accounts for the backlog in judicial nominations that results in there being 16 judicial nominations on the Senate calendar today. On the other hand, since March 9, seven additional vacancies have arisen and the Senate has received 17 additional nominations. 
   There remain 36 judicial nominations pending in the Judiciary Committee, plus new nominations that the President is sending us every week. I have challenged the Senate to regain the pace it met in 1998 when the Committee held 13 hearing and the Senate confirmed 65 judges. That would still be one less than the number of judges confirmed by a Democratic Senate majority in the last year of the Bush Administration in 1992. Indeed, in the last two years of the Bush Administration, a Democratic Senate majority confirmed 124 judges. It would take an additional 67 confirmations this year for this Senate to equal that total. 
   Over the last five years the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed the following: 58 federal judges in the 1995 session; 17 in 1996; 36 in 1997; 65 in 1998; and 34 in 1999. By contrast, in one year, 1994, with a Democratic majority in the Senate, we confirmed 101 judges. With commitment and hard work many things are achievable. 
   Of the confirmations achieved this year, seven were nominations that were reported last year and should have been confirmed last year. That would have made last year's total slightly more respectable. Instead, they were held over and inflate this year's numbers. In addition, Tim Dyk, one of the nominees finally being considered today, was nominated in 1998 and has been held over two years. 
   Moreover, the Republican Congress has refused to consider the authorization of the additional judges needed by the federal judiciary to deal with their ever increasing workload. In 1984, and again in 1990, Congress responded to requests by the Chief Justice and the Judiciary Conference for needed judicial resources. Indeed, in 1990, a Democratic majority in the Congress created scores of needed new judgeships during a Republican Administration. 
   Three years ago the Judicial Conference of the United States requested that an additional 53 judgeships be authorized around the country. Last year the Judicial Conference renewed its request but increased it to 72 judgeships needing to be authorized around the country. Instead, the only federal judgeships created since 1990 were the nine District Court judgeships authorized in the omnibus appropriations bill at the end of last year. 
   If Congress had timely considered and passed the Federal Judgeship Act of 1999, S.1145, as it should have, the federal judiciary would have nearly 130 vacancies today. That is the more accurate measure of the needs of the federal judiciary that have been ignored by the Congress over the past several years and places the vacancy rate for the federal judiciary at 14 percent (128 out of 915). As it is, the vacancy rate is almost 10 percent (65 out of 852) and has remained too high throughout the five years that the Republican majority has controlled the Senate. 
   Especially troubling is the vacancy rate on the courts of appeals, which continues at over 11 percent (20 out of 179) without the creation of any of the additional judgeships that those courts need to handle their increased workloads. 
   Most troubling is the circuit emergency that had to be declared more than seven months ago by the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. I recall when the Second Circuit had such an emergency two years ago. Along with the other Senators representing States from the Circuit, I worked hard to fill the five vacancies then plaguing my circuit. The situation in the Fifth Circuit is not one that we should tolerate; it is a situation that I wished we had confronted by expediting consideration of the nominations of Alston Johnson and Enrique Moreno last year. I still hope that the Senate will consider both this year. 
   I deeply regret that the Senate adjourned last November and left the Fifth Circuit to deal with the crisis in the federal administration of justice in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi without the resources that it desperately needs. I look forward to our resolving this difficult situation. I will work with the Majority Leader and the Democratic Leader to resolve that emergency at the earliest possible time. 
   With 20 vacancies on the Federal appellate courts across the country and nearly half of the total judicial emergency vacancies in the Federal courts system in our appellate courts, our courts of appeals are being denied the resources that they need, and their ability to administer justice for the American people is being hurt. There continue to be multiple vacancies on the Ninth Circuit. Three vacancies is too many and perpetuating these four judicial emergency vacancies, as the Senate has in this one circuit, is irresponsible. We should act on these nominations promptly and provide the Ninth Circuit with the judicial resources it needs and to which it is entitled. 
   I am likewise concerned that the Fourth, Sixth and District of Columbia Circuits are suffering from multiple vacancies. 
   I continue to urge the Senate to meet our responsibilities to all nominees, including women and minorities, and look forward to action on the nominations of Judge James Wynn, Jr. to the Fourth Circuit, Enrique Moreno to the Fifth Circuit, Kathleen McCree Lewis to the Sixth Circuit and Judge Johnnie Rawlinson to the Ninth Circuit. Working together the Senate can join with the President to confirm well-qualified, diverse and fair-minded judges to fulfill the needs of the federal courts around the country. 
   Having begun so slowly in the first five months of this year, we have much more to do before the Senate takes its final action on judicial nominees this year. We should be considering 20 to 40 more judges this year. Having begun so slowly, we cannot afford to follow the ``Thurmond rule'' and stop acting on these nominees at the end of the summer in anticipation of the presidential election. We must use all the time until adjournment to remedy the vacancies that have been perpetuated on  the courts to the detriment of the American people and the administration of justice. I urge all Senators to make the federal administration of justice a top priority for the Senate for the rest of this year.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while the Senator from Arizona is still on the floor, I was going to say at the beginning of my remarks, the Vermont press showed very clearly how well respected the Senator from Arizona is in Vermont and how well received he was. He was one of the biggest vote getters our State has ever had. He did an extremely good job. He won his party's primary overwhelmingly. In Vermont his victory was declared within, I think, 5 minutes after the polls closed on primary day because the number was so overwhelming. 
   I say this because, while I was not at the convention where he spoke, as he can imagine--it was the Republican State convention--many of my dear friends and supporters were there. They told me also how much they respected what the Senator from Arizona said, as they had when he had been in Burlington earlier in his campaign and spoke to an overflow crowd. Montpelier is where I was born, so I always watch what happens there. I say to my friend from Arizona, the calls and e-mails I got after his appearance about him were all positive.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is finally going to vote this week on the confirmation of Timothy Dyk. 
   A vote on this nominee has been a long time coming. He was first nominated to a vacancy on the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in April of 1998--over 2 years ago--by some reckonings, in the last century. He had a hearing. He was reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee of the Senate in September of 1998. His nomination was left on the Senate calendar that year without any action and eventually was returned to the President, 2 years ago as the 105th Congress adjourned. 
   Then Mr. Dyk was renominated in January of 1999. He was favorably reported to the Senate floor, again, in October of 1999. For the last 7 months, this nomination has been waiting on the Executive Calendar for Senate action. 
   Let me just tell you a little bit about Timothy Dyk. He has distinguished himself with a long career of private practice in the District of Columbia. From 1964 to 1999, he worked with Wilmer, Cutler, and Pickering as an associate and then as a partner. Since 1990 he has been with Jones, Day, Reavis, and Pogue as a partner. He has been the chair of its issues and appeals section. 
   He received his undergraduate degree in 1958 from Harvard College; his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1961. Following law school, he clerked for three U.S. Supreme Court Justices: Justices Reed and Burton, and Chief Justice Warren. He was also a special assistant to the Assistant Attorney General in the Tax Division. 
   His is a distinguished career. He represented a wide array of clients, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Association of Broadcasters, the National Trucking Association, and he has the support of a wide variety of these organizations. We have received strong letters of support for him. Here are some of those who sent in letters saying let's get this man confirmed:

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted to support the confirmation of Jerry Lynch to the District Court for the Southern District of New York. Professor Lynch is the Paul J. Kellner Professor of Law at Columbia Law School, the outstanding law school from which he received his law degree in 1975. He began his legal career by clerking on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals for Judge Feinberg and then on the United States Supreme Court for Justice Brennan. 
   He served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York back in the early 1980's and as the Chief Appellate Attorney for that office. In 1990 he returned to the office at the request of President Bush's U.S. Attorney to head the Criminal Division of that office. 
   Even his opponents must describe him as ``a man of personal integrity and a man of considerable legal skill.'' That he is. He is also a person who served as a prosecutor during two Republican Administrations. 
   Professor Lynch is well aware that he has been nominated to the District Court and not to the United States Supreme Court and that he will be bound by precedent. He has committed to follow precedent and the law and not to substitute his own views. In his answers to the Judiciary Committee, he wrote:  
   There is no question in my mind that the principal functions of the courts is the resolution of disputes and grievances brought to the courts by the parties. A judge who comes to the bench with an agenda, or a set of social problems he or she would like to ``solve,'' is in the wrong business. In our system of separation of powers, the courts exist to apply the Constitution and laws to the cases that are presented to them, not to resolve political or social issues. The bulk of the work of the lower courts consists of criminal cases and the resolution of private disputes and commercial matters.  
   In fact, in specific response to written questions from Senator SESSIONS, Professor Lynch wrote that he understands that the role of a district court judge requires him to follow the precedents of higher courts faithfully and to give them full force and effect, even if he personally disagrees with such precedents. 
   His opponents excerpt a couple lines of text from a 1984 book review and a eulogy to his former boss, Justice Brennan, rewrite them and argue that their revisions of his words indicate a judicial philosophy that he will not enforce the Constitution but his own policy preferences. They are wrong. 
   I have read the articles from which opponents excerpted out of context a phrase here and a phrase there to try to construct some justification for opposing this nominee. In his 1984 book review, Professor Lynch was criticizing a book that defended the legitimacy of constitutional policymaking by the judiciary. That's right: Professor Lynch was on the side of the debate that criticized personal policymaking by judges and counseled judicial restraint. 
   Professor Lynch criticized the author for a ``theory justifying judges in writing their own systems of moral philosophy into the Constitution.'' Nonetheless, opponents of this nominee turn the review on its head, as if Professor Lynch were the proponent of the proposition he was criticizing. 
   These opponents take a throw-away line out of context from the book review and miss the point of the review. What his critics miss is the fact that Professor Lynch argued against the Supreme Court being the politically activist institution that the book he is criticizing seeks to justify. Professor Lynch argues against judges, even Supreme Court Justices, becoming moral philosophers. He writes, following the excerpt on which his critics rely:  
   [N]either of these claims has force when the Court speaks through the medium of moral philosophy. First, there is little reason to expect judges to be more likely than legislators to reach correct answers to moral questions. After all, judges possess no particular training or expertise that gives them better insight than other citizens into whether abortion is a fundamental right or an inexcusable wrong. Disinterestedness alone does not determine success in intellectual endeavor. .....  
   Ignored by his critic is also the written answer that Professor Lynch furnished Senator SESSIONS explaining what he meant by the statement that is being misread and misinterpreted, again, by his opponents. Professor Lynch explained:  
   The quoted statement comes from a book review in which I sharply criticize a book that makes the claim that courts have authority to enforce moral principles of its own choosing, a position I do not share. In the quoted passage, I was attempting to explain why the Supreme Court is given power to enforce the text of a written Constitution.  
   The other quote being criticized is taken from a short memorial to Justice Brennan, a man for whom Professor Lynch had clerked and whom he respected. The memorial was apparently written just after Justice Brennan's funeral. Professor Lynch wrote of Justice Brennan's humanity and his patriotism. Nonetheless, it appears that even this statement of tribute to a departed friend is grist for the mill of opponents looking for something they can declare objectionable. 
   Ignored by opponents is the direct response to Senator SESSIONS' question about the eulogy for Justice Brennan. Professor Lynch responded to Senator SESSIONS:  
   The statement quoted comes from a eulogy to Justice Brennan on the occasion of his death. I do not believe that good faith attempts to discern the original intent of the framers are dishonest or dishonorable. Judges and historians daily make honorable and honest attempts to understand the thoughts of the framers. 
   Too often, however, the history that lawyers present to courts is deliberately or inadvertently biased by the position that lawyers as advocates would like to reach, and such resort to partial and limited sources can be used to support results that accord with policy preferences. While Justice Brennan took positions that can be criticized as activist, it  is generally agreed that he was forthright in stating his approach.  
   Likewise ignored is Professor Lynch's statement to Senator SESSIONS: ``The judge's role is to apply the law, not to make it.'' 
   Also ignored are the acknowledgments by Professor Lynch in the course of the memorial itself that the ``charge that Justice Brennan confused his own values with those of the Constitution does capture one piece of the truth'' and that the ``problem, and here is the heart of the argument against Brennanism, is that there will always be different interpretations of what those core shared values mean in particular situations.'' I commend Professor Lynch for his candor. 
   It is sad that Senators have come to oppose nominees and the Senate has refused to move forward on nominees because they clerked, as young lawyers just out of law school for a certain judge or because clients they represented during the course of their practice and while fulfilling their professional responsibilities had certain types of claims and charges against them or brought certain types of claims. That is what underlies the opposition to both this highly qualified nominee and to Fred Woocher, a nominee to an emergency vacancy on the District Court for the Central District of California. 
   Mr. Woocher participated in a confirmation hearing last November and has been denied consideration by the Judiciary Committee for more than six months. Mr. Woocher has had a distinguished legal career and is fully qualified to serve as a District Judge. But Mr. Woocher clerked for Justice Brennan after his academic studies at Yale and Stanford. 
   Apparently, Senators who are holding up consideration of Mr. Woocher likewise believe that those who do not favor the conservative activism of Justice Scalia or Chief Justice Rehnquist should oppose the appointment of people who clerked for such jurists. Certainly that is the point that they are establishing by their opposition to these outstanding nominees. 
   Any Senator is entitled to his or her opinions and to vote as he or she sees fit on this or any nominee. But the excerpts relied upon by opponents of Professor Lynch, from over 20 years of writing and legal work, do not support the conclusion that Professor Lynch is insensitive to the proper role of a judge or that he would ignore the rule of law or precedent. To charge that Judge Lynch would consider himself not to be bound by the plain words of the Constitution is to misperceive Jerry Lynch and ignore his legal career. 
   With respect to the unfounded charge that Professor Lynch would interpret the Constitution by ignoring its words, that is simply not true. Here is what Professor Lynch told Senator THURMOND at his confirmation hearing:  
   I believe, Mr. Chairman, that the starting place in interpreting the Constitution is with the language of the document. As with legislation passed by the Congress, it is the wording of the Constitution that was ratified by the people and that constitutes the binding contract under which our Government is created. 
   In attempting to understand the language, it is most important to look to the original intent of those who wrote it and the context in which it was written. At the same time, with respect to many of those principles, the Framers intended to adopt very broad principles. Sometimes the understanding of those principles changes over time.  
   In truth, the opposition to this nomination seems to boil down to the fact that Professor Lynch clerked for Justice Brennan, a distinguished and respected member of the United States Supreme Court, more than 20 years ago. 
   In light of the arguments made by the Senator of Alabama on the workload of the Federal Circuit, I wanted to add to the RECORD the letter from the Chamber of Commerce to the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts from last summer. Although these statistics are as out of date as those used by the Senator from Alabama, the letter makes several important points. The caseload of the Federal Circuit is not inflated by prisoner cases but is filled with complicated intellectual property cases and other complex litigation. I ask consent to print the August 1999 letter from the Chamber of Commerce in the RECORD.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this bill, which will help protect both America's economy and our relationship with Canada. In particular, citizens of states all across our Northern Border should breathe a sigh of relief that we appear to be close to finding a legislative solution to a potentially serious problem brewing along our border with Canada. 
   This bill will replace section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). Section 110 would mandate that the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) establish an automated system to record the entry and exit of all aliens in order to track their movements within the United States and to determine those who ``overstay'' their visas. the system has not yet been implemented. 
   By requiring an automated system for monitoring the entry and exit of ``all aliens,'' this provision requires that INS and Customs agents stop each vehicle or individual entering or exiting the United States at all ports of entry. Canadians, U.S. permanent residents and many others who are not currently required to show documentation of their status would likely either have to carry some form of identification or fill out paperwork at the points of entry. 
   This sort of tracking system would be costly to implement along the Northern Border, especially since there is no current system or infrastructure to track the departure of citizens and others leaving the United States. 
   Section 110 would also lead to excessive and costly traffic delays for those living and working near the border. These delays would surely have a negative impact on the $2.4 billion in goods and services shipped annually from Vermont to Canada and would likely reduce the $120 million per year which Canadians spend in Vermont. 
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service Data Management Improvement Act will replace the existing Section 110 with a new provision that requires the Attorney General to implement an ``integrated entry and exit data system.'' This system would simply integrate the arrival and departure data which already is authorized or required to be collected under current law, and which is in electronic format within databases held by the Justice and State Departments. The INS would not be required to take new steps to collect information from those entering and leaving the country, meaning that Canadians will have the same ability to enter the United States as they do today. 
   This bill will ensure that tourists and trade continue to freely cross the border, without additional documentation requirements. This bill will also guarantee that more than $1 billion daily cross-border trade is not hindered in any way. Just as importantly, Vermonters and others who cross our nation's land borders on a daily basis to work or visit with family or friends should be able to continue to do so without additional border delays. 
   This is an issue that I have worked on ever since section 110 was originally adopted in 1996. In 1997, along with Senator ABRAHAM and others, I introduced the ``Border Improvement and Immigration Act of 1997.'' Among other things, that legislation would have (1) specifically exempted Canadians from any new documentation or paperwork requirements when crossing the border into the United States; (2) required the Attorney General to discuss the development of ``reciprocal agreements'' with the Secretary of State and the governments of contiguous countries to collect the data on visa overstayers; and (3) required the Attorney General to increase the number of INS inspectors by 300 per year and the number of Customs inspectors by 150 per year for the next three years, with at least half of those inspectors being assigned to the Northern Border. 
   I also worked with Senator ABRAHAM, Senator KENNEDY, and other Senators to obtain postponements in the implementation date for the automated system mandated by section 110. We were successful in those attempts, delaying implementation until March 30, 2001. But delays are by nature only a temporary solution; in the legislation we introduce today, I believe we have found a permanent solution that allows us to keep track of the flow of foreign nationals entering and leaving the United States without crippling commerce or our important relationship with Canada. That is why I am proud to support this legislation, and why I urge prompt action.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know the distinguished leader has been working on trying to find a way to confirm some more judges. I hope we do. 
   I remind the Senate, and the American public, that there is a mistaken belief that in a Presidential election year we stop confirming judges. That is not so. 
   As one who has been here for 25 years, I note that there is an informal procedure called the Thurmond rule, named after our beloved President pro tempore, the Senator from South Carolina, STROM THURMOND. This rule basically says that as we get close to the Presidential election time--July, August, and into the fall--we slow down and nearly stop the confirmation of judges to lifetime appointments to see how the Presidential election comes out, because the next President will be able to nominate judges. 
   But having said that, I point out what happened in the last year of President Bush's term. Democrats controlled the Senate, and we confirmed 66 judges--66 judges nominated by President Bush--more than have been confirmed in any year of President Clinton's term in which there has been a Republican majority, even when he was not facing reelection. In 1996 they confirmed only 17 judges all year. 
   With a Democratic Senate in the last year of President Reagan's term, we did not have this kind of a slowdown and stoppage. Democrats confirmed more than 40 judges. 
   I hope we will look, first and foremost, not at some kind of partisan game but at what is best for the judiciary. 
   We are seen throughout the world as having the most independent federal judiciary anywhere. Look at what happens in other parts of the world where the President or Prime Minister or leader of a country can tell the judiciary exactly what to do, and they do it. Look at what happened in Peru. President Fujimori got the Supreme Court to allow him to run unconstitutionally for a third term. 
   Look at a number of other countries around the world where dictators, and those who seize power, get the courts to bend to their will. That is not done here in the United States. Our Federal judiciary truly is independent. We should protect their independence by not making judges a partisan pawn in a political program. We should make sure they remain independent. 
   Democrats have given an enormous amount of flexibility to Republican Presidents. I hope--it may be a vain hope--that a Democratic President would get at least a goodly percentage of that same kind of flexibility from a Republican-controlled Senate. If we were to confirm all 16 of the judges on the Senate Executive Calendar today, we still would only have confirmed 23 judges so far this year. That is about half the total from 1988 and only one-third of the 66 judges confirmed in 1992. 
   We will not accomplish anything tonight on this. But I urge--as I did last night when I was speaking to the Capitol Historical Society, speaking of the history of the Judiciary Committee, when I praised a number of Republican chairmen of that committee, from the past and present, and Democratic chairmen--and if I might, just for a moment, reflect on my 25 years here--we 
    should lower our decibel level, especially in this area. I urge that the distinguished Republican leader and the distinguished Democratic leader, both of whom are dear friends of mine--and I have enjoyed the friendship and serving with them--might try once again. And the distinguished chairman of the committee, the senior Senator from Utah, Mr. HATCH, and I will do that, too, because whatever momentary political advantage either party might have, it does not begin to equate with our responsibility to the independence of the finest judiciary in the world. We should make that try. 
   It will not happen tonight, but over the weekend maybe calmer heads will prevail. I see my good friend from Kansas on the floor. He and I have joined on legislation. We are certainly not seen as political and philosophical allies, but we have reached across the aisle on significant legislation; one of the most significant is the collegiate gambling legislation. The distinguished Presiding Officer, the Senator from Alabama, and I have also joined together and voted together oftentimes in the Judiciary Committee. We know that, eventually, if something is going to work it has to have the support of Democrats and Republicans. I mention this because I hope that maybe the temperatures will lower. Let us realize that we have more things to unite us than to divide us and we can work together. I thank my two colleagues for their forbearance and letting me take these few minutes. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. I rise today in support of the Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act of 2000, which has passed the House and deserves our support as well. The beneficiaries of this bill are guerrilla soldiers--and their spouses and widows--who were our allies in Laos during the Vietnam War. Many of these soldiers came to the United States with their families after the war and have contributed to the American economy through their labor and by paying taxes. Now many of them seek to become citizens of this country, but find it difficult to meet the prerequisites for naturalization due to the unique characteristics of their native culture. 
   Until quite recently, the Hmong people had no written language. This lack of experience with written language has made it more difficult for Hmong people who have moved to the United States to learn English, which in turn makes it more difficult for them to obtain citizenship. This bill would waive the English language requirement and provide special consideration for the civics requirement for Hmong veterans and their spouses and widows. It is a small concession to make in return for the great sacrifices that these men made in fighting for the American cause in Southeast Asia. 
   I would like to commend Senators WELLSTONE and FEINGOLD for the efforts they have made to draw attention to this issue and this bill, and to thank Representative VENTO whose persistence has made this bill possible. I would also note that this is a bipartisan bill that Senators HAGEL and MCCAIN have cosponsored. My only disappointment is that the majority made it impossible to report this bill from the Judiciary Committee last week, when we were joined at the hearing by many of the brave soldiers whom this bill would benefit. Instead of working out its concerns with the bill's sponsors in advance, the majority insisted upon an 11th-hour amendment, an amendment that--in violation of normal practice--was not distributed to members of this Committee. This conduct came only a week after the majority objected to an attempt to pass the House bill on the floor--an attempt that was cleared by every Senator on my side of the aisle. 
   But it is better to pass this bill after a delay than not at all. I am grateful for the opportunity to have helped bring this bill to the floor today, and I look forward to the day when these brave veterans become American citizens. It is a privilege that they have more than earned.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield a moment, I thank the Senator from Kansas and others for passing this bill. I know this has been a major cause of our retiring colleague from the other body, BRUCE VENTO. We had this before the Judiciary Committee this morning. I thank Senator HATCH and the others who helped make it possible to bring it out. It rights a grievous wrong, and it is a good piece of legislation.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President. U.S. News and World Report, in speaking of the death of Marvin Stone, spoke of one man's ``superior contribution''. 
   Marvin Stone contributed more than should be expected of someone who had had a dozen life times and far more than anyone could have expected in a span of seventy-six years. 
   Marvin Stone, born in Burlington, VT, served in the Pacific in World War II and then went on to become one of the most respected journalists in America. 
   My wife, Marcelle, and I have been privileged to know Marvin and his wonderful wife, Terry. I think with fondness not only of times together with them, Marvin's sister, Marilyn Greenfield, and the many friends in Burlington, but also evenings with those far reaching conversations at their home in the Washington area. 
   Marvin took the time to call me when I was a brand new Senator, even though he probably was at first curious about the oddity of a Democrat from Vermont. We became close friends and throughout two decades I called upon him for advice and insight. I knew the advice would come, never tinged with partisanship but underlined with a great sense of history and his overwhelming integrity. 
   I can only imagine the void this leaves in the life of Terry, his wife of fifty years, of Jamie and Stacey and Torren and all his family. He also leaves a great void in our country.  Marvin's legacy, though, is also one of example, and those, especially in the field of journalism, who follow that example, can also seek the respect and the honor that he earned.

   Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we need to do a better job supporting our federal law enforcement officers and our State and local law enforcement officers. This is National Police Week and today was the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service in which we remembered another 139 federal, State and local officers who died in the line of duty. I commend Senator CAMPBELL for introducing S. Res. 247 back in January. I am sorry that the Judiciary Committee did not take it up and report it before today, but am supportive of his efforts and agreed to discharge the Committee, so as not to miss today's activities. 
   As someone who served in law enforcement for 8 years as the Chittenden County State's Attorney, I respect and admire those who devote their careers to public safety. I took issue with the extreme rhetoric that some have recently used to attack our Federal law enforcement officers who helped return Elian Gonzalez to his father. 
   For example, one of the Republican leaders in the House of Representatives was quoted as calling the officers of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, the U.S. Border Patrol, and the U.S. Marshals Service: ``jack-booted thugs.'' And the Republican Mayor of New York City, who is seeking election to this body, called these dedicated public servants: ``storm troopers.'' This extreme rhetoric only serves to degrade federal law enforcement officers in the eyes of the public. 
   Let none of us in the Congress, or who are seeking to serve in Congress, contribute to an atmosphere of disrespect for law enforcement officers. No matter what your opinion of the law enforcement action in South Florida, we should all agree that these law enforcement officers were following orders and putting their lives on the line, which they do everyday. Let us treat law enforcement officers with the respect that is essential to their preserving the peace and protecting the public. 
   This harsh rhetoric by Republican public officials reminds me of similar harsh rhetoric used in April 1995, when the NRA sent out a fund-raising letter calling federal law enforcement officers ``jack-booted thugs'' who wear ``Nazi bucket helmets and black storm trooper uniforms.'' President George Bush was correctly outraged by this NRA rhetoric and resigned from the NRA in protest. President Bush wrote to the NRA: ``Your broadside against federal agents deeply offends my own sense of decency and honor. ...... It indirectly slanders a wide array of government law enforcement officials, who are out there, day and night, laying their lives on the line for all of us.'' I praised President Bush in 1995 for his actions and again recently. 
   President Bush was right. This harsh rhetoric of calling federal law enforcement officers ``jack-booted thugs'' and ``storm troopers'' should offend our sense of decency and honor. It is highly offensive and did not belong in any public debate on the reunion of Elian Gonzalez with his father, either. We are fortunate to have dedicated women and men throughout Federal law 
   enforcement in this country who do a tremendous job under difficult circumstances. They are examples of the hard-working public servants that make up the federal government, who are too often maligned and unfairly disparaged. These are people with children and parents and friends. They deserve our respect, not personal insults. 
   In countless incidents across the country everyday, federal law enforcement officers, who are sworn to protect the public and enforce the law, are in danger. These law enforcement officers deserve our thanks and our respect. They do not deserve to be called ``jack-booted thugs'' and ``storm troopers.'' 
   I went to the Senate floor in the wake of those comments to join the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association in condemning these insults against our nation's law enforcement officers. Any public official who used this harsh rhetoric owes our Federal law enforcement officers an apology. I regret that members of the majority party have not followed President Bush's example and, likewise, condemned that extreme rhetoric. 
   This week is an annual occasion in which we pause to remember the federal, State and local officers who gave their lives in the line of duty over the past year. It is a difficult week and an important week. It should be a productive week, as well. 
   I said last week at the Judiciary Committee Business Meeting that the Committee should be taking up and reporting S. 2413, the bill that Senator CAMPBELL and I introduced to improve our Bulletproof Vest Grant Partnership Act by reauthorizing the program for another 3 years, raising the annual appropriation to $50 million and guaranteeing to jurisdictions with populations less than 100,000 a fair share of these resources. This program has been  very helpful in offering federal assistance to help protect State and local officers in concrete ways. It is an extraordinarily successful program and it should be extended and expanded. I thank President Clinton for his support and for calling for enactment of this measure during his remarks at the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service today. I hope that when the Committee meets later this week, Senator HATCH will see fit to include this measure on the agenda and that the Committee will act favorably on it. 
   In addition, I look forward to enacting additional measures that protect and assist State and local law enforcement. In particular, I was extremely disappointed last year when an anonymous Republican objection prevented S. 521, my bill to improve the Bulletproof Vest Grant Partnership Act, from passing. This bill would allow the Attorney General to waive or reduce the matching fund requirement for assisting poor and rural law enforcement units to provide this life-saving equipment to officers and prevent injury and death. I cannot understand why anyone would want to oppose that effort. 
   Finally, I am disappointed that the Congress has not taken final action on the Public Medal of Valor Act, S. 39, championed by Senator STEVENS. The awarding of a medal for extraordinary valor shown by law enforcement officers every year would be a good way to draw attention to the service provided every day by officers all across this country. That bill passed the Senate a year ago by unanimous consent. I cosponsored the bill along with 28 others. For the past year, the House has not found the time to pass it. Today the President announced that he will explore ways to proceed to honor valor by our public safety officers through executive action if Congress continues to stall action on this bill. I hope that Congress will finally act on S. 39 this week and send it to the President for his signature. 
   These are just a few of the important legislative matters that the Congress should address to help our federal and state law enforcement officers. We should strive for constructive action rather than half-baked rhetoric.

   Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I know that Senator ROBB strongly supports this bill and I was glad to work with him and Senator ASHCROFT to expedite Judiciary Committee action in February and finally to achieve Senate consideration today. 
   I support extending the educational assistance benefits to the families of public safety officers who died in the line of duty. I supported those efforts when we acted for federal officers' families back in 1996 and when we extended those benefits to State and local officers' families in 1998. 
   A number of us joined with Senator SPECTER and Senator KOHL back in 1996 to pass the Federal Law Enforcement Dependents Assistance Act. Our efforts grew out of the Ruby Ridge investigation and our shared concern to help the family of U.S. Marshal Bill Degan and the families of others killed in the line of duty. 
   At the time we were unable to gain the consensus needed to authorize these education benefits to State and local law enforcement officers. Some thought that would cost too much. We came back in 1997 and 1998 and were able to pass the Public Safety Officers Educational Benefits Assistance Act to extend these educational benefits to State and local public safety officers. We were led in that effort by Senators SPECTER and BIDEN. 
   I am delighted to see these benefits expanded further by extending them retroactively by this bill, S. 1638. We were told in February that the estimated cost of this expansion would be $125 million. Since then we have received a significantly revised estimate from the CBO greatly diminishing the estimated costs. I do not know whether CBO was wrong in February or is wrong now, but I commend Senator ASHCROFT and all the sponsors of this measure for their willingness to make this investment and authorize these payments. 
   I have said that rather than move the eligibility dates back approximately between 14 and 19 years, we should consider removing them altogether. I do not want some to be penalized by the arbitrary selection of the eligibility date. In this regard I have urged an amendment to take the eligibility dates back to at least January 1978, in order to cover at least one, and possibly more, Vermont families who suffered the loss of a family member who was a public safety officer earlier that year. The family of Arnold Magoon, a Vermont game warden, should not be penalized again because he died on April 27 and not after May 1 or October 1 of 1978. 
   I said in February when the committee considered this measure that I would be working to speed its passage and to help it achieve its goal of making these assistance payments as comprehensive as possible. As soon as the majority got around to suggesting consideration of this matter on Wednesday, May 10, I cleared it for consideration so that we could proceed. 
   In addition, I look forward to enacting additional measures that protect and assist State and local law enforcement. In particular, I was extremely disappointed last year when an anonymous Republican objection prevented S. 521, my bill to improve the Bulletproof Vest Grant Partnership Act, from passing. This bill would allow the Attorney General to waive or reduce the matching fund requirement for assisting poor and rural law enforcement units to provide this life-saving equipment to officers and prevent injury and death. I cannot understand why anyone would want to oppose that effort. 
   This year, in addition, I have joined again with Senator CAMPBELL to introduce S. 2413 to improve our Bulletproof Vest Grant Partnership Act by reauthorizing the program for another 3 years, raising the annual appropriation to $50 million and guaranteeing to jurisdictions with populations less than 100,000 a fair share of these resources. Senator HATCH has joined us as a cosponsor of our measure. 
   I hope that the Judiciary Committee and the Senate will act on these measures without additional delay, as well.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last year I reluctantly cast my vote against the Trade and Development Act of 1999, a modest package of trade bills which included the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the Carribean Basin Trade Enhancement Act. 
   I have long supported expanding trade opportunities for Vermonters and all Americans, as well as for people in developing countries. And I have felt for some time that our relationship with Africa cannot continue to be based almost exclusively on aid, when the real engine of development, as we have seen both at home and abroad, is investment and trade. 
   However, I voted against that bill because I felt that in developing a trade policy toward Africa--where poverty is deeply rooted and protections for the environment and the rights of workers  are non-existent--precautions must be taken to ensure that it is a sound policy that responds to Africa's unique and urgent needs. I was disappointed that given the rare opportunity to examine and redefine our relationship with Africa, the approach was so limited and flawed. 
   There are many aspects of this conference report which I strongly support. Provisions which open new markets for American exports, while providing trade benefits that will help a number of countries compete more effectively in the global economy. Provisions which encourage countries to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, and raise the profile of U.S. agricultural interests in trade negotiations. 
   I remain disappointed, however, by the act's approach toward Africa. 
   It is astonishing that aside from Sense of Congress language about the need to strengthen efforts to combat desertification, the act in no way addresses environmental concerns. This is an unfortunate step backward from NAFTA, which--while they did not go far enough--contained side agreements on both environmental and labor issues. 
   Multinational corporations, especially mining and timber companies, have a long history of exploiting Africa's weak environmental laws and causing pollution, deforestation and the uprooting of people. There is a direct link between environmental degradation and civil unrest. If barriers to foreign investment are lowered or eliminated--as the act calls for--and meaningful, enforceable environmental protections are not put in place, these problems will only get worse. 
   The act's provision on workers' rights, most of which have been included in other trade legislation, have routinely allowed countries notorious for abuses to escape without penalty. Unions have rightly criticized them for being vague and unenforceable. 
   As the wealthiest nation, we have a responsibility to do what we can to ensure that the benefits of the global economy are enjoyed by people from all walks of life, here and abroad. However, the workers' rights provision in this act are an invitation for the continued exploitation of cheap African labor. 
   Mr. President, some have claimed that this legislation is an historic first step toward integrating Africa into the global economy. Others have called it a devastating blow that will force African countries to cut spending on education and health care, and to submit to strict International Monetary Fund conditions. It is neither. 
   The Trade and Development Act of 2000 is not going to cause the great economic boon some have predicted, and it may cause harm. But it is the wrong approach if we truly want to redefine our relationship with the region from one of dependency to one of actively promoting economic growth and self-reliance. 
   Like last year, I reluctantly cast my vote against the bill.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, throughout the dispute over Elian Gonzalez, I have argued that he should be reunited with his father Juan Miguel, I have made this argument because I believe that children belong with their parents, barring evidence of unfitness. I also made this argument because I was concerned about how American parents are being treated internationally. 
   At the Judiciary Committee hearing held on the Elian Gonzalez case on March 1, I also urged that we consider the potential impact of that case on those of U.S. parents fighting to gain custody of their children in other countries. In fact, at that hearing I made sure to invite a U.S. parent who has struggled for years just for the right to see his children in Japan, and who believes, as do other American parents in similar circumstances, that to preserve American credibility we must practice what we preach and reunite Elian Gonzalez and his father. 
   I worked for months on such a case of an American child who was taken abroad by an estranged parent. Had it not been for the active intervention of the Government of Egypt, the child would not have been reunited with his American mother. Reuniting Elian and his father was the best thing for Elian and also the best way to advance American interests--and the interests of American parents whose children have been taken abroad without their consent. 
   At the March 1 hearing, I quoted Mary Ryan, the Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, who had testified in the federal court case regarding Elian Gonzalez that a failure to enforce the INS' decision that Elian Gonzalez should be reunited with his father would ``be inconsistent with the principles we advocate on behalf of the United States and could have potentially lasting negative implications for left-behind parents in the United States and for U.S. citizen children taken to foreign countries.'' 
   I believe that the American government should stand behind that principle and seek to bring children and their parents back together. I am proud that the government has reunited Elian and his father, and I think the pictures of the two of them together have proven beyond a doubt that this was the right result. 
   But I am deeply concerned that the energy and effectiveness that our government showed in reuniting Elian and his father does not always seem to apply to its attempts to reunite American children and their parents. Indeed, recent articles in the Washington Post indicate that our State Department should take a far more active role in helping American parents who--in violation of international law--are being deprived of custody of their children. 
   The Washington Post tells the story of Joseph Cooke, a New York man whose then-wife took their two young children to Germany and, without Mr. Cooke's consent, turned the children over to the state because she felt unable to care for them. For a year and a half, Mr. Cooke was unable to find out what had happened to his children, as his wife refused even to tell him where they were. When he finally was able to locate them, he sought custody of them in both American and German courts. Although he obtained a custody order from an American court, which under the Hague Convention is binding upon Germany since the children had resided in the United States for all of their young lives, the German courts have refused to grant him custody. Instead, they have ruled that the children should stay with their foster parents, in part because during the drawn-out German legal process, the children learned German, went to German schools, and grew attached to their foster parents. The court felt that reuniting these children with their father would result in ``severe psychological loss.'' 
   The State Department's reaction to this case hardly befits the importance of the issue involved. Despite Germany's obligations under the Hague Convention, a State Department spokeswoman told the Washington Post, ``We're not the courts. It's up to the courts to make those kinds of decisions.'' The very point of the Hague Convention is to provide countries with a diplomatic opportunity to question the rulings of courts outside the country were the children habitually reside. The Convention is rendered meaningless if our State Department is not willing to act as a strong advocate for American parents. As the Post reported, only 80 out of the 369 children--22 percent--who were the subject of Hague applications from American parents from 1990 to 1998 have come back to the United States, and that number includes those children who were voluntarily returned. Meanwhile, U.S. courts have returned 90 percent of children who were the subject of Hague applications in other countries. 
   In other words, while America obeys its treaty obligations, it has failed to enforce our own treaty rights. This is not a minor problem, either. The State Department says that it has 1,148 open international custody cases, and there are surely far more cases that have not been reported to the government. The State Department should be doing everything within its power to help American parents. I implore our government to pay more attention to this issue, and I ask our allies to abide by their own duties under the Hague Convention. 
   I ask unanimous consent to enter an editorial on this matter from today's Washington Post into the RECORD.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on Saturday, March 18, the Paramount Theater opened its doors to the Rutland community for the first public performance on its stage in nearly 20 years. This was a memorable night for Vermonters who had the opportunity to see Arlo Guthrie perform with the Vermont Symphony Orchestra. This grand reopening also marked the successful completion of an important and historic restoration project. 
   The Paramount Theater is a Vermont treasure that was an icon of downtown Rutland from the time it first opened its doors in 1914 to the day those doors closed in 1981. Founded by Rutland businessman George T. Chaffee, the Chaffee Playhouse served as a venue for the entertainers of the day, allowing Rutland area residents the opportunity to see the likes of Will Rogers, the Marx Brothers and Harry Houdini, among many others. As motion pictures moved into the spotlight in the 1930s, Chaffee's Playhouse was taken over by Paramount and became known as the Paramount Movie House. 
   Then times changed, and after years of screening movies for fewer and fewer patrons, the Paramount closed its doors to the public in 1981. The ornate theater that had once served as a centerpiece for the Rutland arts and social scenes had become only a fond memory for those whose lives it had affected. 
   Now times have changed again, and over the past several years, downtown Rutland has undergone remarkable growth and revitalization. As the downtown community began to bustle with more and more visitors, local residents and merchants felt the time had come to reopen the doors of the old Center Street theater. 
   Coming up with a good idea is often the easy part of a project. Finding a way to turn that idea into reality can be a much larger task. That was the case with the project to reopen the Paramount Theater, which required significant renovation and restoration. Through the tireless efforts of community leaders, a major fund raising effort was launched with contributions from individuals and local businesses, with grants also from the state and federal governments. More than 1500 people made personal contributions toward the renovation project. My colleague, Senator JEFFORDS, took the lead in making the case for the federal contribution, and I was pleased to support that effort. 
   Nearly 20 years after it closed, and after more than $3.5 million in construction and renovation, the Paramount Theater has been restored to the beauty and splendor enjoyed by those Vermonters who attended its original opening night on January 15, 1914. The reopening of the Paramount Theater now will serve the Rutland community's need for an arts center, and, for new generations of Vermonters, it will once again be a focal point for the social life of a vibrant community.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I, again, urge the Senate to take the responsible action necessary to fill the 80 judicial vacancies around the country. The Senate has confirmed only seven judges all year. We are in our fifth month and have only confirmed seven judges. We have 80 vacancies. There are six nominations on the Senate Executive Calendar, including Tim Dyk, who has twice been reported by the Judiciary Committee. Mr. Dyk's nomination has been pending over 2 years. Does this all sound familiar? It is because the Senate continues to fail in its responsibility to the American people and the Federal courts to take action on judicial nominations. 
   The stall has been going on since 1996, with a few brief burst of activity when the editorial writers and public attention has focused attention of these shortcomings. When there is scrutiny, then the majority puts through a few more. 
   The Judiciary Committee is not doing any better. It has held the equivalent of two hearings all year. In 5 months, it has held the equivalent of just two hearings on judicial nominations. We heard from only two nominees to the courts of appeal and only nine to the district courts. The committee has reported only six nominees all year, just six. 
   I know the Senate has built in to the schedule a lot of vacation and a number of recesses. Maybe we ought to take a day or two out of one of those vacations and have some hearings and some votes on the confirmations of the scores of judges that are needed. 
   We have seen the majority announce with great fanfare that the Senate would have more hearings in the Judiciary Committee on Elian Gonzalez this year. The American public responded so loudly and correctly to that proposal for senatorial child abuse that the majority quickly backed off, trying to find some face-saving way to cancel the hearings. Well, without those hearings we had a whole day this week available. Instead of senatorial child abuse, why not have hearings on judges? We could have done that. 
   The committee markup scheduled for this morning was canceled. We could have used that time for a Judiciary hearing or proceeded and reported a few judicial nominees. 
   Most afternoons are free around here this year. We could have hearings a few afternoons a week and start to catch up on our responsibilities. 
   Over the last weekend, the President again called upon us to do our job and complete consideration of these nominations without additional delay. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, a Republican, has scolded the Senate in this regard. 
   I have urged the Senate time and time again to fulfill our responsibilities. I wish we would do this, take a couple days less vacation time, work a few afternoons, and confirm the judges that we need around the country. 
   A couple of years ago, I compared the Senate pace of confirming judges with  the home run pace of such players as Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, and Ken Griffey, Jr. Over the past couple of years when I have used this example of how much better they do hitting home runs than we do at confirming judges, my friend from Utah and I have gone back and forth with regard to this kind of comparison. He has said I should not be comparing the Senate to some of the greatest home run hitters of all time. I understand his reluctance since this Senate certainly has not been a home run hitter as far as confirming judges. 
   But when I looked at the sports pages today I was struck by how poorly we are doing. Keep in mind, that the Senate has been in session a couple of months longer than the baseball season, that we had a 2-month head start. Nonetheless, as of today, there are 27 baseball players who have hit more home runs than the Senate has confirmed judges. These are not just the stars. The Senate does not fail in comparison to just McGwire and Sosa, but in comparison to--I know these are names you will not all recognize and I see 
   the pages coming to attention and see how many they know--the White Sox' Paul Konerko; the Cubs' Shane Andrews; the Rockies' Todd Helton; the Brewers' Geoff Jenkins; the Angels' Troy Glaus; the Royals' Mike Sweeney. Not legends yet, but fine people and players who have all hit more home runs than the Senate--even with a 2-month head start. 
   In fact, I may be doing a disservice to these major-leaguers by comparing them to the Senate. Why? Because these ballplayers are acting professionally and doing what they are paid to do. We are not acting professionally. We are not fulfilling our constitutional responsibilities. We are not doing what we are paid to do. We are refusing to vote yes or no on these judges. 
   The vacancies on the courts of appeals around the country are particularly acute. Vacancies on the courts of appeals are continuing to rob these courts of approximately 12.3 percent of their authorized active strength, as they have for the last several years. The Ninth Circuit continues to be plagued by multiple vacancies. We should be making progress on the nominations of Barry Goode, Judge Johnnie B. Rawlinson and James E. Duffy, Jr., as well as that of Richard Tallman. 
   I am acutely aware that there is no one on the Ninth Circuit from the State of Hawaii. I know that federal law requires that ``there be at least one circuit judge in regular active service appointed from the residents of each state in that circuit,'' 28 U.S.C. 44(c), and I would like to see us proceed to comply with the law and confirm Mr. Duffy, as well as the other well-qualified nominees to that Court of Appeals without further delay. 
   The Fifth Circuit continues to labor under a circuit emergency declared last year by its Chief Judge Carolyn Dineen King. We should be moving the nominations of Alston Johnson and Enrique Moreno to that Circuit to help it meet its responsibilities. 
   Earlier this year I received a copy of a letter from Judge Gilbert Merritt, formerly Chief Judge of the Sixth Circuit, concerning the multiple vacancies plaguing that Circuit. Judge Merritt was disturbed by a report that the Judiciary Committee would not be moving any nominees for the Sixth Circuit this year. We should be moving on the nominations of Kathleen McCree Lewis, Kent Markus, and Helene White. Judge Merritt wrote to us two months ago, stating:  
   The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals now has four vacancies. Twenty-five per cent of the seats on the Sixth Circuit are vacant. The Court is hurting badly and will not be able to keep up with its work load due to the fact that the Senate Judiciary Committee has acted on none of the nominations to our Court. One of the vacancies is five years old and no vote has ever been taken. One is two years old. We have lost many years of judge time because of the vacancies. 
   By the time the next President is inaugurated, there will be six vacancies on the Court of Appeals. Almost half of the Court will be vacant and will remain so for most of 2001 due to the exigencies of the nomination process. Although the President has nominated candidates, the Senate has refused to take a vote on any of them. 
   Our Court should not be treated in this fashion. The public's business should not be treated this way. The litigants in the federal courts should not be treated this way. The remaining judges on a court should not be treated this way. The situation in our Court is rapidly deteriorating due to the fact that 25% of the judgeships are vacant. Each active judge of our Court is now participating in deciding more than 550 cases a year--a case load that is excessive by any standard. 
   In addition, we have almost 200 death penalty cases that will be facing us before the end of next year. I presently have six pending before me right now and many more in the pipeline. Although the death cases are very time consuming (the records often run to 5000 pages), we are under very short deadlines imposed by Congress for acting on these cases. Under present circumstances, we will be unable to meet these deadlines. Unlike the Supreme Court, we have no discretionary jurisdiction and must hear every case. 
   The Founding Fathers certainly intended that the Senate ``advise'' as to judicial nomination, i.e., consider, debate and vote up or down. They surely did not intend that the Senate, for partisan or factional reasons, would remain silent and simply refuse to give any advice or consider and vote at all, thereby leaving the courts in limbo, understaffed and unable properly to carry out their responsibilities for years.  
   Likewise, the Fourth Circuit, the Tenth Circuit and the District of Columbia Circuit continue to have multiple vacancies. Shame on the Senate for perpetuating these crises in so many Courts of Appeals around the country. 
   By this time in 1992, the Senate had confirmed 25 judges and the Committee had held 6 confirmation hearings for judicial nominees. By this date in 1988, the Senate had confirmed 21 judges and the Committee had held 7 hearings. By this time in 1998, the Senate had confirmed 17 judges and the Committee had held 5 hearings. This year we remain leagues behind any responsible pace. 
   Unfortunately, the Senate has not built upon the progress we had made filling judicial vacancies following Chief Justice Rehnquist's remarks in his 1997 report on the state of the federal judiciary. Last year, faced with 100 federal judicial vacancies, the Senate confirmed only 34 new judges. This year we will again be facing 100 vacancies. Already we have seen 87 vacancies and have so far responded with the confirmation of only 7 judges. 
   I have challenged the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate to return to the pace it met in 1998 when we held 13 confirmation hearings and confirmed 65 judges. That approximates the pace in 1992, when a Democratic majority in the Senate acted to confirm 66 judges during President Bush's final year in office. 
   There is a myth that judges are not traditionally confirmed in Presidential election years. That is not true. Recall that 64 judges were confirmed in 1980, 44 in 1984, 42 in 1988 when a Democratic majority in the Senate confirmed Reagan nominees and, as I have noted, 66 in 1992 when a Democratic majority in the Senate confirmed 66 Bush nominees. 
   Our federal judiciary cannot afford another unproductive election-year session like 1996 when a Republican majority in the Senate confirmed only 17 judges. These 17 confirmations in 1996 were an anomaly that should not be repeated. Since then we have had years of slower and lower confirmations and heavy backlogs in many federal courts. 
   Working together the Senate can join with the President to confirm well-qualified, diverse and fair-minded judges to fulfill the needs of the federal courts across the country. I urge the Republican leadership to join us in making the federal administration of justice a top priority for the Senate for the rest of the year.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2000, which was crafted by President Clinton and Vice President GORE. I am delighted to be joined by Senator SARBANES, the Ranking Member of the Senate Banking Committee, who is a real leader in the Senate on protecting personal financial information. I am also pleased that Senators ROBB, DODD, KERRY, BRYAN, EDWARDS, DURBIN, HARKIN and FEINSTEIN are original cosponsors of this legislation to protect the financial privacy of all Americans. 
   Last November, President Clinton signed into law the landmark Financial Modernization Act of 1999, which updates our financial laws and opens up the financial services industry to become more competitive, both at home and abroad. Many of my colleagues and I supported that legislation because we believe it will benefit businesses and consumers. It will make it easier for banking, securities, and insurance firms to consolidate their services, cut expenses and offer more products at a lower cost to all. But it also raises new concerns about our financial privacy. 
   New conglomerates in the financial services industry may now offer a widening variety of services, each of which may require a customer to provide financial, medical or other personal information. Nothing in the new law prevents these new subsidiaries or affiliates of financial conglomerates from sharing this information for uses beyond those the customer thought he or she was providing it. For example, the new law has no requirement for the consumer to control whether these new financial subsidiaries or affiliates sell, share, or publish information on savings account balances, certificates of deposit maturity dates and balances, stock and mutual fund purchases and sales, life insurance payouts or health insurance claims. That is wrong. 
   When President Clinton signed the financial modernization bill last year, he directed the National Economic Council to work with the Treasury Department and Office of Management and Budget to craft a legislative proposal to protect financial privacy in the new financial services marketplace. The result of that process is the bill we are introducing today. 
   I believe the Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2000 should serve as the foundation for model financial privacy legislation that Congress enacts into law this year. This bill is a common sense approach that can attract both consumers and the industry. It sands off the extremes at both ends of the issue. We need a catalyst to bring both sides together, and this bill can do it. 
   Privacy is one of our most vulnerable rights in the information age. Digitalization of information offers tremendous benefits but also new threats. Some in Congress are content to punt the privacy issue down the field for another year. The public disagrees. People know that the longer we dawdle, the harder it will be to halt the erosion of privacy. A year is an eternity in the digital age. 
   The right of privacy is a personal and fundamental right protected by the Constitution of the United States. But today, the American people are growing more and more concerned over encroachments on their personal privacy. To return personal financial privacy to the control of the consumer, the Administration's financial privacy legislation would create the following enforceable rights in Federal law. 
   New Right To Opt-out of Information Sharing By Affiliates. The new financial modernization law permits consumers to say no to information sharing, selling or publishing among third parties in many cases, but not among affiliated firms. The Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2000 would require financial conglomerates, which will only grow under the new modernization law, to expand this protection to give consumers the right to notify it (opt-out) to stop all information sharing, selling or publishing of personal financial information among all third parties and affiliates. 
   New Right For Consumers To Opt-In For Sharing of Medical Information and Personal Spending Habits. The Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2000 would require financial firms to get the affirmative consent (opt-in) of consumers before a firm could gain access to medical information within a financial conglomerate or share detailed information about a consumer's personal spending habits. 
   New Right To Access and Correct Financial Information. The Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2000 would give consumers the right to review and correct their financial records, just like consumers today may review and correct their credit reports. 
   New Right To Privacy Policy Up Front. The Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2000 would require financial firms to provide their privacy policies to consumers before committing to a customer relationship, not after. In addition, the bill's new rights would be enforced by federal banking regulators, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorney generals. 
   As President Clinton warned all Americans: ``Although consumers put a great value on privacy of their financial records, our laws have not caught up to technological developments that make it possible and potentially profitable for companies to share financial data in new ways. Consumers who undergo physical exams to obtain insurance, for example, should not have to fear the information will be used to lower their credit card limits or deny them mortgages.'' I strongly agree. 
   Unfortunately, if you have a checking account, you may have a financial privacy problem. Your bank may sell or share with business allies information about who you are writing checks to, when, and for how much. And even if you tell your bank to stop, it can ignore you under current law. This legislation returns to consumers the power to stop the selling or sharing of personal financial information. 
   Americans ought to be able to enjoy the exciting innovations of this burgeoning information era without losing control over the use of their financial information. The Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2000 updates United States privacy laws to provide these fundamental protections of personal financial information in the evolving financial services industry. I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, during the debate last week on the proposed constitutional amendment on victims' rights, a number of editorials and thoughtful essays were printed in the RECORD. Because of the way in which the Senate ended its consideration of S.J. Res. 3, I did not have an opportunity to include in the RECORD all such materials. Accordingly, I included additional materials yesterday and do so again today, in order to help complete the historical record of the debate. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD editorials from a number of sources around the country in opposition to the proposed amendment.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am perfectly willing, from this side, to work with the distinguished Senator from Arizona and the distinguished Senator from California on time. I do not expect an enormous amount of time to be consumed. It has not been announced, but there is a certain sense that there may not be any more rollcall votes this week so a lot of people are probably going to be leaving. I will definitely try to accommodate them. 
   The distinguished Senator from West Virginia does have a statement he wishes to make. I have a statement I wish to make. I am simply trying to protect some others who may want to speak, as I am sure the Senator is on his side. But I will continue to work with the distinguished Senator to cut down this time any way we can.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the sponsors of S.J. Res. 3 have decided to withdraw their proposal to amend the Constitution. One of the reasons they gave for their decision is that the many Senators who came to the floor to oppose their amendment have not, in their view, engaged on the merits of their specific language. Because of this, and because they have vowed to continue in their efforts to amend the Constitution to address victims' rights, I feel obliged to say a few words about some of the most glaring defects of S.J. Res. 3. 
   One of the most fundamental responsibilities of United States Senators is to make sure that we understand what  we are enacting into law. That duty is heightened when we are considering a constitutional amendment. Justice John Marshall said that the Supreme Court ``must never forget, that it is a constitution we are expounding.'' 
   We, too, must never forget that it is a constitution--the Constitution of the United States of America--that we are being urged to amend. 
   I could speak for hours about the defects of this proposed amendment, but I trust that Senators have had an opportunity to consider the minority views in the Committee report that I submitted, along with Senators KENNEDY, KOHL, and FEINGOLD. 
   The minority views run about 40 pages, and identify several specific problems with the drafting of this amendment. 
   I would also direct Senators to the additional views to the Committee's 1998 report, submitted by our distinguished Chairman. Senator HATCH's views subject this amendment to penetrating criticism. He reiterated such concerns just yesterday in his statement to the Senate in which he indicated the following reservations about the proposed constitutional amendment:  
   Its scope: the amendment's protections apply only to violent crimes; 
   Its vagueness: some of its definitions are unclear and will be subject to too much judicial discretion; and 
   Its effects on principles of federalism: the proposed amendment could pave the way for more federal control over state legal proceedings.  
   For the moment, I will just focus on a few fundamental flaws. 
   Let us start with the first, and most important, seven words of the amendment. The amendment gives rights to ``a victim of a crime of violence.'' Supporters of this amendment have often compared it to the fifth and sixth amendments, which give rights to those accused of crimes. So let us compare them. 
   The most basic point about any constitutional right is, whose right is it? The fifth and sixth amendments are clear on that point: They give rights to people who have been charged with committing crimes, and we know who those people are. Of course, the other amendments to our present Constitution are no less clear, since they apply without exception to ``the people,'' or to ``citizens of the United States,'' or, in the case of the fourteenth amendment, to ``all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'' But do we know who would have rights under the proposed victims' rights amendment? 
   The answer in the text of the amendment is ``a victim of a crime of violence.'' Who is that? Let us make it easy by taking the most obvious crime of violence--murder. Who is the victim of a murder? The last time I prosecuted a murder case, the victim was the dead person. But that answer, what Justice Scalia might call the plain language approach to interpretation, will not do here, unless the purpose of the amendment is to enable the corpse to attend the trial. 
   So who, if anyone, gets the benefit of the proposed constitutional rights in a murder case? Maybe nobody. Or maybe the reference in section 2 to ``the victim's lawful representative'' refers to the trustee of the victim's estate in a murder case, although I do not see what the trustee of a murder victim's estate would have to contribute to a bail or parole hearing. Or maybe the amendment's supporters are banking on what I believe are called ``activist judges'' to add words to the amendment that are not there and extend rights to a murder victim's family. 
   This would raise other questions, like what happens when members of the victim's family hold different views about parole, or each wants a share of the mandatory restitution order? Would unmarried couples, be they heterosexual or homosexual, count as families? Would the six-year-old son of a victim be entitled to make arguments in connection with a negotiated guilty plea? 
   Okay, you may say, so murder is a problem. What about other crimes of violence? Let us take robbery. Let us say there is an armed robbery of a bank. A gun is pointed at a lot of people, tellers and customers. A security guard is shot and injured. The bank loses a lot of money. A pretty simple factual story, and one that I know, from my time as a prosecutor, happens all too often. 
   Pretend I am the prosecutor in this bank robbery. Tell me who are the victims I have to notify. The security guard? The 20 customers who were uninjured but had a gun pointed at them? The 10 bank tellers? The CEO of the bank? And while you are at it, tell me who gets the mandatory restitution--the bank that lost the money, the security guard who was injured, or the customers and tellers who were scared, or the teams of plaintiffs'--or, I guess, victims'--lawyers who are fighting out these questions. 
   And who gets to reopen the restitution hearings? Or the bail hearings? Feel free to assume that I am a competent prosecutor who can figure out some administrative details. But, if you are going to pass this amendment, do not pass the buck to me to decide who has constitutional rights and who does not. That is your job if you want to be a Framer of the Constitution; it is not the job of individual courts and prosecutors. 
   I have talked about two of the most infamous crimes of violence, murder and robbery. Other crimes, such as compound crimes under the federal RICO statute that can include lots of different criminal acts, some violent and some non-violent, over an extended period of years, will involve even harder problems when we try to identify who is and who is not a ``victim of a crime of violence.'' But we should also consider the most common form of violence that afflicts our society, domestic violence. 
   Here is a typical scenario. The police get a call from neighbors who hear shouting and screaming and pots and pans being thrown. They reach the house and find the husband and wife hysterically angry at one another and a young child cowering in the corner. It is not entirely clear who attacked whom, but the husband is injured and the police arrest the wife and charge her with assault. The wife's bail hearing comes up, or maybe there are plea negotiations. The wife claims it was self-defense; the husband claims she attacked him without provocation. 
   The wife claims she is a victim of a crime of domestic violence; so does the husband. Maybe the child is too. The proposed amendment leaves us with no clue whether a witness to violence who is psychologically but not physically injured by the violence has the new constitutional status of ``victim''. 
   Under current law, it is up to the jury to determine who is the victim and who is the criminal in this sad domestic scenario, and the jury makes that determination after hearing all the evidence from both sides at trial. Under the proposed amendment, that determination must be made before the wife's bail hearing or plea negotiation. If the husband can persuade the prosecutor that he is the victim, and not the instigator of the violence, he gets the special new constitutional rights of a crime victim at the bail and plea bargaining stage, before the wife has even had a chance to present her evidence to the jury that the husband is really the guilty party. 
   Or maybe the wife can insist on extra-judicial proceedings to contest the husband's status as a victim--although I do not know how you would squeeze in extra proceedings before bail or indictment hearings. 
   Assuming that the husband is the ``victim'' for purposes of our new constitutional amendment, what does that get him? Maybe he will push for bail or for a plea with a minimum sentence conditioned on his getting custody of the child, perhaps accompanied by a new kind of child support called ``restitution.'' 
   Or maybe the husband will be satisfied with his new constitutional right to notice of his wife's release from custody, which will help him track her down and exact revenge. 
   In some cases, the right end result may be reached. But the process that the proposed amendment seem to involve bypassing a trial on the merits and potentially bypassing family court. By creating pre-trial rights for an undefined category of victims, it requires someone--I guess the prosecutor--to decide who is the victim of a given crime, and who gets special constitutional rights before there has been a trial or even an indictment. 
   Deciding who has constitutional rights and who does not before there has been even an ex parte judicial proceeding is un-American. Doing so in a  case, like a domestic violence case, where there are likely to be self-defense issues, risks giving special constitutional rights to the criminal instead of the victim. 
   One more comment on this half-baked, undefined term ``victim of a crime of violence.'' Thus far, I have discussed the easy cases in terms of what constitutes a ``crime of violence''--murder, robbery, and assault. But there are a lot of hard cases, too. 
   Is drunk driving a crime of violence if the driver physically injures a pedestrian? What if the driver runs over the pedestrian's dog, or crashes into a parked car? Can the same offense be a crime of violence if someone is physically injured, but not otherwise? 
   What about elder abuse or child abuse? We have all heard heart-breaking stories of seniors and disabled people who have suffered horrible abuse and neglect at the hands of their so-called care-givers, and of children locked up in squalid conditions and subjected to appalling psychological abuse by their parents. 
   Neglect of the weak and vulnerable in our society by those who have taken the responsibility of being their care-givers can cause as much harm as almost any violence, without a hand ever being lifted against them. But are neglect and non-physical abuse ``violence''? What about the horrifying slavery case involving more than 50 Mexican immigrants in New York a few years ago? Is enslavement a crime of violence? And what about kidnapping? If a parent who has been denied legal custody of a child kidnaps the child, is that a crime of violence, and if so, who is the victim, the child, the custodial parent or both? 
   The words of the proposed amendment do not answer these questions. The majority report suggests answers, some of which seem to stretch the concept of a ``crime of violence'' to the breaking point. It suggests, for example, as possible crimes of violence burglary, driving while intoxicated, espionage, stalking, and the unlawful displaying of a firearm--very serious crimes, but crimes that usually do not involve ``violence'' in the normal sense of the word. 
   Last year, Senator HATCH criticized the proposed amendment's reliance on the term ``crime of violence'' as ``arbitrary.'' I can do no better than to quote his language:  
   I believe we must tread carefully when assigning constitutional rights on the arbitrary basis of whether the legislature has classified a particular crime as ``violent'' or ``non-violent.'' Consider, for example, the relative losses of two victims. First, consider the plight of an elderly woman who is victimized by a fraudulent investment scheme and loses her life's savings. Second, think of a college student who happens to take a punch during a bar fight which leaves him with a black eye for a couple of days. I do not believe it to be clear that one of these victims is more deserving of constitutional protection than the other. While such distinctions are commonly made in criminal statutes, the implications for placing such a disparity into the text of the Constitution are far greater.  
   It is interesting to note that in their additional views in this year's Committee report, Senators KYL and FEINSTEIN do not in any way disagree that the scope of their proposed amendment is arbitrary. Instead, they explain it as a political compromise. 
   I do not recall Madison and Jefferson saying at the constitutional convention that the provisions they drafted were not great, but politics are politics and you should not expect too much. I believe that we owe the American people something more than arbitrary political compromises when we amend their Constitution. 
   For anyone who shares Senator HATCH's and my concerns about the arbitrariness of focusing on ``crimes of violence,'' there is, by the way, a solution at hand. Vote against the proposed constitutional amendment and, instead, pass the Crime Victims Assistance Act, which provides strong and effective rights for all crime victims. 
   I have said a lot about the first, and most important, seven words of the proposed amendment; and I could identify many more problems. But let us sum up where we are so far. We are not sure whether the amendment applies at all to the most obvious ``crime of violence,'' murder, and we have no idea who gets the new constitutional rights for ``victims'' in a murder case if it does. In other fairly common crimes of violence such as robbery, the amendment appears to apply, but even assuming clear and simple facts, we are not sure which type of person affected by the crime gets to exercise the ``victim's'' rights, and the answer may well be a large number of people affected in vastly different ways--some physically, some emotionally, and some financially--who have vastly different views and interests. In what is probably the most common violent crime scenario, domestic violence, the amendment appears to require the prosecutor to decide who is the criminal and who is the victim as a constitutional matter, without the benefit of evidence at trial and without participation of judge or jury. And then we have what perhaps we should call ``borderline crimes,'' a wide range of crimes that may or may not be classified as crimes of violence. 
   On the ``of violence'' issue, Senator HATCH has raised troubling concerns that it is arbitrary as a matter of principle. I agree, and add the further concern that it is yet another huge point of uncertainty as to the meaning of this amendment. On this and other points, the answer of the amendment's supporters appears to be ``don't worry, someone else will figure this out later.'' 
   ``Don't worry, someone else will figure this out later.'' I think we can all agree that is not a principle that Congress should ever follow, especially not in the context of a constitutional amendment. Supporters of the amendment will no doubt contend that it is an unfair characterization of their position. Well, let us see what their amendment says. 
   The amendment seems quite candid in admitting that its central terms are yet to be defined. Section 1 says that the new constitutional rights created by the amendment go to ``A victim of a crime of violence, as these terms may be defined by law.'' I take it that ``these terms'' mean the two terms that we have identified as hopelessly vague: (1) ``victim'' and (2) ``crime of violence.'' 
   The phrase ``as these terms may be defined by law'' is a new one for the United States Constitution. There is a reason for this. Our Constitution was conceived as, and is, ``the supreme Law of the Land.'' 
   As Chief Justice John Marshall explained in Marbury versus Madison in 1803, our Constitution, as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court, is the law by which our other laws, State and Federal, are to be judged; it is not whatever our other laws, enacted by shifting political majorities from time to time, say it is. 
   Take, for example, the fourteenth amendment guarantee of equal protection of the laws. That does not mean equal protection ``as defined by law.'' If it did, the legislature and Governor of Arkansas might have been entitled to do what they did in 1957, when they ``defined'' the equal protection rights of public school students to be rights to a ``separate but equal,'' racially segregated education. But our Constitution has never worked that way, and in 1958, in Cooper versus Aaron, the Supreme Court rightly ruled that Arkansas' attempt to redefine the fourteenth amendment was unconstitutional, and desegregated Arkansas' schools. 
   Our Constitution has a provision, and a process, for defining new constitutional rights or for redefining existing constitutional rights. That provision, the amendment provision, is in Article V. Article V provides for two-thirds of the members of both Houses of Congress, plus three-fourths of the State legislatures, to amend the Constitution when ``necessary''. It does not provide for us to pass the buck to bare majorities in State legislatures or in a future Congress to define or redefine constitutional rights as we go along. 
   As a matter of principle, therefore, I believe that an ``as may be defined by law'' provision is an abdication of our duty, sitting as we do today as constitutional Framers, to provide clear constitutional standards against which other laws may be judged. In a constitutional democracy, the rule of law means that constitutional rights are to be found in the Constitution, not in ordinary statutes passed from time to time. 
   If we are going to pass the buck, we should at least be clear about who we are passing it to. Who gets to write the ``law'' that ``define[s]'' the critical terms of this constitutional amendment? This is yet another basic question that the amendment itself does  not answer. So I have studied the Committee report for an answer. 
   In a statement that must be profoundly troubling to those Senators who complain regularly about ``activist judges'' making law, the report first says that ``[t]he `law' which will define a `victim' (as well as `crime of violence') will come from the courts interpreting the elements of criminal statutes until definitional statutes are passed explicating the term.'' This, I suppose, is the ``don't worry, the courts will figure it out'' theory. Anyone who subscribes to this theory should be prepared to confirm the most activist judges this country has ever seen, because that is certainly the vaguest, blankest check that has ever been written to the judiciary. 
   The Committee report ``anticipates'' that judicial law-making under this constitutional amendment may be short-lived--that Congress and the State legislatures would quickly step in and enact ``definitional laws'' for purposes of their own criminal systems. 
   It is worth pausing for a moment to consider what this means. One of the main arguments that we have heard in support of this amendment is that we need to eliminate the current ``patchwork'' of victims' rights. 
   We are told we need this amendment because even though all 50 States provide rights for victims, the rights vary from State to State. A constitutional amendment that may be defined differently from State to State would not correct this situation --it would simply replace one patchwork with another. The superficially simple concept of basic baseline rights for victims will fracture into more than 50 different schemes of rights. I do not think that there is anything wrong with such diversity; indeed, I believe that the present system of defining crimes and the rights of crime victims and enforcing criminal justice primarily at the State level has served this country well throughout our history. But I do object to a shell game that dresses up rights defined by State law as Federal constitutional rights, thus trivializing the United States Constitution and casting doubt on the rights that it currently protects. 
   Finally, I should note that the ``as these terms may be defined by law'' provision is not the only delegation in this proposed amendment. Section 3 provides that ``The Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.'' In their additional views, Senators KYL and FEINSTEIN note that they originally proposed to give enforcement power to the States as well as to Congress, but then reached another of this amendment's political compromises. 
   I am, however, mystified as to what function the section 3 enforcement power could possibly serve. Similar provisions are contained in the fourteenth amendment and in the various amendments that protect voting rights. In the fourteenth and voting rights amendments, the Federal enforcement power against the States was justified by the long history of resistance of certain States to the Federal constitutional mandates for equal protection of law and equal voting rights. But there is no such history of State abuses with respect to victims' rights. In fact, many States provide more protections for crime victims than Federal law provides. 
   The majority report alleges no conflict between States and the Federal Government that would necessitate a Federal enforcement power. Rather, the reason given by the amendment's principal sponsors for putting victims' right in the Federal Constitution at all is that the States supposedly need Federal help to protect them effectively. They claim that:  
   States have had difficulty extending rights to victims of crime through State statutes and constitutional amendments precisely because courts are used to considering, first and foremost, Federal constitutional rights. By extending Federal rights to victims throughout the States, it will then become easier for State criminal justice systems to protect the rights of victims.  
   I frankly do not understand this explanation. If you want to empower State courts to take State statutes and constitutional amendments seriously, the last thing you do, I would think, is impose a complex new Federal mandate on them. If you want to help willing States protect victims, the last thing you do, I would think, is to place their criminal justice systems under congressional supervision and subject them to Federal enforcement through the Federal courts. 
   We are left, therefore, with an enforcement provision that mimics other amendments, but without any suggestion of the need to coerce recalcitrant States that justified such provisions elsewhere. Coercing the States here because we have done it before in other contexts is harmful to State sovereignty. And empowering Congress to enforce against the States constitutional rights which it is up to the States to define is likely to be futile. If the goal is, as asserted, to help the States protect victims' rights, we should not be piling new constitutional duties on the States; we should be providing assistance. Instead of threatening them with the stick of federal enforcement, I believe that we should offer the States the carrot of funding for the protection of victims' rights. If you agree with me, you should reject this amendment and, instead, support the Crime Victims Assistance Act. 
   Senators KYL and FEINSTEIN urge us not to make perfect the enemy of the good. If this amendment responded to an urgent need that could not be met by statute, and if it were well-drafted but imperfect, I would give that argument serious consideration. I have explained before why I believe the goals of this amendment are not merely adequately served, but better served, by statute. But I want to highlight briefly the other problem with this amendment. Not only is it not perfect; it is not well-drafted. In fact, it is remarkably sloppy. 
   I have just discussed the two major problems with the text of the amendment. Section 1 creates a complex scheme of new federal constitutional rights without saying with any clarity who is entitled to those rights, then says ``don't worry; someone, somewhere, in a court or in Congress or in the States, will make a law that will identify who gets these rights.'' Section 3 then empowers Congress to enforce those rights on behalf of these yet-to-be-identified people against the States, not because the States are unwilling to recognize those rights, but because Congress has been empowered to enforce other constitutional rights in the past, so ``why not here.'' 
   I do not want to skip section 2. Let me read you a sentence:  
   Nothing in this article shall provide grounds to stay or continue any trial, reopen any proceeding or invalidate any ruling, except with respect to conditional release or restitution or to provide rights guaranteed by this article in future proceedings, without staying or continuing a trial.  
   Let us call that ``the tax lawyer's provision,'' since it is so obscure that I think only someone who has spent half their life plumbing the depths of the tax code could understand it. It would certainly be the first triple negative in the United States Constitution. I think that ``Nothing in this article shall provide grounds to stay or continue any trial'' should be a sentence on its own, since I do not think that this rule ends up being subject to the exception, in light of the exception to the exception, but frankly I am not sure. 
   I am also puzzled by the exception that appears to allow victims to reopen proceedings or invalidate rulings ``to provide rights guaranteed by this article in future proceedings.'' If the concern is with future proceedings, I see no need for the exception to allow the reopening of present proceedings. But maybe I missed a turn somewhere in the drafters' maze. 
   Regardless of how it is ultimately interpreted, this intricate web of exceptions is not the stuff of a Constitution. One of the great virtues of our Constitution is that it speaks with a clear voice, articulating principles of justice that ordinary Americans can understand. The proposed amendment fails to meet that standard. 
   Finally, let me say a few words about section 5, which states that the new constitutional rights for victims shall apply ``in Federal and State proceedings, including military proceedings to the extent that the Congress may provide by law, juvenile justice proceedings, and proceedings in the District of Columbia and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States.'' This section is truly an enigma. No provision of the current Federal Constitution goes into detail about its geographic scope. There is a reason for that.  
   The purpose of the Bill of Rights, as envisioned by the Framers, was to provide a fundamental uniform platform of rights enjoyed by all people throughout the United States. Of course every provision of the Constitution applies throughout the United States. The fact that the drafters of this amendment felt the need to state that here suggests a fundamental confusion about the nature of the Federal Constitution, which is, by definition, the supreme law of the land. It was, perhaps, that same confusion that led them to provide for the key phrase of this federal constitutional amendment, ``a victim of a crime of violence,'' to be defined by a patchwork of State and Federal statutes. 
   A degree of uncertainty at the margins on questions of law and fact may be inevitable in legislation. But, despite the fact that it would be one of the longest-ever amendment to the Constitution, the half-baked proposal before the Senate is hopelessly vague on the basics. I do not know from looking at this amendment and listening to its supporters when it applies and who it applies to, or how that will be figured out. 
   Senator HATCH has made many of the same points about this proposed constitutional amendment. At our last Committee markup in September 1999, however, the distinguished Senator from Utah said that he intended to vote for this amendment, even though he has ``real questions'' about it, ``because of the hard work that has been put into it.'' I cannot go along with that reasoning. I commend the efforts of those who have worked on this amendment, as I commend the efforts of Federal and State legislators across the country who have worked to provide rights for victims of crime. 
   But ``A'' for effort is not good enough if it means subjecting the American people to a ``C''-grade Constitution. 
   As a Senator, I believe I have a constitutional duty not to inflict on the American people and our busy courts a new constitutional provision when I and they have no idea what it means in the most obvious type of case to which it theoretically might apply. And I have a constitutional duty as a Senator not to pass the buck to the courts by saying, ``Here's a new constitutional provision that no one understands. Go make something up.'' 
   When Madison, Jefferson and their compatriots wrote the original Constitution, they did not settle for ``don't worry, someone else will figure this out later.'' Nor should we. 
   I ask unanimous consent to include in the RECORD, a letter to me from the NAACP dated April 10, 2000, opposing the proposed constitutional amendment, and a letter to Senators LOTT and DASCHLE dated April 19, 2000, from over 300 law professors opposing the proposed amendment as unnecessary and dangerous.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to do what I have done several times on the floor this week, and that is to thank my good friend and colleague, the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. He is to all our colleagues not only a dear friend but a great mentor. As I have said--and I realize I repeat myself--I have learned so much history not only this week but in the 25 years I have served with him. 
   Senator BYRD was one of the very first Senators I met after I was elected to the Senate. We chatted at a dinner, in Boston, which he will recall, at the residence of the then-mayor of Boston--he and I and a classmate of mine from law school, John Durkin. John and I had both graduated from law school 10 years before, and probably of hubris, chutzpah, or foolishness, we  were both running for the Senate--10 years later, in 1974. We met with Senator BYRD at that time. 
   I began my practice of keeping a journal. I recently went back to read it. The Senator from West Virginia told of his childhood--not being one born with a silver spoon in his mouth. There probably wasn't a silver spoon in the house. He told me what he had done--self-taught, went on to school, learned more, and learned history as few men in this country ever have. But then he had the opportunity not only to learn history but to live history, as he has done day after day after day for over 40 years in the Congress of the United States, in both bodies. 
   I wrote down some of the things he said that night. I even wrote down the music we heard that evening. 
   When I came to the Senate as a 34-year-old--I was going to say ``former prosecutor'' but the first time I met him was before I was sworn in. I was still a prosecutor. I recall meeting with him during the lame duck session. I don't want to embarrass my good friend from West Virginia, because he met so many young Senators. But I remember so well that it was a lame duck session. 
   I sat in the reception room and Senator BYRD came out. I started to reintroduce myself--after all, he meets so many--and he immediately referred to having met me and Senator-elect Durkin. He had absolute, total recall of that time. 
   I think about this because recently in an unpleasant and unfortunate constitutionally necessary event in this body a year ago when all 100 Members of the Senate sat at the impeachment trial. I recall a member of the other body made disparaging remarks about the Senate and that the House Managers would have to simplify things so we Senators could understand it. He came over to introduce himself to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. I was sitting here. 
   He said: Senator BYRD, I may have somewhat overstated that. 
   Senator BYRD looked at him and said: I want you to understand two things: I pay close attention and I have a long memory. 
   I repeated that to my oldest son and he said: Dad, Senator BYRD's right on both accounts. 
   I know that long memory and we benefit by it. 
   I was thinking today when I came to work how fortunate I am. I have said many times on the floor of the Senate, we serve at the wishes of our State, but service is a privilege. Every time I come to the Capitol I feel privileged. I have felt no more privileged in my 25 years than in the past few days in this debate on the constitutional amendment. We can not debate anything more significant on this floor, anything that will affect history, long after we have gone. Some day, all 100 Senators who now serve will be gone and others will take our place. I hope they revere the Constitution, too. 
   I have not enjoyed any debate more than I have the past few days, partly because of my friend from West Virginia. We stood on many battles together on constitutional amendments. The Senator mentioned the balanced budget. I am sure we could go to West Virginia, Vermont, or anywhere else and take a poll on whether voters want a balanced budget amendment to balance the budget and, resoundingly, yes would be the answer. Senator BYRD, myself, and others had to go back and explain to the people of our States: You have trusted us with this vote. If we pander to you on this, we misplace your trust. We have to do it the right way. 
   We have a dear friend, a former colleague, a man for whom we both have respect and great affection, the distinguished former Senator from Oregon, Mark Hatfield. He and the Senator from West Virginia have served alternately as chairman and ranking member and then as ranking member and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. I have quoted Senator Hatfield on this floor, and I believe my friend from West Virginia remembers very well that balanced budget vote under enormous pressure on the Senator from Oregon, especially when he knew it would be a 1-vote margin. He said he would vote to protect the Constitution and do what was right. Both the Senator from West Virginia and I complimented him afterwards. I remember the steadfastness of Senator Hatfield. 
   That is what we have to do on this floor. We have stood together on very difficult treaty matters. We have stood side by side casting votes that at the time were unpopular. History has proven us right. 
   The Senator from West Virginia has cast well over 15,000 votes; I became the 21st person to cast 10,000 votes, so I have a long way to catch up. We can all go back and find votes we might do differently today. But if it is a statute, if it is an amendment, if it is a procedural motion we usually get a chance to vote on it again. 
   If it is a budget matter, whatever the issue might be, it is going to come up again and again. Use your experience to make sure you do it right--maybe modify it, maybe change it, maybe repeal it, maybe add to it. There is one exception--a constitutional amendment. Write a constitutional amendment. If that is then 
   ratified, if that goes into effect, we do not come back and change it. 
   Look at the example the distinguished Senator from West Virginia mentioned about prohibition, a bad mistake in the Constitution. A lot happened. Finally it was changed, but only after a great battle. 
   That is why we should always hesitate. That is why the dean of our party, the No. 1 in seniority in our party, has opposed this proposed constitutional amendment. From one who is No. 6 in seniority to the Senator who is No. 1, I applaud what the Senator has done. 
   This is not a party issue. The Senator from West Virginia knows we have had Senators from both sides of the aisle, even some who were cosponsors, say, ``You are right, let's back up.'' This proposed amendment will be withdrawn some time today. I hope the United States has learned the Constitution is not something to treat in a cavalier fashion. 
   I thank my friend from West Virginia.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in my capacity as ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I also think it is necessary, as we wind down this debate, that I take care of a couple of misconceptions that occurred during the debate. 
   My late father, a man who had so much to do with shaping my views, a man who was a self-taught historian--a very good one, I might say--always told me if somebody misstates history, it is wise that someone else stands up and states it correctly so the mistake does not go down to the next generation. 
   There was a popular misconception behind the proposed constitutional amendment. The distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, touched on this on the first day of the debate, and actually again today, when she discussed her theory as to why victims are not specifically mentioned in either the original Constitution or the Bill of Rights.  
   According to Senator FEINSTEIN, when the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were written in the late 18th century, public prosecutors did not exist. I should quote exactly what the distinguished Senator, my good friend, told us on this point. She said:  
   When the Constitution was written, in America in the late 18th century and well into the 19th century, public prosecutors did not exist. Victims could, and did, commence criminal trials themselves by hiring a sheriff to arrest the defendant, initiating a private prosecution. The core rights of our amendment to notice, to attend, to be heard were inherently made available to a victim of a violent crime.  
   She then quotes the following passage from an article by Juan Cardenas, in the ``Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy'':  
   At trial, generally, there were no lawyers for either the prosecution or the defense. Victims of crime simply acted as their own counsel, although wealthier crime victims often hired a prosecutor.  
   She then continued:  
   Gradually, public prosecution replaced the system of private prosecution........[T]his began to happen in the mid 19th century, around 1850, when the concept of the public prosecutor was developed in this country for the first time.  
   She then argued the Constitution must now be amended to rebalance the criminal justice system and ``restore'' rights to crime victims. 
   The distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, also my friend, Senator HATCH, told us on Tuesday that he draws the same conclusion from history. He said that when the Constitution was drafted:  
   There was no such thing as a public prosecutor; victims brought cases against their attackers.  
   He then said:  
   When the Constitution was drafted, victims of crime were protected by the same rights given to any party to litigation.  
   Not surprisingly, the majority views in the report of the Senate Judiciary Committee are likewise predicated on the notion of ``restoring''--``restoring'' rights to crime victims that they enjoyed at the time the Constitution and Bill of Rights were being ratified. The majority views said the following:  
   The Crime Victims' Rights Constitutional Amendment is intended to restore and preserve, as a matter of right for the victims of violent crimes, the practice of victim participation in the administration of criminal justice that was the birthright of every American at the founding of our Nation. 
   At the birth of this Republic, victims could participate in the criminal justice process by initiating their own private prosecutions. It was decades after the ratification of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights that the offices of the public police and the public prosecutor would be instituted.......''  
   When I heard my distinguished colleague say there was no such thing as a public prosecutor in this country when the Constitution was drafted, I was surprised. I had been a public prosecutor. I was the vice president of the National District Attorneys Association at the time I was elected to the Senate. The fact is that, had I not opted for the anonymity of the Senate, I was next in line to become president of that association, one of my few regrets in having to leave to come here, but the Senate would not wait. And, frankly, I did not want to wait. 
   But as a former public prosecutor and one who studied a great deal of history of prosecution, I was quizzical. So I did a little research. 
   I might say, when I state that, you understand, of course, we Senators are often times but constitutional impediments to our staff. But, by the same token they deserve a lot of credit, Julie Katzman, in my office, an able lawyer, did a lot of research as did Bruce Cohen from the Judiciary Committee. They found this article by Mr. Cardenas that Senator FEINSTEIN quoted, which does appear in volume 9 in the ``Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy.'' In fact, if you take the passage the distinguished Senator from California quoted and relied upon, from page 367, about how victims of crime used to act as their own counsel, it is describing the general practice in this country in the 17th century, not in the late 18th century when the Constitution was written. 
   Mr. Cardenas discusses what happened at the time of the American Revolution on page 371, a few pages after the passage quoted by the sponsor of this proposed constitutional amendment. He writes:  
   Whatever its derivation, the American system of public prosecution was fairly well established at the time of the American Revolution.  
   Mr. Cardenas notes that Connecticut was the first colony to establish a system of public prosecutors, in 1704, over 80 years before the Constitution was written. 
   In Vermont, the Office of the State's Attorney is established in chapter II, section 50 of the State constitution of 1793. Even before Vermont joined the Union as the 14th State, it had a system of public prosecutions run by the State's Attorneys. Samuel Hitchcock was State's Attorney for Chittenden County, VT, from 1787 to 1790, during the time that the Federal Constitution and the Bill of Rights were being written. Samuel Hitchcock was State's Attorney in Chittenden County, from 1787 to 1790, some time before I became State's Attorney, in the last century--or, this century, depending upon how we do this. In May of 1966, until 11:59 in the morning on January 3 of 1975, I served as State's Attorney, also, of Chittenden County. At 12 noon, January 3, I took a different job. I have held it ever since. 
   Now, private prosecutions may not have been eliminated in all the colonies by the time the Constitution was written. They were, however, eliminated in Virginia, home of some of the foremost architects of the Constitution. Mr. Cardenas writes:  
   [B]y 1711, the attorney general [of Virginia] appointed deputies to each county in the state, and these deputies began exercising their authority to prosecute not only in important cases, but in routine ones as well. ..... By 1789, the deputy attorney general had complete control over all prosecutions within his county.  
   There was a place that had the sort of criminal justice system that the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and others attributed to the time the U.S. Constitution was written, but that place was not the United States. Mr. Cardenas describes it on page 360 of his article:  
   The right of any crime victim to initiate and conduct criminal proceedings with the paradigm of prosecution in England all the way up to the middle of the 19th century.  
   It was England that had a system of private prosecution in the 18th and 19th centuries, not the United States, not even New England in the United States. 
   To make sure I had my facts straight, I had to look through some other historical source material. I looked at an essay in volume 3 of the ``Encyclopedia of Crime and Justice'' by Professor Abraham S. Goldstein on the history of the public prosecutor in America. Professor Goldstein tells us essentially the same thing as Mr. Cardenas. 
   Most American colonies followed the English model of private prosecutions in the 17th century, but as Professor Goldstein tells us, that system ``proved even more poorly suited to the needs of the new society than to the older one.'' For one thing, victims abused the system by initiating prosecutions to exert pressure for financial reparation. These colonies shifted to a system of public prosecutions because they viewed the system of private prosecutions as ``inefficient, elitist, and sometimes vindictive.'' 
   According to Professor Goldstein, some of the colonies have no history at all in private prosecutions. In the areas settled by the Dutch in the 17th century, consisting of parts of what are now Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, the Dutch brought public prosecutions with them. 
   In any event, Professor Goldstein comes to the same conclusions as Mr. Cardenas. On page 1287, he writes:  
   [B]y the time of the American Revolution, each colony had established some form of public prosecution and had organized it on a local basis. In many instances, a dual pattern was established within the same geographical area, by county attorneys for violations of state law and by town prosecutors for ordinance violations. This pattern was carried over into the states as they became part of the new nation.  
   Actually, for almost 200 years that was the system in my own State of Vermont. Now prosecutions are done by the State's Attorneys of the 14 counties and, in some instances, by the Attorney General. 
   Professor Goldstein goes on to discuss the fact that the Federal system of prosecution was always a system of public prosecution. Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, enacted the same year  the Constitution was ratified, the U.S. Attorney General was ``to prosecute and conduct all suits within the Supreme Court of the United States in which the United States might be concerned.'' The general authority to ``prosecute in each district'' for Federal crimes was vested in local U.S. district attorneys appointed by the President. 
   Professor Goldstein is a highly respected scholar. He is the Sterling Professor of Law at Yale Law School. In fact, at one time he was the dean of that prestigious institution. He is widely regarded as an authority on criminal law and criminal procedure. When Professor Goldstein says every American colony had established some form of public prosecution by the time of the Revolution, I think we Senators can probably take that to the bank. 
   To be on the safe side, since we heard Senators say otherwise about this, I thought we should check further. We checked another source, a 1995 article by Professor Randolph Jonakait of the New York Law School. It appears in volume 27 of the Rutgers Law Journal beginning on page 77. Not surprisingly, it says much of the same thing about the history of public prosecutions as I had 
   already learned from Mr. Cardenas and Professor Goldstein.  
   I quote from page 99:  
   Although the American colonies initially followed the English prosecutorial pattern, a different process began to emerge around 1700. Public officials took responsibility for the prosecution of crimes generally or just for the limited set of offenses that directly affected the sovereign. As public prosecutors emerged, private prosecutions in the colonies disappeared. This evolution of the American criminal justice system was quick and thorough. By the time of the Revolution, public prosecution in America was standard, and private prosecution, in effect, was gone. Indeed, it was so established and taken for granted at the inception of the new Federal Republic that public prosecutors, although not mentioned in the Constitution, were, without debate, granted exclusive control over prosecutions in Federal courts.  
   Mr. Cardenas, Professor Goldstein, and Professor Jonakait are all quite clear that the concept of government-paid public prosecutors did not develop in this country for the first time ``around 1850,'' as the Senate was mistakenly told on Tuesday. All these authorities agree that public prosecutors have been around in this country for much longer--about 150 years longer--and that they were the rule, not the exception, by the time Mr. Madison and Mr. Hamilton and all the other framers of our Constitution got together in Philadelphia in 1787 to draft our Nation's founding charter. 
   If the Bill of Rights, which was written a few years later, makes no specific mention of crime victims, it is not because the framers thought victims were protected by a system of private prosecutions. 
   My point, of course, is the proposed constitutional amendment on victims' rights cannot be justified as ``restoring'' victims' rights enjoyed at the time the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were drafted. Rather, if we are to draw any lesson from history, it is that the framers believed victims were best protected by the system of public prosecutions that was then, and remains, the American standard for achieving justice. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a letter dated April 25 from Assistant Attorney General Robert Raben opposing the proposed constitutional amendment.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have said over and over that no one in the Senate is against crime victims. I care deeply about the rights of crime victims, just as I care about the rights of all Americans. 
   I established one of the first formal systems in my State to make sure crime victims are heard. It is something that is done all the time now. In fact, one of the distinguished family court judges, Judge Amy Davenport, was in town yesterday and listened to part of this debate. She said: There is nothing you talked about here that we just don't do automatically. In Vermont, we do not need a constitutional amendment to do it. 
   We all care about the rights of crime victims. This is not a case of for or against amending the Constitution. We establish whether we care about crime victims. We all do. I care about their rights. I also care about the rights of mothers and expectant mothers, the rights of immigrants, the rights of workers, the rights of farmers, the rights of hospital patients, the rights of the young, the rights of the old, the rights of people seeking housing, the rights of students, the rights of artists, journalists, and scientists, the rights of those people who care about the environment, and the rights of families. 
   I do not know anybody in this body, Democrat or Republican, who does not care about the rights of all these people. 
   We all care about the rights of all law-abiding Americans. We could easily pass unanimous resolutions to that effect. But Americans want practical solutions to practical problems from their Government, not just expressions of concern. They certainly do not want us to try to define every one of these rights in a separate constitutional amendment. 
   So the issue is not whether we care about the rights of crime victims. I point out that a couple weeks ago my dear friend Senator FEINGOLD voted against a constitutional amendment to limit campaign contributions. Anyone who would infer from that vote that Senator FEINGOLD is not passionate about campaign finance reform knows nothing about Senator FEINGOLD and his attitude about campaign finance reform. In all the years I have been here, I have never seen anybody as passionate about it as he. 
   Recently we voted on a constitutional amendment to criminalize physical destruction of the American flag. Senators BOB KERREY, ROBERT BYRD, MITCH MCCONNELL, BOB BENNETT, DANIEL INOUYE, DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN, and many others voted against that constitutional amendment. Many of them are decorated war veterans. BOB KERREY, for example, is the only Member of this body to hold the Congressional Medal of Honor. The vote did not mean they do not respect the flag. 
   When Gen. Colin Powell and Senator John Glenn opposed the flag amendment, it was not because they lack devotion to this country. Anybody would be hard pressed to find two people more patriotic than they. Far from it, they are American heroes who showed their patriotism by standing up for the Bill of Rights. Frankly, that is ultimate patriotism. 
   There have been studies over time in which people are asked about different parts of our Bill of Rights that we all rely upon, and the study would say: Would you vote for the right of free speech today, the right of assembly, or some of these others? People say: Yes, all except this or all except that. Thank goodness people had the courage to write and vote for it earlier. Our country has it. And then others made sure we did not go back and change it because we might have some problems. 
   In my years in public life, I cannot think of more times that devotion to the first amendment has been tested or that any area in the Constitution has been tested more than the first amendment. We do not need the first amendment to protect popular speech; we need it to protect unpopular speech.  That really is the crux of why we should care about amending our Constitution and carving exceptions or making changes in our Constitution. 
   We had a Member of Congress in Vermont who was prosecuted under the Alien and Sedition Act in a way that we all know would be highly unconstitutional. Why? Because he criticized the Federal Government. They locked him up. You know what? This is why I love my native State of Vermont: We do not let other people tell us what to think. While he was locked up, what did we do? We reelected him and sent him right back down to Congress. And the shame was on those who supported the Alien and Sedition Act, they were soon gone. 
   It was a Vermonter, I think the most outstanding Vermont U.S. Senator of the 20th century, who stood on the floor of this body--a quintessential conservative--Republican Ralph Flanders of Vermont, who introduced a motion of censure against Joseph McCarthy, the late Senator from Wisconsin. Joseph McCarthy ran roughshod for too long over the first amendment of the United States, and lives and careers were ruined because of his accusations. Ralph Flanders stood up and called a halt to that. Then other Senators came forward and joined with him. That reign was over. 
   I would say to anyone who visits the United States, from whatever country, if you want to guarantee a democracy, guarantee two things: Guarantee the freedom of speech, including the freedom 
   to say things that might be unpopular at the moment because you may find within a few years they will be the popular ones; and, secondly, guarantee the right to practice any religion you want, or none, if you want. Because if you protect those two rights, you protect diversity. If you protect diversity in your country, you protect democracy. 
   I say that those who have opposed this constitutional amendment are not doing it because they lack concern for victims' rights. Decent and sincere people in both parties who serve in this Chamber respect victims' rights, but many of us oppose this amendment. I support crime victims' rights. I do not support a victims' rights constitutional amendment. 
   The issue before the Senate is whether to amend the U.S. Constitution--and almost double the length of the entire Bill of Rights--by adding a complex listing of constitutional victims' rights and limitations that may diminish the Constitution and do little to protect victims. It is not like passing a commemorative resolution. 
   Do we have to pass constitutional amendments to prove we care about people? We care about victims, but we also care about mothers, immigrants, workers, farmers, hospital patients, the young, the old, artists, journalists, scientists, nature lovers, and families. 
   We have heard complaints in this Chamber more than a few times about ``group entitlements.'' We are not going to have a constitutional amendment for every group. 
   Stuart Taylor recently wrote in the National Journal about this amendment. He wrote:  
   Most of us agree, of course, that prosecutors and judges should be nice to crime victims (as they usually are). Most of us also agree that parents should be nice to their children. But would we adopt a constitutional amendment declaring, ``Parents shall be nice to their children''? Or ``Parents shall give their children reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard before deciding whether and how to punish older children who have pushed them around''? Would we leave it to the courts to define the meaning of terms like ``reasonable'' and ``nice''? 
   A ban on spanking, perhaps? A minimum of one candy bar per day? Would we let the courts override all state and federal laws that conflict with their interpretations? 
   We don't need constitutional amendments to embody our broad agreement on such general principles. And we should leave it to the states (and Congress) to detail rules for applying such principles to the messy realities of life.  
   There is no precedent in a national constitution for a victims' rights amendment. But there is precedent for treating constitutional provisions as group entitlements. For most of the 20th century, there was a nation that rejoiced in criticizing America for not caring about the rights of various groups of law-abiding people because we did not have such provisions in our Constitution. That nation had special constitutional provisions for mothers, immigrants, workers, farmers, hospital patients, the young, the old, artists, journalists, scientists, nature lovers, and families. 
   I would have brought a copy of its 1977 constitution along with me today if I could carry it. But some of our visitors today know that country is no longer here, the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 
   Back then, I felt confident that Mr. Madison and his compatriots had done a better job of drafting a Constitution than Mr. Lenin, Mr. Stalin, or Mr. Brezhnev, and I am no less proud to be an American today. Madison, Jefferson, Washington, and the other founders understood three key lessons other countries are only learning now, 200 years later. 
   First, in a democracy, it is better to have a short constitution everyone can read and understand rather than a long one full of symbolic declarations, legalese, and procedural details. I hold the Constitution, including the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence in this little booklet. 
   The distinguished senior Senator from New York mentioned a country we all respect, a democracy, France, which amended its Constitution so many times to fit in every single little thing they could possibly think of so that, as the story goes, in the libraries they do not file it under ``constitution,'' they file it under ``periodicals.'' Well, I do not want that to be the U.S. Constitution. 
   Secondly, in a free society, the purpose of a constitution is to constrain the government, to establish a government of limited powers, with the rest of the powers to the people, not a government of expanding responsibilities. Jefferson and Madison trusted to the States and the American people to care for the rights of victims of crime and of other misfortunes by means of the democratic process and by using the tool at hand to solve problems as they arose. They did not mandate a set of procedures for relief of every problem by calling them rights and then tacking them on to the Constitution. Instead, they reserved the Constitution for the protection of the people from the government itself. 
   Thirdly, in a nation of ordinary practical people, what is needed are practical responses to practical problems, not symbols of concern that at the end of the day are empty. Madison and Jefferson designed the original Bill of Rights to respond to actual government abuses such as suppression of unpopular speech or unpopular religion or unpopular newspapers, that the States and the Federal Government could not be otherwise trusted to remedy in the normal course of events. 
   Likewise, the Reconstruction Amendments did not enact a long litany of procedural rights without substance. Instead, they responded to a real, practical history of abuse by State governments of the rights of African-Americans. Even then our Nation was shamefully slow in implementing the anti-slavery amendments. 
   The proposed amendment under consideration is fundamentally misconceived. It would be the most procedurally complex provision of the entire Constitution, within just a few words of doubling the length of the entire Bill of Rights. Every school child, every senior citizen, every American can pick up this Constitution and read it and understand it. That is the beauty of it. That is the strength of it. That is why a quarter of a billion people live in such freedom. 
   We have referred to the last American precedent for a constitutional amendment to increase the power of government over law-abiding citizens. That was prohibition. It was well intentioned but, my word, what a disaster. It ended up staining the reputation of Senator Volstead and others who championed its cause. It was so ill suited to the framework of our Constitution that it bears the distinction of being the only constitutional amendment that had to be repealed. 
   I still remember the stories I was told as a child, many in Vermont, of good, upright citizens who prospered greatly during prohibition, perhaps because of the fortuitous aspect of our geographical location bordering on Canada. 
   If I could digress for a moment, we have a large lake in the northern part of Vermont, Lake Memphremagog. My wife was born on 
   the shores of Lake Memphremagog, as she quickly points out, on the Vermont side. Her parents,  of French Canadian descent moved there to take up life as new American citizens. She became a first-generation American. 
   Lake Memphremagog is a magnificent lake that is half in Vermont and half in Canada. During prohibition time, some of the farmers who had little farms, one or two cows and a falling down barn along the lake, had very expensive Chris-Craft speedboats. I mention this because the local Customs official had a slower boat with an outboard motor. Every evening about dusk, these farmers would go out with their high-powered speed boats and they would have their fishing rod and a couple worms and they would head out across the lake toward Canada to go fishing, their speedboats riding high. 
   About 2 o'clock in the morning, you would hear this awful roar across the lake as several of these came back, obviously the ``fishing'' having been very successful because the boats are now riding much, much lower. You can imagine the chagrin of the poor Customs agent who had to try to fulfill the prohibition provision of the Constitution, as he wondered which one of these fishing boats he should try to intercept, knowing he could not intercept any of them because he could not catch them. 
   Whether it was because of the ``fishing'' or not, for at least a generation thereafter, the two most popular brands of alcohol in Vermont were the two that are also the most popular in the Province of Quebec, right across the lake. 
   As I said, I digress. But prohibition caused such a disrespect for the law. It really made us look foolish, but it took forever to change it because it was in the Constitution. If we made the mistake of doing it as a statute, we could have amended it. We could have changed it within a year. Everybody knew it was not working. Everybody knew it was increasing the power of organized crime. Everybody knew it was bringing about corruption and bribery and everything else. But worse than that, a democracy can enforce its laws only if people respect the laws. A democracy can work only if we know that these laws are fair and these laws are just. 
   We do not have a police officer in everybody's house. We do not have a police officer on every corner. We expect people to obey the laws. But if they have no respect for them, then they do not. In all the years it took to repeal this, for over a decade, the laws in this country and the people's respect for the laws of this country diminished every single year. Nobody could do anything about it because it takes so long to repeal a constitutional amendment. 
   So let us look at statutes when we can. Let us think of article V of the Constitution, which says you amend only when necessary. 
   Last, but by no means least, the proposed amendment is not a practical response to a practical problem. Many States are ahead of the Federal Government in protecting victims' rights. Recent years have seen huge advances in protection of victims' rights in State constitutions and State legislation, in the provision of restitution or other compensation where practical, and in improvement of law enforcement resources and techniques to ensure proper regard for victims. 
   While Congress has been focusing its attention on more than 60 drafts of a constitutional amendment on victims' rights, it has actually slowed us down from doing real improvement to the way crime victims are treated in Federal courts and by Federal prosecutors. Our legislative achievements of the period from 1994 through 1997 have not been matched in the last several years. I fear this debate on the proposed constitutional amendment will be in lieu of consideration of scores of significant legislative proposals introduced by Senators on both sides of the aisle to help victims. 
   Violent crime is a serious practical problem in our society--far more than it was even when I was a prosecutor. As a parent, as a grandparent, that troubles me greatly. But there is not a fundamental problem--certainly not one requiring a rigid, one-size-fits-all set of constitutionally mandated procedures--in how the States treat victims of violent crimes today. 
   We have visitors in the gallery today from Russia, the successor to the former Soviet Union. The old Soviet Constitution demanded the obedience of Russians. It really was not very subtle about it. Article 59 declared that every citizen was ``obliged to observe the Constitution and comply with the standards of socialist conduct.'' 
   Well, the U.S. Constitution does not command; instead, it counsels humility. It is humbling to consider the great minds that drafted it, its clarity and simplicity in laying down a framework to protect law-abiding people by ensuring limited, democratic government. It is also humbling to think how it has stood the test of time. It remains extraordinary what was achieved in 4 short months in Philadelphia in 1787, when communication meant walking from one building to another to talk to somebody, or sending a letter by horseback. In 4 short months, look at what they wrote. 
   By contrast, we have been waiting twice that long for the House-Senate conference on the juvenile crime legislation to meet and complete its work--something that could really help victims of crime in this country, something that could be done now and something that could be sent down to the President and signed into law and it would be the law of the land immediately. But we do not meet because the gun lobby said do not meet. 
   We ought to be very slow in this Chamber to presume that we know better than the founders how to balance the power of government and the rights of the accused. We should be reluctant to presume that we can draft a one-size-fits-all set of detailed procedural rules that will work to protect different people who are victims of different crimes in cases in different States--the kind of constitutional micromanagement of the judicial process the framers were too wise to attempt. These 400-odd words of the 63rd draft of this proposed amendment do not fit with the size and style, the limited Government vision, or the practical approach of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. 
   I hope when we finish this debate all Senators will join in efforts to improve victims' rights through the States and through Federal legislation. 
   I see the distinguished Senator from Delaware on the floor. As chairman and as the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator BIDEN has worked very hard on legislation to help victims of all kinds of crime. The distinguished Senator from Delaware has helped write laws that can take effect and have money and teeth in them to help victims. I have done some, as have others. Usually, we join in bipartisan efforts to do it. But they have been pieces of legislation that, once signed into law, we could watch. We could see if they were working, and if they did, fine, we could expand them and give them more money. If they did not work, we could change them. We cannot do that with a constitutional amendment. 
   I ask those who are for victims' rights to support congressional action on S. 934, the Crime Victims Assistance Act. 
   Mr. President, we have editorials in opposition to this constitutional amendment from the Asheville Citizen-Times, the Baltimore Sun, the Chicago Tribune, the Herald, the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the San Francisco Chronicle, the San Francisco Examiner, the San Jose Mercury News, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, the St. Petersburg Times, the Washington Times, the Collegiate Times, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; and the South Bend Tribune.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have so much respect and affection for two key sponsors, Senator KYL of Arizona and Senator FEINSTEIN of California. They, as the other 98 Senators of both parties, care deeply about the rights of victims. Anybody who has seen some of the violent crimes in this country could not feel otherwise. A great, powerful, wealthy nation ought to care about the victims of child abuse, or fraud, and victims of all crime. That is not the issue. The issue, I say to my friends, is the legacy we leave to the next generation. So much of that legacy as Senators is what is in the Constitution. 
   We will not vote on anything more important than constitutional amendments, unless it is a declaration of war. There have been thousands of votes I have cast, and many that I can remember were inconsequential. Virtually all of them were on issues on which, if we did not like the results we could come back and revisit it the next Congress and change it. You cannot do that with a constitutional amendment. You do it with practical, pragmatic legislation that actually helps people--legislation that the Senator from Delaware has passed, legislation that I have passed, legislation that Senators on both sides of the aisle have passed, including Senators NICKLES, DEWINE, and others. I do not mean to exclude other people who have joined in on real legislation that really works for victims. 
   Mr. President, how much time is still available to the Senator from Vermont?

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I do not want to conclude this debate without, again, acknowledging the commitment to crime victims of the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from California. I know that they are sincere in their support for crime victims. I compliment them as well for the manner in which they have conducted themselves throughout this debate and throughout the Judiciary Committee's work on this matter. I view them not as opponents but as allies in our mutual efforts to assist crime victims. 
   I also want to acknowledge the extraordinary efforts of the senior Senator from West Virginia and the thoughtful guidance of the Democratic Leader. Senators DORGAN, DURBIN, SCHUMER, DODD, MOYNIHAN, FEINGOLD, MURRAY, THOMPSON, WELLSTONE, LEVIN, and BINGAMAN each contributed greatly to the debate. 
   I thank Senators from both sides of the aisle--Senators who supported preserving the Constitution and those who supported the proposed constitutional amendment. I commend the Senate for doing its duty and upholding the Constitution and Bill of Rights. 
   I would also like to thank Rachel King and her colleagues at the ACLU; Sue Osthoff, Director of the National Clearinghouse for the Defense of Battered Women; John Albert, Public Policy Director of Victims Services; Donna Edwards, Director of the National Network to End Domestic Violence; Renny Cushing, Director of Murder Victims' Families for Reconciliation; Arwen Bird; Scott Wallace; Beth Wilkinson; Emmet Welch; and Professor Lynne Henderson. As always, I thank my staff, as well as the hard-working staff of our distinguished Democratic Leader. 
   Finally, my special thanks to Professor Robert Mosteller of the Duke Law School, who has given so generously of his time, over many years, to many of us on the Judiciary Committee and in the Senate. Professor Mosteller is a leading scholar in this field, and his expertise and counsel have been invaluable.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, May 6th marks the 75th birthday of Dr. William Sloane Coffin. Protestants for the Common Good is celebrating that day with a tribute to Dr. Coffin in Chicago, and I want to take a moment to call the Senate's attention to the life of this remarkable man. 
   I should begin by mentioning that since his retirement, Bill has lived in Vermont, and I am proud to represent a man whose dedication to peace, the environment, and social justice I have long admired. 
   William Sloane Coffin first came to the world's attention during the 18 years he served as the Chaplain of Yale University. As an outspoken and courageous supporter of civil rights and a founder of Clergy and Laity Concerned for Vietnam, he often sacrificed his own safety to ensure and protect the rights of others. He protested against segregation laws in the South, and with Dr. Benjamin Spock against the war in Vietnam. Anyone who was fortunate to hear him speak on these great moral issues of our time remembers his tremendous eloquence, passion and conviction. What many people may not know is that he also served his country as an infantry officer in Europe during the Second World War. 
   From New Haven, Dr. Coffin moved to New York City where he became the Senior Minister at Manhattan's Riverside Church. His soaring oratory inspired people from all walks of life. 
   Regularly challenging those who attended his services to seek justice in their own lives, Dr. Coffin set an example by consistently doing so himself. He founded the Church's well-known disarmament program, traveled throughout the world promoting peace and respect for human rights, and remains the President Emeritus of ``SANE/FREEZE: Campaign for Global Security.'' 
   Mr. President, I have been fortunate not only to know of William Sloane  Coffin but to know him personally. He has had an extraordinary impact on his community, his state, his country, and the world. His conscience is like a beacon, which challenges and guides us all. 
   Not long ago, I celebrated my 60th birthday. I hope that 15 years from now I will be able to look back at my own life, and look forward to the days ahead, with the sense of accomplishment, pride, and commitment to equality, justice and peace that William Sloane Coffin should feel on the occasion of his 75th birthday. 
   Happy birthday my friend.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I do not want to interrupt the discussion of the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from California. I am just curious, so we can have some idea of where we might be; yesterday, we had a problem. I understand the two proponents were out negotiating a new draft of this. But we had a situation where there were few on the floor. 
   I know the two proponents of this amendment, although they are on opposite sides from me, would agree that a constitutional amendment is far too consequential to be some kind of place holder on the Senate schedule. We have a number of Senators who will want to speak. They have asked me to speak. We have the distinguished dean of our party, my friend, the senior Senator from West Virginia, who will want to speak. We have had others who have. 
   I am just curious if the two Senators have some concept of where we may be on the schedule.

   Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I wish to start by acknowledging the outstanding statements that were made during the course of yesterday's debate. Senators DORGAN, FEINGOLD, SCHUMER, DURBIN, MOYNIHAN, and THOMPSON each made a significant contribution to this debate. I thank them for sharing their views on the Constitution. 
   Before we go on in this debate, and before we get to the actual vote on the motion to proceed, I want to mention a couple issues that need to be considered: 
   One, who is a victim for purposes of the proposed constitutional amendment, and secondly, what does the amendment mean to prosecutions? 
   We asked the Congressional Research Service. This is what they said:  
   [S.J. Res. 3 leaves] to another day the definition of ``victim'' for purposes of the amendment....... It is yet unclear whether S.J. Res. 3 ..... will wipe the slate clean or simply supplement existing law and whether it will trump conflicting defendant constitutional rights or if the need to accommodate both will in rare instances preclude prosecution in order to avoid conflict.  
   Think about that. CRS says under this amendment there are times when one might not be able to prosecute at all because of a conflict in its wording. 
   I do not know how stopping a prosecution with this amendment helps a victim in any way, shape, or manner. 
   What I wish instead is for those who share the concerns as I do for the victims of crime to join with me in finding a way to achieve progress without damaging our Constitution. I hope that even the most ardent proponents of this proposed constitutional change will try to find the best language possible. As Senator TORRICELLI said during debate on the so-called balanced budget amendment in 1997: ``Good is simply not good enough when we are amending the Constitution of the United States.'' I agree. Constitutional amendments should be held to a much higher standard than simply what is good. 
   Every one of us begins a Congress by swearing that we ``will support and defend the Constitution and bear true faith and allegiance to the same.'' We are honored by the constituents of our States. They allow us to serve here. We have that duty, if they allow us to serve, to honor and defend the Constitution. 
   But the oath does more than that. It recognizes our obligation to the great constitutional tradition of the United States and for those who forged this wonderful document. Our oath recognizes our responsibility to those who sacrificed to protect and defend our Constitution, but it is also our legacy to those who will succeed us. 
   No Member of this body owns a seat in the Senate. One-hundred of us are privileged to represent 250 million Americans. In days and years to come, others will take our places. Not only do we have to honor the commitment of those who put us here now, but we have to make sure we preserve the legacy for those who come after us. 
   I am afraid, as we see more and more constitutional amendments come down the pike--we have had 11,000 proposed since this country began--that we run the risk of our Constitution, which has served this Nation so well for over 200 years, being treated by the Senate as a rough draft rather than as the fundamental charter of this great and good Nation. 
   Over the last 6 years, this institution, the Senate, has been acting as though the Constitution is no longer serviceable, as though it needs some kind of major overhaul, as if we fortunate few who have been chosen to represent the people of our States since coming to Washington have acquired some special wisdom that makes 
   us smarter than all the patriots and all the public servants who preceded us and wiser than the legislatures of all of our States, and certainly more knowledgeable than the founders of this Nation. 
   In 1995, the Senate debated and rejected three proposed constitutional amendments--H.J. Res. 1 on budgeting, S.J. Res. 21 on congressional term limits, on which cloture was immediately filed but was not invoked, and S.J. Res. 31 regarding the flag. Since that time, the Senate Judiciary Committee has continued to report proposed amendments at a record clip, and the Senate has been called upon to reaffirm its rejection of a proposed constitutional amendment on budgeting and to debate and vote on a proposed constitutional amendment on campaign finance. 
   Last year, the Senate devoted several weeks to an event of truly constitutional magnitude. That was the impeachment trial of the President. This year the pace of constitutional proposals has accelerated again. This is the third proposal to amend the Constitution that the Senate has been asked to debate in the last 30 days alone--the third constitutional amendment in the last 30 days. We could turn ourselves into another country, as referred to on this floor yesterday when the distinguished senior Senator from New York said that country's constitution changes so rapidly that the libraries should find it under periodicals. 
   In 1995, when he was to cast the decisive vote against a constitutional amendment on budgeting, Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon came to the Senate floor to explain how he would vote. My dear friend of over 20 years said:  
   The debate on the balanced budget amendment is not about reducing the budget deficit, it is about amending the Constitution of the United States with a procedural gimmick....... As I stated during the debate on a balanced budget amendment last year, a vote for this balanced budget amendment is not a vote for a balanced budget, it is a vote for a fig leaf.  
   Then Senator Hatfield concluded by saying:  
   Voting for a balanced budget amendment is easy, working to balance the budget will not be. The Congress should not promise to the people that it will balance the Federal budget through a procedural gimmick. If the Congress has the political will to balance the budget, it should simply use the power that it already has to do so. There is no substitute for political will and there never will be.  
   My friend from Oregon was right. But the same could be said about crime victims' rights. Supporting a crime victims' rights constitutional amendment is easy, but working to ensure that crime victims are afforded their rights and that the protective provisions of law are implemented, that is something else again. That takes real effort. It takes on-the-ground implementation and the dedication of the necessary resources and effort.  
   We have had profiles in courage on constitutional amendments on this floor. Last month, the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator ROBERT C. BYRD, showed courage and commitment to constitutional principles when he voted against S.J. Res. 14, a constitutional amendment regarding the flag. I was fortunate to be present during his extraordinary statement on March 29. During that statement he counseled the Senate, but he also counseled the Nation on how to approach proposals to amend the Constitution. 
   I said then that his statement was a great history lesson and example of political courage because Senator BYRD was reconsidering his vote. I must admit, much as I enjoyed his observations, much as I learned from them, I did not know they would be so instructive again so soon. 
   With respect to this proposed constitutional amendment on crime victims' rights, there is an open secret in this body; and that is, a number of Senators have begun conceding privately, many over the last several weeks, that they have personal misgivings about voting for this proposed amendment. They know that it is not necessary. They know that it does not meet the standard of Article V of the Constitution to justify constitutional amendments. It is not that necessary amendment of which Article V speaks. 
   Some of these Senators, people I respect greatly, on both sides of the aisle, admit they joined as cosponsors because it is popular, because there seemed little reason not to, or because another one of the sponsors had persistently urged them to do so. 
   But as one who has served a long time, as one who has certainly made his share of mistakes in votes or positions, but as one who has had the privilege to vote on this floor more than 10,000 times, I say to each of those Senators, including those who cosponsor this proposed constitutional amendment, that you have succeeded by your efforts in bringing this matter to debate before Congress. I say this most sincerely to the cosponsors, this debate can result in greater recognition of crime victims' rights. They could do that without amending the Constitution. 
   I also say, respectfully, that now it is time to debate and to consider that debate and decide how you will vote, whether you are a cosponsor or not, because how each of us votes and how the Senate acts is what is now the question. Each Senator is responsible for his or her own vote. Nobody can tell any one of us how we must or must not vote. 
   But for each of us, we should understand that if we vote on a constitutional amendment, that is one of the most important responsibilities we will ever exercise as an elected representative. It is a significant factor in the Senate legacy that each of us creates, but it is also what contributes to the lasting legacy of our Constitution. 
   As Senators--the 100 of us--we are custodians of the Constitution. It is a responsibility we should allow to weigh heavily on our shoulders, not to be exercised lightly. Each of us 
    should take seriously our responsibility to defend the Constitution. 
   I have often said that rather than amending the Constitution we should conserve the Constitution. No Senator should rely on 34 others to do the right thing and preserve the Constitution. Senators should cast their votes only for a constitutional amendment that they can wholeheartedly support, that they can honestly say they understand, and whose implementation and impact they are confident they can fully anticipate. I say to my colleagues, with all due respect, very few of us could answer that challenge and vote for this constitutional amendment. 
   The Constitution is not a bulletin board. It is not an automobile bumper on which to affix currently popular slogans. A vote on a constitutional amendment is not something to be cast blithely. When it comes to amending the Constitution, the popular vote is not necessarily the right vote. The founders of this Nation knew that. That is why they put various hurdles before us to amend the Constitution. 
   Let us not sacrifice the traditional guarantee against an overreaching Federal Government that our Constitution provides and sacrifice it to a popular siren song. Rather, let us turn to the work needed to be done to provide those rights that crime victims need in the Federal system and provide the incentives for their implementation in the States' criminal justice systems. There is no need for a constitutional amendment to achieve these goals. We can achieve these goals without amending our Constitution. 
   A constitutional amendment is not like an ordinary statute. A statute you can revisit. You can say next year: We were a little bit wrong in that. Let's redo it. You can tweak it. You can revise it. You can amend it. You can change it. You can repeal it. 
   It is not so with an amendment to the Constitution. Here we are dealing with something else. This is not a commemorative resolution. This is not one of those things we rush down to the floor and say to somebody: Which amendment is this? Oh. And then voting yes or no. This is a constitutional amendment. 
   I think if we are going to change the fundamental charter of this great Nation, we ought to step back a little bit, step back from the political passions of the moment. We are debating a constitutional amendment. We are not endorsing the popularity of a notion or a goal. 
   The Constitution of the United States is a good document. It is not a sacred text. But I would say in a democracy it is as good a law as has ever been written. That is probably why our Constitution is the oldest existing Constitution today. It has survived as the supreme law of this land with very few alterations over the last 200 years. 
   Just think, more than 11,000 amendments have been proposed--many very popular at the time--but only 27 have been adopted; only 17 since the Bill of Rights was ratified over 200 years ago. 
   What have we gotten out of this? We have a Constitution that binds this country together rather than pushes it apart. It contains the Great Compromise that allowed small States, such as my State of Vermont, and large States, such as the State of the distinguished Senator from California, to join together in a spirit of mutual accommodation and respect. 
   I believe the State of Vermont may have had more population when it was admitted than the State of California. How much changes over time. That Great Compromise guaranteed that every State would have a voice in this wonderful body, the Senate, this place I love so much and will miss so greatly when I leave. 
   The Constitution embodies the protections that make real the pronouncements in our historic Declaration of Independence and give meaning to our inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
   These are not just simply words we hear in Fourth of July speeches. These are the words that make up the bedrock of this great Nation. 
   The Constitution requires due process. It guarantees equal protection of the law. It protects our freedom of thought and expression, our freedom to worship as we want, or not, if we want. It also protects our political freedom. It is the basis for our fundamental right of privacy and for limiting Government's intrusions and burdens in our lives. 
   The provisions incorporated in the Bill of Rights ensure that Government power is not used unfairly against anyone. These provisions have protected us for over 200 years.

   Earlier this week, I was honored to join in a Dear Colleague letter with the senior Senator from West Virginia. I have referred to Senator BYRD as the Senate's constitutional sage. Senator BYRD has played a leading role in protecting our Constitution over the last several years as it has weathered assault after assault. He counseled the Senate on the so-called balanced budget amendment, which would have been  a travesty. He was right. He has preserved the protection of our separation of powers against the line-item veto. Again, he was right. He showed great courage and wisdom with his vote and statement on the flag amendment on March 29. As I said, I was fortunate enough to join with the distinguished Senator from West Virginia on a Dear Colleague letter. We sent it out on April 24.

   Let me say one last thing on this. Ours is a powerful Constitution. It is inspiring because of what it allows. It is inspiring because it protects the liberty of all of us. 
   Think of the responsibility the 100 of us here have. Let us be good stewards. Let's keep for our children and our children's children the Constitution with protections as well considered as those bequeathed to us by the founders, the patriots, and the hard-working Americans who preceded us. Work together to improve crime victims' rights in legislation. Let the States do the same. But let us remember that the 100 of us are the ones who must reserve constitutional amendments for those matters for which there are no other alternatives available, and this is not such a matter. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague from West Virginia. For over 25 years, he has been my mentor in the Senate. I probably learned more about the Constitution's history and certainly the procedures of the Senate from him than from anything I have read or anybody else I have known. He is like my late father, one who reveres history because history to him is not just a compilation of dates and facts, but it is the roots of what we are and who we are and where we will go. 
   The distinguished Senator from West Virginia has cast well over 15,000 votes. I know he could tell me exactly how many he has cast, but it has been well over 15,000 votes. It is the record. I have been privileged to cast over 10,000 votes, and I appreciate the kind words he said when I cast that 10,000th. But those 10,000 votes, those 15,000 votes, many were in serious matters. Some were in procedural matters. Most were on legislation, statutes, laws, amendments--some on treaties. But it is so rare to be actually coming to vote on the issue of a constitutional amendment. 
   As important as all the statutes, all the treaties, even all the procedural matters are--because the distinguished Senator from West Virginia knows better than anybody else here, a procedural vote often is the determining vote--I think he would agree with me that the two most important votes you might cast would be on a declaration of war or on a constitutional amendment. In many ways, the country may be affected more by a constitutional amendment than by a declaration of war. 
   The distinguished Senator from West Virginia, my dear friend, has done the Senate and I think the country a service by saying let us pause a moment and ask how we got here. Actually, not only how we got here but why we got here. The answers to those two questions reveals that we should not amend the Constitution this way. It does not even begin to reach that article V level of necessity. 
   I thank my friend. I don't wish to embarrass him. I know he has been in some discomfort from a procedure on his eye. As one who, for other reasons, is very sensitive to that, I know he did this at some discomfort, but he said something that we should all hear. 
   I thank him and I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to correct the RECORD with respect to the effectiveness of the Victims Rights Clarification Act of 1997. 
   In the course of this debate on this proposed constitutional amendment, the two principal sponsors of this constitutional amendment, my friends Senator KYL and Senator FEINSTEIN, have spoken at some length about the Oklahoma City bombing cases. They have repeatedly cited that case as evidence that Federal statutes are not adequate for protecting crime victims, and that nothing but a constitutional amendment will do the trick. 
   They have said that ``the Oklahoma City case provides a compelling illustration of why a constitutional amendment is necessary to fully protect victims' rights in this country'' and that the case shows ``why a statute won't work.'' 
   I have a very different take on the lessons to be learned from the Oklahoma City bombing cases. In my view, what happened in that case is a textbook example of how statutes can and do work, and why the proposed constitutional amendment is wholly unnecessary. 
   For many years, the proponents of this amendment have pointed to one particular ruling to support their cause. On June 26, 1996, during the first Oklahoma City bombing case, the Timothy McVeigh case, the trial judge, Chief Judge Richard Matsch, issued what I and many other Senators thought was a bizarre pretrial order. He held that any victim who wanted to testify at the penalty hearing, assuming McVeigh was convicted, would be excluded from all pretrial proceedings and from the trial. Judge Matsch's reasoning, as I understand it, was that victims' testimony at sentencing would be improperly influenced by their witnessing the trial.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have to take issue with the extreme rhetoric that some are using to attack our Federal law enforcement officers who helped return Elian Gonzalez to his father. 
   For example, one of the Republican leaders in the House of Representatives was quoted as calling the officers of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, the U.S. Border Patrol, and the U.S. Marshals Service: ``jack-booted thugs.'' The mayor of New York City, a man who is seeking election to this body, called these dedicated public servants ``storm troopers.'' 
   I know both men who made these remarks. I hope they will reconsider what they said because such intemperate and highly charged rhetoric only serves to degrade Federal law enforcement officers in the eyes of the public. That is something none of us should want to see happen. 
   Let none of us in the Congress, or those who want to serve in Congress, contribute to an atmosphere of disrespect for law enforcement officers. No matter what one's opinion of the law enforcement action in south Florida, we should all agree that these law enforcement officers were following orders, doing what they were trained to do, and putting their lives on the line, something they do day after day after day. 
   Let us treat law enforcement officers with the respect that is essential to their preserving the peace and protecting the public. I have said many times on the floor of this body that the 8 years I served in law enforcement are among the proudest and most satisfying times of my years in public service. 
   Thus, this harsh rhetoric bothers me even more. I do not know if I am bothered more as a Senator or as a former law enforcement official. But I am reminded of similar harsh rhetoric used by the National Rifle Association. In April 1995, the NRA sent a fundraising letter to members calling Federal law enforcement officers ``jack-booted thugs'' who wear ``Nazi bucket helmets and black storm trooper uniforms.'' 
   Apparently, the vice president of the NRA was referring to Federal Bureau of Investigation and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents involved in law enforcement actions in Idaho and Texas. 
   President George Bush, a man who is a friend of ours on both sides of this aisle, was correctly outraged by this NRA rhetoric, and he resigned from the NRA in protest. At the time in 1995, President Bush wrote to the NRA:  
   Your broadside against federal agents deeply offends my own sense of decency and honor....... It indirectly slanders a wide array of government law enforcement officials, who are out there, day and night, laying their lives on the line for all of us.  
   I praised President Bush in 1995 for his actions, and I praise him again today. 
   President Bush was right. This harsh rhetoric of calling Federal law enforcement officers ``jack-booted thugs'' and ``storm troopers'' should offend our sense of decency and honor. It is highly offensive. It does not belong in any public debate on the reunion of Elian Gonzalez with his father. 
   We are fortunate to have dedicated women and men throughout Federal law enforcement in this country. They do a tremendous job under difficult circumstances, 
   oftentimes at the risk of their lives and, unfortunately, too often losing their lives. They are examples of the hard-working public servants who make up the Federal Government, who are too often maligned and unfairly disparaged. It is unfortunate that it takes high-profile incidents to put a human face on Federal law enforcement officials, to remind everyone that these are people with children and parents and friends, spouses, brothers and sisters. They deserve our respect. They don't deserve our personal insults. 
   In countless incidents across the country every day, we ask Federal law enforcement officers who are sworn to protect the public and enforce the law to place themselves in danger, in danger none of us has to face. These law enforcement officers deserve our thanks and our respect. They do not deserve to be called jack-booted thugs and storm troopers. I proudly join the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association in condemning these insults against our Nation's law enforcement officers. The public officials who used this harsh rhetoric owe our Federal law enforcement officers an apology. 
   I also want to note the misplaced swiftness in those calling to investigate the law enforcement action needed to reunite Elian Gonzalez with his father. The same congressional leaders who broke speed records calling Attorney General Reno to Capitol Hill and now call for Senate Judiciary Committee hearings to investigate this law enforcement action are the same congressional leaders who stalled the juvenile justice conference for nearly a year. With just a word, these congressional leaders can order politically charged meetings and hearings, though they remain silent when it comes to moving a comprehensive youth crime bill toward final passage into law. Unfortunately, we are in a Congress that is quick to investigate but slow to actually legislate a solution that could improve the quality of our constituents' lives. I think this is a misplaced priority on politics over commonsense legislation. I hope we will calm down the rhetoric. 
   There are those who feel strongly about where Elian Gonzalez should be, either with relatives in Miami or with his father. I am one who has stated from the beginning that the little boy should be with his father. The fact is, he is with his father. I hope we can all just let them be alone, let them reestablish the bonds that a father and child naturally have. Let him enjoy the company of his new brother. Let him be out of the TV cameras. Let's stop seeing this little boy paraded out several times a day before crowds, even adoring crowds. Let him be a normal little 6-year-old. Let him hug his father. Let his father hug him back. Let them read stories. Let them do things together. 
   I ask his family, his relatives in Miami--I have to assume they love him--let them have this time alone. Back away. Don't let your own egos or feelings get in the way of what is best for this little child. Let him be with his father. There will be a time where all of them will be together again. Right now, this little boy needs his dad. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. I am pleased to hear both of my distinguished colleagues talking about the necessity to protect those who go into a situation such as that. In an earlier career in law enforcement I had the experience of going on raids or arrests or hostage situations, oftentimes in the middle of the night. They are a very frightening thing. 
   I suspect those immigration officers and marshals also have families who worry about whether they are going to come back alive. They are entitled to some protection, too. They talk about a frightening picture of a man so intimidating that everybody would stand still. His finger was not on the trigger of his gun. If you look at the picture, the safety was on the weapon. An unarmed female INS officer, with no body armor or anything else, came in there, putting her own life at risk so the little boy would not be frightened when she picked him up. And she spoke to him in Spanish. 
   The Miami relatives could have avoided this. The Miami relatives took a position they wanted to help little Elian and hurt Fidel Castro. They helped Fidel Castro and hurt little Elian. They should have given him back to his father long ago. Instead, they made this whole situation necessary. 
   The officers who went in there are entitled to protect themselves. If I were their spouse, if I were their child, I would hope that they would. Then to accuse them of brainwashing or drugging this little boy is scandalous. These marshals, who took the little boy into their custody, are sworn to give their own life, if necessary, to protect the person they have in their custody. 
   They were there to protect the little boy. They did protect the little boy. He is now back with his father where he belongs. 
   I resent the statement of some of the Miami relatives saying these pictures of a happy child with his father are doctored, that it is not really little Elian, that they substituted someone else for him, or that the marshals drugged him. One relative even said the only reason he called his father from the airplane was because they put a gun to his head. This is outrageous. 
   These brave men and women, who constantly put their lives on the line to protect the people of this country, including oftentimes Members of Congress, ought to be praised.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I listened to my two distinguished colleagues. Not only are all colleagues ``distinguished'' colleagues, but these two are also personal friends. One is a Republican, one a Democrat. Both are individuals I like very much, individuals with whom I enjoy working on the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
   However, notwithstanding our friendship and our service on the same committee, I must disagree with them on this constitutional amendment. 
   I do not disagree with them at all on the intent of the amendment to give victims rights; to make sure they can be heard in sentencing, to make sure their views are sought out in every area from plea bargains to compensation. I know in the 8 years I was a prosecutor I did that. It was the standard  procedure in my office. I insisted that victims be heard in the pre-sentence report, victims be heard by the court, victims be heard by the prosecutor's office if a determination was made to either bring extra charges or to drop some charges--whatever the reason might be. 
   I must admit, I would have been very concerned had there been a constitutional amendment of this nature because I can almost picture the number of appeals, the number of delays, and the number of other issues that would come up. In many ways, it would create, in my view, just the opposite effect from that which the sponsors want; that is, so many appeals could come out of this that everybody would lose sight of who is being prosecuted and why. 
   Last Wednesday, we observed the fifth anniversary of the killing of 168 Americans in the horrific bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, and we opened the Oklahoma City National Memorial. 
   Every American was shocked at the initial bombing. Every American must have been moved by the speeches and the observance at the memorial. I remember, after that terrible incident, the Senate proceeded to consider antiterrorism legislation. The incident was in the spring, and by June, we were considering antiterrorism legislation. In fact, at that time the Senate accepted my amendment to include victims legislation in the antiterrorism bill. I worked with Senator MCCAIN to increase assessments against those convicted of crime, with the assessments to go to the Crime Victims Fund. When the matter was completed the following year, we preserved our legislative improvements to help victims of terrorism in the United States, in fact around the world, as the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 1996. We moved very quickly to respond. 
   Last Thursday, we also observed the anniversary of the tragic violence at Columbine High School. That was one in a series of deadly incidents of school violence over the last few years. Scores of our Nation's children have been killed or wounded over the last 3 years from school violence, and that violence has shaken families and communities across our Nation. In the wake of the Columbine violence, the Senate moved to the consideration of juvenile crime legislation. We had one of the few real Senate debates in the past few years. We had a 2-week debate. During that 2-week debate, we greatly improved the bill with numerous amendments, including a number directed at commonsense, consensus gun safety laws. 
   On May 20 last year, within a month of the Columbine tragedy, the Senate acted to pass the Hatch-Leahy juvenile crime bill. We did it by a 3-1 margin, but since last May when we passed it, the Congress has kept the country waiting for final action on the legislation. Since last May, the Congress and the Senate have kept the country waiting for sensible gun safety laws. It has been now more than a year since the tragic event at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO; more than a year since 14 students and a teacher lost their lives in that tragedy on April 20, 1999. Still, the American people are waiting for action by this Congress. 
   It has been more than 11 months since the Senate passed the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill by a bipartisan vote of 73-25. It had modest, but I believe effective, gun safety provisions in it. It has been more than 8 months since the House and Senate juvenile justice conference met. That was only a ceremonial meeting. We did it for the first and the last and the only time. Throughout the entire school year that has ensued, the Republican Senate chairman of the House-Senate conference and the Republican leadership of the Congress, have refused to call this conference 
   back to work. The Senate and House Democrats have been ready for months to reconvene the juvenile justice conference and work with Republicans to craft an effective juvenile justice conference report that includes reasonable gun safety provisions. But the majority has refused to act. 
   I think the lack of attention, a lack of effective action is shameful, particularly in light of the fact that Congress has spent far more time in recess than in session since the first ceremonial meeting of the conference. 
   I spoke on the floor several times over the last year--on September 8, September 9, October 21, March 21, March 28, March 29, April 5, April 6, April 13, and today--urging the majority to reconvene the juvenile justice conference. I have joined with Senators, both in writing and on the floor, to request the Senate leadership let us complete our work on the conference and send a good bill to the President. We should not delay simply because some powerful gun lobbies do not want us to pass even the most modest gun safety legislation; even the modest provision that closes this huge loophole we now have for gun shows where somebody in a flea market can sell firearms to felons. 
   On October 20, 1999, all the House and Senate Democratic conferees sent a letter to Senator HATCH and Congressman HYDE, calling for an open meeting of the conference. On March 3 of this year, after another shocking school shooting involving 6-year-old classmates in Michigan, Representative CONYERS and I wrote again to Senator HATCH and Congressman HYDE requesting an immediate meeting of the conference. The response has been resounding silence. 
   Even a bipartisan letter on April 11 from the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, HENRY HYDE, and the Ranking Democrat, JOHN CONYERS, to the Republican Senate chairman of the conference, Senator HATCH, has not succeeded in getting the conference back to work. We have to find time, or at least the will, to pass balanced, comprehensive juvenile crime legislation. This is something that could be signed into law today, or within a day after being passed. This is legislation we passed by a 73-25 margin, and then we hold it in abeyance because the gun lobbyists said do not touch this. 
   What have we done in the meantime? We keep having a number of proposed constitutional amendments. Last month, it was a proposed constitutional amendment regarding the flag. I spoke at the beginning and end of that debate to urge the Senate to turn to completing our work on the juvenile crime bill, health care reform legislation, on minimum wage legislation, on privacy legislation, on confirming the Federal judges needed in our courts around the country, and all the other matters that have been sidetracked this year. But rather than doing the legislative work that we should do first and foremost, we are now going to turn our attention to another constitutional amendment, this one with regard to crime victims' rights. 
   I believe constitutional amendments, if they are brought up, should be approached seriously. The distinguished Senator from Arizona and the distinguished Senator from California have approached it seriously. But that means a real, serious debate. If we are going to amend the Constitution of the United States, we should do it seriously. Instead, late on Thursday, after we voted to adopt an adjournment resolution, and everybody had left for the airport, the majority leader came to the floor to move to proceed to this matter. I do not think constitutional amendments should be a time filler to be called upon when we do not want to proceed to legislative items. Nor is a constitutional amendment the type of item that should be rushed through Senate consideration. It should be explored and thoughtfully considered. If we are going to start having constitutional amendments rather than legislative matters, then let's set aside a good period of time--a few weeks--to talk about this one. 
   Let's talk about the others that should come up. I can think of at least two. Let's have a constitutional amendment debate on abortion. For those who think Roe v. Wade should be the law of the land, let's write it into the Constitution. For those who think it should not be, this is the chance to overrule the Supreme Court. Let's settle once and for all this whole constitutional issue on abortion. Let's have a constitutional amendment on that. I am perfectly willing to move forward with that. Even though I have stated my strong positions on this issue, let's have a debate on it. 
   There are those who are concerned about whether we have too many gun rights and those who think we do not have enough. Maybe we should have a gun amendment to clarify the second amendment. Maybe we should get these  issues out of the way once and for all. We can spend a few weeks on each one of these. We can be done by late August, and the Senate will have spoken as to how they think it should be done. 
   The last two times the Senate debated the so-called balanced budget amendment, those debates consumed a number of weeks, as they should. This was a palliative I happened to oppose. We were told that without a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, we could never balance the budget. Many of us said if we did our work and wrote the legislation the right way we could. Of course, that is exactly what happened. We did not need a constitutional amendment after all. We are now debating how to spend the budget surpluses because we balanced the budget without a constitutional amendment. 
   This proposed amendment is of similar length and additional complexity and will require some time to debate, as we did with the balanced budget amendment. 
   In addition, of course, this is the first time this amendment will be debated by the Senate. It has never been debated by the House. So there is a lot of new ground to cover. If we are to pass it, I know the House will want to look to our debate. I assume there will be weeks of debate on it, as there should be. It is a legitimate issue. 
   I think it can be handled statutorily, but if we are going to do it in the Constitution, we should spend the weeks necessary to make sure we get it right. 
   By way of illustration, the Judiciary Committee took more than 6 months to file its report on the proposed amendment, even though a similar measure had been the subject of a report last Congress. I note that the majority views in the committee report run over 40 pages. The principal sponsors, Senators KYL and FEINSTEIN, added a statement of their own additional views on top of those. I urge all Senators to read them because they are worth reading. I note that the minority views, in which I join with Senators KENNEDY, KOHL, and FEINGOLD, extend over 35 pages. I think they are well worth reading. There is a lot of discussion in them. 
   We will vote today on the majority leader's motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed. I will not oppose invoking cloture on the motion to proceed. In fact, I urge Senators to vote for cloture on the motion to proceed. I hope it will be a 100-0 vote. But once we proceed to consideration of this measure, my colleagues should understand that it is an important matter that will require some extensive debate, and we will see serious and substantial amendments to this proposal. I have heard from both sides of the aisle. I told the distinguished Senator from California that I will offer a statutory alternative in the days ahead that can move the cause of crime victims' rights forward immediately by a simple majority vote, without the additional complications and delays the constitutional amendment ratification process might entail, and without the need to return to Congress to draft, introduce, and pass implementing legislation. There will be other amendments, as I have said. 
   I know the distinguished sponsors of this amendment have been through more than 60 drafts to date. This is not an easy issue. It is hardly fixed in stone. It has not had Senate scrutiny. In fact, a number of Senators told me when they came back from the recess that they were surprised to know this was coming up because it was added to the agenda after we had voted to adjourn for the Easter recess. Many Senators are surprised it is before us. I have told them the proposed constitutional amendment is important. I think its meanings and mandates have to be explored. 
   In my personal view--and I actually note this with some sadness--the focus on the constitutional amendment has actually had the unintended consequence of slowing the pace of victims' rights legislation over the past several years. I am reminded of the debate we had year after year of the need for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. President Reagan, who submitted budgets with the biggest deficits in the Nation's history, would always give great speeches about needing a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Of course, I used to tell him: There you go again. All you had to do was introduce a balanced budget and let us vote on it. Instead, he introduced budgets, as was his right as President, with enormous deficits, and then a few days later gave a speech saying: I wish we had a constitutional amendment to balance the budget so we could balance this budget.

   Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I will claim such part of my hour as I might consume. 
   It was less than a month ago, I recall, I stood on the floor of the Senate to defend the Bill of Rights against the proposed flag amendment to our Constitution. The Senate voted March 29 to preserve the Constitution and refused to limit the first amendment and the Bill of Rights by means of that proposed amendment. Apparently, preserving the Constitution in March does not mean the Constitution is safe in April. So here I am again as we begin to debate yet another proposed amendment to the Constitution. Yet, again, I am here to speak out in favor of the integrity of our national charter. 
   I support crime victims' assistance and rights, but I do not support this proposed amendment to the Constitution. Just as opposition to a flag desecration amendment does not mean a Senator is in favor of flag burning, opposition to a victims' rights amendment does not mean that a Senator opposes justice for victims of crime. In fact, during the course of this debate, we will have a statutory alternative to the proposed constitutional amendment that would serve to advance crime victims' rights. 
   I have been in the Senate for 25 years. I think it is safe to say that I have been a very strong advocate for victims' rights during that time. My initial involvement with victims' rights began more than three decades ago when I served as State's attorney for Chittenden County, Vermont. According to our population and under  our procedures at that time, by virtue of the office, at the age of 26, I became the chief law enforcement officer for the County. I saw firsthand the devastation of crime. I have worked ever since to ensure that the criminal justice system is one that respects the rights and the dignity of victims of crime and domestic violence, rather than one that presents additional ordeals for those already victimized. 
   I will continue to work for victims of crime and domestic violence in the course of this debate. I support crime victims and their rights, but I oppose this constitutional amendment. As a prosecutor, I was able to make sure victims were heard, that sentencing decisions were made with the rights of victims in mind, that plea bargains were not entered into without the rights of victims in mind. They were all heard. I also knew we could do that individually, or by State statute, or by State constitution. But we didn't have to amend the United States Constitution. 
   The proposed amendment, S.J. Res. 3, goes on for over 60 lines. I believe the most important part of our national charter, the Constitution, is the first amendment. This magnificent part of our document, in just five or six lines, says that we have the right of free speech, we have freedom of religion--that is, to practice any religion we want, or none if we want--we have the right to petition our Government, and we have the right of assembly. These rights, enunciated in just five or six lines in 
   the Constitution, preserve the diversity--actually, they almost demand diversity in our country, and they protect diversity in our country. If you have diversity, especially diversity that is protected, you have democracy. Those five or six lines are the bedrock of our democracy and our freedom. 
   Contrast this with S.J. Res. 3. As I said earlier, I don't doubt the sincerity of my two friends, the chief sponsors of this; they are my friends and they are two people I respect. But this is over 60 lines. It is like a complicated statute, which will be made more complicated as the courts get a hold of it, as prosecutors have to figure out what is going on, and as defense attorneys look for loopholes. No place in it does it mention what we have always built our criminal justice system on--the protection of the rights of the accused. 
   James Madison, the great framer of the Constitution, instructed that a constitutional amendment should be limited to ``certain great and extraordinary occasions.'' Well, we have one thing that is great and extraordinary and that is our country and our democracy. It has made us the most powerful and influential nation on Earth today. But these are not great and extraordinary occasions that demand the amending of the United States Constitution. 
   I find it distressing that we so ignore James Madison's instructions and advice and that there are almost 60 proposed constitutional amendments pending before this Congress alone, including an amendment to make it easier to adopt other amendments in the future. Now, if we are going to do this, let's do it on everything. Let's have an amendment on gun control. Let's have an amendment on abortion. Let's have an amendment on reapplying from where Senators can serve. Let's do a number of other things. Some of the amendments that have been proposed look as if they were before a local board of select people. We should not be so eager to amend our Constitution. Look at Article V of the Constitution and read the first part of the first sentence. It says:  
   The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary. ..... 
   Does anyone think the American people would ``deem this necessary''? 
   At one time, after the President at the time sent up unbalanced budget after unbalanced budget, Congress said the only way to stop us from spending was to have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Fortunately, we do not have such a constitutional amendment today. Instead, we have a President who had the guts to send up a balanced budget, and we had a Congress who had the guts to back him up and pass it. That is how to do it--the old-fashioned way. 
   I believe this particular proposed constitutional amendment regarding crime victims' rights fails to set the standards set by our founders in Article V of the Constitution. It cannot be necessary. Let me state why: Over the last several years, we have been making great strides in protecting crime victims' rights. We have accomplished much in 20 years to advance the cause of crime victims' rights, through State law and Federal statutory improvements, through increased training or education, and through implementation efforts. There is no basis today for concluding that this constitutional amendment is necessary for providing crime victims' rights in the criminal justice process. 
   There is a growing fascination in the Congress with amending our Constitution first and legislating second. No Member knows how long he or she will be in the Senate. I have been privileged in the State of Vermont. My friends in the State of Vermont have sent me here for over 25 years. They do remind me that Vermont is the only State in the Union that has elected only one member from my party to the Senate, but I am thankful they do it by ever increasingly large margins. I don't know how long I will be here; no Member does. 
   As long as I am here, I will take upon myself the duty to say to the Senate: Slow down on this idea of amending the Constitution. Slow down. 
   Whatever short-term political gain Members may feel today, your children and your children's children will in all likelihood live by what you do. The temptation was there for the framers of the Constitution. I am sure they looked at the differences between the States and thought, if I amend the Constitution just this way, my State has an advantage or I have an advantage over this person. Instead, they resisted the temptation. Maybe that is why we are the oldest currently existing democracy in the world. Maybe that is why we have a First Amendment, something not duplicated in any other nation on Earth. Maybe that is why we protect ourselves and our rights as we do, because we know we have resisted over the years the 11,000 suggested amendments to the Constitution. Of those 11,000 amendments, one has to assume that somebody in every single instance thought their amendment was extremely important. Every one of those 11,000 times, somebody somewhere thought: This is the amendment to the Constitution that we really need; this is the amendment that falls under Article V which says it is necessary. 
   I was the 21st person in the history of this country to vote 10,000 times in the Senate. Those 10,000 votes were not all necessary for this country. Sometimes they were votes called by the Sergeant at Arms, and sometimes they were to adjourn. Sometimes they were votes to commend ourselves for doing something we were paid to do anyway. Of course, sometimes they were extraordinarily important votes. 
   I took pride in being the 21st person in our Nation's history to vote that many times. But I wouldn't have taken pride to think I voted almost the same number of times for a different constitutional amendment. Yet 11,000 constitutional amendments have been before the Senate. Imagine our Constitution if the 11,000 amendments had passed. Heck, take half of them. Imagine our Constitution if 5,500 passed. Impossible. Say 10 percent, 1,100, passed; 5 percent, 550; 1 percent, 110, passed. If we had 
   taken a tiny fraction of these 11,000 that were so essential to this Nation, our Constitution would not be something that would be revered around the world, that other countries would try to emulate; it would be a laughingstock. 
   Until we do our job with statutes, until we find the ways within the State, until we explore other ways to help with victims' rights, until we follow through with the commitment of necessary resources, until we look at all those States that have passed their own victims' rights laws, until we accept the fact that not one single court has found those unconstitutional, thus saying we don't need a constitutional amendment, until we do that, why do we amend the Constitution again? 
   As I said, I don't know how much longer I have in the Senate. However, I will stand on this floor, constitutional amendment after constitutional amendment. This is a wonderful document. Don't change it. Don't change it  unless an amendment falls under Article V and really is necessary. This is not necessary. 
   It is ironic, at the height of the key dynamic changes in increased rights and protections for crime victims over the last decade, the efforts on behalf of this constitutional amendment have had the unfortunate, and I believe unintended, fact of slowing that process and dissipating those efforts. 
   Who suffered? The crime victims. Crime victims are among the most sympathetic figures. And they should be. They are also some of the most politically powerful groups in our society today. We are all supportive of crime victims. That probably takes political courage, to say we should ask some questions, because it takes little political courage to say you are in favor of crime victims; we all our. It is not whether we support crime victims, because we all do. 
   Certainly, those of us like myself who have been prosecutors, who have seen firsthand the beaten victims, the stabbed victims--I even had a murder victim die in my arms while he was telling me who killed him--understand victims. But this debate is not about those victims. It is whether the Senate will endorse the amendment to the United States Constitution. I will do all in my power to make sure we do not amend the Constitution. 
   April is an especially sensitive time of year for crime victims and those who advocate for them. Frankly, I feel every day we should be advocating for them. Two weeks ago was the 20th anniversary of Crime Victims' Rights Week. During that time, I was one of the few Senators who came to the floor to try to make progress on crime victims' rights by proposing an improved version of the Crime Victims Assistance Act, S. 934. 
   Last week, we observed the fifth anniversary of the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Some of us have worked long and hard for the victims of crime and terrorism around the world. I was proud to be the author of the Victims of Terrorism Act amendment to the anti-terrorism bill that passed the Senate in the wake of that tragedy of June, 1995, which served as the basis for what became the victims provisions ultimately enacted in 1996. 
   I worked with Senator NICKLES and others to provide closed circuit television coverage of the Oklahoma City bombing trials. I supported special assistance for victims and their families to attend and participate in the trials, including enactment of the Victims Rights Clarification Act in 1997 to help ensure those who attended the early portion of the trial could also testify or attend during the sentencing phase. 
   I do not need to be told by anybody that I have to be sympathetic with victims of crime. I have done that throughout my professional career. I have done it in legislation. I did it for 8 years as a prosecutor. 
   But I also look at some of the things we are not doing here in Congress. Last Thursday, we observed the first anniversary of the tragic violence at Columbine High School in Colorado. That anniversary served as a reminder of the school violence we have witnessed too often over the past few years. Yet the Senate and House have not completed their work on the juvenile crime bill, a bill that passed the Senate last May by a margin of almost 3 to 1. 
   The Hatch-Leahy bill passed this body 73-25. Since then, the Republican leadership continues its refusal to convene the House-Senate conference necessary to complete action on this measure. Tell that to the families who were at the zoo here in Washington D.C. yesterday. Tell them the gun lobby will tell us when we can meet and when we cannot, in the United States Congress. Tell those families. 
   We, oftentimes, have emotional issues that come before us. This past weekend Elian Gonzalez was reunited with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. You know what happened there. The great uncle had temporary custody, custody was revoked, he refused to do a voluntary transfer of the child, the Attorney General finally had to act to reunite them and say the United States would uphold its own laws. I think it was done in the right way. Everybody is running around: We'll have a special citizenship bill, special amnesty bill, special whatever else. I say, remember what the Senate is supposed to be. Remember that wonderful story about the cup and saucer. We are the saucer that allows the cooling of the passions, and we should approach debate of a proposed constitutional amendment with the seriousness and deliberation that it requires. 
   We could go, instead, back to some of the legislative things we could do right now, that could be signed into law right now, that might help victims of crime. 
   I see the distinguished senior Senator from New Jersey, a man who, throughout his career here in the Senate, has worked so hard, not just for victims of crime but for those laws that might ensure that at least we have a diminution of crime, especially gun crimes. I am perfectly willing to reserve my time and yield to the distinguished Senator if he would care to speak. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

   I say to my friend from New York, there have been 11,000 proposed amendments to the Constitution that have been brought before the Congress. Article V speaks of amending the Constitution when necessary. 
   The Senator from New York is a far greater student of history than I, but does he think that by any stretch of the imagination--we have had civil wars; we have fought in world wars; we have gone through Presidential assassinations; we have done all these things--we have ever come close to 11,000 times in the history of this great Nation where it has been necessary to amend the Constitution?

   Mr. LEAHY. I say to my friend from New York, it is the Senate that is the saucer that cools the passions. That should make us slow up and look at these things. 
   I wonder what would have happened if, say, during all those times, 10 percent of those amendments had gone through. That would be 1,100 amendments. If 1 percent went through, there would be over 100 amendments. What a different country this would be with much less democracy, if we would be a democracy at all. 
   The first amendment in our little pocketbooks of the Constitution is only four or five lines. The first amendment really protects the diversity of this country to make sure we remain a democracy, that we have the right to practice any religion we want, or none if we want--both thoughts are protected--that we can say what we want, that we can assemble and petition our Government. All of that is protected. Yet we have something that, when we print out this proposed amendment, goes on for something like 60 lines. 
   I am a lawyer. I loved doing appellate work. The distinguished Presiding Officer is a distinguished former attorney general. I am sure he would love to do appellate work. I can tell you right now, this is a lawyer's dream. We might as well quadruple the number of courts, the number of judges. They would not keep up with the appeals that would come just from this one amendment alone. 
   It is hard for me to emphasize enough, and I hate to hold up the Senator from New York on this, but there is nobody else here to express my frustration to.

   Mr. LEAHY. He and I are on the same side of this. I have the privilege, as I said earlier, of being the 21st Member of the Senate, in all its history, to cast 10,000 votes. Some votes were important; a lot were not important. But I thought it was pretty 
   impressive--10,000 votes. Even with all the unimportant ones, even after all of them, I did not vote enough to have voted on all the proposed constitutional amendments. There have been 11,000. 
   Our highly respected and beloved two most senior Members of this body, Senator THURMOND and Senator BYRD, have cast 15,000 votes. They are about the only ones who might have cast enough votes. But those votes encompassed all kinds of things. 
   Here we are talking about changing the Constitution at the drop of a hat. Some of us--Republicans and Democrats alike, conservatives and liberals--ought to stand up and say: We will pass statutes; we will experiment. If we are wrong, we will change the statutes; we will change the law. But we will not amend the Constitution. No matter that the proposal comes from the left or the right, no matter what it is, we should not pass it unless it is, as the Constitution says, necessary. 
   This resolution is not necessary for the security and for the continuation of the world's greatest democracy.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I do not like the marriage penalty. I think it is poor public policy. However, I am forced to vote against cloture today because the majority has refused to allow the minority to offer amendments to improve this seriously flawed legislation. 
   The majority has presented us with a bill that not only fails to completely remedy the marriage penalty, but also provides large tax cuts to individuals and married couples who currently experience a marriage bonus. Less than 40% of the benefits of this bill would actually go to couples earning under $100,000. This is not a marriage penalty bill; this is a fiscally irresponsible tax cut bill for the wealthy. Hard working married couples in Vermont deserve an honest, targeted measure to eliminate the marriage penalty, not the proposal that is before us today. 
   I had looked forward to debating amendments to strengthen this bill and I am disappointed that the majority is cutting off the debate with a motion to invoke cloture. The integrity of the Senate is threatened when the majority refuses to permit the minority to debate amendments. The Senate should be the conscience of the nation because of the distinguishing feature of this body for any Senator to offer amendments and thoroughly debate the merits of legislation. 
   I support an end to the marriage penalty. I will continue to work with other Senators to pass legislation that is targeted at eliminating all of the marriage penalties that are embedded in our tax code. Vermonters deserve nothing less.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am disappointed that the conference committee dropped an amendment I offered with Senator KOHL that would have applied additional surpluses estimated by CBO to debt reduction rather than tax cuts. I had hoped that this fiscally responsible amendment, which was unanimously adopted by the Senate, would be included in the final version of the budget resolution. Instead, the Committee accepted a House provision that would allow the budget chairman to use additional surpluses for tax cuts above and beyond the $150 billion in cuts already in the resolution. I find it disheartening that Congress is not even willing to commit unexpected surpluses to debt reduction. 
   In the 1980s, Congress went on a tax cut binge and left the bill for our children. During those years we all saw the lip service paid and the sloganeering about balancing the budget, while we simultaneously tripled the national debt and ran the biggest deficits of any nation in the history of the world. As a result, the national debt now stands at $3.6 trillion and the Federal government pays almost $1 billion in interest every working day on this debt. Now that we have surpluses, we have a chance and an obligation to pay off that debt. This budget resolution fails to live up to that responsibility. 
   Nothing would do more to keep our economy strong than paying down our national debt. Paying down our national debt will keep interest rates low. Consumers gain ground with lower mortgage costs, car payments, credit card charges with low interest rates. And small business owners can invest, expand and create jobs with low interest rates. 
   Alan Greenspan and nearly every other economist who has testified before the Senate Budget and Finance Committees has stated that our nation's budget surpluses should be used to pay down the debt. And yet, the Republican budget resolution proposes far less debt reduction than the budgets developed by President Clinton and Senate Democrats. This resolution would use 98% of the non-Social Security surplus for tax breaks which would primarily benefit the wealthy. By dropping our amendment, Congress is in danger of using an even higher percentage of the surplus for tax cuts, and even less for debt reduction. This does not make fiscal sense. 
   During markup, Senator LAUTENBERG offered an alternative budget that would have reduced $330 billion in debt over ten years, while providing almost $300 billion in targeted tax cuts--cuts that would go towards eliminating the marriage tax penalty, permitting the self-employed a full tax deduction for their health insurance and providing estate tax relief for family farmers and small business owners. Such cuts would be fair and targeted to help all Vermonters, not just the wealthy. Unfortunately, this amendment failed. 
   In 1993, Congress charted a course of fiscal discipline and the country has reaped the benefits of this successful plan. Republicans and Democrats can rightfully claim their shares of the credit for getting the nation's fiscal house in order. The important thing now is to keep our budget in balance, to pay down our debt, and to keep our economy growing. Unfortunately, this budget resolution fails to make a real commitment to debt reduction, which is why I must vote against it.

   Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object. 
   Mr. President, I notice that the adjournment order has already been adopted. Respectfully, I do not believe that there is any intention of completing this matter today, tomorrow, or even next week. We have just barely filed a committee report. 
   This is a constitutional amendment. I think we ought, at least, to make sure Senators know that this is going to be the next matter coming up and that they have a chance to consider the report and the proposal. A constitutional amendment should not be rushed through this way, with all due respect. So I will object. 
   I will be happy to work with the distinguished majority leader, who has the added problems of having to make sure that the Senate does its work at the appropriate time. I will be happy to work with him on schedules and everything else on this, but because it is a constitutional amendment, I think we should treat it with more care and not just zing it off like this. We should have a real debate. I am not going to stop it from coming forward. I only want to make sure that everyone knows about it, that everyone has a chance to debate it and that everyone has the opportunity to offer amendments.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am disappointed that the majority continues to refuse to reconvene the conference on juvenile justice legislation. 
   This Congress has kept the country waiting far too long for action on juvenile justice legislation and sensible gun safety laws. We are fast approaching the first-year anniversary of the shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. Next Thursday will sadly mark one year since fourteen students and a teacher lost their lives in that tragedy on April 20, 1999. 
   It has been 11 months since the Senate passed the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill by an overwhelming vote of 73-25. Our bipartisan bill includes modest yet effective gun safety provisions. It has been 10 months since the House of Representatives passed its own juvenile crime bill on June 17, 1999. It has been 9 months since the House and Senate juvenile justice conference met for the first--and only--time on August 5, 1999, less than 24 hours before the Congress adjourned for its long August recess. 
   Senate and House Democrats have been ready for months to reconvene the juvenile justice conference and work with Republicans to craft an effective juvenile justice conference report that includes reasonable gun safety provisions, but the majority refuses to act. Indeed, on October 20, 1999, all the House and Senate Democratic conferees wrote to Senator HATCH, the Chairman of the juvenile justice conference, and Congressman HYDE, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, to reconvene the conference immediately. This week, Congressman HYDE joined our call for the juvenile justice conference to meet as soon as possible in a letter to Senator HATCH, which was also signed by Congressman CONYERS.  
   Every parent, teacher and student in this country is concerned about school violence over the last two years and worried about when the next shooting may occur. They only hope it does not happen at their school or involve their children. 
   We all recognize that there is no single cause and no single legislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our schools or in our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to do our part. We should seize this opportunity to act on balanced, effective juvenile justice legislation, and measures to keep guns out of the hands of children and away from criminals. 
   It is ironic that the Senate will be in recess next week on the anniversary of the Columbine tragedy. In fact, the Senate has been in recess more than in session since the one ceremonial meeting of the juvenile crime conference committee. I hope we get to work soon and finish what we started in the juvenile justice conference. It is well past the time for Congress to act.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, nearly 30 years ago, my predecessor, the late Senator George D. Aiken, rose to report to the Senate on a new Vermont initiative called ``Green Up Day.'' He described an effort, then in its second year, in which thousands of Vermont citizen volunteers of all ages combed the streets, highways, back roads, and village greens to pick up litter and beautify their state. 
   Another distinguished colleague of mine, Senator Robert Stafford, kept these same Vermonters' thoughts in mind when he courageously led this Senate in the fight to build strong national environmental policies--including Superfund--to protect public health, air, water, and land. 
   The very first Green Up Day was a simple initiative born on April 18 of 1970--a few days before the first Earth Day. Today it is an annual Vermont tradition. On May 6, 2000, thousands of Vermonters will celebrate the official 30th anniversary of ``Green Up Day'' just as they have for so many years--by picking up trash bags and devoting their day to the beautification and clean up of our Green Mountain State. 
   Over the years, one organization, Vermont Green Up, has diligently coordinated volunteers and spread the ideas of Green Up Day. Vermont Green Up has sponsored annual poster contests for students, cleaned up several illegal dumps, and helped other states--and even other countries--organize their own ``Green Up'' efforts. 
   In fact, my own daughter, Alicia, thought so much of Vermont Green Up that she served as their Executive Director for a few years. Alicia had the pleasure of serving in that position with Bob Stafford on the board. She also made sure her father was out picking up trash with her on Green Up Day! 
   I congratulate Vermont Green Up, the financial sponsors supporting Green Up Day, and the thousands of Green Up Day volunteers. These are the people who continue to make the first Saturday in May an extraordinary day for Vermont's environment. The fact that we are now celebrating the 30th anniversary of Green Up Day is a testament to these Vermonters untiring dedication to the environment of our Green Mountain State.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we head into the twenty-first century, computer-related crime is one of the greatest challenges facing law enforcement. Many of our critical infrastructures and our government depend upon the reliability and security of complex computer systems. We need to make sure that these essential systems are protected from all forms of attack. The legislation I am introducing today will help law enforcement investigate and prosecute those who jeopardize the integrity of our computer systems and the Internet. 
   Whether we work in the private sector or in government, we negotiate daily through a variety of security checkpoints designed to protect ourselves from being victimized by crime or targeted by terrorists. For instance, congressional buildings like this one use cement pillars placed at entrances, photo identification cards, metal detectors, x-ray scanners, and security guards to protect the physical space. These security steps and others have become ubiquitous in the private sector as well. 
   Yet all these physical barriers can be circumvented using the wires that run into every building to support the computers and computer networks that are the mainstay of how we communicate and do business. This plain fact was amply demonstrated by the recent hacker attacks on E-Trade, ZDNet, Datek, Yahoo, eBay, Amazon.com and other Internet sites. These attacks raise serious questions about Internet security--questions that we need to answer to ensure the long-term stability of electronic commerce. More importantly, a well-focused and more malign cyber-attack on computer networks that support telecommunications, transportation, water supply, banking, electrical power and other critical infrastructure systems could wreak havoc on our national economy or even jeopardize our national defense. We have learned that even law enforcement is not immune. Just recently we learned of a denial of service attack successfully perpetrated against a FBI web site, shutting down that site for several hours. 
   The cybercrime problem is growing. The reports of the CERT Coordination Center (formerly called the ``Computer Emergency Response Team''), which was established in 1988 to help the Internet community detect and resolve computer security incidents, provide chilling statistics on the vulnerabilities of the Internet and the scope of the problem. Over the last decade, the number of reported computer security incidents grew from 6 in 1988 to more than 8,000 in 1999. But that alone does not reveal the scope of the problem. According to CERT's most recent annual report, more than four million computer hosts were affected by the computer security incidents in 1999 alone by damaging computer viruses, with names like ``Melissa,'' ``Chernobyl,'' ``ExploreZip,'' and by the other ways that remote intruders have found to exploit system vulnerabilities. Even before the recent headline-grabbing ``denial-of-service'' attacks, CERT documented that such incidents ``grew at rate around 50% per year'' which was ``greater than the 
    rate of growth of Internet hosts.'' 
   CERT has tracked recent trends in severe hacking incidents on the Internet and made the following observations, First, hacking techniques are getting more sophisticated. That means law enforcement is going to have to get smarter too, and we need to give them the resources to do this. Second, hackers have ``become increasingly difficult to locate and identify.'' These criminals are operating in many different locations and are using techniques that allow them to operate in ``nearly total obscurity.'' 
   We have been aware of the vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks of our computer networks for more than a decade. It became clear to me, when I chaired a series of hearings in 1988 and 1989 by the Subcommittee on Technology and the Law in the Senate Judiciary Committee on the subject of high-tech terrorism and the threat of computer viruses, that merely ``hardening'' our physical space from potential attack would only prompt committed criminals and terrorists to switch tactics and use new technologies to reach vulnerable softer targets, such as our computer systems and other critical infrastructures. The government has a responsibility to work with those in the private sector to assess those vulnerabilities and defend them. That means making sure our law enforcement agencies have the tools they need, but also that the government does not stand in the way of smart technical solutions to defend our computer systems. 
   Targeting cybercrime with up-to-date criminal laws and tougher law enforcement is only part of the solution. While criminal penalties may deter some computer criminals, these laws usually come into play too late, after the crime has been committed and the injury inflicted. We should keep in mind the adage that the best defense is a good offense. Americans and American firms must be encouraged to take preventive measures to protect their computer information and systems. Just recently, internet providers and companies such as Yahoo! and Amazon.com Inc., and computer hardware companies such a Cisco Systems Inc., proved successful at stemming attacks within hours thereby limiting losses. 
   That is why, for years, I have advocated and sponsored legislation to encourage the widespread use of strong encryption. Encryption is an important tool in our arsenal to protect the security of our computer information and networks. The Administration made enormous progress earlier this year when it issued new regulations relaxing export controls on strong encryption. Of course, encryption technology cannot be the sole source of protection for our critical computer networks and computer-based infrastructure, but we need to make sure the government is encouraging--and not restraining--the use of strong encryption and other technical solutions to protecting our computer systems. 
   Congress has responded again and again to help our law enforcement agencies keep up with the challenges of new crimes being executed over computer networks. In 1984, we passed the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and 
    its amendments, to criminalize conduct when carried out by means of unauthorized access to a computer. In 1986, we passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), which I was proud to sponsor, to criminalize tampering with electronic mail systems and remote data processing systems and to protect the privacy of computer users. In the 104th Congress, Senators KYL, GRASSLEY, and I worked together to enact the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act to increase protection under federal criminal law for both government and private computers, and to address an emerging problem of computer-age blackmail in which a criminal threatens to harm or shut down a computer system unless their extortion demands are met.  
   In this Congress, I have introduced a bill with Senator DEWINE, the Computer Crime Enforcement Act, S. 1314, to set up a $25 million grant program within the U.S. Department of Justice for states to tap for improved education, training, enforcement and prosecution of computer crimes. All 50 states have now enacted tough computer crime control laws. These state laws establish a firm groundwork for electronic commerce and Internet security. Unfortunately, too many state and local law enforcement agencies are struggling to afford the high cost of training and equipment necessary for effective enforcement of their state computer crime statutes. Our legislation, the Computer Crime Enforcement Act, would help state and local law enforcement join the fight to combat the worsening threats we face from computer crime. 
   Computer crime is a problem nationwide and in Vermont. I recently released a survey on computer crime in Vermont. My office surveyed 54 law enforcement agencies in Vermont--43 police departments and 11 State's attorney offices--on their experience investigating and prosecuting computer crimes. The survey found that more than half of these Vermont law enforcement agencies encounter computer crime, with many police departments and state's attorney offices handling 2 to 5 computer crimes per month. 
   Despite this documented need, far too many law enforcement agencies in Vermont cannot afford the cost of policing against computer crimes. Indeed, my survey found that 98% of the responding Vermont law enforcement agencies do not have funds dedicated for use in computer crime enforcement. 
   My survey also found that few law enforcement officers in Vermont are properly trained in investigating computer crimes and analyzing cyber-evidence. According to my survey, 83% of responding law enforcement agencies in Vermont do not employ officers properly trained in computer crime investigative techniques. Moreover, my survey found that 52% of the law enforcement agencies that handle one or more computer crimes per month cited their lack of training as a problem encountered during investigations. Proper training is critical to ensuring success in the fight against computer crime. 
   This bill will help our computer crime laws up to date as an important backstop and deterrent. I believe that our current computer crime laws can be enhanced and that the time to act is now. We should pass legislation designed to improve our law enforcement efforts while at the same time protecting the privacy rights of American citizens. 
   The bill I offer today will make it more efficient for law enforcement to use tools that are already available--such as pen registers and trap and trace devices--to track down computer criminals expeditiously. It will ensure that law enforcement can investigate and prosecute hacker attacks even when perpetrators use foreign-based computers to facilitate their crimes. It will implement criminal forfeiture provisions to ensure that cybercriminals are forced to relinquish the tools of their trade upon conviction. It will also close a current loophole in our wiretap laws that prevents a law enforcement officer from monitoring an innocent-host computer with the consent of the computer's owner and without a wiretap order to track down the source of denial-of-service attacks. Finally, this legislation will assist state and local police departments in their parallel efforts to combat cybercrime, in recognition of the fact that this fight is not just at the federal level. 
   The key provisions of the bill are: 
   Jurisdictional and Definitional Changes to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act: The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;1030, is the primary federal criminal statute prohibiting computer frauds and hacking. This bill would amend the statute to clarify the appropriate scope of federal jurisdiction. First, the bill adds a broad definition of ``loss'' to the definitional section. Calculation of loss is important both in determining whether the $5,000 jurisdictional hurdle in the statute is met, and, at sentencing, in calculating the appropriate guideline range and restitution amount. 
   Second, the bill amends the definition of ``protected computer,'' to expressly include qualified computers even when they are physically located outside of the United States. This clarification will preserve the ability of the United States to assist in international hacking cases. A ``Sense of Congress'' provision specifies that federal jurisdiction is justified by the ``interconnected and interdependent nature of computers used in interstate or foreign commerce.'' 
   Finally, the bill expands the jurisdiction of the United States Secret Service to encompass investigations of all violations of 18 U.S.C. &#167;1030. Prior to the 1996 amendments to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Secret Service was authorized to investigate any and all violations of section 1030, pursuant to an agreement between the Secretary of Treasury and the Attorney General. The 1996 amendments, however, concentrated Secret Service jurisdiction on certain specified subsections of section 1030. The current amendment would return full jurisdiction to the Secret Service and would allow the Justice and Treasury Departments to decide on the appropriate work-sharing balance between the two. 
   Elimination of Mandatory Minimum Sentence for Certain Violations of Computer Fraud and Abuse Act: Currently, a directive to the Sentencing Commission requires that all violations, including misdemeanor violations, of 
    certain provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act be punished with a term of imprisonment of at least six months. The bill would change this directive to the Sentencing Commission so that no such mandatory minimum would be required. 
   Additional Criminal Forfeiture Provisions: The bill adds a criminal forfeiture provision to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, requiring forfeiture of physical property used in or to facilitate the offense as well as property derived from proceeds of the offense. It also supplements the current forfeiture provision in 18 U.S.C. 2318, which prohibits trafficking in, among other things, counterfeit computer program documentation and packaging, to require the forfeiture of replicators and other devices used in the production of such counterfeit items. 
   Pen Registers and Trap and Trace Devices: The bill makes it easier for law enforcement to use these investigative techniques in the area of cybercrime, and institutes corresponding privacy protections. On the law enforcement side, the bill gives nationwide effect to pen register and trap and trace orders obtained by Government attorneys, thus obviating the need to obtain identical orders in multiple federal jurisdictions. It also clarifies that such devices can be used on all electronic communication lines, not just telephone lines. On the privacy side, the bill provides for greater judicial review of applications for pen registers and trap and trace devices and institutes a minimization requirement for the use of such devices. The bill also amends the reporting requirements for applications for such devices by specifying the information to be reported. 
   Denial of Service Investigations: Currently, a person whose computer is accessed by a hacker as a means for the hacker to reach a third computer cannot simply consent to law enforcement monitoring of his computer. Instead, because this person is not technically a party to the communication, law enforcement needs wiretap authorization under Title III to conduct such monitoring. The bill will close this loophole by explicitly permitting such monitoring without a wiretap if prior consent is obtained from the person whose computer is being hacked through and used to send ``harmful interference to a lawfully operating computer system.'' 
   Encryption Reporting: The bill directs the Attorney General to report the number of wiretap orders in which encryption was encountered and whether such encryption precluded law enforcement from obtaining the plaintext of intercepted communications. 
   State and Local Computer Crime Enforcement: The bill directs the Office of Federal Programs to make grants to assist State and local law enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of computer crime. 
   Legislation must be balanced to protect our privacy and other constitutional rights. I am a strong proponent  of the Internet and a defender of our constitutional rights to speak freely and to keep private our confidential affairs from either private sector snoops or unreasonable government searches. These principles can be respected at the same time we hold accountable those malicious mischief makers and digital graffiti sprayers, who use computers to damage or destroy the property of others. I have seen Congress react reflexively in the past to address concerns over anti-social behavior on the Internet with legislative proposals that would do more harm than good. A good example of this is the Communications Decency Act, which the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional. We must make sure that our legislative efforts are precisely targeted on stopping destructive acts and that we avoid scattershot proposals that would threaten, rather than foster, electronic commerce and sacrifice, rather than promote, our constitutional rights. 
   Technology has ushered in a new age filled with unlimited potential for commerce and communications. But the Internet age has also ushered in new challenges for federal, state and local law enforcement officials. Congress and the Administration need to work together to meet these new challenges while preserving the benefits of our new era. The legislation I offer today is a step in that direction.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week marks the 20th anniversary of our observance of National Crime Victims' Rights Week. This is a week that we set aside each year to honor and commemorate the victims of crime and those who serve them. It is appropriate to take this time to discuss the unmet needs of victims in our Nation's criminal justice system. 
   Tremendous strides have been made in these past 20 years toward ensuring better and more comprehensive rights and services for victims of crime. Today, there are over 30,000 laws nationwide that define and protect victims' rights, as well as over 10,000 national, State, and local organizations that provide assistance to people who have been hurt by crime. This is substantial progress, but there is still more to be done. 
   My involvement with crime victims' rights began more than three decades ago when I served as State's Attorney for Chittenden County, Vermont, and witnessed first-hand the devastation of crime. I have worked ever since to ensure that the criminal justice system is one that respects the rights and dignity of victims of crime and domestic violence, rather than one that presents additional ordeals for those already victimized. 
   I am proud that Congress has been a significant part of the solution to provide victims with greater rights and assistance. During the last two decades, Congress has passed several bills to this end. These bills have included: 
   The Victims and Witness Protection Act of 1982; 
   The Victims of Crime Act of 1984; 
   The Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990; 
   The Violence Against Women Act of 1994; 
   The Mandatory Victims' Restitution Act of 1996; 
   The Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 1996; 
   The Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997; 
   The Crime Victims with Disabilities Awareness Act of 1998; and 
   The Torture Victims Relief Act of 1998. 
   It is because of my continuing commitment to protecting the rights of victims that I joined with Senator KENNEDY to introduce the Crime Victims Assistance Act, S. 934, and its predecessor in the 105th Congress. This legislation offers full-scale reform of Federal rules and Federal law to establish stronger rights and protections for victims of Federal crime. This legislation further proposes to assist victims of State crime through the infusion of additional resources to make the criminal justice system more supporting of crime victims. In addition, this legislation would improve the capacity of the Office for Victims of Crime to provide more immediate and effective assistance to Americans who are victims of terrorism abroad.
   The Crime Victims Assistance Act would improve the lot of victims throughout the country. Unfortunately, it appears that in this Congress, as in the last, we will not take the simple and important step of enacting this legislation. Instead, the Judiciary Committee has focused on proposals to amend the United States Constitution. Such action is ill-advised and a constitutional amendment is unnecessary. I regret that for the last several years the pace of crime victim legislation has slowed dramatically. I have grave reservations about proceeding first to amend the Constitution and only then to design and enact the legislation that could help crime victims. To help victims we must act on legislation like the Crime Victims Assistance Act and we should be doing so without further delay. 
   While the Crime Victims Assistance Act is central to a package of victim assistance legislation, it does not stand alone. There is so much that we could be doing to help victims, none of which requires an amendment to the Constitution. If we truly want to help victims we should, for example, re-authorize the Violence Against Women Act. A bill to reauthorize those programs has been pending without action for too long. It contains over $3.7 billion dollars in funding over five years, funding that primarily goes to State and local programs that desperately need assistance. 
   Just yesterday, the Office of Justice Programs announced that Women Helping Battered Women in Burlington, Vermont, will be receiving $249,043 under the Rural Domestic Violence and Child Victimization Enforcement Program--a VAWA program that I initiated. Earlier this month, the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services received an award of $799,534 under the same program. This program, and other VAWA programs, meet the true and immediate needs of victims in every State. By contrast, the proposed constitutional amendment is a political gimmick, which promises much but fails to define real rights or provide real remedies or assistance. 
   We must also do more for victims of hate crimes by passing the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. This legislation amends the Federal hate crimes statute to make it easier for federal law enforcement officials to investigate and prosecute cases of racial and religious violence. It also focuses the attention and resources of the Federal Government on the problem of hate crimes committed against people because of their sexual orientation, gender, or disability. The Senate approved this legislation last summer as part of the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill, but it was dropped before final passage. We should pass it now, without further delay. 
   With a simple majority of both Houses of Congress we can pass the Crime Victims Assistance Act, which should have been enacted three years ago; we can re-authorize the Violence Against Women Act; we can pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. These laws can make a difference today in  the lives of crime victims throughout the country. There would be no need to achieve super-majorities in both Houses of Congress, no need to await ratification efforts among the States and no need to go through the ensuing process of enacting implementing legislation.
   I regret that we did not do more for victims last year or the year before. Over the course of that time, I have noted my concern that we not dissipate the progress we could be making by focusing exclusively on efforts to amend the Constitution. Regretfully, I must note that the pace of victims legislation has slowed noticeably and many opportunities for progress have been squandered. 
   I look forward to continuing to work with the Administration, victims groups, prosecutors, judges and other interested parties on how we can most effectively enhance the rights of victims of crime. Congress and State legislatures have become more sensitive to crime victims rights over the past 20 years and we have a golden opportunity to make additional, significant progress this year to provide the greater voice and rights that crime victims deserve. 
   I want to take this opportunity to commend all those who work so hard every day to assist victims of crime and to prevent others from becoming victims of crime. That is something I try to do every year and, in particular, during Crime Victims Rights Week. In preparing to do so again this year I was disappointed to see that no other Senator has yet recognized Crime Victims Rights week.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is today considering for final passage S. 1769, as amended by the House. I introduced S. 1769 with Chairman HATCH on October 22, 1999 and it passed the Senate on November 5, 1999. This bill will continue and enhance the current reporting requirements for the Administrative Office of the Courts and the Attorney General on the eavesdropping and surveillance activities of our federal and state law enforcement agencies. The House amendment is the text of H.R. 3111, a bill to exempt from automatic elimination and sunset certain reports submitted to Congress that are useful and helpful in informing the Congress and the public about the activities of federal agencies in the enforcement of federal law. I am also glad to support this amendment. 
   For many years, the Administrative Office (AO) of the Courts has complied with the statutory requirement, in 18 U.S.C. 2519(3), to report to Congress annually the number and nature of federal and state applications for orders authorizing or approving the interception of wire, oral or electronic communications. By letter dated September 3,  1999, the AO advised that it would no longer submit this report because ``as of December 21, 1999, the report will no longer be required pursuant to the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995.'' I commend the AO for alerting Congress that their responsibility for the wiretap reports would lapse at the end of this year, and for doing so in time for Congress to take action. The date upon which this reporting requirement was due to lapse was extended in the FY 2000 Consolidated Appropriations Act, H.R. 3194, until May 15, 2000--only a few short weeks away. 
   AO has done an excellent job of preparing the wiretap reports. We need to continue the AO's objective work in a consistent manner. If another agency took over this important task at this juncture and the numbers came out in a different format, it would immediately generate questions and concerns over the legitimacy and accuracy of the contents of that report. 
   In addition, it would create difficulties in comparing statistics from prior years going back to 1969 and complicate the job of congressional oversight. Furthermore, transferring this reporting duty to another agency might create delays in issuance of the report since no other agency has the methodology in place. Finally, federal, state and local agencies are well accustomed to the reporting methodology developed by the AO. Notifying all these agencies that the reporting standards and agency have changed would inevitably create more confusion and more expense as law enforcement agencies across the country are forced to learn with a new system and develop a liaison with a new agency. 
   The system in place now has worked well and we should avoid any disruptions. We know how quickly law enforcement may be subjected to criticism over their use of these surreptitious surveillance tools and we should avoid aggravating these sensitivities by changing the reporting agency and methodology on little to no notice. I appreciate, however, the AO's interest in 
   transferring the wiretap reporting requirement to another entity. Any such transfer must be accomplished with a minimum of disruption to the collection and reporting of information and with complete assurances that any new entity is able to fulfill this important job as capably as the AO has done.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to join the Senior Senator from Colorado in introducing the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000. We worked together closely and successfully with the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the last Congress to pass the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998 into law. I am pleased that Senator HATCH is again an original cosponsor of this bill. I am also pleased that Senators SCHUMER, REID of Nevada, SARBANES, ROBB, BINGAMAN, THURMOND, COVERDELL, and REED of Rhode Island are joining us as original cosponsors. 
   According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, more than 40 percent of the 1,182 officers killed by a firearm in the line of duty since 1980 could have been saved if they had been wearing body armor. Indeed, the FBI estimates that the risk of fatality to officers while not wearing body armor is 14 times higher than for officers wearing it. 
   To better protect our Nation's law enforcement officers, Senator CAMPBELL and I introduced the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998. President Clinton signed our legislation into law on June 16, 1998 (public law 105-181). The law created a $25 million, 50 percent matching grant program within the Department of Justice to help state and local law enforcement agencies purchase body armor for fiscal years 1999-2001. 
   In its first year of operation, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program funded 92,000 new bulletproof vests for our Nation's police officers, including 361 vests for Vermont police officers. Applications are now available at the program's web site at http://vests.ojp.gov/ for this year's funds. The entire process of submitting applications and obtaining federal funds is completed through this web site. 
   The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 builds on the success of this program by doubling its annual funding to $50 million for fiscal years 2002-2004. It also improves the program by guaranteeing jurisdictions with fewer than 100,000 residents receive the full 50-50 matching funds because of the tight budgets of these smaller communities and by making the purchase of stab-proof vests eligible for grant awards to protect corrections officers and sheriffs who face violent criminals in close quarters in local and county jails. 
   More than ever before, police officers in Vermont and around the country face deadly threats that can strike at any time, even during routine traffic stops. Bulletproof vests save lives. It is essential that we update this law so that many more of our officers who are risking their lives everyday are able to protect themselves. 
   In the last Congress, we created the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program in part in response to the tragic Drega incident along the Vermont and New Hampshire border. On August 19, 1997, Federal, State and local law enforcement authorities in Vermont and New Hampshire had cornered Carl Drega, after hours of hot pursuit. This madman had just shot to death two New Hampshire state troopers and two other victims earlier in the day. In a massive exchange of gunfire with the authorities, Drega lost his life. 
   During that shootout, all federal law enforcement officers wore bulletproof vests, while some state and local officers did not. For example, Federal Border Patrol Officer John Pfeifer, a Vermonter, who was seriously wounded in the incident. If it was not for his bulletproof vest, I would have been attending Officer Pfeifer's wake instead of visiting him, and meeting his wife and young daughter in the hospital a few days later. I am relieved that Officer John Pfeifer is doing well and is back on duty today. 
   The two New Hampshire state troopers who were killed by Carl Drega were not so lucky. They were not wearing bulletproof vests. Protective vests might not have been able to save the lives of those courageous officers because of the high-powered assault weapons used by this madman. We all grieve for the two New Hampshire officers who were killed. Their tragedy underscore the point that all of our law enforcement officers, whether federal, state or local, deserve the protection of a bulletproof vest. With that and lesser-known incidents as constant reminders, I will continue to do all I can to help prevent loss of life among our law enforcement officers. 
   The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 will provide state and local law enforcement agencies with more of the assistance they need to protect their officers. Our bipartisan legislation enjoys the endorsement of many law enforcement organizations, including the Fraternal Order of Police and the National Sheriffs' Association. In my home State of Vermont, the bill enjoys the strong support of the Vermont State Police, the Vermont Police Chiefs Association and many Vermont sheriffs, troopers, game wardens and other local and state law enforcement officials. 
   Since my time as a State prosecutor, I have always taken a keen interest in law enforcement in Vermont and around the country. Vermont has the reputation of being one of the safest states in which to live, work and visit, and rightly so. In no small part, this is due to the hard work of those who have sworn to serve and protect us. And we should do what we can to protect them, when a need like this one comes to our attention. 
   Our Nation's law enforcement officers put their lives at risk in the line of duty everyday. No one knows when danger will appear. Unfortunately, in today's violent world, even a traffic stop may not necessarily be ``routine.'' Each and every law enforcement officer across the Nation deserves the protection of a bulletproof vest. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that each and every law enforcement agency in Vermont and across the Nation can afford basic protection for their officers.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Foreign Operations Subcommittee held its third hearing on global health since 1997. Our first hearing was the first of its kind in the Congress, when we highlighted how disease outbreaks and impoverished public health systems half a world away directly threaten Americans. Since then, the interest in these issues in the Congress, the Administration, the media and the public has skyrocketed. 
   Today, there are about a dozen pieces of legislation pending which deal with some aspect of global health, the President has proposed major increases in funding and policy initiatives to encourage the pharmaceutical companies to invest in new vaccines against HIV/AIDS, malaria, TB, and other major killers, and the World Health Organization is setting the pace for us all to tackle these challenges with new energy and new resources. 
   This sea change is a reflection of the magnitude of the challenges and opportunities, as well as a recognition of the essential role the United States must play in global health. 
   There is no need to recite at length what has spurred this interest, but I do want to cite a couple of illustrative facts: 
   In America, each year we spend over $4,000 per person on health care. 
   In the countries where 2 billion of the world's people live in desperate poverty, only $3 to $5 per person per year is spent on health care. 
   It would cost just $15 per person per year to address most of the urgent health needs of those 2 billion people. 
   With that $15 per person, we could prevent or cure the many millions of deaths caused by tuberculosis, malaria, pneumonia, diarrheal diseases, measles, HIV/AIDS, and pregnancy related diseases. 
   That is the challenge we face. The benefits to the world, and to the United States, should be obvious. In an increasingly interdependent world, reducing the threats posed by infectious diseases and poor reproductive health, and the social and economic consequences of poverty and disease, is absolutely key to our own future security and prosperity. 
   The Congress has become increasingly seized with these issues. However, while I strongly support most of the bills that have been introduced--and I am a cosponsor of Senator KERRY's ``Vaccines for the New Millennium Act,'' they have tended to focus narrowly on the eradication of specific diseases and the development of new vaccines. 
   These are admirable and important goals, but I have always believed that global health consists of a broader set of issues that must be addressed together. Our primary challenge is to provide the resources to enable developing countries to build the capacity--both human and infrastructure, to support effective public health systems. That was the motivation for my infectious disease initiative three years ago, which since then has provided an additional $175 million to support programs in surveillance, anti-microbial resistance, TB, and malaria. 
   Today, in an effort to build on that initiative, I am introducing new legislation to authorize an additional $1 billion to support five key components of global health. The ``Global Health Act of 2000,'' targets HIV/AIDS; other deadly infectious diseases such as TB, malaria, and measles; children's health; women's health; and family planning. 
   Together, these five groups of issues account for over 80 percent of the disproportionate burden of disease and death borne by the 2 billion people living in the world's poorest countries. This legislation, an identical version of which Congressman Joseph Crowley has introduced in the House, has the strong support of the Global Health Council, the world's largest consortium of private and public companies and organizations, agencies and governments, involved in public health.  
   We have the technology to do this. The key missing ingredient is political will, and resources. 
   We can, and we must, recognize that we need to think in terms of far larger amounts of money if we are serious about global health. Every dollar of the additional $1 billion called for in my legislation, which is approximately double the amount we currently spend on these activities, is justified and urgently needed. And the payoff would be enormous, both in terms of lives saved and in future health care cost savings. 
   Senator MCCONNELL, the chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, has been a strong supporter of global health, and I will be working in the Appropriations Committee to obtain the funds we need to achieve these goals.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we Vermonters know that if you have a debt, you pay it off. It is time to pay off the national debt so our children do not have to. This will help us pay it off. 
   I thought it was time to introduce a dose of Yankee thrift in this debate. Though he is not a Yankee, the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin seems to share Vermonters' thrifty outlook. The amendment we are introducing is simple, but important. This amendment strikes Section 206 of the budget resolution to ensure that additional surpluses estimated by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reduce the national debt, instead of being used for irresponsible tax cuts. 
   The next CBO update in July is expected to increase the on-budget surplus by at least $40 billion over the next five years. As it now stands, Section 206 would allow Congress to apply those additional projected dollars to tax cuts, on top of the $150 billion in tax cuts already called for in the resolution. That would amount to $190 billion in tax cuts over five years, which is even larger than the fiscally irresponsible tax bill that Congress passed last year, and the President sagely vetoed. That bill would have cost $156 billion over five years and $850 billion over 10 years. 
   Without Section 206, which our amendment would strike, any windfall surplus estimated by CBO would go automatically towards reducing the national debt. In addition, striking this section would ensure that any increase in the projected surplus would further protect Social Security surpluses from additional spending. I thank Senator KOHL and our other cosponsors of this amendment for making the sensible choice, the thrifty choice, the Yankee choice, to make paying down the national debt our top priority. 
   In the 1980's, Congress went on a tax cut binge and left the bill for our children. During those years we all saw the lip service and slogans about balancing the budget, while Congress, President Reagan and President Bush simultaneously tripled the national debt and ran the biggest deficits of any nation in the history of the world. As a result, the national debt now stands at $3.6 trillion and the Federal government pays almost $1 billion in interest every working day on this debt. Now that we have surpluses, we have a chance and an obligation to pay off that debt. Let's not make the mistakes of the 1980's. Let's not just talk about balancing the budget and paying down the debt. Let's actually do it. 
   Nothing would do more to keep our economy strong than paying down our national debt. Paying down our national debt will keep interest rates low. Consumers gain ground with lower mortgage costs, car payments, credit card charges with low interest rates. And small business owners can invest, expand and create jobs with low interest rates. 
   A sound economy rests on a solid foundation of balanced revenue and spending policies. I am proud to have voted for the 1993 deficit reduction package, which was a tough vote around here, and has brought the deficit down. I am also proud to have voted for the 1997 balanced budget and tax cut package--tax cuts that were fully paid for by offsetting spending cuts, not by pie in the sky projected surpluses that had not yet materialized. 
   For the past seven years, the President and Congress have built this solid foundation by reducing the deficit and restraining spending. In 1992, President Clinton inherited a deficit of $290 billion. Since then, the Administration and Congress have steadily cut it down, turning it into a projected record surplus of $171 billion in 2000. Because of our sound fiscal policies, the national debt was $1.7 trillion lower in 1999 than was projected in 1993--that is $25,000 less debt for each family of four in Vermont. 
   These balanced policies have also kept interest rates down and employment up. Since 1993, the unemployment rate in Vermont has dropped from 5.8% to just 2.7%. Now that we have a projected surplus, we should stay the course of fiscal discipline rather than make irresponsible tax cuts. Paying down the debt, protecting Social Security and Medicare, investing in education, and providing hard working Americans with targeted tax cuts should be our top priorities.  
   The budget resolution we have before us would use almost the entire non-Social Security surplus for tax breaks which would primarily benefit the wealthy. CBO's recent estimates predict that over the next 5 years, the non-Social Security surplus will be $171 billion. The budget resolution calls for a minimum of $150 billion in tax cuts. When you take into account the cost of future interest payments due to a reduction in future surpluses, that brings us to $168 billion. That is 98% of the projected surplus. Not 25%, not 50%, not even 75%, but close to 100% of the projected surplus that will NOT be used to pay down the national debt, according to this resolution. This does not make fiscal sense. 
   Imagine that you had a credit card debt of $20,000 and you received a bonus of $1,000. Would you use only 2%, which is $20, of that bonus to pay down your substantial debt. Would you continue to carry a debt and waste money on interest payments when it is within your means to pay it down? I do not know of a single Vermonter who would make that choice and yet, incredibly, that is what the budget before us would recommend. 
   This budget resolution would use only 2% of projected non-Social Security projected surpluses to pay down the debt. Is this Congress serious about paying down the debt? Committing only 2% of projected surpluses to debt reduction suggests that the majority is not. Regardless of slogans offered or lip service paid to reducing the debt, the numbers speak for themselves. 
   Alan Greenspan and nearly every other economist who has testified before the Senate Budget and Finance Committees has stated that our nation's budget surpluses should be used to pay down the debt. And yet, the Republican budget resolution proposes far less debt reduction than the budgets developed by President Clinton and others. During markup in the budget committee, Senator LAUTENBERG offered an alternative budget that would have reduced $330 billion in debt over ten years, while providing almost $300 billion in targeted tax cuts--cuts that would go towards eliminating the marriage tax penalty, permitting the self-employed a full tax deduction for their health insurance and providing estate tax relief for family farmers and small business owners. Such cuts would be fair and targeted to help all Vermonters. 
   In 1993, Congress and President Clinton charted a course of fiscal discipline and the country has reaped the benefits of this successful plan. Republicans and Democrats can rightfully claim their shares of the credit for getting the nation's fiscal house in order. The important thing now is to keep our budget in balance, to pay down our debt, and to keep our economy growing. The amendment that I have offered with Senator KOHL will help us to reach these goals by ensuring that additional surpluses are used to pay down our national debt. I urge my colleagues to support our amendment.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to especially thank Senator COVERDELL, the resolution's chief sponsor, and Senator HELMS, Senator DEWINE, Senator CHAFEE, and Senator MCCONNELL for their leadership and support. 
   This is an extremely timely resolution which should send a clear message to the Peruvian Government and the Peruvian people that the United States cares deeply about the future of democracy in that country. It is my fervent hope that next week's presidential election in Peru is free and fair, but all indications from independent monitoring groups are that President Fujimori and his supporters have used every possible means to manipulate the electoral process. If the election is not deemed to be free and fair by independent observers, this resolution calls on the administration to review U.S. policy toward Peru and modify our political, economic and military relations accordingly. 
   We have changed slightly the resolved clause in the resolution from the language that was originally introduced on March 28. Originally, the resolution stated that the U.S. should modify its relations with Peru, ``including its support for international financial institution loans to Peru,'' if the election is deemed to have been unfair. That language has been replaced with language calling on the U.S. to modify our ``political, economic and military relations'' with Peru. 
   However, I want to emphasize that the phrase ``economic relations'' includes loans from the international financial institutions. I want to be sure that there is no misunderstanding or suggestion that by changing this language we have precluded the administration from modifying U.S. support for international loans, if the election is deemed to have been unfair and such action would be appropriate. 
   I agreed to this change, both to include the phrase ``military relations'' since our military relations should also be reexamined and modified if appropriate, but also with the understanding that the phrase ``economic relations'' includes the entire spectrum of economic assistance, both from the United States directly and through the international financial institutions.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island, and I thank the other Senator from Rhode Island, and I thank the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from New Jersey. I am proud to cosponsor the amendment to report the juvenile justice conference by April 20. I think the distinguished senior Senator from Rhode Island does the whole Senate and the country a service by his amendment. 
   Congress has kept the country waiting too long for action on juvenile justice legislation. It kept the country waiting too long for action on sensible gun laws. In fact, we are almost up to the first-year anniversary of the shooting in Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. 
   This morning I was watching the news, seeing some of these young people talking about what they went through, and the memories all came back about what had happened there when 14 students and a teacher lost their lives, nearly 12 months ago, on April 20, 1999. 
   I mention that date, April 20, 1999, because it has been 11 months since then that the Senate passed the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill. This bill was not a close call. The vote was 73-25. It was a bipartisan bill. It included some very modest but, I believe, effective gun safety measures. Ten months ago, the House passed its own juvenile crime bill. 
   Then we did not meet or have a conference; we did not meet to talk about it until about 8 months ago. Then we met only briefly. We did nothing and recessed for a 4- or 5-week vacation. 
   Now it is very easy to see what has happened. By delaying and delaying and delaying, some might have the best of all possible worlds. They could say: Yes, I stood up and voted for some modest gun safety laws; and at the same time they could say to the powerful gun lobby: Don't worry, it is not going anywhere. We have that bottled up somewhere in a committee, a committee of conference that never meets. Nobody even knows where it is. I doubt if there are 10 people in the House or the Senate who could even name the members of it. 
   The majority in Congress convened this conference on August 5, 1999, less than 24 hours before the Congress adjourned for its long August recess. 
   You do not have to be a cynic to recognize this for what it was: a transparent ploy to deflect criticism for delays while ensuring the conference did not have enough time to prepare comprehensive juvenile justice legislation to send to the President before school began in September, 1999. 
   This is a serious matter. The Senate Democrats and the House Democrats have been ready for months to reconvene the juvenile justice conference and work with Republicans to have an  effective juvenile justice conference report, one that has reasonable gun safety provisions, something along the lines of what we passed 3-1 here in the Senate. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership would not act. 
   I know they are facing fierce opposition from the gun lobby. One only has to turn on the television set to see an aging actor telling us why we should not be protecting our young children. I wish instead of listening to somebody who is acting a role and playing a role and has made their livelihood acting out other people's fantasies, they would listen to the Nation's law enforcement officers. These are the men and women whom we ask every single day to put their lives on the line for us. These are the people who die protecting us. These are the people most concerned about effective gun laws. 
   Ten national law enforcement organizations, representing thousands of law enforcement officers, have endorsed the Senate-passed gun safety amendments, and they support loophole-free firearms laws, from the International Association of Chiefs of Police, International Brotherhood of Police Officers, Major Cities Chiefs, National Sheriffs Association, and on and on. 
   I spent 8 years in law enforcement. I know how much they care. They believe in keeping guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. I am not talking about people who use guns for sports and hunting. I am talking about criminals and unsupervised children. 
   These thousands of law enforcement officers are asking us to do our duty. Instead of taking all these recesses and vacations, we should stay here a couple of days and pass juvenile justice legislation. 
   Every parent, every teacher, every student in this country is concerned about school violence. We know there is not any one thing that will stop school violence, but we do know that in the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill there are provisions that 
   help bring about safety in our schools. Don't we owe it to the parents, don't we owe it to the students, don't we owe it to the teachers to make this a safer country? We do not owe or should not owe anything to any powerful lobby, left or right. We owe our privilege of serving here to the people who sent us here, and the vast majority of people who sent us here, Republicans and Democrats, want us to move forward on this sensible piece of legislation.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to say a couple of words about one of my oldest and best friends in the Senate, the senior Senator from Alaska, Mr. STEVENS. 
   Last week, Senator STEVENS was named ``Alaskan of the Century.'' Most of us feel pretty fortunate if we get named for the day, or possibly for the week, and sometimes even the month in our States. He was named ``Alaskan of the Century.'' 
   Well, my good friend, TED STEVENS, deserves that. He has a way about him, as we all know. He keeps me humble. I might talk about the hardships of a cold winter day in Vermont. But then I see his eyebrows go up when he explains to me that 40 degrees below zero is just beginning to get nippy--it gets to 75 below in Fairbanks. At that point, I know I am beat.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was a conferee last year on the satellite television bill. I worked very hard, along with a number of my colleagues, to put in a provision that would have ensured the benefits of this bill would be shared by rural America through a loan guarantee program. 
   I appreciate the work of the Banking Committee under the leadership of Senator GRAMM and Senator SARBANES to report out a bill which provides a strong framework in which to move forward with this program. 
   I appreciate the majority leader, Senator LOTT, and the Democratic leader, Senator DASCHLE, who worked out an agreement with the committee leadership that put the bill before the Senate today. 
   Senator MAX BAUCUS of Montana introduced legislation with me last year. He has now joined with me on some very constructive amendments which I hope can be accepted. 
   I am here today to stand with rural America. I am proud to be a son of rural America. I know that oftentimes the needs of this special part of our Nation must be heard on the Senate floor. 
   I am not trying to change the main thrust or the intent of this committee-reported bill. My amendments don't alter the structure of the bill. My amendments simply say that I want the board, which will have the job of approving these loan guarantees for local-into-local television, to look at one thing. If we are going to have loan guarantees for local-into-local television, we should give additional consideration to the projects that can provide high-speed Internet access and emergency Weather Service reports to rural America. 
   If rural America is going to have high-speed Internet access, it is going to have to rely on satellite service; cable companies are not going to put wire out for it. For most of those parts of the country, they are not going to have the kind of fiber optics that might do it. But they can do it with satellite service. 
   I hope we will not allow a digital divide between urban America and rural America. Give us the special access through the satellite system. 
   For example, say the board that is going to do the loan guarantees has two equally balanced satellite systems that might give the same level of service, and at about the same cost, but one would offer high-speed Internet access to rural families; I say give that one the loan guarantee. 
   In America, there is a growing disparity between the digital haves and have-nots as portions of our society get left behind at the same lightning pace at which Internet develops. Our amendment closes this digital divide. 
   Having broadband, especially in rural areas, can provide opportunities to the handicapped, to the elderly, to education, and everyone, along with business opportunities and entertainment. Whether you are sitting on the dirt road at my home in Middlesex, VT, whether you are out in rural Utah, or whether you are in rural California, it means you can have the same kind of Internet business, the same kind of access to information, and the same kind of access to educational opportunities. 
   My amendment would ensure that as long as the loan guarantee is to be made, the high-speed Internet access ought to be financed under the loan guarantee program, if there is excess capacity. 
   All we say is, before the board gives a satellite company a loan guarantee to provide rural satellite service, ask, first and foremost, Will you provide high-speed Internet access for the people in rural America? If you do, you have a better chance of being supported. 
   I want to provide a little history on this matter. A provision which we offered to conferees last year would have provided up to $1.25 billion in loan  guarantees to help finance the delivery of local broadcast stations to rural America. I pushed for that amendment because certain satellite companies were concerned that they could not cost-efficiently provide ``local-into-local'' satellite service to markets more rural than about the top 60 to 70 markets. That meant that bigger cities would get the local broadcast television service but that rural areas, by and large, would not. 
   Other Senators, not on the conference were also vitally interested in providing this service to rural America. I know that Senator BURNS and his key staffer on this issue Mike Rawson worked long and hard to get this language included in conference. 
   In addition, Senator BAUCUS introduced a bill which I cosponsored to address these rural concerns after efforts to include it in the conference report failed. 
   I do not want to be misunderstood, I want to point out that the leaders of the satellite industry--such as Charlie Ergen of EchoStar who is known for his creative and innovative ideas--want to provide this local service. 
   I want to congratulate Charlie Ergen for his recent partnership with iSKY which will offer consumers two-way wireless broadband access via satellite along with satellite television service. This broadband access will be 30 times faster than current dial-up speeds of 56k according to news accounts. Charlie has often been a leader in this arena and he has done it again. 
   I also want to point out that in Montana or my home state of Vermont, or in Alaska, or a Great Plains state, or elsewhere, receiving local broadcast television over satellite is more than entertainment. 
   Local television provides local weather, local news about emergencies, and local public affairs programming. It is a way for residents to better participate in government and to more effectively influence local government, school board or zoning decisions. 
   This bill that we are debating is indeed very important. 
   I need to emphasize a very important point. Section 336 of the Communications Act of 1934 sets forth requirements for the rollout to digital television. This bill in no way is intended to alter or change those requirements. 
   Thus, it is imperative for the Board to only approve loans made to finance a local television signal delivery system that will be forward compatible and in compliance with the digital television rollout requirements in the Communications Act. 
   It is thus common sense that applicants for loan guarantees under this legislation must be able to show that the proposed signal delivery system will be forward compatible. Applicants should be required to show how their proposed delivery system can be readily adapted to deliver local television signals in a format compatible with the digital rollout requirements. Without this, I do not see how the loans could be other than risky. 
   This conversion to digital television also cannot be ignored. I have met with Jim Goodmon, the CEO of Capitol Broadcasting, on this matter and appreciate his visionary role and his willingness to take the lead. Digital TV is more than just a crystal clear moving picture. Digital TV can use multiple channels and datacasting on their single digital channel to better serve the public. I have been advised that the same digital bandwidth used to broadcast HDTV can also transmit as many as three video channels and a data signal on the single digital channel. 
   Thus, during the recent floods that devastated North Carolina, WRAL-HDTV, a digital station in Raleigh, was able to simultaneously broadcast on one digital channel: coverage of a basketball game; continuous local news on flood conditions; the continuous sweep of the local Doppler radar showing where the rainfall was the most severe and the direction of the storm; and, a data broadcast alongside the video services that enabled home computer access to specific flood, traffic, rainfall and emergency information. Jim Goodmon and his staff down in Raleigh did a great job during this crisis and I commend them. 
   Thus, I do not want loans under this bill to interfere with the rollout under the Communications Act. Rural America deserves digital service along with urban America. 
   I want to raise an additional matter. I am concerned that additional steps will be needed to assure full competition in rural areas and convenience to consumers. In a nutshell, multiple providers of satellite service may be needed in many areas to provide service to rural customers. However, if the set top boxes and satellite dishes are incompatible with these systems then competition will be reduced and consumers will receive fewer services or have to purchase additional satellite receivers at an additional cost of hundreds of dollars. 
   This same integration or interoperability problem exists regarding program and schedule information. Access to program and schedule information would enable third party satellite providers to create integrated program guides. This would enhance consumer choices and provide more competition. 
   Resolving these interoperability problems so that multiple satellite TV signals, offered by competitors, can be accessed by consumers in a convenient and inexpensive way is in the public interest. The FCC should use all its authority to resolve these matters. 
   In addition to the points I have just made, and the amendments I have offered, I want to point out improvements in the bill which I hope can be addressed at conference. I believe that the three-person Board should have more of an oversight and loan approval role and less of a day-by-day management role. The management of the program should be with the Administrator of the Rural Utilities Service. For example, references to the Board on page 28 should be struck and the Administrator and the Board should work out the regulations together. 
   Also, the Board should delegate responsibility for loan guarantees of up to $50 million to the Administrator. 
   It is also important, to assure that this bill is not biased toward the cable industry, that spectrum rights be allowed to be purchased or leased with the guaranteed loans. If cable borrowers will be able to purchase cable and install that cable using the guaranteed loans then satellite borrows should be able to use the loan proceeds for spectrum rights, which is their medium to deliver signals. 
   I also support the amendment offered by Senators THOMAS and JOHNSON that would allow the Federal Financing Bank and the National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation to participate in these loan guarantee programs. They could offer borrowers a lower rate than commercial banks and should not be excluded from this process. 
   In section 4(f) the full $1.25 billion in aggregate for all loans should not be artificially limited by including other debt in the $1.25 billion. In section 5(h) the Administrator, in consultation with the Board, should establish and approve the credit risk premiums and amounts. 
   To ensure that the Administrator can best protect the interests of the United States the text on lines 3 through 10 of page 38 should be replaced with the following: ``after exercising of rights and remedies by the Administrator any shortfall in the guarantee amount''. This would allow the Administrator working with the Board to restructure a loan if that were the best way to protect the government's interest. I am very nervous about section 5. 
   The Administrator should have more responsibility to manage the program. Daily management by a 3-member board that does not meet daily will not work very well. Also, section 5(l) appears to give state courts jurisdiction over the United States. 
   I am also worried about that unless more flexibility is provided under section 4(d)(2) and (3) that excellent loans for excellent projects will be needlessly denied because of the timing of when paperwork is done, or when the FCC approves certain regulations, or when spectrum rights are obtained. Also, the unnecessarily constraining collateral, security, insurance and lien requirements will make it very difficult for the program to work well. These duplicative constraints do not provide additional protection for the United States. 
   I will urge the conferees to provide a strong oversight role for the Board, greater ability of the Administrator to manage the day-to-day operations, more flexibility for the Administrator, a more level playing field with respect to cable TV, and other improvements.  
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I note we had discussion about whether people want to prolong this debate. We do want to have debate on the constitutional amendment. People have given tremendous speeches, pro and con, on this issue. I hope everybody will vote for cloture, for example. But let us not have any suggestion that anybody here is trying to stop a vote on this constitutional amendment. We all want it. But most Senators believe, if you are going to amend the Constitution, it requires at least more debate and more time than we might give to a simple resolution. 
   I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the Constitution Subcommittee. He has been a leader on this issue and so many other constitutional issues that protect the rights of all of us. He has done that ever since he came to the Senate. I applaud him, not only for what he said here but for his active work in the committee. 
   I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator, and my friend, from Massachusetts.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I applaud the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts for his statement as a decorated war veteran. He does not have to prove his courage or his commitment to our country or our symbols. He has already done that. He has done that in combat, and he has done it to honor himself but also the country. 
   Everybody is talking about when we will come to this vote and whether we should cut off debate. That will be a nonissue. I urge all Senators to vote for cloture. 
   I also point out that if this is so important--we are going to set aside all kinds of time today to do other things--we ought to spend time on this. We are talking about amending the Constitution, and we are talking about amending the Bill of Rights, contrary to what has been said on this floor, to amend the Bill of Rights for the first time in our 200-year history. I hope we will not do it. 
   There has been reference to one of our first flags, a flag that was designed in my State of Vermont and flew in battles there. I have that same flag in my office. As we all know, any flag, once used by the United States, can be used as a legitimate symbol of our country. I chose to fly the flag in Vermont. 
   Like all Vermonters, I revere the symbol. Every day when I am home in Vermont, that flag flies bravely and safely because nobody would touch it. Nobody would seek to destroy it. Nobody would burn the flag that flies in my front yard. We revere it and we praise it, not because we are required by law to do so, but because we want to as Americans, as Vermonters. 
   Every town hall in Vermont flies the American flag. Every one of our public meetings shows the Vermont flag. But I point out to all Senators, that one of the first flags of the country came from the State of Vermont. I will also tell you, Vermont is the only State in the Union that has not asked for a constitutional amendment on burning the flag. Why? Because we Vermonters do not need to be told by law or Constitution that we should show respect for the symbols of our country. We do it because we want to. We do not do it because the law requires us. 
   We are not like Cuba or China or Libya or Iraq or Iran or those countries that require a law to make people respect their flags and their symbols. We do it from our heart and from our sense of patriotism. That is the way most Americans are. We do not need a law to tell us to be patriotic. 
   Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate finally began the debate on S.J. Res. 14, the proposal to amendment the First Amendment of the Constitution to cut back on political protest and expression for the first time in our history. Earlier this week, on Monday and Tuesday morning, the debate was focused on the Hollings amendment and the McConnell amendment in accordance with the Senate agreement governing this matter. 
   Only Senator HATCH and I spoke for any length of time at all on the underlying proposed amendment on Tuesday morning. The debate then resumed after the votes on Tuesday afternoon. By my estimate, the Senate has spent less than 3 hours debating the proposed constitutional amendment. 
   Rather than continue that debate and conclude it, the majority is insisting that we now divert ourselves with an unnecessary cloture vote. The interruption of debate for this vote is unfortunate. I have said to the Republican manager from the outset that I did not believe the debate would be extended unnecessarily, but that I wanted to ensure that Senators had their rights protected so that any Senator who wished to be heard on this proposal to amend the Constitution, could be heard. 
   On Monday, the Senate heard from Senators MCCONNELL, BENNETT, DORGAN, CONRAD, HOLLINGS, SMITH and SESSIONS. Yesterday, thoughtful statements were made by Senators FEINGOLD, DURBIN, WELLSTONE, KENNEDY, KERREY, ROBB and MOYNIHAN articulating a number of reasons for opposing the amendment. In addition, the Senate heard from Senators HATCH and FEINSTEIN in favor of the amendment. Today, I expect to hear from Senators BYRD, DASCHLE, KERRY, FEINGOLD, CHAFEE and perhaps others. 
   At the outset we were confronted by a demand that we agree to limit statements in opposition to the proposed constitutional amendment to a total of 2 hours. Amending the Constitution is a serious matter, entitled to more time than the Senate spends on ceremonial resolutions. Two hours seemed unnecessarily restrictive. 
   Had we so limited the debate we may not have had the benefit of the extraordinary moments on the Senate floor last night when Senator BOB KERREY, who was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his valor in Vietnam, spoke to us from his heart about our country, our values and our flag. We may not have heard a riveting address from Senator CHARLES ROBB, himself a Marine highly-decorated for his service in Vietnam, in which he demonstrated his strength and consistency as one who fights for the Constitution and the values that make this country great. 
   We may have missed the opportunity to hear from Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN, a veteran of World War II, and the most knowledgeable of Senators, whom we will sorely miss when he retires at the end of this Congress after his extraordinary service to this nation. I urge those who were not here to experience that debate to read their thoughts and wise counsel. 
   I have every expectation that we could conclude the debate today in an orderly fashion. I know of no Senator who has threatened a filibuster on this matter. I know of no Senator who intends to engage in dilatory tactics. I know of no Senator who intends to offer any additional amendments or series of amendments. I know of no Senator who is using the rules of the Senate to delay the final vote on this matter. Accordingly, I know of no reason for the Republican leadership to have filed this petition for cloture and know of no reason for them to persist in insisting on this cloture vote this morning. 
   The Republican majority's timing of this debate has been strange for a long time. Last Congress, there was a half-hearted attempt to have the Senate consider the proposed constitutional amendment toward the end of a session when the majority knew that Senator Glenn was necessarily absent in connection with his NASA mission. Last year there was a rush to report the proposed 
   constitutional amendment from the Judiciary Committee in April and then no effort to consider it before the full Senate. Indeed, while the matter was voted out of the Committee on April 29, 1999, the Committee Report was not filed until 11 months later. The Republican leadership took almost a year to decide to turn to the matter, then filed a cloture petition on the first day of debate and now insists on a vote on cloture after just 3 hours of debate on the merits of the proposed constitutional amendment. 
   In fact, this cloture vote and our debate on it only diverts us from finishing the debate on the merits of the proposed constitutional amendment. This cloture petition and vote say more about the lack of seriousness of the Republican leadership with regard to this debate than anything else. 
   I have no doubt that the Senate will invoke cloture this morning. I also have no doubt that this hour would have been better spent debating the merits of the proposal. 
   Does the Senate know what we will do after cloture is invoked this morning? Lest anyone think that we will be staying on the proposed constitutional amendment to conclude debate and proceed to vote on the merits, let me  disabuse them of any such notion. No, following the cloture vote, the Senate is scheduled to proceed to two hours of unrelated debate and the introduction of other matter in morning business. 
   We will not be resuming debate on the proposed constitutional amendment until at least 12:30 this afternoon. At that time many of us in the Senate leadership are scheduled to be meeting with the President of Egypt. So this closing debate on the amendment will take place later this afternoon and possibly into this evening. 
   Just as the Bill of Rights serves to protect the minority in the country and the First Amendment protects even unpopular speech, so it is the role of the minority manager to protect the rights of those who wish to be heard in opposition to a Senate proposal. The rules of the Senate accord us at least that right. I know of at least five Senators who still wish to be heard in opposition to the amendment. As the minority manager of the bill, I am seeking to accommodate them and then to proceed to the final vote. I fully expect that we will reach the appropriate time for the vote long before the 30 hours of post-cloture debate would be consumed. I look forward to cooperating with the Democratic leader, the majority leader, and the Republican manager of the proposed constitutional amendment to bring this matter to conclusion at the earliest appropriate time after the completion of debate. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have worked out their problems and enabled the Senate, at last, to appoint conferees on S. 761. I co-authored S. 761 as it passed the Senate, and I look forward to working as a conferee to ensure that the final conference report respects the principles that this body endorsed when it passed that legislation by unanimous consent last year. The letter to conferees dated March 28, 2000, signed by all 45 Democratic Senators, reminds us of those principles. 
   I am only one conferee among 17 but working with the other 6 Democratic Senate conferees and the 10 Republican Senate conferees. I will endeavor to encourage electronic commerce with balance, fairness, and due regard for consumer protection.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the privileges of serving in the Senate is the chance to hear debates--some good, some not so good. Periodically, we hear greatness in speeches. The Senate just heard greatness. 
   I think all Senators would agree, whether they are for or against this constitutional amendment, that when the history of this debate is written, when the history books are written, the speech of the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. BYRD, will be in that recounting. This is the type of speech that students of constitutional history, students of the Constitution itself--and this Senator wishes there were more--will look to, and they will read and reread. 
   We sometimes forget that every 6 years, those of us who are fortunate to serve here, to serve more than once, take a very specific oath of office. I can think of times when various people have administered this oath, usually the Vice President of the United States. But I recall watching the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia administer that oath on a couple of occasions in his role as President pro tempore of the Senate. 
   There was one big difference when he administered it than when all the various Vice Presidents, Republican or Democrat, administered it. The difference is, they had a card before them and they read the oath. The Senator from West Virginia didn't need a card before him to do it. The Senator from West Virginia would stand there, tell them to raise their right hand, and he would administer the oath. There was no prompting. There was no teleprompter. There was no card. There was no book. There was the mind that carries the history of the United States Senate there, when he would do it. 
   I mention that oath because we swear we will uphold the Constitution, we will protect the Constitution. There could be no more solemn duty. If we are protecting the Constitution of this country, we are protecting the country itself. In this debate, that really is the issue. 
   I have said over and over again, I do not want to see the first amending of the Bill of Rights in over 200 years. I think we know from our history there have been times when we have amended the Constitution. We did it to provide, after the tragedy of the death of President Kennedy--I was not serving here at that time; the distinguished Senator from West Virginia was--a means of succession of Vice President. And in this era of the nuclear age and all, it is good we have that. But these are matters of enormous consequence. These are matters that can go to the very survival of our Nation and that make it possible, actually necessary, to amend the Constitution. 
   Let us not amend it simply because it is a matter of passing political favor. 
   I have spoken too long, and I do not wish to embarrass my friend. I have had the honor of serving with him for just over 25 years. There is hardly a day goes by that I do not learn something from the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. Today the Nation learned from the Senator.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in 1791, the State of Vermont, the State that I am honored to represent, was admitted to the Union. Kentucky followed. Congress then saw fit to change the design of the American flag for a time to include 15 stars and 15 stripes, one for each State. It was this flag, the one recognizing the addition of Vermont to the Union, that flew over Fort McHenry in 1814, and inspired Francis Scott Key to write the Star Spangled Banner. 
   Along with Vermonters and many others I find that flag inspirational, as I do the American flag with 48 stars under which my family fought in World War II. I remember the great pride my wife and I felt seeing the current American flag with 50 stars being carried in formation at Paris Island when my youngest son became the newest member of the U.S. Marine Corps. 
   Fifty years after that famous battle that inspired our national anthem in Baltimore's harbor, President Abraham Lincoln visited that city as this country confronted its greatest test. It was a time in which this nation faced grave peril from a civil war whose outcome could not yet be determined. Many flags flew over various parts of the United States and our existence as a nation was in doubt. President Lincoln used the occasion to reflect on a basic feature of American democracy. 
   As Professor James McPherson recently reminded us, Lincoln observed: ``The world has never had a good definition of the word liberty. And the American people just now are much in need of one. We all declare for liberty, but using the same word we do not mean the same thing.'' 
   Through the course of this debate, it has seemed to me that all of us here in this chamber would champion liberty. If any of us were asked, we would say: Of course we do. When I listen to the debate, I have to conclude that Lincoln's wish for a definition on which all of us would agree remains very elusive. 
   Ultimately, the debate over this amendment turns on the scope we think proper to give to speech which deeply offends us. For Congress to limit expression because of its offensive content is to strike at the heart of the First Amendment. Justice Holmes wrote that the most imperative principle of our Constitution was that it protects not just freedom for the thought and expression we agree with, but ``freedom for the thought that we hate.'' He also wrote, that ``we should be eternally vigilant against attempts to check the expression of opinions that we loathe.'' 
   Justice Robert Jackson made this point with unsurpassed eloquence in a 1943 decision, West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette. Unlike that small handful of wartime decisions upholding flag burning statutes on which the proponents try to base their claim of an expansive judicial tradition before the Johnson case, the Supreme Court, even in 1943, during the difficult days of World War II, recognized the fundamental tradition of tolerance that makes this country strong. The Supreme Court in a very difficult decision, at the height of world War II held that State school boards may not compel their teachers and students to salute the flag. Justice Jackson wrote:  
   To believe that patriotism will not flourish if patriotic ceremonies are voluntary and spontaneous instead of a compulsory routine is to make an unflattering estimate of the appeal of our institutions to free minds. 
   We can have intellectual individualism and the rich cultural diversities that we owe to exceptional minds only at the price of occasional eccentricity and abnormal attitudes. When they are so harmless to others or to the State as those we deal with here, the price is not too great. But freedom to differ is not limited to things that do not matter much. That would be a mere shadow of freedom. The test of its substance is the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing order. 
   If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.   
   What unifies our country is the voluntary sharing of ideals and commitments. We can do our share toward that end by responding to crude insults with a responsible action that will justify respect and allegiance that has been freely given. Justice Brennan wrote in Johnson:  
   We can imagine no more appropriate response to burning a flag than waving one's own.  
   That is exactly how the American people respond. 
   Respect cannot be coerced. It can only be given voluntarily. Some may find it more comfortable to silence dissenting voices, but coerced silence can only create resentment, disrespect, and disunity. You don't stamp out a bad idea by repressing it; you stamp it out with a better idea. 
   My better idea is to fly the flag at home, not because the law tells me to; not because there is something that says this is what I have to do to show respect; I do it because, as an American, I want to. 
   I am immensely proud of being one of the two Senators who has been given the opportunity to represent the State of Vermont. I fly that flag out of pride. Frankly, I am an ornery enough Vermonter that if there were a law that said as a Senator I had to fly that flag, I would not do it. I do it because I want to do it. 
   It is with the same sense of pride that I saw my son march in uniform with that flag flying. It is the same sense of pride when I see that flag flying over this Capitol Building every day when I drive to work. 
   The French philosopher Voltaire once remarked that liberty is a guest who plants both of his elbows on the table. I think what he meant by that is that liberty is sometimes an unruly, even an unmannerly and vulgar guest. Liberty demands we be tolerant even when it is hard to do so. 
   Our freedoms in this country are protected by the constitutional guarantee that dissent must be tolerated whether it is expressed in polite and deferential tones or in a crude and repugnant manner. We are a mature enough political community to know what every child knows: Unlike sticks and stones, words and expressions need not hurt us. It certainly does not justify the loss of rights that protect the liberties of us all. 
   Especially despicable gestures are hard to tolerate, but we do so because political expression is so central to what makes America great and what protects the rights of each of us to speak, to worship as we choose, and to petition our Government for redress. 
   As I have said before, I have taken such pride in going to countries with dictators, countries that require a law to protect their flags and their symbols, and in saying: We do not need such a law in our country because in this great Nation of a quarter of a billion people, the people protect our symbols, not because they are forced to do so but because they want to do so. 
   I was brought up to believe the first amendment is the most important part of our democracy. It allows us to practice any religion we want or no religion if we want. It allows us to say what we want, and the Government cannot stop us. 
   What does that mean? It means we are going to have diversity--diversity in religion, diversity in thought, diversity in speech, diversity that is guaranteed and protected in this Nation. And when you guarantee and protect diversity, then you guarantee and protect a democracy, because no real democracy exists without diversity. When you exclude and stamp out diversity, then I guarantee, you stamp out democracy, whether it is the Taliban or any of the totalitarian governments of history. If diversity, dissent, and free speech are stamped out, democracy goes with them. 
   American democracy has succeeded because we have found a way to live with that unruly guest with his elbows on our table of which Voltaire spoke, and to acknowledge acts which are disrespectful and crude and may, nonetheless, be lawful. 
   We protect dissent because we love liberty, not because we oppose liberty, but because we love it. The very impiety of these acts puts us to the test as votaries of liberty. 
   Wendell Phillips, the great New England abolitionist, wrote:  
   The community which dares not to protect its humblest and most hated member in the free utterance of his opinion, no matter how false and hateful, is only a gang of slaves.  
   No man disagreed more vehemently with Wendell Phillips on the burning issues of their day than Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina. Yet Senator Calhoun came to much the same conclusion in a speech on the Senate floor in 1848--more than 150 years ago. He said:  
   We have passed through so many difficulties and dangers without the loss of liberty that we have begun to think that we hold it by divine right from heaven itself. But it is harder to preserve than it is to obtain liberty. After years of prosperity, the tenure by which it is held is but too often forgotten; and I fear, Senators, that such is the case with us.  
   I represent a State that has a proud tradition of defending liberty, a State that encourages open debate. We are the State of the town meeting. You have never heard open debate, whether as a Member of this great body or the other legislative body, until you have been to a Vermont town meeting. There is debate, there are expressions, there is heat, and there is often light. 
   I am proud that in 1995, the Vermont Legislature chose the first amendment over the temptation to make a politically popular endorsement of a constitutional amendment regarding the flag. The Vermont House passed a resolution urging respect for the flag and also recognizing the value of protecting free speech ``both benign and overtly offensive.'' Our Vermont Attorney General has urged that we trust the Constitution, not the passions of the times. 
   But Vermont's actions are consistent with our strong tradition of independence and commitment to the Bill of Rights. Indeed, Vermont's own constitution is based on our commitment to freedom and our belief that it is best protected by open debate. In fact, Vermont did not join the Union until the Bill of Rights was ratified and part of this country's fundamental charter. 
   We are the 14th State in this Union. But we waited because we were so protective of our own liberty. At one time, we declared ourselves an independent republic. We wanted to make sure our people had their liberties protected. We in Vermont waited until the Bill of Rights was part of the Constitution. 
   Following that tradition, this Vermonter is not going to vote to amend the Bill of Rights for the first time since it was adopted, and certainly not going to be the first Vermonter to do that. 
   Vermont sent Matthew Lyon to Congress. He cast the decisive vote of Vermont for the election of Thomas Jefferson when that election was thrown into the House of Representatives. He was the same House Member who was the target of a shameful prosecution under the Sedition Act in 1789 for comments made in a private letter. He was locked up. 
   Vermont showed what they thought of the Sedition Act. They showed what they thought of trying to stifle free speech. Vermont said: Fine, Matthew Lyon is in jail. We will still reelect him to Congress. And, by God, we did. Why? Because we are saying: Do not trample on our right of free speech. 
   Vermont served the Nation again in the dark days of McCarthyism when I think probably one of the most remarkable and praiseworthy actions of any Vermont Senator, certainly in the 20th century--the outstanding Vermont Senator, Senator Ralph Flanders--he stood up for democracy in opposition to the repressive tactics of Joseph McCarthy. When so many others ran for cover in both parties--both Republicans and Democrats--Senator Ralph Flanders of Vermont, the quintessential Republican, conservative, 
   a businessman, came to the floor of the Senate and said enough is enough, and asked for the censure of Senator McCarthy. 
   Vermont's is a great tradition that we cherish. It is one that I intend to uphold. 
   The New York Times had it right earlier this week when it wrote in its editorial, on Monday:  
   If the Senate truly respected the Constitution it is sworn to uphold, it would not be trifling with the Bill of Rights and its precious guarantee of freedom of speech. Yet that is exactly what the Senate is doing as it considers the so-called flag desecration amendment--a mischievous addition to the Constitution that would weaken the right of free expression by allowing federal laws banning physical desecration of the flag.  
   The Washington Post also opposed this amendment in a recent editorial.  It noted that flag burning is ``only one among many types of offensive expression that the First Amendment has protected throughout American history.'' Then they added:  
   The principle that ``Congress shall make no law'' restricting speech loses much of its power when exceptions begin turning the ``no'' into ``only a few.'' The political points senators win by supporting this amendment are not worth the cost.  
   The first amendment says: ``Congress shall make no law.'' It does not say: Congress shall not make a bunch of laws or Congress shall not make some laws or Congress shall not make little laws versus big laws restricting speech, or Congress should not make laws on Monday versus Friday restricting speech. 
   It says: ``Congress shall make no law.'' 
   I remember being at an oral argument in the U.S. Supreme Court when I was a young law student, and Hugo Black was saying: I read the Constitution, which says ``Congress shall make no laws'', to mean ``Congress shall make no laws.'' I find it pretty clear. 
   The Chicago Tribune said this:  
   The amendment is a gross overreaction to a non-problem. Incidents of flag burning are exceedingly rare, and they do no harm beyond causing legitimate disgust among patriotic Americans. Disgust, however, is not an adequate reason to take the extraordinary step of altering the nation's founding document--and altering it to curtail one of our most fundamental liberties.  
   So many times I read editorials from the Washington Times, especially those that say that Congress takes, too often, a liberal bend. The Washington Times today said this in their editorial--and they oppose this amendment--they said they oppose it because ``it would be the only standing constitutional amendment to expand--not curtail--the power of the federal government.'' 
   They went on to say:  
   Laws reflect a nation's culture and Constitution. Both govern a people's relationship with the government. Sometimes, however, the two collide and the nation's leaders must decide between expressing the culture through law or abiding by constitutional restraints that limit government powers to do so. ..... The founders adopted the first 10 amendments, now called the Bill of Rights, as more than simply limits on Government's power, but rather an enumeration of rights on which Government could not trample.  
   Think of that. They are not saying, here are some extra powers we have in the Government. Rather, they are saying no to the Federal Government. These are rights you cannot step on. These are rights that belong only to the American people. These are rights that do not belong to a government. They do not belong to the Congress, to the executive branch, or the judicial branch. They belong to all of us, today a quarter of a billion proud Americans. 
   The Washington Times went on to say:  
   Conservatives in the Senate should take this opportunity to burn a flag--the white flag the faint-of-heart seem to fly on every tough issue. It is time to say, ``We trust the American people with their flag''--with a vote against this constitutional amendment.  
   That is what I say: Trust the American people. The vast majority of the people in this great country are patriotic. They respect the symbols of our Government. There isn't a rash of flag burning around the Nation. You don't see people running out to do it because we respect our flag, we respect our Nation, and we don't need a law to tell us to do that. In fact, that respect is diminished if we are told we have to respect the symbols of our Government rather than doing it from our heart. 
   Through this debate this week, some proponents of the constitutional amendment expressed their view that this is a nation in moral decline and that amending the Constitution to punish flag burning is thereby justified. I disagree. I would not put down the United States that way. I believe this Nation is strong. I believe there is far more civic virtue to the American people than some credit. I know that is the case in my State of Vermont. I know it when I go on line each week with the children of our State in grade schools and high schools around Vermont answering their questions. I sense a civic pride. I do not sense a moral decline. I sense a great nation moving into an even greater century. 
   I am not a fan of what in some quarters passes for culture nowadays, but let us not have a constitutional amendment to lash out at crude cultural influences. Let us discuss the issue of civic virtue. In fact, we in the Senate play a role, an important one, in setting the level of civic virtue in this Nation. So maybe a good place to start would be with ourselves and with our institution. It is not just what we say here that is important; it is what we do here. 
   Instead of telling the American people, the rest of the American people beyond the 100 here, what they can and cannot do, maybe we should talk about what we do and how we do it. We honor America when we in the Senate do our jobs, when we work on the matters that can improve the lives of ordinary Americans. 
   I began this debate by urging the Senate to conclude action on the juvenile crime conference. I urged the Senate to vote on increasing the minimum wage, to confirm judges our courts and people need. We have 77 vacancies today. I urged the Senate to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights and privacy legislation and other legislation that can make a difference today. Then we set an example for the Nation. As this debate concludes and after we vote on this, let us return to that hope and message. 
   Ours is a time of relative peace and prosperity. We should praise that. Because of that, it is certainly not the time, if there is any, to tinker with the fundamental framework that has helped make this country the land of opportunity and diversity and vitality it has been for more than 200 years. 
   The proposed amendment to the Constitution would do harm to the first amendment--protections that gird us all against oppression, especially oppression of momentary majority thought. It violates the precept laid down more than 200 years ago that ``he that would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression.'' It undercuts the principle that a free society 
   is a society where it is safe to be unpopular. A nation may lose its liberties in an instant of imposed orthodoxy. 
   I am sure many of us have read the letter written in 1787 by Thomas Jefferson in which he observed:  
   If it were left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.  
   For me, presented with the stark choice between an undefiled flag and an undefiled Bill of Rights, I, too, must choose the latter. 
   If somebody were to cruelly desecrate the flag I proudly fly at my home, then I would replace that flag. I would buy a new flag. But if somebody misplaces, changes, or diminishes the Bill of Rights that protects me, protects the other 99 Senators, that protects a quarter of a billion Americans, I can't replace that. I can't go to the store and buy a new Bill of Rights. I cannot start the process of 200 years ago over again. I cannot go back and say, because we have spent 200 years growing and maturing as a nation in protecting our rights under the Bill of Rights, now we can ignore all that because we have changed the Bill of Rights. 
   Don't diminish it. There are a lot of things that are unpopular, but we protect them. I think of the debate when I was a young prosecutor. Decisions would come down saying you had to warn criminal suspects of their rights--first the Escobedo case and then the Miranda case. I remember people, both in law enforcement and outside, saying we have to amend the Constitution. Some said we had to impeach the whole Supreme Court. We have to amend the Constitution. How dare they say these criminals must be warned of their rights? We want to be warned of our rights because we are not criminals. But the guilty accused have to be warned of their rights? What a terrible idea. 
   We got through that. What happened? Training of law enforcement got a lot better. The police got a lot better, the courts got a lot better, the prosecutors got a lot better, and our Nation got better. Today there are still people who are arrested or stopped by the police who are totally innocent, and they have their rights. They can stand on those rights. How many times have we said: I am an American; I have my rights? Well, it is true. We have wonderful rights in this country. That is why we are the strongest democracy in the world. Let's not diminish those rights.  
   Ours is a powerful constitution, all the more inspiring because of what it allows and because we protect each other's liberty. Let us be good stewards. Let us leave for our children and our children's children a constitution with freedoms as great as those bequeathed to us by the founders, patriots and hard-working Americans who preceded us. If we do that, successive generations will bless us, they will praise us, we will have a stronger nation. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention and courtesy and yield the floor. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last fall I became the 21st or 22nd person in the history of this body to cast 10,000 votes. When somebody asked me about those votes, whether they were all important, I said: No, a lot of them were merely procedural votes that we all cast, but some were important. Some of those 10,000 were. 
   Certainly this vote, whatever number of votes I might be privileged to cast on the floor of the Senate, will go down as one of the most important votes, as it will for all Senators. Whether they voted for or against the amendment, it will be one of the most important votes they will cast in their career. 
   I take a moment to commend the Senate for its actions this afternoon. It protected the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, in particular our first amendment freedoms. This has been an emotional debate, as one would expect, about a highly charged political issue. I believe the Senate fulfilled its constitutional responsibility to both debate and then vote on this proposed 28th amendment to the Constitution. 
   I thank Senators on both sides of the aisle, Democrats and Republicans, and on both sides of this issue--those who voted, in my estimation, to protect the Constitution as it presently stands and those who used their constitutional right to vote to amend the Constitution. There were thoughtful and heartfelt statements on both sides. 
   The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. FEINGOLD, who is ranking Democrat on the Constitution subcommittee, spoke eloquently on the floor, as he has in committee. He has been a leader on constitutional issues since he arrived in the Senate. I thank him for all he has done. 
   We heard from Senator KENNEDY. We heard from Senator MOYNIHAN, one of 11 Senators in this body who fought in World War II. We heard from Senator DODD, Senator DORGAN, Senator CONRAD, Senator DURBIN, Senator WELLSTONE, and so many others. All were thoughtful and constructive contributors to the debate. 
   In particular, I commend my dear and very special friend, TOM DASCHLE, Democratic leader, for his remarks closing this debate and also for his leadership throughout this debate. 
   Over the last 24 hours, we heard compelling statements--if I may single out a couple--from Senator BOB KERREY, Senator CHUCK ROBB, and Senator JOHN KERRY. Each of these men was an heroic veteran of the Vietnam war. Each was decorated for his bravery, and one had the highest decoration of this country, the Congressional Medal of Honor. Each of them rose to the defense of our freedoms. We have heeded their counsel. We have heeded their service, as we have our former colleague, Senator John Glenn, another American hero; Gen. Colin Powell, another American hero; our late colleague, Senator JOHN CHAFEE; and the many veterans who testified and contacted us urging that we preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution by not amending the first amendment to the Bill of Rights for the first time in the history of our great Nation. 
   I recognize the courage shown by the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. BYRD--Senator BYRD gave us a history lesson which will be studied long after all of us are gone--and the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. BRYAN, who, during the course of consideration of this proposal, looked inside themselves, looked to the principles of this country and changed the position they had held before. I commend them for that. I thank them. Their legacy will include their dedication to the Constitution and their vote to uphold, protect, and defend it. 
   I thank Prof. Gary May, Keith Kruel, James Warner, Rev. Nathan Wilson, Prof. Robert Cole, the American Bar Association, People for the American Way, and the ACLU for their views. 
   I thank Maj. Gen. Patrick Brady and Lt. Gen. Edward Baca for their testimony opposed to the position I have taken today. 
   I commend Senate staff on both sides of the aisle, those for the amendment and those opposed. I think in this case I may be allowed to thank Bruce Cohen and Julie Katzman of my staff, who spent far more hours than this Senator had any right to ask them to spend on this in answering every question I ever asked, anticipating those I was not wise enough to ask, and always giving me good counsel. Bob Schiff, Andrea LaRue, Michaela Sims, and Barbara Riehle, they should be proud of their work and of the Senate's action today. 
   I would also like to thank my friend and Chairman, Orrin HATCH, who has fought so hard for this amendment over the years. 
   Mr. President, I see other Senators seeking recognition. I will yield the floor in one moment. Again, I thank all Senators on both sides of the issue for their dedication to this issue. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on April 20, 1999, 14 young students and a teacher lost their lives at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. That was one of a series of deadly incidents of school violence over the last 2 years. The day that happened, the Senate Judiciary Committee was not engaged in working on crime proposals or public safety issues. That day, like today, we were devoting our attention to the symbolism of this proposed amendment to the Constitution, which would weaken the first amendment for the first time in history, so that we might make criminal the burning of the American flag. 
   Scores of our Nation's children have been killed and wounded over the last 2 years. They haven't been killed or wounded by burning flags. They have been killed and wounded by firearm violence. Our loss has been from school violence that has shaken communities across this country. 
   Unfortunately, the Republican leadership in the Senate and the House have not found time to have the juvenile crime bill conference meet and resolve the differences. So even though we have passed a juvenile crime bill, one that has modest gun control in it, the gun lobby said we can't meet on that. We cannot have meetings on it. We cannot resolve those differences. Instead, we step forward and say to the American people: We will protect your children, we will protect your schools, we will make sure we have a constitutional amendment banning the burning of flags. 
   Like all Americans, all parents, I abhor the burning of flags. But like American parents, especially those with children in 
   school, I know the danger to those children of gun violence and other criminal activity in this country is far more of a danger than the burning of a flag. 
   The Republican majority has not moved the emergency supplemental appropriations bill that is needed to provide Federal assistance to victims of Hurricane Floyd, or to help those who need fuel assistance, or to fund our men and women engaged in international peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo. Nor has the Republican majority moved responsibly to help fill the 77 judicial vacancies plaguing the Federal courts around the Nation. Nor has the majority yet moved a budget resolution to meet the April 1 and April 15  deadlines of the Budget Act. I recall that 2 years ago no final budget resolution passed the Congress, and I hope that experience of congressional inattention will not be repeated. We need to raise the minimum wage, pass a Patients' Bill of Rights, approve prescription drug benefits, and authorize the FDA to help stem the public health hazard of tobacco products. There is a lot to be done, and very little is being done. 
   I came to the Senate again last week to urge action on the juvenile crime conference. This Congress has kept the country waiting too long for action on juvenile crime legislation and sensible gun safety laws. We are fast approaching a first-year anniversary of the shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO, without any response from Congress except for a bill that passed the Senate 3-to-1, a bill that we all praised and took credit for, a bill that, unfortunately, didn't go anywhere. It sat in a closed conference, behind a door that says: Parents of America cannot be admitted. 
   If we did all our work, if we did something about gun violence, if we did something about our children who are dying in the streets of America, if we did something about school safety and something about juvenile justice, if we passed our budget on time, as the law requires, if we did something on medical privacy, if we did those things, fine, set aside a couple of weeks for symbolic actions. But let's do our work first. Let's do the things that should be done first. 
   Next month, Americans have to have their tax returns in, by April 15, because it is the law. It is also the law that says we are supposed to get our budget done. But we won't. The Congress of the United States has shown 2 years ago that we have not followed the law. 
   For some time I have been urging the Senate to rededicate itself to the work of helping parents, teachers, police and others to curb school violence. On May 11 last year, the Republican majority in the Senate allowed us to turn our attention to the important problems of school violence and juvenile crime. Over the ensuing two weeks the Senate worked its way through scores of amendments. The Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice legislation that passed the Senate last May 20, received a strong bipartisan majority of 73 votes. Under the plan put forward by the Republican leader, this juvenile justice legislation had become the vehicle for the anti-violence amendments adopted by the Senate last May. 
   I urged a prompt conference. When things bogged down, I took the unusual step of coming to the Senate to offer a unanimous consent request to move to conference on the legislation, which eventually provided the blueprint for finally agreeing to conference on July 28. 
   Unfortunately, the conference was convened for a single afternoon of speeches. Democrats from the House and Senate tried to proceed, to offer motions about how to proceed, and to begin substantive discussion, but we were ruled out of order by the Republican majority. 
   Since that time I have returned to the Senate a number of times to speak to these important issues and to urge the Republican to reconvene the juvenile crime conference. I have joined with fellow Democrats to request both in writing and on the floor that the majority let us finish our work on the conference and send a good bill to the President. On October 20, 1999, all the House and Senate Democratic conferees sent a letter to Senator HATCH and Congressman HYDE calling for an open meeting of the juvenile crime conference. On March 3, 2000, after yet another shocking school shooting involving 6-year-old classmates in Michigan, Representative CONYERS and I wrote again to Senator HATCH and Congressman HYDE requesting an immediate meeting of the conference. The response has been resounding silence. 
   I worry that after a major debate on the floor, one in which we have both Republicans and Democrats bring up amendments and pass some and vote down others, we then let the subject of juvenile justice languish. We have seen press releases, but the families of America have yet to see a bill. 
   Three weeks ago, I was honored to be invited to a White House summit by the President of the United States. He had three other Members of Congress--the distinguished chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, HENRY HYDE; the distinguished chairman of our Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH; and the distinguished ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman CONYERS. We met in the Oval Office in a rather extraordinary meeting. I have been to many over 25 years, and I do not remember one where the President stayed so engaged for such a long period of time in such a frank and open exchange. 
   The President concurs with the reconvening of the conference and action by the Congress to send him a comprehensive bill before the 1-year anniversary of the Columbine tragedy. But all of his entreaties have been rebuffed as well. We have been in recess more than we have been in session since that time. Take a couple of days and wrap this up, and send it to the President. 
   Democrats have been ready for months to reconvene the juvenile crime conference and put together an effective juvenile justice conference report that would include reasonable gun safety provisions. It bothers me that this Senate, under its majority leadership, cannot find the time nor the will to pass balanced, comprehensive juvenile justice legislation. 
   With respect to juvenile crime, I hope the majority will heed the call of our Nation's law enforcement officers to act now to pass a strong and effective juvenile justice conference report. Ten national law enforcement organizations representing thousands of law enforcement officers have endorsed the Senate-passed gun safety amendment. They support loophole-free firearm laws. 
   These are the ones who do: 
   International Association of Chiefs of Police; 
   International Brotherhood of Police Officers; 
   Police Executive Research Forum; 
   Police Foundation; 
   Major Cities Chiefs; 
   Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association; 
   National Sheriffs Association; 
   National Association of School Resource Officers; 
   National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives; and 
   Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association. 
   Should we not at least listen to the law enforcement people who are asked every day to put their lives on the line to protect all of us, and should we not at least listen to them when they say, Pass this modest bill? But no. We see the gun lobbies run all kinds of ads basically telling the Congress, Don't do it; we will not allow you to do it. The Congress meekly says, Yes, sir; yes, sir; we will let the gun lobby run our schedule--not those of us who are elected to do it. 
   I was in law enforcement. I spent 8 years in law enforcement. I know law enforcement officers in this country need help in keeping guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. 
   I am not talking about people who use guns for hunting or for sport, as my neighbors and I do in Vermont, but about criminals and unsupervised children. The thousands of law enforcement officers represented by these organizations are demanding the Congress act now to pass a strong and effective juvenile justice conference. As leader of the Democrats on this side, I am willing to meet on a moment's notice to do that. 
   Every parent, teacher and student in this country is concerned about school violence over the last two years and worried about when the next shooting may occur. They pray it does not happen at their school or involve their children. 
   We all recognize that there is no single cause and no single legislative solution that will cure the epidemic of youth violence in our schools or in our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to do our part. We should seize this opportunity to act on balanced, effective juvenile crime legislation, and measures to keep guns out of the hands of children and away from criminals. It is well past the time for Congress to act. 
   Instead, the Senate will be called upon to devote several more days this week to debating this proposal to amend the Constitution to restrict the First Amendment's fundamental protection of political expression for the  first time in our nation's history in order to criminalize flag burning as a form of political protest. We can debate that. But can't we take at least as much time to debate things that will actually involve the safety of our children? 
   I am prepared to debate the merits of the proposed constitutional amendment to restrict political speech. I contributed to an extensive set of minority views in the Committee's report that lay out the flaws in the proponents' arguments and the case for protecting the Constitution and our Bill of Rights. We have debated this before and must do so, again. 
   I treat proposals to amend the Constitution with utmost seriousness. Our role in the process is a solemn responsibility. But when we have concluded this debate, as we will in the next few days, I hope that the juvenile crime bill conference committee will complete its work. I hope that we will move the emergency supplemental appropriations needed to help our citizens hurt by Hurricane Floyd and by high fuel prices. I hope that we will vote to increase the minimum wage without further delay; I hope that we will enact a real patients' bill of rights, and that we will approve a meaningful prescription drug benefit, and that we will pass the statutory authority now needed by the FDA to regulate tobacco products. I hope that we will vote on the scores of judicial nominations sent to us by the President to fill the 77 vacancies plaguing the federal courts and our system of justice; and I hope that we will make progress on the many other matters that have been sidetracked by the majority. 
   My friends on the Republican side of the Senate control the schedule. They set the priorities. But I hope they realize that these are priorities of the American people and will allow us to vote on them. 
   Mr. President, on the proposed constitutional amendment we are debating, I note that the minority views in the committee report extend over 30 pages, yet we are asked to limit the debate on the proposal to 2 hours. Nobody wants to filibuster a proposal. But if we are going to amend the Constitution, especially if we are going to amend the first amendment, and especially if we are going to amend the Bill of Rights for the first time in over 200 years, I think the American people deserve more than a couple of hours of chitchat and quorum calls to discuss what we are going to do. 
   I look forward to hearing from Senator FEINGOLD, the ranking member of the Constitution Subcommittee. I look forward to hearing from Senator BOB KERREY, the only Congressional Medal of Honor recipient among us; or Senator ROBB, of Virginia, who is a decorated veteran and distinguished Senator; and, of course, the constitutional sage of the Senate, the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. 
   The Senate was intended to be a place for thoughtful debate, for the offering of amendments and for votes on amendments. We should not short-change this debate. Let us do justice to the task of considering this constitutional amendment before we are called upon to vote, again. 
   This afternoon we will first vote on the Flag Protection Act amendment offered by Senators MCCONNELL, BENNETT, DORGAN and CONRAD with the support of Senators DODD, TORRICELLI, BINGAMAN, LIEBERMAN and BYRD. Having reviewed that proposal, I intend to support it as well. It is a statutory alternative to the proposed constitutional amendment. 
   Now, let us remember one thing. No matter how Senators vote on the proposed amendment, either for or against it, there is one thing that unites every single Member of this body. We all agree that flag burning is a despicable and reprehensible act. It is usually done to show great disrespect to our country and our institutions and all it stands for. It has to be especially offensive to those who put their lives on the line for this country, whether in the Armed Forces, law enforcement, or elsewhere. 
   But the ultimate question before us is not whether we agree that flag burning is a despicable and reprehensible act. We all agree that it is. The issue is whether we should amend the Constitution of the United States, with all the risks that entails, and narrow the precious freedoms ensured by the First Amendment for the first time in our history, so that the Federal Government can prosecute the tiny handful of Americans who show contempt for the flag. Such a monumental step is unwarranted and unwise. 
   Proponents of the constitutional amendment note the views of distinguished American veterans and war heroes who have expressed their love of the flag and support for the amendment. Those who fought and sacrificed for our country deserve our respect and admiration. I remember very much the letters that came back from my uncle in World War II, and other friends and neighbors in subsequent wars. 
   They know the costs as well as the joys of freedom and democracy. Their sacrifices are lessons for us all in what it means to love and honor our flag and the country and the principles for which our flag stands. On this question of amending our Constitution, some would like to portray the views of veterans as being monolithic, when in fact many outstanding veterans oppose the amendment. 
   Above all, these veterans believe that they fought for the freedoms and principles that make this country great, not just the symbols of those freedoms. To weaken the nation's freedoms in order to protect a particular symbol would trivialize and minimize their service. 
   Last year, we were honored to have former Senator John Glenn, my dear friend, who served this nation with special distinction in war and in peace and in the far reaches of space, come back to the Senate to testify before the Judiciary Committee. This is a veteran of both World War II and the Korean conflict. 
   He told us:  
   It would be a hollow victory indeed if we preserved the symbol of our freedoms by chipping away at those fundamental freedoms themselves. Let the flag fully represent all the freedoms spelled out in the Bill of Rights, not a partial, watered-down version that has altered its protections. 
   The flag is the nation's most powerful and emotional symbol. It is our most sacred symbol. And it is our most revered symbol. But it is a symbol. It symbolizes the freedoms that we have in this country, but it is not the freedoms themselves. . . . 
   Those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, who died following that banner, did not give up their lives for a red, white and blue piece of cloth. They died because they went into harm's way, representing this country and because of their allegiance to the values, the rights and principles represented by that flag and to the Republic for which it stands.  
   These are powerful words from our former colleague, John Glenn, a man we all agree is a true American hero. 
   Last spring I wrote to General Colin L. Powell, our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Persian Gulf War, about this proposed constitutional amendment. I thank him for having answered the call and for adding his powerful voice to this debate. He wrote me the following:  
   We are rightfully outraged when anyone attacks or desecrates our flag. Few Americans do such things and when they do they are subject to the rightful condemnation of their fellow citizens. They may be destroying a piece of cloth, but they do no damage to our system of freedom which tolerates such desecration. 
   If they are destroying a flag that belongs to someone else, that's a prosecutable crime. If it is a flag they own, I really don't want to amend the Constitution to prosecute someone for foolishly desecrating their own property. We should condemn them and pity them instead. 
   I understand how strongly so many of my fellow veterans and citizens feel about the flag and I understand the powerful sentiment in state legislatures for such an amendment. I feel the same sense of outrage. But I step back from amending the Constitution to relieve that outrage. The First Amendment exists to insure that freedom of speech and expression applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree, but also that which we find outrageous. 
   I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants. The flag will still be flying proudly long after they have slunk away.

   Mr. LEAHY. Gary May lost both his legs while serving this country in Vietnam. He spoke about how he felt and why he did not feel that we should amend the Constitution on this point:  
   I am offended when I see the flag burned or treated disrespectfully. As offensive and painful as this is, I still believe that those dissenting voices need to be heard. This country is unique and special because the minority, the unpopular, the dissenters and the downtrodden, also have a voice and are allowed to be heard in whatever way they choose to express themselves that does not harm others. The freedom of expression, even when it hurts, is the truest test of our dedication to the belief that we have that right ..... 
   Freedom is what makes the United States of America strong and great, and freedom, including the right to dissent, is what has kept our democracy going for more than 200 years. And it is freedom that will continue to keep it strong for my children and the children of all the people like my father, late father in law, grandfather, brother, me, and others like us who served honorably and proudly for freedom. 
   The pride and honor we feel is not in the flag per se. It's in the principles that it stands for and the people who have defended them. My pride and admiration is in our country, its people and its fundamental principles. I am grateful for the many heroes of our country and especially those in my family. All the sacrifices of those who went before me would be for naught, if an amendment were added to the Constitution that cut back on our First Amendment rights for the first time in the history of our great nation. 
   I love this country, its people and what it stands for. The last thing I want to give the future generations are fewer rights than I was privileged to have. My family and I served and fought for others to have such freedoms and I am opposed to any actions which would restrict my children and their children from having the same freedoms I enjoy.  
   Many thoughtful and patriotic veterans object to this attempt to legislate patriotism. Those who testified before the Committee did not have to prove their patriotism. They are automatically, by their service to this country, true patriots. They spoke in eloquent terms about the importance of respect and love for country coming from the heart of a citizen or a soldier, not being imposed from without by the government. 
   I have thought so many times when I have been in countries where dictators rule to be able to say to them, do you have laws that require everybody to respect the symbols of your country, and they say, of course we have laws and we will prosecute anybody who doesn't obey the laws and respect the symbols of our country. 
   I say, we are better in our country. We don't need the laws. We are a nation of a quarter of a billion people and our people respect the symbols of this great nation and what it stands for, without having to have the ``flag police'' on the corner, without having to have laws passed by Congress. They do it because they honor those symbols. 
   For the same reason, my family and I fly the flag proudly at our home in Vermont. We know it is protected by the people of Vermont. We also know that it would probably be a very foolish thing for anybody to step foot on the property to do any damage to that flag. But we don't have to worry about it. People drive by, smile and wave. They know what a proud symbol it is and how proudly we fly the flag. 
   I remember what Senator BOB KERREY, the only recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor currently serving in the United States Congress, said last year: ``Real patriotism cannot be coerced. It must be a voluntary, unselfish, brave act to sacrifice for others.'' Senator KERREY reminded us that in this country we believe that ``it is the right to speak the unpopular and objectionable that needs the most protecting by our government.'' Speaking specifically of the act of flag burning, he added: ``Patriotism calls upon us to be brave enough to endure and withstand such an act--to tolerate the intolerable.'' 
   The late John Chafee, a distinguished member of this body and a highly decorated veteran of World War II and Korea, pointed out that just as forced patriotism is far less significant than voluntary patriotism, a symbol of that patriotism that is protected by law will be not more, but less worthy of respect and love. He said: ``We cannot mandate respect and pride in the flag. In fact, in my view taking steps to require citizens to respect the flag, sullies its significance and symbolism.'' 
   James Warner, a decorated Marine flyer who was a prisoner of war of the North Vietnamese for six years, has made this point in graphic terms. He wrote:  
   I remember one interrogation where I was shown a photograph of some Americans protesting the war by burning a flag. ``There,'' the officer said. ``People in your country protest against your cause. That proves that you are wrong.'' 
   ``No.'' I said, ``that proves that I am right. In my country we are not afraid of freedom, even if it means that people disagree with us.'' The officer was on his feet in an instant, his face purple with rage. He smashed his fist onto the table and screamed at me to shut up. While he was ranting I was astonished to see pain, compounded by fear, in his eyes. I have never forgotten that look, nor have I forgotten the satisfaction I felt at using his tool, the picture of the burning flag, against him ..... 
   We don't need to amend the Constitution in order to punish those who burn our flag. They burn the flag because they hate America and they are afraid of freedom. What better way to hurt them than with the subversive idea of freedom? ..... Don't be afraid of freedom, it is the best weapon we have.

   Mr. LEAHY. Those of us who oppose the constitutional amendment concerning flag protests understand that the political pressure for this amendment is strong, but our hope is that the Senate will in the end heed the wisdom of John Glenn, when he urged us to reject the amendment:  
   There is only one way to weaken the fabric of our country, and it is not through a few misguided souls burning our flag. It is by retreating from the principles that the flag stands for. And that will do more damage to the fabric of our nation than 1,000 torched flags could ever do. . . . History and future generations will judge us harshly, as they should, if we permit those who would defile our flag to hoodwink us into also defiling our Constitution.  
   We should not adopt a proposal that will whittle away at the first amendment for the first time in our history. We act here as stewards of the Constitution, guardians and trustees of a precious legacy. The truly precious part of that legacy does not lie in outward things--in monuments or statues or flags. All that those tangible things can do is remind us of what is precious--our liberty. 
   Our Constitution guards our freedoms and the first amendment is the marble of our democracy; it is the bedrock of our rights and constitutional protections. It guarantees the freedom of religion--the freedom to practice a religion or not to practice a religion, as you believe. It guarantees our freedom of speech. By doing that, it guarantees diversity. If you guarantee diversity, you guarantee democracy. Our bill of rights has been doing that for over 200 years. We are the envy of the world because of the way we protect our freedoms. 
   Look at all the other countries, countries that have not achieved and will not achieve greatness because they stifle dissent, because they do not allow freedom of expression. 
   If, God forbid, some natural disaster or terrorist act swept away all the monuments of this country, the Republic would survive just as strong as ever. But if some failure of our souls were to sweep away the ideals of Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, then not all the stone, not all the marble, not all the flags in the world would restore our greatness. Instead, they would be mocking reminders of what we had lost. 
   I trust this Senate will uphold the Constitution and the first amendment. I trust this Senate will uphold the lessons of history. I trust this Senate will tell the founders of this Nation, when they wrote the bill of rights, they gave us a precious gift that we would hold unchanged throughout our lives and the lives of our children and the lives of our grandchildren, because that is the way we honor our country. 
   That is the way we honor the sacrifices of so many millions who protected our freedoms throughout the years. 
   Mr. President, do I still have time?

   Mr. LEAHY. I wish to commend the Senator from Pennsylvania for his comments about town meetings. But I hope there are Senators in this body who will do town meetings. I expect there probably are some. I think they are the most advantageous thing we could possibly do in rural States like mine and, I think, like the distinguished Presiding Officer's State. I do not think either one of us would ever come back here if we were not willing to do them. I think that is the experience of most Senators. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I note that even without a time agreement, we have had a good debate. Senators on both sides of the issue have spoken. We have had practically no quorum calls. We should have debate like this where Senators can speak. 
   I see two of the most distinguished veterans of the Vietnam war on the floor, the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, Mr. KERREY, and the distinguished Senator from Virginia, Mr. ROBB. Both are highly decorated veterans of that war. 
   I ask unanimous consent that I be able to yield to the Senator from Nebraska, and then upon completion of his statement, that he be able to yield to the Senator from Virginia.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from Virginia for his statement, as I do the distinguished Senator from Nebraska. I can assure my friend from Virginia, a  young marine, my son, will receive a copy first thing in the morning at his home in California of the speech by the Senator from Virginia and a speech by the Senator from Nebraska. 
   Later this evening I am going to be having dinner with my oldest and dearest friend, a man I went to college with, a marine. He served the Republic and faced the same kind of reaction when he came back from combat from Vietnam. One day he was in a firefight in Vietnam, 2 days later he was walking down the street in his uniform in the United States, facing protesters' shouts. 
   Having risked his life, as did both of you, he said what saved him through that time was to know exactly for what he fought. At least he has had the satisfaction of seeing so much of that come full circle: The Wall here, people realizing that whatever the protesters had against the war, it should not be against the warriors, especially when they see the names of tens of thousands who did not come back. 
   I recall last year when the Senate rose as one to commemorate the heroism and valor of the Senator from Nebraska. Both of you have been decorated for heroism, both of you have faced near death in battle. I think both of you have come back here to serve your country in as strong a way as you did there, both as Senators but in bringing a calm, considered, integrity constantly throughout your service in the Senate. 
   I am not a veteran. I did not serve in battle. But I think how proud I am to have served in the Senate with both of you. I thank you for your speech tonight. I hope all Americans and all Senators will listen. 
   Mr. President, I met again today with Vermont representatives to the American Legion convention, which is taking place in Washington this week. These are people who deserve our respect, who served this nation in time of war, and who sacrificed so that our freedoms and way of life would triumph over Nazi Germany. As they gather, I pledge to continue to work with them to address the unmet needs of American veterans. Abraham Lincoln reminded us of our sacred obligation ``to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan.'' 
   Following the Judiciary Committee's hearings last year on the constitutional amendment to restrict the first amendment to protect the flag from use in political protest, I asked Maj. Gen. Patrick Brady, chairman of the Citizens Flag Alliance, what in his opinion were the most pressing issues facing our veterans. His response may surprise the proponents of the constitutional amendment. His response to my inquiry regarding the most pressing issues facing veterans was ``broken promises, especially health care.'' 
   I asked the same question of Professor Gary May, an American hero who lost both legs while serving his country in Vietnam. Professor May said:  
   Veterans and their families need services and opportunities, not symbolism. Recruitment for military service is predicated in part on a quid pro quo--if honorable service is rendered, then meaningful post-service benefits will follow. Our record of making good on this contract is not good. The favorable expressed sentiment for veterans by supporters of the flag desecration amendment would be better placed in support of extending and stabilizing services responsive to the day-to-day needs of ordinary veterans and their families.  
   Have we followed this good counsel here in the Senate? The unfortunate answer is no. Our veterans and retirees have received more high-sounding rhetoric about patriotism than real efforts on our part to resolve the broken promises. 
   During the debate on the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1998, the Senate voted to shift over $10 billion worth of critical veterans funding to help pay for extravagant highway spending programs. 
   Three times that year, the Senate raided veterans' programs: in the budget resolution, in the IRS Reform legislation, and in the VA/HUD Appropriations Bill. All three times, too many Senators voted against the veterans. If only a few more of those who now beat their chests about symbolic actions had voted for them, the necessary funding for veterans would have been assured. 
   We have had numerous other missed opportunities to increase the funds in the Veteran Administrations medical care account. Hospitals are seeing more patients with less funding and staff, and it can take months to get a doctor's appointment. It is not mere symbolism to fund those hospitals. 
   It has been estimated that a third of all homeless people in this country are American veterans. Many of those people may be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or other illnesses relating to their military service. 
   We all know that with the end of the cold war, military bases are closing. Military retirees who relied on the base hospitals for space-available free medical care are losing access to care. Many service members retired near military bases specifically so that they could enjoy the free medical care we promised them, but now they have to find health care in the marketplace. 
   I saw this in Vermont recently, where we had to fight--yes, fight--to keep adequate funding for the only veteran's hospital in the State. The in-patient surgical program at the White River Junction VA hospital was nearly closed down. If the closure had gone through, many elderly Vermont and New Hampshire veterans would have had to travel all the way to Boston for medical care, and many of them just cannot. The VA has recommitted itself to the White River Junction program, but this sort of thing is happening all across the country. 
   Last year, we finally raised the veteran's budget for medical care by $1.7 billion. I was particularly relieved that Vermont veterans finally received some assistance, in the form of a $7 million Rural Health Care Initiative. That funding will develop a number of innovative programs to bring high quality care closer to home. I would remind everyone that a majority of the Senate defeated an amendment offered by my friend PAUL WELLSTONE that would have raised VA medical care funding an additional $1.3 billion in Fiscal Year 2000. I was proud to vote for the increase, but disappointed that more of colleagues did not go along with this much-needed amendment. 
   We have a long way to go in ensuring that our veterans receive the health care that they so richly deserve. After many years of fixed funding and increased costs, we need continued funding increases, and new programs to provide higher quality care. 
   We must also keep our promises to those who have completed a military career. I have strongly supported efforts to improve TRICARE, the military health care system upon which military retirees rely for their health care. The system is generally sound, but problems have arisen in developing the provider networks and ensuring quick reimbursements for payments. Last November, I supported a TRICARE forum in Burlington, Vermont, to allow retirees and other participants to express their concerns directly to health care providers. Of course, we must also ensure that Medicare-eligible retirees continue to receive high quality health care. 
   What are we doing instead? In 1996, we changed the immigration laws to expedite deportation proceedings by cutting back on procedural safeguards and judicial review. The zealousness of Congress and the White House to be tough on aliens has successfully snared permanent residents who have spilled their blood for this country. As the INS prepares to deport American veterans for even the most minuscule criminal offenses, we have not even been kind enough to thank them for their service with a hearing to listen to their circumstances. Last year I introduced the Fairness to Immigrant Veterans Act, S. 871, to remedy this situation, but it has been bottled up in committee. 
   If we truly wish to do something patriotic, what we should be talking about is honoring our veterans. We should honor our veterans by answering Lincoln's call ``to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan.'' We should honor our veterans with substance rather than symbols. 
   If we fail to meet the concrete needs of American veterans and try to push them aside with symbolic gestures, we will have failed in our duty not only to our veterans, but to our country, as well. I wonder where we would be if the effort and funds expended each year lobbying for the constitutional amendment had been directed toward the needs of our veterans and their families  and to making sure that we honor them by fulfilling our commitments to them. 
   I see one of the many veterans of World War II serving still in the Senate, and I will yield to my friend and neighbor, the distinguished senior Senator from New York.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am joining Senators COVERDELL, DEWINE and HELMS in introducing a Joint Resolution regarding the presidential and congressional elections in Peru, which are scheduled for April 9. I want to thank the other sponsors for their leadership and concern for these issues. 
   These elections have generated a great deal of attention and anticipation, and they have also focused a spotlight on President Fujimori, who is running for an unprecedented third term. He is doing so after firing three of the country's Supreme Court judges, who had determined that a third term was barred by Peru's Constitution. 
   President Fujimori has often been praised for what he has accomplished since he first took office in 1990. He success in defeating the brutal Sendero Luminoso insurgency, combating cocaine trafficking, and curbing soaring inflation has brought stability and greater economic opportunities. 
   These are important achievements. Unfortunately, they have often been accomplished through the strong arm tactics of a president who has shown a disturbing willingness to run roughshod over democratic principles and institutions. 
   In the run up to the April 9th election, President Fujimori's and his supporter's disrespect for democratic procedures and the conditions necessary for free and fair elections has rarely been so blatant. 
   Journalists and independent election observer groups cite the Peruvian Government's control of key official electoral agencies, systematic restrictions on freedom of the press, manipulation of the judicial process, alleged falsification of electoral petitions and harassment and intimidation of opposition politicians as just a few of the problems plaguing this process. 
   In February, the National Democratic Institute and the Carter Center concluded that ``extraordinary, immediate and comprehensive measures'' were necessary if the Peruvian elections are to meet international standards. Those measures have not been taken, and NDI and the Carter Center recently reported that ``irreparable damage to the integrity of the election process has already been done.'' The Clinton administration, to its credit, has expressed grave concerns about the transparent attempts by President Fujimori and his supporters to manipulate the election process. 
   Mr. President, the results of the Peruvian elections will not be known until the final ballot is counted. But one thing is already clear. If the elections are not deemed to have been free and fair, it will be a major setback for the Peruvian people and for democracy in the hemisphere. And if that happens, the United States must react strongly. We will have no choice but to modify our economic and political relations with Peru, and work to restore democracy to that country. 
   That is the message of this resolution, and I urge other Senators to support it so we can send as strong a message as possible to President Fujimori and the Peruvian people. 
   Mr. President, I also want to take this opportunity to mention another matter that has caused me and other Members of Congress great concern. The Peruvian Government recently brought to the United States a former Peruvian Army intelligence officer who was responsible for torturing a woman who was left permanently paralyzed as a result. He was convicted in Peru, but released after a military tribunal reversed his conviction. For reasons that I have yet to get a suitable answer to, the U.S. Embassy granted him a visa to come to the United States to testify at a hearing before the Inter-American Human Rights Commission. That was bad enough. But the fact that the Peruvian Government saw fit to include such a person in its official delegation to appear as a witness in a human rights forum says a great deal about that government, and it should be condemned. 
   Finally, I want to express my personal concern about Lori Berenson, who was convicted by a Peruvian military court and sentenced to life in prison. The United States Government, other governments, Amnesty International and other independent human rights groups, have all concluded that she was denied due process. I and others have called for her release or trial by a civilian court in accordance with international standards. Innocent or guilty, every person deserves a fair trial, and I would hope that a country that professes to respect human rights would recognize the obvious--that Ms. Berenson's conviction was a miscarriage of justice.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at long last, after years of effort and several weeks of intensive, tedious and seemingly endless negotiations, we have reached agreement on civil asset forfeiture reform legislation. This is a significant improvement over the current system and should go a long way toward stemming the abuses that have so offended Americans across the country and the political spectrum. It is not often that we see the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, ACLU, NRA, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, American Bankers Association, the Institute of Justice, Americans for Tax Reform, and the American Bar Association joining together on the same side of a legislative effort. Working with Chairman HATCH, Chairman HYDE, Mr. CONYERS, Senator SESSIONS and Senator SCHUMER, we have crafted a good  bill, a balanced bill and a reform package that should move forward as consensus legislation and be enacted without further delay this year. I want to thank all who have worked with us in this process. In particular, I want to thank Janet Reno, our Attorney General, for working with us, meeting with us and lending her support to this effort and joining our coalition by agreeing to the consensus civil asset forfeiture reform legislation that the Senate is passing today. 
   Asset forfeiture is a powerful crime-fighting tool. It has been a particularly potent weapon in the war on drugs, allowing the government to take the cars and boats and stash houses amassed by drug dealers and put them to honest use. Last year alone, the government was able to seize nearly half a billion dollars worth of assets, cutting a big chunk out of criminals' profit stream and returning it to the law-abiding community. 
   Unfortunately, our nation's asset forfeiture is not fail-safe; it can be and has been abused. In hearings on this issue, the Judiciary Committee has heard examples of what happens when prosecutorial zeal skirts the boundaries of due process, leading to the taking of private property regardless of whether the owner is innocent of, or even cognizant of, the property's use in an illegal act, or whether the seizure is entirely out of proportion to the criminal conduct alleged. 
   I am well aware from incidents in Vermont about how aggressive use by Federal and State law enforcement official of civil asset forfeiture laws can appear unfair and excessive, and thereby fuel public distrust of the government in general and law enforcement in particular. For example, in 1989, federal prosecutors seized a Vermont homestead that a family had built and lived in for over a decade. The husband had pleaded guilty in State court to growing six marijuana plants, without his wife's knowledge, and was sentenced to 50 hours of community service, which he fulfilled by building bookshelves for the local public library. 
   Yet, one year after his arrest, Vermont State police brought his arrest to the attention of the federal authorities and Federal marshals seized the family's home and 49 surrounding acres. Hundreds of Vermonters rallied to the family's defense, including former prosecutors, until the case was settled with no seizure of the property. 
   In another civil asset forfeiture case, federal prosecutors again seized the home and 10 acres of a Vermont woman in Richmond, Vermont, after two hidden patches of marijuana plants were discovered on her property. Criminal charges against the woman were dismissed when she established she was unaware that her daughter and daughter's boyfriend were cultivating the 
   plants. Three years after the seizure, in 1990, a federal judge ordered the government to return the property to the woman, but by that time it had been destroyed by fire. 
   By contrast to the obligation under Vermont law that law enforcement agencies must ``ensure that the property is properly maintained,'' 18 V.S.A.  4246, the federal authorities who made the seizure of this property had no such obligation and did not take good care of the property. 
   In yet another civil asset forfeiture case, federal prosecutors in 1990, seized the home and 10.7 acres of a family in Craftsbury Common, Vermont, after the homeowners were convicted in State court of cultivating marijuana and given suspended sentences three years earlier in 1987. 
   Given the fact that in each of these cases, the underlying criminal charges were prosecuted by the State but the forfeiture action was taken federally, one might ask why these related proceedings were divided between the State and Federal authorities? The answer is simple: Vermont law does not allow the forfeiture of real property ``which is occupied as the primary residence of a person involved in the violation and a member or members of that person's family.'' 18 V.S.A.  4241(a)(5). 
   Moreover, under Vermont law, state law enforcement authorities carry a heavier burden ``of proving all material facts by clear and convincing evidence.'' 18 V.S.A.  4244(c). By contrast, federal forfeiture procedures provide more latitude on the property subject to seizure and more lenient requirements for federal law enforcement authorities to meet. 
   While federal authorities in Vermont have in recent years avoided such egregious asset forfeiture abuses, that is not the situation in other jurisdictions, prompting increasing and exceedingly sharp criticism from scholars and commentators of the federal asset forfeiture system, which in general requires far less from the government than any State forfeiture law. 
   Federal judges have also added their voices to the growing chorus of concern. In 1992, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals stated: ``We continue to be enormously troubled by the government's increasing and virtually unchecked use of the civil forfeiture statutes and the disregard for due process that is buried in those statutes.'' Four years later, the Eighth Circuit rebuked the government for capitalizing on the claimants' confusion to forfeit over $70,000 of their currency, and expressed alarm that:  
   [T]he war on drugs has brought us to the point where the government may seize ..... a citizen's property without any initial showing of cause, and put the onus on the citizen to perfectly navigate the bureaucratic labyrinth in order to liberate what is presumptively his or hers in the first place. ..... Should the citizen prove inept, the government may keep the property, without ever having to justify or explain its actions.  
   Similarly, the Seventh Circuit recently expressed its belief that ``the government's conduct in forfeiture cases leaves much to be desired,'' and ordered the return of over $500,000 in currency that had been improperly seized from a Chicago pizzeria. 
   Under current law, the property owner--not the government--bears the burden of proof. All the 
   government must do is make an initial showing of probable cause that the property is ``guilty'' and subject to forfeiture. The property owner must then prove a negative--that the property was not involved in any wrongdoing. It is time to bring this law in line with our modern principles of due process and fair play, and reform forfeiture procedures to ensure that innocent property owners are adequately protected. 
   The Hyde-Conyers civil asset forfeiture reform bill, H.R. 1658, passed the House by an overwhelming bipartisan majority (375-48) last June. After lengthy negotiations with the Department of Justice, Chairman HATCH and I introduced a Senate civil asset forfeiture reform bill, S.1931. Our bill addressed every major concern that the Department had raised in our hearings and in the Statement of Administration Policy regarding the Hyde-Conyers bill, and struck a fair compromise on those issues. 
   For example, the Hyde-Conyers bill put the burden of proof on the Government by clear and convincing evidence. We put the burden of proof on the Government by a preponderance of the evidence. The preponderance standard is used in virtually all other civil cases, and we believe it is sufficient to protect the interests of property owners. 
   The Hyde-Conyers bill authorized courts to appoint counsel for any indigent person who asserted an interest in seized property. Although I am sympathetic to that proposal--justice should not be only for the wealthy--the Administration strongly opposed it. We provided for appointment of counsel only in the rare case where the property subject to forfeiture was the claimant's primary residence. In other cases, a claimant could recoup attorney fees only if she substantially prevailed in challenging the forfeiture. 
   We are grateful for the support of so many members of the Committee and others over the last year. The Hatch-Leahy bill was endorsed by the last six Attorneys General of the United States from both parties, William Barr, Richard Thornburgh, Edwin Meese, Benjamin Civiletti, Griffin Bell, and Nicholas Katzenbach, and a wide range of organizations. 
   Although I knew that we had met the Department more than half way in our bill, we did not stop there. We have met with and worked with Senators SESSIONS and SCHUMER, who had introduced a different type of bill, to see whether we might find common ground. After weeks of intensive efforts, we succeeded in coming together. For our part, Chairman HATCH and I accepted more than 30 substantive changes to the provisions in the Hatch-Leahy bill, plus about a dozen new sections to the bill that give law enforcement new, but measured, authority. In  essence we combined the Hatch-Leahy Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act, S. 1931, with suggestions from the Sessions-Schumer bill to form a civil asset forfeiture legislative package that we can all agree to support. 
   Among the important reforms made by the Hatch-Leahy-Sessions-Schumer substitute amendment to H.R. 1658, which the Senate passes today, are the following: 
   Burden of proof. The substitute amendment puts the burden of proof on the government by a preponderance of the evidence. 
   Cost bond. Another core reform of the substitute amendment is the elimination of the so-called ``cost bond.'' Under current law, a property owner who seeks to recover his property after it has been seized by the government must pay for the privilege by posting a bond with the court. No other federal statute requires a cost bond, and no State requires a cost bond in civil forfeiture cases. 
   The government has defended the cost bond, not as a device for ensuring that its court costs are covered, but as a way of deterring frivolous claims. Of course, we are all in favor of deterring frivolous claims, but there are ways to deter frivolous claims without offending the fundamental principle of equal and open access to the courts, a bedrock of our American system of justice. 
   The substitute amendment provides that a person who challenges a forfeiture must file his claim on oath, under penalty of perjury. It also provides for imposition of a civil fine, in cases where the claimant's assertion of an interest in the property was frivolous. In addition, claimants will continue to bear the substantial costs of litigating their claims in court, and they and their attorneys will remain subject to the general sanctions for bad faith in instituting or conducting litigation. Frivolous prisoner claimants will be barred from repeated filings on proper court findings. The added burden of the ``cost bond'' serves no legitimate purpose. 
   Legal assistance and attorney fees. The substitute amendment permits courts to authorize counsel to represent an indigent claimant only if the claimant is already represented by a court-appointed attorney in connection with a related federal criminal case. This is both fair and efficient, and eliminates any appearance that the government chose to pursue the forfeiture in a civil proceeding rather than as part of the criminal case in order to deprive the claimant of his right to counsel. 
   Beyond this, the substitute amendment ensures that when the government seeks to forfeit an indigent person's primary residence, that person will be afforded representation by the Legal Services Corporation. When a forfeiture action can result in a claimant's eviction and homelessness, there is more at stake than just a property interest, and it is fair and just that the claimant be provided with an attorney if he cannot otherwise afford one. The Legal Services Corporation will be paid by the government for providing representation in these cases. 
   For claimants who are not provided with counsel, the substitute allows for the recovery of reasonable attorney fees and costs if they substantially prevail on their claim. The bill also makes the government liable for post-judgment interest on any money judgment, and imputed interest in certain cases involving currency or negotiable instruments. 
   Filing deadlines. Under current law, a property owner has only 20 days from the date of first publication of the notice of seizure to file a claim challenging an administrative forfeiture, and only 10 days to file a claim challenging a judicial forfeiture. It is therefore unlikely that anyone who misses the first of three published notices will be able to file a timely claim. The substitute extends the property owner's time to file a claim following 
   the commencement of an administrative or judicial forfeiture action to 30 days. The bill also codifies current Department of Justice policy with respect to the time period for sending notice of seizure, and establishes a 90-day period for filing a complaint. 
   Release of property for hardship. The substitute will allow a property owner to hold on to his property pending the final disposition of the case, if he can show that continued possession by the government will cause the owner substantial hardship, such as preventing him from working, and that this hardship outweighs the risk that the property will be destroyed or concealed if returned to the owner during the pendency of the case. Unlike H.R. 1658, the substitute adopts the primary safeguards that the Justice Department wanted added to the provision--that property owners must have sufficient ties to the community to provide assurance that the property will not disappear, and that certain property, such as currency and property particularly outfitted for use in illegal activities, shall not be returned. Government cannot obtain a grand jury subpoena to obtain such documents. 
   Criminal proceeds. The substitute also brings clarity and fairness to the confused body of case law concerning the definition of criminal proceeds. Specifically, in cases involving lawful goods or lawful services that are sold or provided in an illegal manner, the term ``proceeds'' is defined to mean the amount of money acquired through the illegal transactions resulting in the forfeiture, less the direct costs incurred in providing the goods or services. An exception is made for cases involving certain health care fraud schemes, since it would make no sense to allow those who provide unnecessary services to deduct the cost of those unnecessary services. Having resolved this important matter, the substitute amendment broadly extends the government's authority to forfeit criminal proceeds under the civil asset forfeiture laws. 
   Fugitive disentitlement. The Supreme Court in 1996 disallowed the judge-made doctrine that a fugitive avoiding the jurisdiction of the U.S. courts in a criminal case may not contest a civil forfeiture; however, the Court left open the possibility that Congress could establish such doctrine by statute. The Court was responding, in part, to the government's record of seeking forfeiture of property even though the property is not subject to forfeiture (e.g., because the statute of limitations has expired), when the government believes that the fugitive owner will not be permitted to contest the forfeiture. Opponents of the fugitive disentitlement doctrine say that the prosecutors have gone so far as to indict people whom they know will never return to this country, so that they can invoke the doctrine in civil forfeiture proceedings against such persons' U.S. assets. The substitute provides a statutory basis for a judge to disallow a civil asset forfeiture claim by a fugitive, while leaving judges discretion to allow such a claim in the interests of justice. 
   Senator HATCH and I share a longstanding and deeply-held appreciation for law enforcement and the officers who work on the front lines to protect our families and communities, and we have worked together on a number of crime-related issues in the past. Recently, for example, we have led the Senate in passing a number of legislative initiatives of importance to State and local law enforcement, including the Bulletproof Vests Partnership Act of 1998, Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998, Care for Police Survivors Act of 1998, the Railroad Police Officers Training Act of 1999, and the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 1999. I want to commend him for his commitment, not just to law enforcement, but to the rights of all Americans. It has been my pleasure to work with him on this issue, to bring balance back in the relationship between our police forces and the citizens of this country. 
   It has been a privilege to work with Representatives HYDE and CONYERS on this important legislation. And we greatly appreciate the contributions made by Senators SESSIONS and SCHUMER, both knowledgeable and experienced legislators in this area. 
   I would also like to thank the Senate and House staff who worked so hard to bring this matter to closure: On my staff, Julie Katzman and Beryl Howell; in addition, George Fishman, who has been dedicated to this project for so many years, Manus Cooney, Rhett DeHart, Ed Haden, Ben Lawsky, Tom Mooney, John Dudas, Julian Epstein, Perry Apelbaum, and Cori Flam--their efforts made this day possible. Thanks are also due to Bill Jensen and the other hardworking members of the Senate's Office of Legislative Counsel.  
   Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to David Smith, a leading expert on civil asset forfeiture, who gave tirelessly of his time over the past few months. His expertise and good counsel were invaluable in producing the legislation that the Senate passes today. 
   It is time for Congress to catch up with the American people and the courts and do the right thing on this important issue of fairness. I am glad that the Senate is acting without delay to pass this long overdue reform legislation.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very hopeful that this bill can, at long last, make crop insurance work for all regions of our nation. It includes creative provisions to bring new producers under its protections, and to bring new crops under its protections. The compromise worked out yesterday protects what the Midwest wanted while reaching out to other regions and producers. 
   Historic participation in New England has been very low--this bill helps address this issue. Crop insurance will give our producers one more tool to help manage risk--risks from ice storms, droughts, flood, hail and other natural disasters. 
   I want to thank Senators ROBERTS and KERREY for their leadership and willingness to include our region, so that we can all now vote together for this effort. 
   Chairman LUGAR and Ranking Member HARKIN were faced with a very difficult challenge--leadership of the Agriculture Committee, as I well know, can be a very difficult balancing act. Also the Democratic leader and his staff--Zabrae Valentine--were extremely helpful in delicate negotiations. 
   Bev Paul with Senator KERREY, Mark Halveson with Senator HARKIN, Dave Johnson, Keith Luse, Michael Knipe and Andy Morton with Chairman LUGAR, put in very long hours in this massive effort. Ken Ackerman, of USDA, provided excellent technical advice in this complex area. Senator CONRAD and his staff Scott Carlson put a huge amount of effort into this. 
   I am grateful that the Leahy, Torricelli, Schumer, Rockefeller, Reed, and Kennedy amendment was included in the managers' package. 
   The Senate has spoken in a united voice on this amendment and it is crucial that it be included in any conference report.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize two outstanding Vermont journalists, both affiliated with my alma mater, St. Michael's College, and both recently elected to the New England Press Association Hall of Fame. This prestigious honor recognizes lifetime achievements in journalism. I am well acquainted with the work of both, and know that this recognition is well deserved. 
   The late John D. Donoghue was the first Public Relations/Sports Information Director at St. Michael's, the first chairman of the Journalism Department there, was a music and arts critic for 35 years at the Burlington Free Press, and Executive Editor of the Vermont Catholic Tribune. During his  tenure as professor and journalist, John Donoghue worked through his association with the New England Press Association and Vermont Press Association to improve professionalism within the industry, and fought for the public's right to know. He was a trailblazer among journalists from my home state, and his legacy continues in Vermont, across the United States, and in the foreign press, through his students who have successfully pursued journalism careers. 
   Michael Donoghue has served Vermonters for three decades as a journalist at the Burlington Free Press, and in the tradition of his father, teaches journalism at St. Michael's College. During Mike's tenure at the Free Press, he has been at the center of efforts to improve reporters' access to information, thus increasing Vermonters' access to their government. Mike helped lead the effort to allow cameras into Vermont courts, was a leader in efforts to improve the Vermont Public Records Law, has successfully fought to keep court records open, and recently was one of four Americans invited to Ireland to make presentations on Freedom of Information after that country adopted such a law. He is a past President of the Vermont Press Association, and active in several national journalism organizations. At the Burlington Free Press, he has proven to be among Vermont's most versatile reporters, covering everything from sports to politics to the court beat with expertise.

   Mr. LEAHY. I agree with what the distinguished Democratic leader said. I would like to see us move forward. The bill we put together passed 83-14. The distinguished leader is right; it was in excess of 80 votes. There was a tremendous amount of work on both sides of the aisle. Senator HATCH, Senator GRASSLEY, Senator TORRICELLI, and I were the four floor leaders on this, working with others--Senator REID, Senator DASCHLE--to get people to take away hundreds of amendments. We got rid of those, and we got down to several on which we voted and passed in a good package. I would advise the two leaders, I have been working with Senator TORRICELLI, Senator HATCH, Senator GRASSLEY, and Senator SESSIONS to try to whittle it down even further, but to have a packet, one that could be acceptable on both sides of the aisle and also could get signed down at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.

   Mr. LEAHY. The needs described so well by my colleagues are pervasive, urgent, and fully within our means to address. Hunger has a cure. As ranking member of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Research, Nutrition, and General Legislation, I will do all I can to pass the Hunger Relief Act this year. I respectfully and insistently ask the Budget Committee to cooperate in creating a $2.5 billion reserve for this purpose.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will speak on a matter involving the juvenile justice conference--or, perhaps more accurately, I should say the lack of a conference on the juvenile justice bill. It is a matter that concerns me greatly because I was the floor leader on this side and the distinguished Senator from Utah was the floor leader on the other side when we had over a week of debate on the juvenile justice bill. We had a very solid debate. We then passed the bill with 73 votes in the Senate. It went to conference, and it was like going into the Bermuda Triangle; we haven't seen it since. 
   Actually, this Congress has kept the country waiting too long for action on juvenile justice legislation and has kept the country waiting too long on sensible gun safety laws. We are fast approaching the first-year anniversary of the shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. It has been 11 months since 14 students and a teacher lost their lives in that terrible tragedy on April 20, 1999. It has been 10 months since the Senate passed the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill. As I said before, it was an overwhelming vote of 73-25. 
   Our bipartisan bill includes modest--and I believe effective--gun provisions. It has been 9 months since the House of Representatives passed its own juvenile crime bill, which was on June 17, 1999. Then the leadership in the Congress delayed action on calling a conference all summer. It has been 8 months since the House and Senate juvenile justice conference met for the first and only time. The Republican majority in the Congress convened the conference on August 5, 1999. They did that less than 24 hours before the Congress adjourned for a month's vacation. 
   Now, you don't have to be a cynic to recognize this for what it was. It was a transparent ploy to deflect criticism for delay, but also to make sure the conference could not do anything. They would not have enough time to prepare comprehensive juvenile justice legislation to send to the President before school began in September. But we did have time to do it before children went back to school in January. We didn't do that. Now I wonder if we will ever do it. 
   The Senate and House Democrats have been ready for months to reconvene the juvenile justice conference. We have told the Republicans we would meet with them on a minute's notice. We want to work with Republicans to craft an effective juvenile justice conference report that includes reasonable gun safety provisions. But even though the Senate passed this legislation by a 3-to-1 majority, no conference; the Republican leadership has decided not to act. 
   I think this is particularly shameful because the Congress has spent more time in recess than in session during the last meeting of this conference. Think about that. We have been out on vacation more time than we have actually been here working since we had that last conference. Let's take a couple days off one of these recesses and have a conference. 
   Two weeks ago, the President invited House and Senate members of the conference to the White House, both Republicans and Democrats. He urged us to proceed to the conference and to have final enactment of legislation before the anniversary of the Columbine tragedy. Unfortunately, the Republican majority has rejected the President's plea for action. I think more than rejecting the President's plea for action, they have rejected the American people's plea. 
   On April 22 of last year, barely 2 days after the killings at Columbine High School, I came to the Senate to urge action. I praised the Democratic leader, Senator KENNEDY, and others for their thoughtful comments on these matters and for reaching out to the families of those who were killed that week. At that time, almost a year ago, I urged the Senate to rededicate itself to the work of assisting parents, teachers, the police, and others in stemming school violence. I suggested that S. 9, the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1999, provided a good place to start. 
   Responding to our efforts to turn the Senate's attention to the problems of school violence, on April 27 the Republican leader came to the floor and said if we withheld for 2 weeks, he could provide a legislative vehicle ``that we could take up, and the Senate would then have an opportunity for debate, have amendments, and have votes.'' 
   Senator LOTT returned to the floor the following day to repeat his commitment to provide the Senate with the ``opportunity to debate and vote on those issues dealing with school violence.'' To Senator LOTT's credit, he proceeded to S. 254, the juvenile justice bill, which was then pending on the Senate calendar, and he did that on May 11. We then had 2 weeks of real debate on it--one of the few we have had recently--and then the Senate worked its way through this bill. The Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice legislation, which passed the Senate on May 20, passed with a strong bipartisan majority and 73 votes, with both Democrats and Republicans voting for it. No one should forget it was a Republican majority that decided to make the juvenile justice legislation the vehicle for the antiviolence amendments adopted by the Senate last May. 
   Three-quarters of the Senate voted for our legislation. 
   Following the action by the other body, I urged a prompt conference on the juvenile justice legislation. I took the unusual step of coming to the Senate to propound a unanimous consent request to move to conference on the legislation, which initially encountered Republican objections. But eventually this request provided a blueprint for moving the Senate to agreeing to conference on July 28 of last year. 
   Unfortunately, that conference was convened for only a single afternoon--not with votes but of speeches. Democrats in both the House and Senate tried to offer motions about how to proceed to begin some of the discussion. But that was ruled out of order by the Republican majority. 
   Then I spoke on the floor several times last year--on September 8, September 9, and October 21--urging the majority to reconvene the juvenile justice conference. I joined with fellow Democrats to request, both in writing and on the floor, the majority to let us  finish our work on the conference and then send a good bipartisan bill to the President. On October 20, 1999, all the House and the Senate Democratic conferees sent a letter to Senator HATCH and Congressman HYDE calling for an open meeting of the juvenile justice conference. The following year, on March 3, 2000, after yet another shocking school shooting involving 6-year-old classmates in Michigan, Representative CONYERS and I wrote again to Senator HATCH and Congressman HYDE requesting an immediate meeting of the conference. The response has been resounding silence. 
   Two weeks ago, I felt honored to be invited to a White House summit by the President of the United States. I joined Senator HATCH, Congressman HYDE, and Congressman CONYERS in an Oval Office meeting with the President--a very substantive meeting. It went on well over an hour on what was a very busy day for the President. He urged the reconvening of the conference. He urged action by the Congress to send him a comprehensive bill before the 1-year anniversary of the Columbine tragedy. I met with the President again that evening. He said again: Please, will you just meet and send me a bill, especially before the 1-year anniversary of Columbine. His entreaties, which I thought were well intentioned and were done seeking bipartisan support, were rebuffed. No conference has been scheduled. 
   This is only the latest in a long series of delays that have plagued this legislation. We had to overcome technical obstacles and threatened filibusters just to begin the juvenile justice conference, and, unfortunately, I see no sign of abating the delays. We worked hard on the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, S. 254, and passed it by a vote of 73 to 25, but we cannot get a conference. 
   What I worry about is the impression we give the country. We will stand here and debate symbolism. We will take long recesses. We will talk about everything but the thing that is on the minds of parents and schoolchildren. 
   I am blessed with representing a State that I believe has the lowest crime rate in the Nation. We are a State where most of us don't even lock our doors. But it is interesting, when I go to schools in my State and talk to parents, to teachers, and to the children, they worry. Then I go into some of these other larger, urban States, and the concern is enormous. 
   We have become a terribly violent nation notwithstanding that the vast majority of Americans are good and law-abiding people. I come from a State where a majority of the people own firearms. I own many myself. We don't have gun control laws in our State. We teach people to respect the weapons they have. But the people in Vermont have the same sense of revulsion that I do when they see some of these shootings and they see a Congress unwilling to even 
   stand up to a powerful gun lobby. 
   Can anybody forget what was probably one of the most terrible pictures I have seen, and terrible in what it said, at the Jewish day center in California where a man went in attacking and shooting? You remember the photograph of the heavily armed police officers leading the little children out across the street. Every one of us has children and has been with children. We have seen them in grade school with a teacher leading the group of children. All the children hold hands. They hold hands with the teacher. And what a happy, cheerful time: We are going to recess. We are going to class. We are going to learn. And they are protected and safe because they are with their teacher or their parents. But this time police officers led these children. They did not know what was going on with the heavily armed officers bringing them to safety. The police officers must have children of their own, or grandchildren of their own, and were thinking about what was going on. 
   These are images that frighten people in this country. It is reasonable that they are frightened. We ought to respond. We are talking about a juvenile justice bill that has a whole lot of things way beyond any question of gun control. It has in it only modest gun control. It closes some loopholes in the law where you can't go to a flea market in the middle of a Saturday afternoon, and buy a gun without a real check on your background. 
   We have an opportunity in the conference to cut through partisan differences to make a difference in the lives of our children and families. We need to meet in the conference to debate our motions, and vote them up or vote them down, but at least meet and vote. We are paid to vote yes or no. We are not paid to pass the buck. That is what is happening here. 
   I don't know what my friends on the Republican side worry about. There are more of them than there are of us. They control the schedule. They have the votes. They can vote down anything they want. The procedural hurdles and the delays that plague this legislation are simply because of the opposition of the gun lobby to any new firearm safety laws. 
   Unfortunately, the leadership is being held hostage by the extreme views of the NRA and other special interests. If they really wanted to pass effective juvenile justice reforms and protect our children against gun violence, they could do it tomorrow. The President would sign the Hatch-Leahy bill in a second if it reached his desk. 
   Last year, the Y2K Act conference only took 2 weeks to complete, and a bill was sent to the President to provide legal protections for business--legal protections, as it turned out, that they didn't need. But when it comes to protecting our children where there is a real need, we can't act unless the NRA tells us we are allowed to act. That is wrong. 
   I didn't come to the Senate to have any group or any special interest group on the right or the left tell me what I can do or not do. Only the voters of my State can make a decision that they don't like the way I vote. They can throw me out. But we should not allow this great body to be held hostage by special interest groups--no matter how many Members they have, no matter how much money they spend on television, or no matter how outrageous a claim they make. 
   I have stood on this floor many times, but some of the proudest times I have had in public service were as a prosecutor in law enforcement. Let's listen to our Nation's law enforcement officers. They say pass a strong and effective juvenile justice bill. Ten national law enforcement organizations, representing thousands of law enforcement officers, have endorsed the Senate-passed gun safety amendment. They support loophole-free firearm laws. 
   I remind Senators of the time Members of this Congress turned their back on police officers when the NRA said don't ban cop-killer bullets. Do you remember that? Law enforcement said: Wait a minute. We put our lives on the line for you. How about protecting us? 
   Here are the organizations that have endorsed the gun-safety amendment and that support loophole-free firearm laws: 
   The International Association of Chiefs of Police, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, Police Executive Research Forum, Police Foundation, Major Cities Chiefs, Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, National Sheriffs Association, National Association of School Resource Officers, National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association. 
   These law enforcement officers need help in keeping guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. I am not talking about people who use guns for hunting and sport but about criminals and unsupervised children. These organizations want Congress to move. 
   We recognize there is no single cause and no single legislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our schools or in our streets. We have an obligation to do our part. It is time to act. 
   This list represents organizations that endorse the Senate-passed gun safety amendments. These are not organizations that take a pie-in-the-sky attitude. These organizations represent people who work in an increasingly violent society, putting their lives on the line to protect all Americans, just as the police officers in the Capitol put their lives on the line every day to protect everyone. Since I have been here two have died doing that. 
   These organizations ask: Will you at least stand up for us as we stand up for the quarter billion Americans?  
   I see the distinguished senior Senator from Rhode Island on the floor, Mr. REED. I applaud Senator JACK REED for his resolution for the juvenile justice conference to report a final bill by April 20 of this year, the 1-year anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting. 
   I am proud to cosponsor this resolution. I am proud to work with my good friend. I admire him for his initiative. I yield the floor to the distinguished senior Senator from Rhode Island.

    Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I congratulate the dedicated Vermonters responsible for the grand opening of the Vermont Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force's new office in downtown Burlington. This new office should build on the success of the Vermont ICAC Task Force to coordinate between local, State and Federal law enforcement agencies from around the region in their efforts to combat the emerging problem of computer crime. 
   Unfortunately, far too many State and local law enforcement agencies cannot afford the cost of policing against computer crimes themselves. In Vermont, there are few law enforcement officers among the more than 900 serving in our state who have training in investigating computer crimes and analyzing the evidence. Without the necessary educational training, technical support, and coordinated information, our law enforcement officials will be hamstrung in their efforts to crack down on computer crimes against children. 
   But the Vermont ICAC Task Force is helping our law enforcement officers meet this new challenge in the information age. Through the collaborative training and public education programs of the ICAC Task Force, Vermont law enforcement officials are able to use the resources of the Department of Justice and the Vermont community to fight cyber-criminals. 
   I have introduced Federal legislation, the Computer Crime Enforcement Act, S. 1314, to provide the Vermont ICAC Task Force and other Vermont law enforcement agencies with additional resources. My legislation would authorize a $25 million Department of Justice grant program to help states prevent and prosecute computer crime. Grants under my bill may be used to provide education, training, and enforcement programs for state and local law enforcement officers and prosecutors in the rapidly growing field of computer criminal justice. 
   It is hard for our law enforcement community to keep up with criminals in the computer age. Lawbreakers have integrated highly technical methods with traditional crimes and developed creative new types of crime. They use computers to cross State and national boundaries electronically, creating jurisdictional problems. They also use sophisticated equipment that makes them difficult to trace. 
   But we Vermonters can prevent, capture and prosecute cyber-criminals by following the model set by the Vermont ICAC Task Force. The Vermont ICAC Task Force has done, and will continue to do, great work to protect Vermont's children from Internet crimes in its new home.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will note, just before I start, a couple of points. 
   The distinguished Senator from New Hampshire spoke about video rental records of Judge Bork or Judge Thomas. He may recall when that happened, a law was passed, the Leahy-Simpson law, which I proposed, initiated, and drove through in short order, to make it illegal for anybody to go and check somebody's video records. Ideally, I would like to see us have as strong a law for our medical records, something that has been held up while we spend a lot of time on a lot of other things. That is something being held up by this Congress on medical privacy. I wish we could do the same with that situation. But on Judge Bork or Judge Thomas or any other judges, the Leahy-Simpson law says we cannot look at their records. 
   I also note it was the Democrats who said very strongly about both Judge Bork and Judge Thomas, there should be no filibuster. As I recall, we expedited them relatively quickly for votes. It was also this Senator, joined by some others on this side, who, on the Ginsburg matter, when items were being leaked to the press--as it turned out, some from the same White House from which his nomination came--it was this Senator who took to the floor, and spoke elsewhere, and said let us give Judge Ginsburg a hearing; he should not be subjected to anonymous leaks, wherever they are coming from. As I said, some, it turned out, came from the White House. It was the White House that then announced, news to him, he was going to be withdrawing his name, which of course he did. 
   It was approximately 12 weeks from the time Judge Bork was nominated until we had a vote. It was something like 15 weeks from the time Judge Thomas was nominated before we had a vote. Of course, on Judge Paez it has been 4 years; on Marsha Berzon, 2 years. 
   I think we should talk about facts. Up to this date, there have been a lot of red herrings set out on these two nominees. They have been held without votes. Now at the 11th hour, some have sought to raise the random assignment of the case against John Huang in the District Court of the Central District of California as another reason to extend what has already been a 4-year delay in our consideration of the nomination of Judge Richard Paez. 
   I have yet to hear anybody suggest that there was anything untoward in the assignment of Judge Paez on this case. The suggestion is out here, somehow this was some nefarious thing, to put Judge Paez on this case. So I checked around about what the court rules are in assigning cases, because most courts have rules on how cases are assigned. They are not secret. They are public, and they are publicly available. I know they are in my own State of Vermont. They are elsewhere. But I thought maybe there was something that those who were objecting to his assignment to this case knew that we didn't. So I checked with the Central District of California, and of course they do have court rules governing the assignment of cases. 
   In fact, I understand the assignment of cases in the central district is pursuant to general order No. 224 of that court. I mention this because I wonder if any of those who have impugned Judge Paez sitting on this case even bothered to check that rule as I did, as anybody can, simply by picking up the phone and calling. 
   Section 7 of that order deals with the assignment of criminal cases. Paragraph 7.1 says:  
   The assignment of criminal cases shall be completely at random through the Automated Case Assignment System.......  
   That is how the cases are assigned. The order allows exceptions under supervision of the chief judge. In the Huang case, there is no indication any exception was involved. Quite the contrary. I am told the assignment was done pursuant to a random assignment. That is what I was told when I called. That is what anybody would have been told if they had bothered to call instead of slandering this judge. 
   Then to make sure, because I am amazed anybody even questioned that because it is such a longstanding rule, I went to the extraordinary length of getting a statement under oath subject to the penalty of perjury by the district court executive and clerk of court explaining how these cases are assigned; Sherri Carter, district court executive and clerk of court. 
   I must apologize on the record to Ms. Carter for any indication that the Senate does not take her word for this or that people insist she submit this statement under penalty of perjury. I say to her, this is a strange time. Any lawyer who practices anywhere in this country knows that practically any court has these same kind of random assignments. State courts do it. Federal courts do it. Certainly any lawyer in California knows it is a random assignment. I suspect the bailiffs can tell you that. The janitors can tell you in that court, but the Senate is so far removed from it that we need an affidavit telling us something that everybody else outside of the sacred 100 in this Chamber know.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am sure Judge Paez had no interest in being assigned that case or the case against a former Member of Congress, Republican Representative Jay Kim, or any other high-profile case. I suspect any judge who has a pending confirmation would be delighted to avoid such high-profile cases, but they follow the rules. If the machine comes up and says ``you are assigned,'' then that judge hears that case. Judge Paez ought not continue to be penalized for doing his job in ruling in those assigned cases. 
   There is no allegation--no credible allegation, no believable allegation, no factual allegation, no whisper of an allegation--outside this Chamber that he did anything to obtain jurisdiction over those matters. None whatsoever. That ought to settle this matter once and for all. 
   It is the same as buying a lottery ticket and having the machine pick the numbers for you. It is done automatically. He did not win the lottery on this because he did not want a high-profile case, but he did his job, the job he was sworn to do. We ought to do the job we are sworn to do and vote up or down on these two people and not, as some have suggested, have a vote to suspend indefinitely. That is the Senate saying: Notwithstanding we are being paid to vote yes or no, we decide to just vote maybe. 
   Let's vote up or down. In this particular case that has been talked about, Judge Paez sentenced John Huang to 1 year probation, 500 hours community service, and a $10,000 fine after he pled guilty to a felony conspiracy charge on August 12, 1999. He agreed to plead guilty after he reached an agreement, not with the judge but with the prosecution for the Department of Justice. Based on that agreement, the prosecutors recommended no jail time in exchange for the defendant's cooperation. Judge Paez's approval of the prosecutor's recommendation was not unusual. 
   During my years as a prosecutor, I can think of a number of times when I said to the judge: Would you give this type of a sentence because we are getting cooperation from this person? I am after bigger fish; I have bigger fish to fry. I need their cooperation. Will you please sentence him to what might appear to be a lighter sentence? 
   Judge Paez did put the sentencing off for 10 days, from August 2 to August 12. Why? To consider a request by a Republican Congressman, DAN BURTON, who asked Judge Paez to delay sentencing until Huang testified in front of his committee investigating campaign finance abuses. The Congress asked him to delay. The Federal prosecutors objected to Representative BURTON's request for the indefinite suspension of sentencing, and having delayed to consider the matter, Judge Paez proceeded with the sentencing on August 12. I believe he was correct in doing so. Huang's lawyer told the prosecutor he would cooperate with Representative BURTON's committee, notwithstanding sentencing. My recollection is that is exactly what he did. 
   When it became clear, in virtually unprecedented fashion, Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon would have to leap over a 60-vote margin in cloture, and when it became clear the Senate would not add to the disgrace and humiliation of holding them up this long, that we would invoke cloture they want to suspend it indefinitely. After four years we should be more than prepared to vote for him for the Ninth Circuit. 
   Suspending a vote on this nomination would be a tragedy. Here is a remarkable man: a Hispanic American who has reached the Federal bench, has the highest rating that bar associations can give for a nominee, one of the most qualified people I have seen before the committee, Republican or Democrat, in my 25 years here. He has been waiting, dangling, for 4 years, humiliated by the actions of the Senate. 
   Now they ask to delay him again. It does not match up to what 
   should be the standards of a body that calls itself the conscience of the Nation. Let us be clear, the Huang plea agreement, the transcript of the sentencing and related documents are not new. They have been in the possession of the Judiciary Committee since at least September of 1999. Six months they have been here. 
   The sentencing, his postponement, and the position of sentence did not happen in secret. It was in the glare of nationwide publicity. Thousands of sentencings go on every year in this country in all kinds of courts rarely covered by the press. This one was. These events extend back to last August and before. It is not a justification for asking for new information. It has been here. 
   I think the opponents misdirect their complaints about the plea agreement between the Government and Mr. Huang at Judge Paez. Complain about the Government's recommendation. That is one thing. Do not blame the judge who followed them. 
   Moreover, in spite of the impression sought to be created here, the plea agreement, dated May 21, 1999, expressly provides that Mr. Huang is not immune from Federal prosecution under ``laws relating to national security or espionage'' but covers only that conduct he had disclosed to prosecutors. In fact, his own attorney acknowledged at the time of sentencing that this plea agreement, OK'd by the prosecutors and the judge, leaves Mr. Huang open to further prosecution. 
   As far as the sentencing, let's be clear what happened. The Senate should know, pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Huang pled guilty to one count of conspiracy, a charge that carries the maximum penalty of up to 5 years. As for the calculation of the sentencing guidelines, both the Government and the probation office agreed on that calculation. They further agreed that in light of his substantial cooperation, he should receive a sentence of 1 year's probation and 500 hours of community service. 
   In fact, the only disagreement between the prosecutors and the probation office was on the amount of the fine. In this case, Judge Paez disregarded what the probation office recommended and went with the prosecutors' recommendation, the higher fine, and he imposed that fine. 
   If you read the sentencing transcript, you see the judge acted in a conscientious manner. He insisted on a probation officer's report and recommendation before proceeding. He did not proceed until he was advised of the extent and nature of Huang's cooperation that was expected. The Government informed the court that Huang provided substantial, credible information helpful in task force investigations. The judge emphasized that Mr. Huang was expected to continue to cooperate after his sentencing. 
   I mentioned being a former prosecutor. I can tell you, when I was prosecuting cases nothing was more infuriating than when people did not know the facts of a case or the extent of cooperation or the value of the plea agreement, and they would try to pick apart an agreement after the fact. 
   I can think of cases where people would say: Oh, my gosh, how can this person get a light sentence? Why? Because they helped us catch five other people we would not have caught without them. 
   It is easy enough to criticize and second-guess. It is always easy to say someone else settled too cheap, that they made a bad deal. That undermines the role and morale of good prosecutors. We all know how clogged the already overloaded courts would be if prosecutors could not use their best  judgment and enter into plea agreements. 
   We have 75 vacancies in the Federal court. Prosecutors are under pressure all the time to move cases through because we have not confirmed the judges; we have not added the extra judges they need. The courts are backlogged. You cannot get civil cases heard because of all the criminal cases. Prosecutors have to make their best judgment. 
   Whether one agrees or disagrees with the agreement, no one can say, with a straight face, that we suddenly found out about it, or that now we have to have a last-minute postponement. We do not need such a thing. 
   This has been pending for 4 years. The facts have been here for 4 years. The nomination has been here for 4 years. Local law enforcement has strongly backed Judge Paez for 4 years. His home State Senators have strongly backed him for 4 years. 
   He is supported by the Los Angeles district attorney, the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the National Association of Police Organizations, the Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, the Los Angeles County Police Chiefs' Association. This guy sounds like the kind of judge I would have liked to have had my cases assigned to when I was a prosecutor. 
   We have made this highly qualified man jump through hoops for 4 years. He was required to review his criminal sentences for his whole career on the Federal bench. This is what we asked him to do after he was pending for 4 years. He had two confirmation hearings, and had been voted out twice by the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee. 
   A lesser person would have said: Enough is enough. This is such petty harassment. He did not complain. He complied. What do the facts show? He is a tough sentencer. Those are the facts, not the comment of some reporter thrown into a political story here in 
   Washington. 
   The people of California, the people who know him best, named him the Federal Criminal Law Judge of the Year in 1999. He has had sentences within the sentencing guidelines more often than the national average for district judges. We ought to be praising him for that. People say district judges don't follow the guidelines. We ought to praise him for being above average in that. 
   We talk about his criminal judgments appealed. There were 32 criminal judgments appealed. He was affirmed 28 times. Two of the appeals were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction; one was remanded. Only 1 of the 32 was reversed, in part. 
   We talk about how we want people who are going to be upheld on appeal. There isn't a district court judge--Republican, Democrat, or anything else--who would not be delighted to have a record on appeal like Judge Paez. 
   He is a tough judge, a really tough judge. He is also a good judge, a well-trained judge, a highly intelligent judge, and a judge who wins on appeals. 
   Obviously, every Senator has a right to vote how he or she wants, but at least vote. I do not think it is right to hold somebody up. It would certainly be an outrageous mark of shame on the Senate if we took the unprecedented step, for a Federal judicial nominee, after cloture, to move to indefinitely postpone. It would be the first time that sequence would be followed in the Senate. That would be a mark of shame on us. 
   But what bothers me is the way people look for any reason--real or imagined--to vote against Judge Paez. 
   There seems to be no interest in looking at his whole record of public service. I have heard no mention of Judge Paez's decision in the Great Western Shows, Inc. case. That was a controversial case. I am sure he did not ask to be assigned to it. But he applied the law fairly and objectively. Let's mention this case. 
   We heard he may be a liberal judicial activist, whatever that is. It must mean, like the majority in the Supreme Court in the last year or so, taking away more rights from the States and people in patent cases, and so on. But let's talk about this. 
   In the Great Western Shows case, he heard and granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against a Los Angeles county ordinance that would have effectively banned gun shows, the sale of firearms and ammunition on county property. He went against those who wanted to ban the gun show because he found substantial questions that the ordinance was preempted by State law. So he granted an injunction so the gun show could proceed. 
   To me, that does not sound like a judicial activist. It reminds me of the courage that a Vermont district court judge showed back in 1994 when his nomination to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals was likewise pending before the Senate. At that time, Judge Fred Parker handed down his decision in the Frank case in which Judge Parker held the 10th amendment prohibited Congress from usurping the power of Vermont's Legislature and declared certain provisions of the Brady law unconstitutional. 
   I remember that very well because it was about the same time I was down asking the President of the United States to appoint Judge Parker, a conservative Republican, who served as the deputy attorney general of our State. I was asking the President to appoint Judge Parker to the Second Circuit. I also knew Judge Parker was an extraordinarily brilliant person. He was a classmate of mine in law school. He is highly honest. Usually he had supported my opponents. 
   I had to tell the President, who was strongly supporting the Brady law: This judge I want you to appoint to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has just found a hunk of that law unconstitutional. The President said: Anything else you want me to do for you today? 
   But to Bill Clinton's credit, he did appoint Judge Parker to the Second Circuit. Oh, just as a little footnote, to Judge Parker's credit, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld him. They said he was right, that the way it was drafted, that part of the Brady law--which we have since changed--was unconstitutional. 
   The point is, both these judges, Judges Parker and Paez, acted with courage to do their duty. They applied the law to the facts, and they did their judicial duty. 
   They did so at some personal risk while their nominations to higher courts were still pending before the Senate. I think the strength they show is commendable. They are the kinds of judges we need in our Federal courts to act with independence and in accordance with the law. All the Senators who were in the Senate at that time voted for Judge Parker. 
   I hoped they would give the same with respect to Judge Paez. He doesn't tailor rulings or sentences to please political supporters. He is not soft on crime. This is a man who gets upheld on virtually all his criminal cases. He is a person with great resolve and temperament and intellect. Those who seek to diminish this man or his record should reconsider and support his prompt confirmation.

   Mr. LEAHY. The so-called ``panhandling'' case. Will the Senator agree, however, that at the time Judge Paez made his decision, there was a Ninth Circuit decision on all fours, which he as a Federal district judge within that circuit was bound to follow, and he and all judges going for confirmation always say they will follow stare decisis, that they will follow the decision? 
   Is it not a fact that in that particular case he had a decision on all fours from his circuit which he had to follow? And is it not also a fact that the Ninth Circuit then, under a new ruling, submitted it to the California Supreme Court for their own ruling to the California Supreme Court? Because, obviously, you cannot appeal to the California Supreme Court, Judge Paez being a Federal court. But the Ninth Circuit then submitted it under a certification procedure--a new procedure--in California to the California  Supreme Court. And then a year or so later, they came down and said the Ninth Circuit's earlier ruling did not interpret California law correctly. They then changed theirs and thus changed the rule Judge Paez had to follow. 
   Is that not the fact?

   Mr. LEAHY. No. The circuit did. Judge Paez's decision, 
   as I understand it, did not go to the Supreme Court because it couldn't go to the California Supreme Court. The circuit itself then changed their earlier decision, came back to the beginning, and had to follow the new decision, which he very much explained in his confirmation hearing. He said, among other things, that he lives in these neighborhoods; he has concerns himself. 
   But the point is, just as some Federal judge in my State would have to follow the Second Circuit's decisions, and a Federal judge in the State of New Hampshire would have to follow the First Circuit's decisions, he is caught kind of between a rock and a hard place. 
   What I am basically saying is, he should have followed his own stare decisis. Yet, if he didn't, then he is an activist judge. This man is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, first, I do thank the distinguished majority leader for keeping the commitment he made to me, to Senator DASCHLE, to the two Senators from California, and others last year to bring these nominations to a vote. I appreciate that. I wish, of course, he would vote for the two nominees, but that is his right. 
   We keep talking about these reversal rates, the Ninth Circuit being reversed the most. Of course, that is not the case. I will put in the RECORD later on a letter from Chief Judge Hug, who shows a number of circuits that have been reversed far more than the Ninth Circuit. 
   I will also point out, as I did earlier, about half of the most recent reversals have been on decisions written by appointees of President Reagan and appointees of President Bush. So I would not be blaming President Clinton for this. 
   We have heard a great deal about the so-called panhandling decision. The judge had no choice in that matter. He had a case on all fours from his own circuit. As a district judge, he had to follow that decision. Whether he liked it or not, that is what he had to follow. Subsequently, when his own circuit reversed its position on it, then he would have to follow the new position. 
   Last, I am disturbed to have it suggested that the judge could not tell litigants in a courtroom that they could not wave anything in the face of jurors, whether it is a Bible or a newspaper. I yield to nobody in this body in my defense of the first amendment. I have certainly received more first amendment awards than anybody serving here. I would say also if they were to wave a newspaper and a headline in the face of jurors, a judge could say: No, you can't do that. 
   That is not freedom of the press. That is not freedom of religion. No judge anywhere is going to allow litigants to wave anything in the face of jurors to influence them, nor to act outside of the regular rules of court, or when you can refer to an item in evidence or not, when you can refer to it in argument. 
   I just point that out. We continuously attack this man for doing the things he is supposed to do. 
   I yield to the distinguished Senator from California who seeks 10 minutes, I understand. I yield 10 minutes.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is not a question of liberal or conservative. As I recall, when the Democrats were in control of the Senate during 6 years overlapping the Reagan and Bush Presidencies, we voted to confirm about 99 percent of the nominations of President Reagan and President Bush. 
   Justice Scalia is considered one of the most conservative Members of the Supreme Court. As I recall, he got a unanimous vote from the Republicans and Democrats in the Senate Judiciary Committee. I believe he had a unanimous vote on the floor of the Senate. 
   Let's not use this shibboleth. We have also had a number of judicial nominees who said they were members of the National Rifle Association and a number who have said they have defended conservative organizations. I  never remember a single one having difficulty being confirmed. Let's not use that. 
   If we want to assume for the sake of argument that the Ninth Circuit is dominated by liberal activist judges, these critics urge the Senate to reject the confirmation of new judges. They are not letting two basically moderate judges come, thereby adding to the mix. It does not make a great deal of sense to me that they want to keep the court exactly the way it is.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, four out of seven recent reversals were decisions written by either a Reagan or Bush appointee from the Ninth Circuit. Somehow it wasn't brought out on the other side. 
   As far as showing fairness, even for Clarence Thomas, who had a tie vote, with Republicans and Democrats voting against him in the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Democrats, being in charge of the Senate, still allowed him to come forward for a vote even though normally that would have killed it. 
   The circuits should not all be the same. Different circuits have different attitudes. They come from different parts of the country. If they were to be all the same, we might as well just have one big circuit for the whole country. The Second Circuit is different from the Third Circuit. The Third is different from the Fifth, and so on. 
   I remind my friends on the other side, if we are going to have a litmus test for a circuit, let us understand what this means when applied to the Fourth Circuit. That is the most conservative and activist in the country. Ironically enough, we forget the fact the very conservative circuit can be a very activist circuit. Nobody would deny it is one of the most activist circuits in the country, rewriting legislation willy-nilly.  
   If the argument is accepted from the other side, then no nominee other than one with a more liberal judicial philosophy should be confirmed in the foreseeable future to the Fourth Circuit. I am not trying to make that argument. But if you follow their argument, that is the case. 
   Mr. President, I thank the Majority Leader for bringing this matter to a vote. After two years, it is time to vote on the nomination of Marsha Berzon. She is one of the most qualified nominees I have seen in 25 years, and Senator HATCH has agreed with that assessment publically. He voted for her in the Judiciary Committee. 
   Marsha Berzon is an outstanding nominee. Her legal skills are outstanding, her practice and productivity have been extraordinary. Lawyers against whom she has litigated regard her as highly qualified for the bench. She was first nominated in January 1998, some 26 months ago. By all accounts, she is an exceptional lawyer with extensive appellate experience, including a number of cases heard by the Supreme Court. She has the strong support of both California Senators and a well-qualified rating from the American Bar Association. 
   She was initially nominated in January 1998. She participated in an extensive two-part confirmation hearing before the Committee back on July 30, 1998. Thereafter she received a number of sets of written questions from a number of Senators and responded in August, two years ago. A second round of written questions was sent and she responded by the middle of September, two years ago. Despite the efforts of Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator KENNEDY, Senator SPECTER and myself to have her considered by the Committee, she was not included on an agenda and not voted on during all of 1998. Her nomination was returned to the President without action by the Committee or the Senate in October 1998. 
   The President renominated Ms. Berzon in January 1999. She participated in her second confirmation hearing in June, was sent additional sets of written questions, responded and got and answered another round. I do not know why those questions were not asked in 1998. 
   Finally, on July 1, 1999, almost eight months ago, the Committee considered the nomination and agreed to report it to the Senate favorably. After more than two years the Senate will, at long last, vote on the nomination. Senators who find some reason to oppose this exceptionally qualified woman lawyer can vote against her if they choose, but she will finally be accorded an up or down vote. That is what I have been asking for and that is what fairness demands. 
   Senator HATCH was right two years ago when he called for an end to the political game that has infected the confirmation process. These are real people whose lives are affected. Marsha 
   Berzon has been held hostage for 26 months, not knowing what to make of her private practice or when the Senate will deem it appropriate finally to vote on her nomination. 
   Last fall I received a Resolution from the National Association of Women Judges. The NAWJ urged expeditious action on nominations to federal judicial vacancies. The President of the Women Judges, Judge Mary Schroeder, is right when she cautions that ``few first-rate potential nominees will be willing to endure such a tortured process'' and the country will pay a high price for driving away outstanding candidates to fill these important positions. The Resolution notes the scores of continuing vacancies with highly qualified women and men nominees and the nonpartisan study of delays in the confirmation process, and even more extensive delays for women nominees, found by the Task Force on Judicial Selection formed by Citizens for Independent Courts. The Resolution notes that such delay ``is costly and unfair to litigants and the individual nominees and their families whose lives and career are on hold for the duration of the protracted process.'' In conclusion, the National Association of Women Judges ``urges the Senate of the United States to bring the pending nominations for the federal judiciary to an expeditious vote so that those who have been nominated can get on with their lives and these vacancies can be filled.'' We received that Resolution in October 1999 and I included it in the RECORD at that time--October 1999. 
   There are judicial emergencies vacancies all over the country. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has had to declare that entire Circuit in an emergency. Its workload has gone up 65 percent in the last 9 years; but they are being forced to operate with almost one-quarter of their bench vacant despite highly qualified nominees having been sent to the Senate by the President. 
   Continuing dilatory practices demeans the Senate, itself. I have great respect for this institution and its traditions. Still, I must say that the use of secret holds for extended periods that doom a nomination from ever being considered by the United States Senate is wrong and unfair and beneath us. After four years with respect to Judge Paez and two years with respect to Marsha Berzon, it is time for the Senate to vote up-or-down on these nominations. I, again, ask the Senate to be fair to these judicial nominees and all nominees. For the last few years the Senate has allowed one or two or three secret holds to stop judicial nominations from even getting a vote. That is wrong. 
   The Washington Post noted last year:  
   [T]he Constitution does not make the Senate's role in the confirmation process optional, and the Senate ends up abdicating responsibility when the majority leader denies nominees a timely vote. All the nominees awaiting floor votes *.*.* should receive them immediately.  
   The Florida Sun-Sentinel has written:  
   The ``Big Stall'' in the U.S. Senate continues, as senators work slower and slower each year in confirming badly needed federal judges. *.*.* This worsening process is inexcusable, bordering on malfeasance in office, especially given the urgent need to fill vacancies on a badly undermanned federal bench. *.*.* The stalling, in many cases, is nothing more than a partisan political dirty trick.  
   Nominees deserve to be treated with dignity and dispatch--not delayed for two or three or four 
   years. 
   Acting to fill judicial vacancies is a constitutional duty that the Senate--and all of its members--are obligated to fulfill. In its unprecedented slowdown in the handling of nominees since the 104th Congress, the Senate is shirking its duty. That is wrong and should end. 
   Today the New York Times included an editorial entitled ``Ending a Judicial Blockade'' in which it notes: ``The quality of justice suffers when the Senate misconstrues its constitutional role to advise and consent as a license to wage ideological warfare and procrastinate in hopes that a new president might submit other nominees.'' 
   In 1992, a Democratic majority in the Senate acted to confirm 66 judicial nominations for a Republican President in his last year in office. With the confirmations of Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon to the Ninth Circuit today, this Senate will have confirmed only seven judicial nominations so far this year. I look forward, at long last, to the confirmation of Marsha Berzon and ask other Senators to join with me to work to confirm many, many more qualified nominees to the federal vacancies around the country in the weeks ahead this year. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know we are about to finish this debate. I do want to compliment the two Senators from California for bringing before us two fine judicial nominees: Judge Paez and, I hope soon to be, Judge Marsha Berzon. 
   I compliment the distinguished Democratic leader for what he said on the floor--a true leadership statement. I compliment my friend from Utah, Senator HATCH, who says we should go forward and defeat this motion to, in effect, kill, by parliamentary maneuver, one of these nominations. 
   I agree with what the Senator from South Dakota, our distinguished Democratic leader, said, that we should not get ourselves in a position where there is payback. Whoever the next President might be, if it is a Republican President do we start doing the same things to him the Republicans have done to President Clinton? That should not be done in judicial nominations. We should protect the integrity and the independence of our Federal courts. 
   I have served here for 25 years. I love and revere this body. The day I leave the Senate, I will know that I have left the finest time of my life, the best and most productive time of my life, the time that I pass on to my children and my grandchildren, by being 1 of 100 men and women whom I respect and have looked forward to working with every day. But that is because I think of this body as being the conscience of the Nation. 
   If we now use a parliamentary procedure, something totally unprecedented on a Federal judgeship following a cloture motion, then we shame the Senate. We should not. 
   Judged by any traditional standards of qualifications, competence, temperament, or experience, both Marsha Berzon and Judge Paez should be confirmed. They will be good judges. They will probably be even great judges. Their commitment to law and justice will serve the people of their circuit and our country. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad the Senate has done the right thing. Maybe we should say in this Lenten season that Judge Paez has now moved out of purgatory into the reward he justly deserves. The Senate has done the right thing today but did the wrong thing for 4 years in holding this good jurist hostage. Marsha Berzon, another nominee who I predict will be a stellar judge, was held far too long. 
   I thank my colleagues who voted to right this injustice and voted for both of them. I thank those who worked hard to bring this on to the floor for a vote. 
   Also, just a footnote, the Senate did the right thing in its second vote in rejecting the cockamamy idea of having a motion to suspend indefinitely a judicial nominee following a cloture vote. That may sound like inside baseball, but that would have been a terrible precedent. I applaud the distinguished Democratic leader for speaking out so strongly against that motion, and I compliment the chairman of our Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, for sticking with these nominees, both of whom passed our committee. 
   We have done the right thing. We have righted a wrong of 4 years. I think now the Senate should go on, set aside partisanship, and let us look at those nominees who are still pending. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Aircraft Safety Act of 2000 is included in the conference report on the Air Transportation Improvement Act, H.R. 1000. This measure is needed to safeguard United States aircraft, workers and passengers from fraudulent, defective, and counterfeit aircraft parts. 
   The problem of fraudulent, defective, and counterfeit aircraft parts has grown dramatically in recent years. Since 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration received 1,778 reports of suspected unapproved parts, initiated 298 enforcement actions and issued 143 safety notices regarding suspect parts. Moreover, the aircraft industry has estimated that as much as $2 billion in unapproved parts may be sitting on the shelves of parts distributors, airlines, and repair stations, according to Congressional testimony. 
   Because a passenger airplane may contain as many as 6 million parts, the growth of bogus aircraft parts raises serious public safety concerns. And even small bogus parts could cause a horrific airplane tragedy. For instance, on September 8, 1989, a charter flight carrying 55 people from Norway to Germany plunged 22,000 feet into the North Sea after a tail section fastened with bogus bolts tore loose. 
   Given this potential threat to public safety, comprehensive laws are needed to focus directly on the dangers posed by nonconforming, defective, and counterfeit aircraft parts. But no such laws are on the books right now. In fact, prosecutors today are forced to use a variety of general criminal statutes to bring offenders to justice, including prosecution for mail fraud, wire fraud, false statements and conspiracy. These general criminal statutes may work well in some situations in the aircraft industry, but often times they do not. 
   The Aircraft Safety Act would provide for a single Federal law designed to crack down on the $45 billion fraudulent, defective, and counterfeit aircraft parts industry. The Act focuses on stopping bogus aircraft parts in three ways. 
   First, our bipartisan bill adds a new section to our criminal laws defining fraud involving aircraft parts in interstate or foreign commerce for the first time. The section sets out three new offenses to outlaw the fraudulent exportation, importation, sale, trade, installation, or introduction of nonconforming, defective, or counterfeit aircraft parts. Under the new statute, it is a crime to falsify or conceal any material fact, to make any fraudulent representation, or to use any materially false documents or electronic communication concerning any aircraft part. 
   Second, our bipartisan bill strengthens the criminal penalties against aircraft parts pirates. A basic 15-year maximum penalty of imprisonment and $500,000 maximum fine is set for all offenses created by the new section. This is needed to end the light sentences that some aircraft parts counterfeiters have received under the general criminal statutes. In fact, in a 1994 case, a parts broker pleaded guilty to trafficking in counterfeit aircraft parts, but only received a seven-month sentence. Fraud involving aircraft parts is a serious crime that deserves a serious penalty. 
   Third, our bipartisan bill provides courts with new tools to prevent repeat offenders from re-entering the aircraft parts business and to stop the flow of nonconforming, defective and counterfeit parts in the marketplace. Under the new statute, courts may order unscrupulous individuals to divest themselves of interests in businesses used to perpetuate aircraft fraud. Courts may also, under the new statute, direct the disposal of stockpiles and inventories of defective and counterfeit aircraft parts to prevent their subsequent resale or entry into commerce.

   Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not, I tell the distinguished leader I was struck by the comments of the distinguished leader in saying we should not have the precedents of filibusters and requiring cloture. I commend him for supporting the cloture motion and moving this forward so we would not have that precedent. I am concerned, though, because I have heard rumors that one of these votes may be on a motion to indefinitely postpone a vote on these nominees. I understand that while such a vote might be in order, there is no precedent for such a vote on a judicial nominee; am I correct on that? I mean in my lifetime, and I was born in 1940.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to underscore what I have said, what the distinguished Senator from California has said, and what others have said in support of the Paez and Berzon nominations. 
   Judge Paez has waited more than 4 years to have his nomination heard on this floor--4 years--notwithstanding the fact that he has the highest rating the American Bar Association can give a nominee. He has one of the most distinguished records of any nominee, Republican or Democrat, to come before this body since I have been here. 
   Similarly, Ms. Berzon has waited for more than 2 years, an unconscionable period of time--again, a woman with an extraordinary background and the highest of ratings from the American Bar Association. 
   They have for some reason been held to a higher standard than most judicial nominees. I do not recall a situation where a nominee has had to go through these kinds of hoops to get here and have an up or down vote. 
   Again, I compliment the majority leader and the Democratic leader for helping us put together a successful cloture petition on each of these nominations. We have now 85 or 86 votes to move forward. 
   I hope the Senate will not shame itself by taking the unprecedented step tomorrow of moving to postpone indefinitely either of these extraordinary nominees. It is a fact that one can make a motion to suspend or indefinitely--that is true--or to indefinitely postpone. One can make such a motion. But it would be unprecedented for a judicial nominee. We have asked informally and I have asked the presiding officer and through him the parliamentarian and no precedent for such a motion against a judicial nomination following cloture has been provided. 
   I defy anybody to point out, certainly in my lifetime--as I said earlier, I am 59 years old--to point out in my lifetime where a judicial nominee has gone through the extraordinary hoops of multiple nominations hearings, being reported favorably twice, having a nomination have to be resubmitted by the President Congress after Congress, being forced to wait more than 4 years to be debated, getting past a filibuster, invoking cloture with 85 or 86 votes--an overwhelming majority of the Senate--and then having a motion to indefinitely postpone, in effect, to kill the nomination. 
   It would shame the Senate, No. 1, to even bring up such a motion, but certainly to allow such a motion to be successful with a nominee who has been waiting for 4 years, notwithstanding the fact that this is a person who is one of the most extraordinary Hispanic American jurists we have ever seen, who has the highest rating, who is backed by everybody from law enforcement to litigators. Judge Paez has been forced to go through these extraordinary hoops and his nomination is poised, finally, for debate and a fair up or down vote. To have somebody take this unprecedented and shameful step of asking us to indefinitely postpone Senate approval of this nomination is, in effect, a procedural device to deny that up or down vote and kill this nomination. 
   The same with Marsha Berzon: This extraordinary woman, reaching the  pinnacle of her legal career, having earned success every step along the way, having earned the highest possible rating from the American Bar Association, comes here, has to undergo an extraordinary ordeal and this long wait, has to go through the unusual step of a cloture motion and our prevailing with 85 votes. Then for the Senate to say to her: But now we are going to do something that has never been done before to a judicial nominee who has gotten past cloture: We are going to move to indefinitely postpone. That is not right.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the reason I get concerned about this is, now, having in excess of 80 votes to go forward with this, we ought to have the courage and the honesty to stand up and vote. Senators are paid to vote ``aye'' or ``nay.'' They are not paid to vote ``maybe.'' It would be a cowardly and disgraceful step to vote ``maybe'' because we want to avoid saying what the Senate is being asked to do--to close the door to two such extraordinary people. I always respect Senators who vote ``yes'' or vote ``no.'' I will not respect Senators who vote ``maybe.'' That is beneath the dignity of the Senate. 
   There are only 100 of us who are elected to represent a quarter of a billion Americans. Let us have the courage to stand up and vote either for or against these two extraordinary nominees. Let us not play silly parliamentary games and tell the American people we do not have the guts to vote, that we are going to vote ``maybe.'' I did not get elected to serve in the Senate to vote ``maybe.'' I did not serve for 25 years in a body that I revere to vote ``maybe.'' 
   I am certainly not going to stand here and allow with no comment these two people to be held hostage one more time. Vote for them, or vote against them. I certainly urge my colleagues to vote for them. 
   In all my years on the Judiciary Committee extending back over several decades, I do not know of two finer nominees who have come before the Senate, Republican or Democrat. And I voted for most nominees, Republican and Democrat, during that time. 
   Vote for these two people. At least in that way, apologize for holding them hostage all of these years. But, for God's sake, don't shame us all by voting for some kind of parliamentary gimcrackery saying we will postpone it indefinitely. Vote ``yes'' or vote ``no.'' Don't vote ``maybe.'' 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my friend from Nevada. I also want to commend the distinguished senior Senator from Utah for his support of Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon. 
   Today, we are going to take up the long delayed nomination of Judge Julio Fuentes for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. It is long delayed; Judge Fuentes was nominated 365 days ago. We tried for a whole year to get his nomination moving. He was finally included in a confirmation hearing on February 22, then on to the Judiciary Committee 2 days later, then reported without a single objection. 
   Now, I understand it came on the calendar yesterday and the distinguished majority leader scheduled it immediately for a vote. I thank him for doing that. No need to linger, especially after waiting a year to get his hearing and a vote. 
   Moving at once from the hearing, quickly to a committee agenda and to committee consideration and on to the floor is how we used to proceed. In the days before 1994, nominees were favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee, then routinely considered by the Senate within a day or so thereafter. That was before the unfortunate practice that has developed in the last 6 years, where oft times extremely well-qualified nominees are held for long times--weeks, months, sometimes years. 
   I am glad in this case, at least, while he had to wait almost a year for a hearing, once we got the hearing, the  nomination is being moved very quickly. 
   I look forward to Julio Fuentes' confirmation. I congratulate the two Senators from New Jersey, Mr. LAUTENBERG and Mr. TORRICELLI, for their longstanding support. 
   Having said that, we should look at where we are. We have 76 current vacancies on the Federal judiciary and 9 more on the horizon. Last month, the Judicial Conference renewed its request for an additional 59 judgeships and taking 10 of the existing temporary ones and making them permanent. There are only 22 weeks left in session this year. We should get moving if we are going to fulfill our constitutional responsibility and help the President fill these vacancies. 
   In the first 2 months of this year, the Senate has only confirmed four judicial nominations--two a month. Incidentally, having waited for some time to even have their hearings and have their vote, they were voted overwhelmingly. Two of them were confirmed by votes of 98-0, which makes one wonder why in Heaven's name they were held up so long. The other two did have opposition. They had two votes against them: 96 for them, 2 against them. Again, one wonders what held them up so long. In fact, they had all been reported favorably last year, or, as someone pointed out, last century, and voted on favorably this century. There are still three very important nominees reported last year to be taken up. 
   The distinguished majority leader and the distinguished minority leader had a colloquy last November 10 talking about them. I fully expect them to be voted up or down. The three are Richard Paez, Marsha Berzon, and Timothy Dyk. Each has waited more than 23 months for Senate action. The Los Angeles Times calls Judge Paez the Cal Ripken of judicial nominations. This distinguished Hispanic, a man with one of the highest ratings ever to come before the Senate, one of the most sterling backgrounds of any nominee by either Republicans or Democrats, this distinguished jurist has waited more than 4 years. That is unforgivable. We should do our constitutional duty and vote up or vote down, not vote maybe. 
   I am glad the majority leader has agreed to bring them to a Senate vote before the Ides of March. The nominees deserve to be treated with dignity and dispatch, not delayed for years. 
   Judge Paez has been pending for over 4 years. He has the strong support of his home State Senators and of local law enforcement. He has had a distinguished judicial career in which he has served as a State and Federal judge for I believe 19 years. His is a wonderful American story of hard work, fairness, and public service. He and his family have much of which they can be proud. Hispanic organizations from California and around the country have urged the Senate to act favorably and soon. 
   I hope we do the right thing when we are called upon to vote. As I recall, when Judge Sonia Sotomayor, another outstanding district court judge, was nominated to the Second Circuit and her nomination was delayed by this Senate, apparently she was so extremely well qualified, some feared if we confirmed her too quickly, she might possibly be considered as a Supreme Court nominee, and that is why she was held up through all kinds of secret holds. It was not the Senate's finest moment. In fact, after all the delay in Judge Sonia Sotomayor's case, it was interesting that not a single Senator who voted against her confirmation and not a single Senator who delayed her confirmation uttered a single word against her. 
   Any Senator can vote as he or she sees fit, but I hope in the case of Judge Richard Paez, where his nomination has been delayed for over 4 years--the longest period in the history of the Senate--that those who have opposed him will show him the courtesy of using this time to discuss with us any concerns they may have and explain the basis for the negative vote against a person so well qualified for this position. 
   I believe we should come to a vote on Timothy Dyk. We should have done so long before now. He was first nominated to a Federal vacancy in April of 1998. After having a hearing and being 
   reported favorably, the Senate in September 1998 left without action. The President had to resubmit the name. He was renominated in January 1999, favorably reported again in October 1999. 
   Again, he is a man with a tremendous background. He is the only person I can remember clerking for three Supreme Court Justices. He is supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and others. I hope we will get on with this nomination. 
   I look forward to the Senate finally approving the nomination of Marsha Berzon to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. One-quarter of the active judgeships authorized for that court have been kept vacant for several years. The Judicial Conference recently requested that Ninth Circuit judgeships be increased, in light of its workload, by an additional five judges. That means that while Ms. Berzon and several other nominees have been waiting for confirmation, the court actually has been doing its work with 10 fewer judges than it needs. 
   Marsha Berzon is an outstanding nominee. She is an exceptional lawyer with extensive appellate practice, including a number of cases heard by the Supreme Court. She has the highest rating from the American Bar Association and the support of both the Senators from California. 
   It may well be coincidence, as someone suggests, that if you are a woman or a minority, you take a lot longer getting through the Senate. That is the way it has been the last 5 years. 
   The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court said:  
   Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. ..... The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry, it should vote him up or vote him down.  
   Which is exactly what I would like. 
   We had one minority nominee, an extremely well-qualified individual, Jorge Rangel. He became tired of waiting. He got into this block of, if you are a minority or a woman, one seems to take longer. He said to the President:  
   Our judicial system depends on men and women of good will who agree to serve when asked to do so. But public service asks too much when those of us who answer the call to service are subjected to a confirmation process dominated by interminable delays and inaction. Patience has its virtue, but it also has its limits.  
   Jorge Rangel withdrew. 
   All three of the nominees reported last year and before have been extremely patient. Each remains among the 10 longest pending judicial nominations before the Senate, and one has waited the longest of anybody in the Senate's history. 
   Some say, if it is a Presidential election year, we have to slow things down--the so-called Thurmond rule. Sure, if we are within a couple months of a Presidential election, we might slow things down. But before people justify the fact we have only moved four judges this year, I remind my colleagues of what happened in Presidential election years past. 
   Let's take a few of the Presidential election years since I have been here: 1980 was a Presidential election year. We confirmed 64 judges that year; 1984 was a Presidential election year, and we confirmed 44 judges that year. 
   Let me take 1988, when President Reagan was at the end of his second term, as much of a lame duck as one could possibly be. There was a Democratic majority in the Senate. We could have done the same thing to President Reagan that the Republicans have been doing for years to President Clinton, but instead we confirmed 42 of his nominees. 
   A better example: In 1992, under President Bush, when he was about to become a lame duck President, during a Presidential election year, where Democrats were in the majority, we confirmed 66 judges, as compared to the 4 who have been confirmed this year. At the end of President Bush's term, with Democrats in the majority, we confirmed 66. 
   My friend from New York may be interested in knowing that in 1996, again at the end of the first term of President Clinton, where Republicans were in the majority--do you know how many were confirmed? Seventeen. Democrats confirmed 66 of a Republican President's nominees; Republicans confirmed 17 of a Democrat President's nominees. 
   What happens is qualified nominees, such as Richard Paez or Marsha Berzon  or Tim Dyk, instead of being treated with dignity and dispatch, are delayed for years--or those like Jorge Rangel, they say: We cannot put up with the delay anymore. We withdraw our name. 
   Then we have to understand what this does to people who have offered themselves for this public service. But we have to also ask: What does it do to the independence of our Federal judiciary, the independence that is praised worldwide? 
   So if Judge Fuentes is confirmed this afternoon, as I fully expect he will, I congratulate him because he will be the first judicial nomination both reported by the Judiciary Committee and confirmed by the Senate this year. 
   I would hope that would give some indication that we might move forward with the nominations of Richard Paez, Marsha Berzon and Tim Dyk from years past, as well. 
   I am glad we are finally going to have the opportunity on this extremely well-qualified nominee to move forward to the Third Circuit. We will move forward on Judge Julio Fuentes, as I say, an outstanding Hispanic nominee, an outstanding American, to the Federal judiciary.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators GRASSLEY, SPECTER and TORRICELLI, and others, in cosponsoring the Counterintelligence Reform Act of 2000, S. 2089. I look forward to working with my colleagues on making any improvements and refinements to the legislation which may become apparent as we hold hearings. This is an important issue with serious implications for the careful balance we have struck between the need to protect our national security and our obligation to defend the constitutional rights of American citizens. 
   This legislation was crafted in response to perceived problems in the investigation of nuclear physicist Wen Ho Lee. Our review of that matter is far from complete and, in view of the pending criminal case, must be put in abeyance to avoid any prejudice to the parties or suggest political influence on the proceedings. Based on the Subcommittee's review to date, however, I do not share the views of some of my colleagues who have harshly criticized the Justice Department's handling of this matter. Notwithstanding my disagreement, as explained below, with those criticisms of the Justice Department, I support this legislation as a constructive step towards improving the coordination and effectiveness of our counterintelligence efforts. Senators GRASSLEY, SPECTER and TORRICELLI have provided constructive leadership in crafting this bill and bringing together Members who may disagree about the conclusions to be drawn from the underlying facts of the Wen Ho Lee investigation. 
   My view of the Justice Department's handling of the Wen Ho Lee investigation differs in at least three significant respects from those of the Department's critics in the Senate. 
   First, the Justice Department's demand in the summer of 1997 for additional investigative work by the FBI has been misconstrued as a ``rejection'' of a FISA application for electronic surveillance. FBI officials first consulted attorneys at DOJ on June 30, 1997, about receiving authorization to conduct FISA surveillance against Lee. The request was assigned to a line attorney in the Office of Intelligence and Policy Review (OIPR), who, appreciating the seriousness of the matter, drafted an application for the court over the holiday weekend. A supervisor  in the OIPR unit then reviewed the draft and decided that further work by the FBI would be needed ``to complete the application and send it forward.'' Further discussions then ensued and two additional draft applications were prepared. 
   In August 1997, FBI agents met again with OIPR attorneys about the FISA request. The OIPR supervisor testified at a Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on June 9, 1999 that ``[f]ollowing that meeting, the case was put back to the Bureau to further the investigation in order to flesh out and eliminate some of the inconsistencies, to flesh out some of the things that had not been done.'' He testified that the primary concern with the FBI investigation ``had to do with the fact that the DOE and Bureau had [multiple] suspects, and only two were investigated. ..... That is the principal flaw which ha[d] repercussions like dominoes throughout all of the other probable cause.'' 
   This was not a ``rejection.'' The OIPR attorneys expected the FBI to develop their case against Lee further and to return with additional information. This is normal, as most prosecutors know. Working with agents on investigations is a dynamic process, that regularly involves prosecutors pushing agents to get additional information and facts to bolster the strength of a case. Yet, nearly a year and a half passed before the attorneys at OIPR were again contacted by the FBI about Lee. 
   The report issued by the Governmental Affairs Committee on this issue concludes that although the OIPR attorneys did not view their request for additional investigation as a ``denial'' of the FISA request, the FBI ``took it as such.'' Notwithstanding or even mentioning these apparently differing views as to what had transpired, some have criticized the Justice Department for rejecting the FISA application in 1997. It is far from clear that any rejection took place, and I credit the perspective of the OIPR attorneys that their request to the FBI for additional investigative work was made in an effort to complete--not kill--the FISA application. 
   Second, the Justice Department correctly concluded that the FBI's initial FISA application failed to establish probable cause. Indeed, even the chief of the FBI's National Security Division, John Lewis, who worked on the FISA application, has admitted that he turned in the application earlier than anticipated and without as much supporting information as he would have liked. 
   Determining whether probable cause exists is always a matter of judgment and experience, with important individual rights, public safety and law enforcement interests at stake if a mistake is made. From the outset, prosecutors making such a determination must keep a close eye on the applicable legal standard. 
   Pursuant to the terms of the FISA statute, intelligence surveillance against a United States person may only be authorized upon a showing that there is probable cause to believe: (1) that the targeted United States person is an agent of a foreign power; and (2) that each of the facilities or places to be surveilled is being used, or about to be used by that target. 50 U.S.C. &#167;1801(b)(2), 1804(a)(4). With regard to the first prong, the statute defines several ways in which a United States person can be shown to be an agent of a foreign power. Most relevant here, a United States person is considered an agent of a foreign power if the person ``knowingly engages in clandestine intelligence gathering activities, for or on behalf of a foreign power, which activities involve or may involve a violation of the criminal statutes of the United States.'' 50 U.S.C. &#167;1801(b)(2)(A). 
   Without dissecting all of the allegations against Lee here, there are several issues that undermined the FBI's evidence that Lee was an ``agent of a foreign power'' and, in 1997, engaged in ``clandestine intelligence gathering activities.'' In the letterhead memorandum by which the FBI first sought DOJ approval for the FISA warrant, the FBI reported that an administrative inquiry conducted by DOE and FBI investigators had identified Wen Ho Lee as a suspect in the loss of information relating to the W-88 nuclear warhead. Most critically, however, the FBI indicated that Lee was one of a group of laboratory employees who: (1) had access to W-88 information; (2) had visited China in the relevant time period; and (3) had contact with visiting 
   Chinese delegations. 
   The problem with the FBI's reliance on this administrative inquiry and corresponding narrow focus on Lee and his wife as suspects was that the FBI ``did nothing to follow up on the others.'' The Attorney General testified at the June 8, 1999 Judiciary Committee hearing that ``the elimination of other logical suspects, having the same access and opportunity, did not occur.'' Similarly, the OIPR supervisor who testified at the GAC hearing confirmed that ``the DOE and Bureau had [multiple] suspects, and only two [meaning Lee and his wife] were investigated.'' According to him, as noted above, ``[t]hat is the principal flaw which ha[d] repercussions like dominoes throughout all of the other probable cause.'' Quite simply, the failure of the FBI to eliminate, or even investigate, the other potential suspects identified by the DOE administrative inquiry undermined their case for probable cause. 
   Indeed, this failure to investigate all potential leads identified in the DOE administrative inquiry has prompted the FBI to conduct a thorough re-examination, which is currently underway, of the factual assumptions and investigative conclusions of that initial inquiry. 
   The other evidence that the FBI had gathered about Lee was stale, inconclusive or speculative, at best and certainly did not tie him to the loss of the W-88 nuclear warhead information. For example, the FBI proffered evidence pertaining to a fifteen-year-old contact between Lee and Taiwanese officials. The FBI's earlier investigation boiled down to this: after the FBI learned in 1983 that Lee had been in contact with a scientist at another nuclear laboratory who was under investigation for espionage, Lee was questioned. He explained, eventually, that he had contacted this scientist because he had thought the scientist had been in trouble for doing similar unclassified consulting work that Lee volunteered that he had been doing for Taiwan. To confirm his veracity, the FBI gave Lee a polygraph examination in January 1984, and he passed. This polygraph included questions as to whether he had ever given classified information to any foreign government. Shortly thereafter, the FBI closed its investigation into Lee and this incident. 
   Even if viewed as suspicious, Lee's contacts fifteen years earlier with Taiwanese officials did not give rise to probable cause to believe that in 1997 he was currently engaged in intelligence gathering for China. 
   As a further example, the FBI also relied on evidence that during a trip by Lee to Hong Kong in 1992, there was an unexplained charge incurred by Lee that the FBI speculated could be consistent with Lee having taken a side trip to Beijing. As Attorney General Reno testified at the hearing, the fact that Lee incurred an unexplained travel charge in Hong Kong did not standing alone support an inference that he went to Beijing. It therefore did nothing to support the FBI's claim that Lee was an agent for China. 
   The OIPR attorneys who pushed the FBI for additional investigative work to bolster the FISA application for electronic surveillance of Wen Ho Lee were right--the evidence of probable cause proffered by the FBI was simply insufficient for the warrant. 
   Third, the Justice Department was right not to forward a flawed and insufficient FISA application to the FISA court. Some have suggested that the Lee FISA application should have been forwarded to the court even though the Attorney General (through her attorneys) did not believe there was probable cause. To have done so would have violated the law. 
   The FISA statute specifically states that ``[e]ach application shall require the approval of the Attorney General based upon [her] finding that it satisfies the criteria and requirements. .....'' 50 U.S.C. &#167;1804 (a). The Attorney General is statutorily required to find that the various requirements of the FISA statute have been met before approving an application and submitting it to the court. 
   As a former prosecutor, I know that this screening function is very important. Every day we rely on the sound judgement of experienced prosecutors.  They help protect against encroachments on our civil liberties and constitutional rights. Any claim that the Attorney General should submit a FISA application to the court when in her view the statutory requirements have not been satisfied undermines completely the FISA safeguards deliberately included in the statute in the first place. 
   I appreciate that those who disagree with me that the evidence for the Lee FISA application was insufficient to meet the FISA standard for surveillance against a United States person may urge that this standard be weakened. This would be wrong. 
   The handling of the Wen Ho Lee FISA application does not suggest a flaw in the definition of probable cause in the FISA statute. Instead, it is an example of how the probable cause standard is applied and demonstrates that effective and complete investigative work is and should be required before extremely invasive surveillance techniques will be authorized against a United States person. The experienced Justice Department prosecutors who reviewed the Lee FISA application understood the law correctly and applied it effectively. They insisted that the FBI do its job of investigating and uncovering evidence sufficient to meet the governing legal standard. 
   The Counterintelligence Reform Act of 2000 correctly avoids changing this governing probable cause standard. Instead, the bill simply makes clear what is already the case--that a judge can consider evidence of past activities if they are relevant to a finding that the target currently ``engages'' in suspicious behavior. Indeed, the problem in the Lee case was not any failure to consider evidence of past acts. Rather, it was that the evidence of past acts presented regarding Lee's connections to Taiwan did not persuasively bear on whether Lee, in 1997, was engaging in clandestine intelligence gathering activities for another country, China. 
   Finally, some reforms are needed. The review of the Lee matter so far suggests that internal procedures within the FBI, and between the FBI and the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review, to ensure that follow-up investigation is done to develop probable cause do not always work. I share the concern that it took the FBI an inordinately long time to relay the Justice Department's request for further investigation and to then follow up. 
   The FBI and the OIPR section within DOJ have already taken important steps to ensure better communication, coordination and follow-up investigation in counterintelligence investigations. 
   The FBI announced on November 11, 1999, that it has reorganized its intelligence-related divisions to facilitate the sharing of appropriate information and to coordinate international activities, the gathering of its own intelligence and its work with the counter-espionage agencies of other nations. 
   In addition, I understand that OIPR and the FBI are working to implement a policy under which OIPR attorneys will work directly with FBI field offices to develop probable cause and will maintain relationships with investigating agents. This should ensure better and more direct communication between the attorneys drafting the FISA warrants and the agents conducting the investigation and avoid information bottlenecks that apparently can occur when FBI Headquarters stands in the way of such direct information flow. I encourage the development of such a policy. It should prevent the type of delay in communication that occurred within the FBI from happening again. In addition, the Attorney General advised us at the June 8, 1999 hearing that she has instituted new procedures within DOJ to ensure that she is personally advised if a FISA application is denied or if there is disagreement with the FBI. 
   Notwithstanding all of these wise changes, the FISA legislation will require formal coordination between the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI, or other head of agency, in those rare cases where disagreements like those in the Lee case arise. I am confident that the Directors of the FBI and CIA and the Secretaries of Defense and State, and the Attorney General, are capable of communicating directly on matters when they so choose, even without legislation. I am concerned that certain of these new requirements will be unduly burdensome on our high-ranking officials due to the clauses that prevent the delegation of certain duties. 
   For instance, the bill requires that upon the written request of the Director of the FBI or other head of agency, the Attorney General ``shall personally review'' a FISA application. If, upon this review, the Attorney General declines to approve the application, she must personally provide written notice to the head of agency and ``set forth the modifications, if any, of the application that are necessary in order for the Attorney General to approve the application.'' The head of agency then has the option of adopting the proposed modifications, but should he choose to do so he must ``supervise the making of any modification'' personally. 
   I appreciate that these provisions of this bill are simply designed to ensure that our highest ranking officials are involved when disputes arise over the adequacy of a FISA application. However, we should consider, as we hold hearings on the bill, whether imposing statutory requirements personally on the Attorney General and others is the way to go. 
   I also support provisions in this bill that require information sharing and consultation between intelligence agencies, so that counterintelligence investigations will be coordinated more effectively in the future. In an area of such national importance, it is critical that our law enforcement and intelligence agencies work together as efficiently and cooperatively as possible. Certain provisions of this bill will facilitate this result. 
   In addition, Section 5 of the bill would require the adoption of regulations to govern when and under what circumstances information secured pursuant to FISA authority ``shall be disclosed for law enforcement purposes.'' I welcome attention to this important matter, since OIPR attorneys had concerns in April 1999 about the FBI efforts to use the FISA secret search and surveillance procedures as a proxy for criminal search authority. 
   Whatever our views about who is responsible for the miscommunications and missteps that marred the Wen Ho Lee investigation, S. 2089, the Counterintelligence Reform Act of 2000, stands on its own merits and I commend Senators GRASSLEY, SPECTER, and TORRICELLI for their leadership and hard work in crafting this legislation.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support Senator BOXER's sense-of-the-senate amendment that Congress pass effective juvenile justice legislation by the one year anniversary of the Columbine High School tragedy--April 20, 2000. Unfortunately, the Senate-passed Juvenile Justice legislation has been languishing in a House-Senate conference for months. 
   Sadly, another school shooting is in the news. In Mount Morris Township in the State of Michigan, a six-year-old boy fatally shot a six-year-old girl at an elementary school. As a father and grandfather, it breaks my heart to hear about a first grader shooting one of his fellow classmates. And yesterday a deranged man shot five people in a McDonalds in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
   I have owned firearms for many years and often enjoy target shooting with my friends and family in Vermont. I understand that the vast majority of gun owners in Vermont and around the country use and enjoy their firearms in a responsible and safe way. 
   I am, however, deeply disturbed by the rash of recent incidents of school violence throughout the country. The growing list of schoolyard shootings by children in Arkansas, Washington, Oregon, Tennessee, California, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Mississippi, Colorado, and Georgia is simply unacceptable and intolerable. 
   It pains me even more to now add the Michigan elementary school shooting to this growing list of schoolyard shootings. This tragic incident of school violence took the life of a 6-year-old, Kayla Rolland. 
   What we should be doing is redoubling our efforts to enact the Hatch-Leahy juvenile crime legislation and its sensible public safety provisions that passed the Senate last May with 73 votes. I do not fault Senator HATCH. I know that he is doing what he can on this and that he shares my frustration that the House-Senate conference committee has been stymied in our effort to report that measure back to the House and Senate for final passage. 
   I again urge the Republican leadership in the House and Senate to pass that bill without further obstruction and delay. Let the Congress act and do what it can to help end this senseless violence. Six-year-olds killing other 6-year-olds is unthinkable but now, tragically, all too real. 
   For more than two years, I have worked with other Senators to craft responsible and effective juvenile crime legislation to curb this senseless violence. Last May, the Senate passed the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, S. 254, by a strong bipartisan vote of 73-25. 
   Our comprehensive legislation provides states and local governments with resources to fund programs to prevent juveniles from committing crimes and to properly handle juvenile offenders if they commit crimes. 
   Our balanced approach to juvenile justice also includes provisions to keep children who may harm others away from guns. These provisions include: bans on the transfer to juveniles and the possession by juveniles of assault weapons and high capacity ammunition clips; increased criminal penalties for transfers of handguns, assault weapons, and high capacity ammunition clips to juveniles; bans on prospective gun sales to juveniles with violent crime records; trigger locks to be sold with all handgun sales; background checks on all firearm sales at gun shows; and increased federal resources to enforce firearms laws by $50 million a year. 
   But the majority refuses to move ahead with final passage of a juvenile justice conference report. In fact, the majority even refuses to reconvene the House-Senate conference to meet to discuss the bill. 
   The members of the juvenile justice conference have met only once--on August 5, 1999. That one meeting of the House-Senate juvenile conference was more than six months ago. 
   It is shameful that the majority refuses to act upon a final juvenile justice bill. A bill that would help keep guns out of the hands of children and criminals, while protecting the rights of law-abiding adults to use and enjoy firearms.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very pleased the Senate voted 98-0 on Kermit Bye to be United States Circuit Court Judge for the Eighth Circuit and Justice George Daniels to be United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of New York. 
   Kermit Bye is an outstanding attorney from North Dakota. I will put his full record in the RECORD later. Justice Daniels is a distinguished New Yorker, with the strong support of the two distinguished Senators from New York--Senators MOYNIHAN and SCHUMER--in the same way Kermit Bye had the strong support of the two distinguished Senators from North Dakota--Senators CONRAD and DORGAN. 
   I wish to thank both the Republican leader and the Democratic leader for helping us get these nominations up. They had been reported last year. For some inexplicable reason, they were held up. We see that the Senate, in voting on them, has voted 98-0. I mention this because many times we have judges, who are judicial nominations, where it takes a long time to get their nominations to the floor, and then they are passed by overwhelming margins. Out of a sense of justice towards the people we are putting on our Federal courts, we, the Senate, should do a better job. 
   Many wait too long. The most prominent current examples of that treatment are Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon. We have waited too long to vote on them. I understand, finally, after 4 years, we are going to vote on Judge Paez, who has one of the most distinguished records anybody has ever had who has come before the Senate. He is strongly supported by law enforcement, strongly supported by the bar, strongly supported by the Hispanic community. He is certainly proud of his Hispanic background, as well he should be. He has accomplished more than most people accomplish of any background. I hope that after 4 years he will be voted on. 
   Finally, I had hoped we would reach a vote on Timothy Dyk today. He was first nominated to a vacancy in the Federal Circuit in April of 1998. For anybody who is keeping track, that was well in the last century. After having a hearing and being reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee to the Senate in September of 1998, his nomination was left on the Senate calendar without action and then returned to the President 2 years ago as the 105th Congress adjourned. He was renominated in January 1999 and reported favorably in October 1999. 
   So he has been waiting for all these years. He has clerked for three Supreme Court Justices, including the Chief Justice. He has a remarkably distinguished career. He has represented people across the spectrum, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which strongly backs him. I hope we can get him confirmed this week or next. They need him on the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. He is one of the most qualified people we have ever seen. We should do it. 
   Mr. Dyk has distinguished himself with a long career of private practice in the District of Columbia. From 1964 to 1990, he worked with Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering as an associate and then as a partner. Since 1990, he has been with Jones Day Reavis & Pogue as a partner and Chair of its Issues and Appeals Section. 
   Mr. Dyk received his undergraduate degree in 1958 from Harvard College, and his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1961. Following law school, he clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justices Reed, Burton, and Chief Justice Warren. Mr. Dyk was also a Special Assistant to the Assistant Attorney General in the Tax Division. His has been a distinguished career in which he has represented a wide array of clients, including the United States Chamber of Commerce. I look forward to the confirmation vote on this highly-qualified nominee. 
   Kermit Bye is an outstanding attorney from North Dakota. From 1962 to 1966, Mr. Bye was the Deputy Securities Commissioner and Special Assistant Attorney General for the State of North Dakota. And from 1966 to 1968, he was an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the District of North Dakota. Since 1968, he has been a member and partner with the Fargo law firm of Votel, Kelly, Knutson, Weir, Bye & Hunke, Ltd. Mr. Bye received his undergraduate degree in 1959 from the University of North Dakota, and his law degree from the University of North Dakota Law School in 1962. 
   Mr. Bye's nomination is another of those that was favorably reported last year by the Judiciary Committee but which was not acted upon by the Senate. He is strongly supported by Senator DORGAN and Senator CONRAD, who are to be commended for their efforts on his behalf and on behalf of the people of North Dakota that has finally brought us to this day. 
   Justice George Daniels is a distinguished New Yorker. He has distinguished himself with a long career of service in the New York federal and state court systems. He was an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York from 1983 to 1989. From 1989 to 1990, and again from 1993 to 1995, he was a Judge in the Criminal Court of the City of New York. And from 1990 to 1993, he was a counsel to the Mayor of the City of New York. Since 1995, Mr. Daniels has been a Justice of the Supreme Court of the State of New York. 
   Justice Daniels received his undergraduate degree in 1975 from Yale University, and his law degree from the University of California at Berkeley, Boalt Hall School of Law in 1978. 
   He has the strong support of Senator MOYNIHAN and Senator SCHUMER and the ABA has given him its highest rating. Although he was reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee last year, his was one of the nominations not acted upon by the Senate. I congratulate the Senators from New York and Justice Daniels and his family on his consideration today. 
   I thank the majority leader and commend the Democratic leader for scheduling the consideration of these judicial nominations. The debate on judicial nominations over the last couple of years has included too much delay with respect to too many nominations. 
   The most prominent current examples of that treatment are Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon. With respect to these nominations, the Senate has for too long refused to do its constitutional duty and vote. I am grateful that the majority leader agreed last year to bring each of those nominations to a Senate vote before March 15. Nominees deserve to be treated with dignity and dispatch--not delayed for two or three or four years. The nomination of Judge Paez has now been pending for over four years. He has the strong support of his home State Senators and of local law enforcement. 
   His has been a distinguished career in which he has served as a state and federal judge for what is now approaching 19 years. His story is a wonderful American story of hard work, fairness and public service. He and his family have much of which to be proud. Hispanic organizations from California and around the country have urged the Senate to act favorably on his nomination without further delay. 
   Within the next two weeks the Senate will be called upon to vote on this outstanding nomination, and I trust that we will do the right thing. I recall when Judge Sonia Sotomayor, another outstanding District Court Judge, was nominated to the Second Circuit and her nomination was delayed. Reportedly, she was so well qualified that some feared her quick confirmation might have led her to be considered as a possible Supreme Court nomination and that was why Senate consideration of her nomination was delayed through secret holds. Ultimately, she was confirmed to the Second Circuit. 
   After all the delay in that case, I was struck that not a single Senator who voted against her confirmation and not a single Senator who had acted to delay its consideration uttered a single word to justify such opposition. 
   Of course it is every Senator's right to vote as he or she sees fit on all matters. But I would hope that in the case of Judge Richard Paez, where his nomination has been delayed for over four years, for the longest period in the history of the Senate, those who have opposed him will show him the courtesy of using this time to discuss with us any concerns that may have and to explain the basis for any negative vote against a person so well qualified for the position to which he has been nominated by the President.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am joining forces with my good friend Senator HATCH on a Judiciary Committee bill that would prohibit improper tampering with product identification codes. 
   Manufacturers code their products in order to protect their consumers and to assist law enforcement in investigating consumer complaints, as well as in conducting recalls of tampered products. These codes assist the manufacturer and law enforcement in tracing goods back to a particular lot, batch or date of production. They include batch codes, expiration dates, lot numbers, and other information that one can typically see imprinted on the bottom or side of most products. 
   This product identification codes are extremely important in terms of product recall. There were over 250 product recalls last year--including two recent product recalls, one of ready-to-eat diet shakes and the other regarding the recall of 7,000 cases of infant formula. Also, product codes were of great help regarding the Tylenol poisonings of 1982 and the contaminated strawberry incident in Michigan in which school children became ill. 
   Forensic experts have used product identification codes in investigating numerous crimes including the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City. Sometimes product codes are used to exonerate the innocent. For example, the product codes in the batteries involved in the Olympic Park, Atlanta, bombing helped exonerate the security guard, Richard Jewell, under suspicion in that case. 
   Product codes have been fraudulently altered regarding medicines, fertility drugs, and even bulk frozen shrimp. This makes it very difficult to trade back these products and to determine their safety. This bill addresses those concerns. 
   This bill contains significant improvements over a version introduced in the other body some time ago. Wholesalers were worried that they could not repackage goods--together into ``sale baskets''--to be sold at discount prices. This bill permits the resale of products at discounted prices. Each individual item would have to keep the original code but the prices could be changed depending on competitive market forces. 
   It is important that manufacturers not be able to control prices by operation of this bill. Consumers interested in bargains need to be able to get the best bargain they can get. This bill does not prevent the reselling of overstocked, or other, goods to discount retailers. 
   The bill also makes clear that any innocent alterations of product identification codes are not subject to the criminal provisions. 
   The bill contains a provision unrelated to product identification codes which I want to discuss for a moment. The bill prohibits at flea markets the sale of baby food, infant formula, or similar products made for consumption of children under three years of age. It also prohibits the sale of drugs, medical foods, cosmetics, and medical devices as defined in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act at flea markets unless the seller keeps for public inspection written documentation identifying the seller person as an authorized representative of the manufacturer or distributor of the food, drug, device, or cosmetic. 
   This appears to be a reasonable policy but I am very interested in the views of my colleagues on this matter as there may be other ways to achieve the goals of these flea market provisions. I intend to work closely with the Committee Chairman, Senator HATCH, and my other colleagues regarding this bill.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we begin the 2d session of the 106th Congress, we should think about the challenge we face with respect to our constitutional responsibility to work with the President to provide the many Federal judges who are desperately needed around the country. 
   Today I thank our Democratic leader, but I also particularly thank the majority leader, both longtime friends. They moved forward Senate consideration of two of the seven judicial nominations that were favorably reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee last year. 
   I know that had the distinguished majority leader not taken the earlier parliamentary action he did today, this would not have happened. I thank him for doing that. 
   I note the heavy vote on both these nominees. One had a vote of 96 votes. The other had a vote of 95 votes. Perhaps more relevant, there were only two votes against them. I would love to win elections by those kinds of margins in my home State of Vermont. 
   The point is that these distinguished jurists have been held up for some time. Yet when they finally come to a vote, we find an overwhelming majority of Republicans and Democrats are for them. 
   I hope that we might proceed to prompt action on the remaining five judicial nominations on the Senate calendar, as well. Having confirmed Judge Ambro and Judge Pisano, I wish we were proceeding, as well, on the confirmations of Kermit Bye to the Eighth Circuit, Judge George Daniels to the District Court for the Southern District of New York, Tim Dyk to the Federal Circuit, and Marsha Berzon and Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit. 
   I hope that the distinguished majority leader, Senator LOTT, and the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator DASCHLE, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, and I can find a way to consider each of the judicial nominations reported last year to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee.  
   Last October, Senator LOTT committed to working with us, and I commend him for that. Also, in November, he announced he would press forward for votes on the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon to the Ninth Circuit by March 15. In that regard, not only do I commend him for pushing forward, but I commend the distinguished Senators from California, Senators FEINSTEIN and BOXER, for their steadfast support of these nominees. They are now in line to receive Senate action. We should do the same with all the others. 
   Then there is the question of the 31 judicial nominations pending in the Judiciary Committee. In fact, 29 not yet had hearings, although we now have some planned. 
   I am challenging the Senate to regain the pace it met in 1998 when the committee held 13 hearings and the Senate confirmed 65 judges. That would still be one fewer than the number of judges confirmed by a Democratic Senate majority in the last year of the Bush administration in 1992. In fact, in the last 2 years of the Bush administration, a Democratic Senate majority with a Republican President confirmed 124 judges. We now have a Democratic President with a Republican-controlled Senate, and it would take 90 confirmations this year alone for the Senate to equal that total. 
   Let me show a chart. These are Presidential election years. This is what we have done on nominations: 64 in 1980; 44 in 1984; 1988, with a Democratic-controlled Senate and a Republican-control Presidency, 42; in 1992, with the Democrats in control of the Senate and with a Republican President, we confirmed 66 judges; but then 4 years later with a Republican Senate and a Democratic President, it dropped to only 17 judges without a single judge confirmed to the federal courts of appeals; and now we have confirmed 2 judges so far this year. 
   I hope we can do better. I hope we will say that 1996 was an anomaly and the Senate will very much take its duties seriously. 
   Let these judges have a vote. If Senators do not want them, vote against them. But as we have seen, oftentimes even when they are held up, if they can finally get a vote, they are overwhelmingly confirmed by the Senate. 
   Over the last 5 years, the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed the following: 58 federal judges in the 1995 session; 17 in 1996; 36 in 1997; 65 in 1998; and 34 in 1999. In one year, 1994, with a Democratic majority in the Senate, we confirmed 101 judges. With commitment and hard work many things are achievable. I am not demanding that the Senate confirm 101 judges this year, as we did in 1994, or 90 or 80 or even 70. But I do challenge the Republican-controlled Senate to hold at least 13 hearings and confirm at least 65 judges, as it did in 1998. 
   We failed to reach those goals last year when the Judiciary Committee held barely half that number of hearings and confirmed barely half that number of judges. A confirmation total of 65 at the end of this year is achievable if we make the effort, exhibit the commitment and do the work that is needed to be done. We cannot achieve this goal if we wait several more weeks before holding hearings or wait several weeks between hearings. To hold at least 13 hearings requires the Committee to begin holding hearings right away and to hold hearings at least every other week for the entire session. 
   I am continuing to work with Chairman HATCH so that all of the nominees submitted to us get a fair hearing before the committee and a fair up-or-down vote before the Senate. 
   We begin this year with 79 judicial vacancies, more than existed when the Republican majority took control of the Senate five years ago and over 50 percent more than when the Senate adjourned in 1998. Over the last 5 years we have actually lost ground in our efforts to fill longstanding judicial vacancies that are plaguing the Federal courts. 
   Moreover, the Republican Congress has refused to consider the authorization of the additional judges needed by the federal judiciary to deal with their ever increasing workload. In 1984, and in 1990, Congress responded to requests by the Chief Justice and the Judiciary Conference for needed judicial resources. Indeed, in 1990, a Democratic majority in the Congress created scores of needed new judgeships during a Republican administration. 
   Three years ago the Judicial Conference of the United States requested that an additional 53 judgeships be authorized around the country. Last year the Judicial Conference renewed its request but increased it to 72 judgeships needing to be authorized around the country. Instead, the only Federal judgeships created since 1990 were the nine District Court judgeships authorized in the omnibus appropriations bill at the end of last year. 
   If Congress had timely considered and passed the Federal Judgeship Act of 1999, S. 1145, as it should have, the Federal judiciary would have over 150 vacancies today. That is the more accurate measure of the needs of the Federal judiciary that have been ignored by the Congress over the past several years and places the vacancy rate for the Federal judiciary at over 16 percent--151 out of 915. As it is, the vacancy rate is almost 10 percent--79 out of 852--and has remained too high throughout the 5 years that the Republican majority has controlled the Senate. 
   Especially troubling is the vacancy rate on the courts of appeals, which continues at 15 percent--27 out of 179--without the creation of any of the additional judgeships that those courts need to handle their increased workloads. 
   Most troubling is the circuit emergency that had to be declared four months ago by the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. I recall when the Second Circuit had such an emergency 2 years ago. Along with the other Senators representing States from the Circuit, I worked hard to fill the five vacancies then plaguing my circuit. The situation in the Fifth Circuit is not one that we should tolerate; it is a situation that I wished we had confronted by expediting consideration of the nominations of Alston Johnson and Enrique Moreno last year. I hope that the Senate will consider both of them promptly in the early part of this year. 
   I deeply regret that the Senate adjourned in November and left the Fifth Circuit to deal with the crisis in the federal administration of justice in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi without the resources that it desperately needs. I look forward to our resolving this difficult situation promptly this session. I will work with the majority leader and the Democratic leader to resolve that emergency at the earliest possible time. 
   With 27 vacancies on the Federal appellate courts across the country and 73 percent of the judicial emergency vacancies in the Federal courts system in our appellate courts, our courts of appeals are being denied the resources that they need, and their ability to administer justice for the American people is being hurt. There continue to be multiple vacancies on the Ninth Circuit. Six vacancies out of 28 authorized judgeships is too many; perpetuating five judicial emergency vacancies, as the Senate has in this one circuit, is irresponsible. We should act on these nominations promptly and provide the Ninth Circuit with the judicial resources it needs and to which it is entitled. 
   I am likewise concerned that the Third, Fourth and Sixth Circuits are suffering from multiple vacancies. 
   I look forward to Senate action on the long-delayed nominations of Judge Richard Paez, Marsha Berzon and Tim Dyk. I continue to urge the Senate to meet our responsibilities to all nominees, including women and minorities, and look forward to prompt and favorable action on the nominations of Judge Julio Fuentes to the Third Circuit, Judge James Wynn, Jr. to the Fourth Circuit, Enrique Moreno to the Fifth Circuit, and Kathleen McCree Lewis to the Sixth Circuit. 
   Working together the Senate can join with the President to confirm well-qualified, diverse and fair-minded judges to fulfill the needs of the Federal courts around the country. I urge all Senators to make the Federal administration of justice a top priority for the Senate this year. 
   Mr. President, I see my distinguished friend from Florida on the floor. I thank him for his courtesy. I commend the distinguished senior Senator from New Jersey for giving us such a fine nominee. I yield the floor.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there was an article in one of our Vermont papers in the last few days about an extraordinary family of Vermonters. Marcelle and I have known Dick and Linda Butsch for many, many years and we have been especially pleased to watch their five children as they have grown. We have also watched Jen and Chris, and the triplets, Sarah, Patrick, and Gillian. 
   Sarah, Patrick, and Gillian were recently profiled because of their hockey activities. I will, at the end of my comments submit to the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD the entire story. 
   Dick and Linda are the best of Vermonters. Not only have they given a great deal of themselves to the community and to their families, but I have always remembered with fondness the many kindnesses they showed to my mother and father, while they were alive. 
   We are a small State, but it is people like the Butschs that make us a great State, and I congratulate all of them and continue to look with admiration as their children grow and develop.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Home Heating Oil Price Stability Act being introduced today by Senator DODD. In response to Congressional concern raised over volatile heating oil prices, the Department of Energy completed a study of regional oil reserves and issued their report in 1998. This report concluded that regional heating oil reserves, such as the one proposed in this bill, would benefit New England and help guard against the negative effects of volatile fuel prices during the winter months. 
   The recent price spike in home heating fuel throughout the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions illustrate the need for a regional fuel reserve. Prices of home heating fuel have increased over the last month to unprecedented levels, putting many families and businesses at risk during these cold winter months. Many areas of New England are now facing fuel costs between $1.70 and $2.00 per gallon--nearly double last January's average price of .80 cents per gallon. Home heating fuel has not seen average prices over $1 dollar in nearly ten years. These prices are endangering the welfare of low income Vermonters and threatening the stability of our economy. 
   This is not the first time we have seen such volatile prices in New England and will certainly not be the last. I remember Vermont in December 1989, when we experienced the coldest temperatures the Northeast has seen in 100 years, and then again in 1993 when the mercury plummeted and the fuel bills rose. Mr. President we need a regional home heating fuel reserve to protect the welfare and the economy of states such as Vermont. The cold winters and the absence of refiners make New England susceptible to fluctuations in the market which leave other parts of the country virtually untouched.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I very proudly cosponsored the amendment of the Senator from New York. Senator SCHUMER's amendment on debts incurred through the commission of violence to health service clinics is a good one. It closes a real-life loophole in our bankruptcy code because some people are using the bankruptcy laws to avoid paying debts arising from clinic violence. 
   That is a dangerous precedent that Congress should stop. It would be the same if somebody was doing this using the bankruptcy laws to escape paying bills for violence against anybody, whether groups with which I agree or groups with which I disagree. 
   We should not use the bankruptcy laws for this. It is wrong to allow court judgments under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act to be discharged under our bankruptcy laws. In fact, 12 individuals who created the Nuremberg Files web site filed bankruptcy to avoid their debts under the law. 
   If I could make a personal note on this, at a time when a doctor was murdered in New York because his name was on the Nuremberg Files, within days they determined that the chief suspect was a man from Vermont. I went to the Nuremberg Files. My name was listed among those to be shot.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I intend to vote for the Bankruptcy Reform Act to send it to conference in the hope that we can continue to improve the bill so that a balanced bankruptcy reform bill can be signed into law by President Clinton this year. 
   We have adopted 45 amendments during the floor debate on this bill--  amendments offered by Republicans and Democrats. 
   During the course of our floor debate, Senators from both sides of the aisle have come forward to made bipartisan progress to improve this bill from that reported by the Judiciary Committee. I want to thank Chairman HATCH and Senator GRASSLEY for working with us, with me and Senator REID and Senator TORRICELLI, and with the proponents of many amendments. This debate has not been easy with more than 300 amendments filed to the bill back in November. We have worked through those amendments. 
   Let there be no confusion: This is certainly not the bill that I would have drafted, even now after the amendment process. This is not as good or as balanced a bill as that which the Senate passed by a 97 to one vote in 1998. Still, it has been significantly improved in its bankruptcy provisions through a bipartisan amendment process. 
   We have worked in good faith with the Republican managers to have an open debate. This is how the Senate works and how it should work. From a total of 320 amendments, we have now worked through them all. That is a bipartisan accomplishment of which we can all be proud. 
   I have tried during the course of this consideration to protect the rights of Democratic Senators to offer and debate their amendments. While we have not always prevailed after a vote, we have at least been faithful to our Senate tradition and preserved the opportunity to offer, debate and vote in relation to those amendments. 
   In some significant regard, we have been successful in improving this bill. Over the course of the last three years we have been able to help reshape the bill to protect child support payments as a priority in bankruptcy. 
   We added modest but essential credit industry reforms to the bill. The millions of credit card solicitations made to American consumers the past few years have caused, in part, the rise in consumer bankruptcies. The credit card industry should bear some responsibility for these problems. The improvements to the Truth In Lending Act that we have been able to add to this measure provide for more disclosure of information so that consumers may better manage their debts and avoid bankruptcy altogether. 
   We adopted other important amendments to improve the bill, as well. Indeed, we adopted amendments during Senate debate on this bill. I want to list just a few of these important amendments for the record. 
   The Senate overwhelmingly voted to close the homestead exemption loophole in the Bankruptcy Code. By a vote of 76 to 22, the Senate adopted the Kohl-Sessions amendment to cap any homestead exemption at $100,000. In States such as Florida and Texas, debtors have been permitted to take an unlimited exemption from their creditors for the value of their home. This has lead wealthy debtors to abuse their State laws to protect million dollar mansions from creditors. This has been a real abuse of bankruptcy's fresh start protection. 
   We adopted the Leahy-Murray-Feinstein amendment to clarify that expenses to protect victims of domestic abuse are necessary expenses in a bankruptcy proceeding. We adopted a Feingold amendment to clarify the long-term expenses of a debtor caring for a nondependent parent or relative are necessary expenses in a bankruptcy proceeding. We adopted the Kennedy amendment to protect a debtor's Social Security benefits in a bankruptcy proceeding. These are good amendments that improve the bill. 
   We adopted the Grassley-Torricelli-Specter-Feingold-Biden amendment to provide bankruptcy judges with the discretion to waive filing fees for low-come debtors. Bankruptcy is the only civil proceeding without in forma pauperis filing status and this amendment corrects that anomaly. And we adopted the Feingold-Specter amendment that struck the bill's requirement that a debtor's attorney must pay a trustee's attorney fees if the debtor is not ``substantially justified'' in filing for chapter 7. That requirement could have discouraged honest debtors from filing for chapter 7 for fear of paying future attorney fees. Together these amendments improve the fairness of bankruptcy proceedings. 
   We adopted the Leahy amendment that struck the bill's mandate for all debtors to file past tax returns and instead permits parties in interest to request tax information if needed. The wasteful provision stricken by my amendment should save taxpayers an estimated $24 million over the next five years by cutting down on unnecessary storage costs and paperwork burdens. 
   We adopted the Reed-Sessions amendment to protect debtors by giving them adequate information for decisions about reaffirmations of unsecured and low-value secured debt. We adopted the Sarbanes-Durbin amendment on disclosure of consumer credit information. 
   Forty-three amendments were adopted to the Committee bill, many made important improvements, many on a bipartisan basis. 
   Unfortunately, while we made progress on the underlying bill in many regards, it still lacks the balance that it needs to become good law and remains tilted too far toward making taxpayers and the bankruptcy courts pay for the excesses of the credit industry. It is my hope that with the help of the Administration and the continuing cooperation of Chairman HATCH and Senator GRASSLEY and our House counterparts that we can continue to improve this measure during the course of a House-Senate conference and report a consensus bill that we can all proudly support. 
   Most threatening to the prospects of this bill becoming law are the nonrelevant, nongermane amendments adopted last November to this bill. Last year, Senate adoption of those nonrelevant, nongermane amendments quite properly led to a presidential veto threat. I will work in the House-Senate conference to have those amendments removed from the conference report and final bill. If they are not, I have grave doubt whether any bankruptcy reform bill can become law this year. 
   Regrettably the Senate rejected the Kennedy amendment to provide a real minimum wage increase and, on a virtual party line vote, chose to adopt an amendment that includes unpaid tax breaks and a watered down increment in the minimum wage for working people. The President noted that the Republican majority used its amendment ``as a cynical tool to advance special interest tax breaks.'' 
   Last year, the Senate also adopted by a one-vote margin, a poison pill amendment regarding sentencing policy. I opposed this amendment because it attempted to solve the unfair discrepancy between sentences for powder and crack cocaine in precisely the wrong way--by increasing the use of mandatory minimums for those who possess, import, manufacture, or distribute powder cocaine, without taking any steps to reduce the use of disproportionate mandatory minimums for those who commit crack cocaine offenses. 
   I have repeatedly stated my objections to the shortsighted use of mandatory minimums in the battle against illegal drugs, and my objections are all the more grave when an attempt is made to increase the use of mandatory minimums through provisions placed in the middle of a unrelated bill offered at the end of a session. Returning to the failed drug policies of the recent past is not the way to enact a fair and balanced bankruptcy reform bill. 
   The bipartisan methamphetamine legislation included in that amendment was passed separately at the end of the last session. Accordingly, the only portion of that amendment worth voting for has already been passed separately. That nonrelevant, nongermane amendment should also be jettisoned in conference. 
   The Senate's actions last year in adopting the two Republican nonrelevant and nongermane amendments were both unfortunate and unwise. I hope the House-Senate conference committee will discard these two poison pill amendments as we craft a final bankruptcy reform bill that can become law. 
   I look forward to working with the Senate and House conferees to improve the Bankruptcy Reform Act in conference. I hope the majority has learned from the mistakes made during the bankruptcy reform conference in the last Congress two years ago. This year, we should work together to make further improvements and add balance to the Bankruptcy Reform Act. 
   Finally, I want to commend Chairman HATCH and Senator GRASSLEY for  their management of this bill and thank Senator REID, our Assistant Democratic Leader, for all his effort and assistance in connection with this matter. 
   Senator GRASSLEY has persevered in this effort when lesser men would have given up and he continues to work with us in good faith to craft reform legislation. 
   Chairman HATCH has returned to his important leadership responsibilities in the Senate without missing a step. He is a legislator of the first order with whom I am glad to work on many matters. Today we culminate our work together on initial Senate passage of the Bankruptcy Reform Act so that we can continue our efforts in a House-Senate conference. 
   Senator REID has worked with me to protect the rights of Democratic Senators and to improve the bill. I have thanked him many times in the days and weeks that we have been on the Senate floor together working to improve this bill and do so, again, today. 
   I look forward to working together with Chairman HATCH, Senator GRASSLEY, Senator TORRICELLI, the House conferees, and the Clinton Administration on a conference report that leads to enactment of a fair and balanced Bankruptcy Reform Act. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for his kind remarks. He has persevered in this effort. He and I talked about this last fall when we were about ready to recess. We both committed ourselves to the fact that if this came back up this year, we would try to make it work. We told our respective leaders, Senator LOTT and Senator DASCHLE, that we would continue to work whittling down amendments. We were able to dispose of, I believe, well over 300 amendments. 
   The distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. TORRICELLI, and the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. HATCH, worked so hard on this. Lesser people might have given up. They did not. They continued on. 
   The chairman, Senator HATCH, returned to his important leadership responsibilities without missing a step. I have been glad to work with him on this. We culminated our work on initial Senate passage of this bankruptcy act. Now we can go to conference. 
   Senators TORRICELLI and GRASSLEY will have their work cut out for them, as well as the rest of us, in trying to work that out. We will not have the help of the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. REID, in removing a lot of amendments for us as he did on the floor. He has been tremendous in working that out. 
   On this side of the aisle, he worked to protect the rights of Democratic Senators and to improve the bill, and he has worked with his counterparts on the other side of the aisle in our joint effort to get amendments off this bill. 
   As the Senator from Iowa and I discussed earlier, we both have been here long enough to know we did have an enormous number of amendments to a bill, but we also know many are called but few are chosen. 
   So we will work together with Chairman HATCH, Senator GRASSLEY, Senator TORRICELLI, the House conferees, and the Clinton administration on a conference report that I think will be well worthwhile. 
   I hope we will not make the mistake of the past Congress where we came out of conference with something that never went anywhere. We have demonstrated in the Senate now twice, in lopsided votes, that we can pass a bankruptcy reform act. I hope we will come out of the conference with something that we can pass. 
   Lastly, I know a number of staff members, all of whom deserve praise, have been mentioned on this floor, but it is often said Senators are usually only constitutional necessities to the staff who really do the work around here. In that regard, Bruce Cohen and Ed Pagano of the Senate Judiciary Committee staff have worked long hours, many weekends, and late nights to get us this far, and they deserve a great deal of credit. 
   I see my good friend from New Jersey, the ranking member of the subcommittee, who told us it would be possible to get a bill through here back when many thought it would not be possible. He was right. He worked very hard. He deserves a great deal of credit. 
   I yield the floor to him.

   Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, the economy is now entering its 107th month of expansion. That is almost 9 years out of the 25 years I have had the pleasure to serve in this Chamber. Not since the 1960s has the economy experienced such an extended period of growth. 
   A number of Senators have spoken on the floor today to commend Alan Greenspan for his foresight and his quick hand in raising interest rates to keep inflation in check. The actions of Alan Greenspan and the Fed have certainly contributed to our unprecedented growth--growth that has also been sustained by the sound fiscal policies of President Clinton and Congress. I would remind the Congress, that we can also do our part to help the economy by continuing to pay down our national debt. 
   Today the Fed is meeting again to consider another possible rate hike. The American economy was certainly on fire during the fourth quarter of 1999. Mr. Greenspan and the Fed have hesitated little in hiking rates to nip inflation in the bud. Last year, the Fed raised interest rates three times by a quarter point each--three times over the short span of 6 months. Such vigilance has been one important part of maintaining the unprecedented growth of our economy. 
   While it might be blasphemy among macroeconomic economists, I would like to take a moment to urge members of the Federal Open Market Committee to consider the disproportionate effect that these hikes have on low and middle income families. As the Fed mulls rate policy as we speak, I would urge Mr. Greenspan to be doubly sure about raising rates when such hikes, while keeping the economy strong to the benefit of wealthy Americans, may also be tying the hands of low and middle income Americans. 
   Each time the Fed raises interest rates, average Americans are hit by an immediate increase in mortgage costs, car payments, and credit card rates. These payments are a disproportionate burden on lower and middle income Americans. 
   For the past week we have been debating a reform of our country's bankruptcy laws. During the course of debate, we have talked at length about the rise in credit card debt. By December of 1999, Americans racked up nearly $589 billion in revolving credit debt. This burden is carried primarily by low and middle income families. An increase in interest rates is likely to pinch these individuals and make it more difficult to pay off their debt and save for the future. 
   I have been contacted by Vermonters who say they are struggling to pay off their debt and save money to buy homes. These Vermonters face a major setback each time the Fed makes the decision to increase interest rates. In its meeting today and in the future, I urge the Federal Reserve to consider the effect of raising rates on these individuals. 
   With all the praising being done of Chairman Greenspan today, I wish to note there are a number of Vermonters who contacted me who feel quite a bit differently. Nobody doubts a strong economy, an expansive economy. I think much of the credit, frankly, goes to those who, in 1993, were willing to face down the naysayers and take the first step to have a real balanced budget in the Congress. It sent a signal to the financial markets that for the first time, certainly in my lifetime, the Congress was serious about balancing the budget. 
   During the 1980s we had seen all the lip service paid and the sloganeering about balancing the budget, while during the 1980s we tripled the national debt and ran the biggest deficits of any nation in the history of the world. 
   In 1993 I heard many voices, actually on the other side of the aisle, saying if we cast these votes to bring about balancing the budget, it would bring about economic collapse. It would bring about staggering unemployment. It would bring about runaway inflation. And it would bring about huge deficits. It did just the opposite. The unemployment rate has dropped, inflation came to a standstill, the economy boomed, the deficits disappeared, and now we have a budget surplus. Many Members of Congress were courageous enough to cast the real votes that might do that--as compared to simply the sloganeering and doing nothing--and many of them lost their place in the House and Senate for doing it, even though they made a better country for all of us and for our children. 
   I note that because I believe that vote was as significant a part of bringing about the credibility necessary for a strong economy as anything we have done. The expansion of the information technology industries, high tech, and so forth, also were part of it and a steadying influence by Chairman Greenspan and the Fed. 
   But this idea that one person controls this economy by himself is something that even some who sit here in the Senate cannot say with a straight face. As many Vermonters have told me, when they see interest rates being raised over and over and over again at a time when there is no inflation, when the economy has more and more people coming into the workforce--because every time you have a merger, thousands of people are laid off. They go and seek jobs in other parts of the labor market. We see all these things and question why interest rates go up. The interest rates going up apparently have given a great benefit to the wealthiest of Americans but has done very little for the average man and woman, certainly in my State. 
   In my State, we have seen oil prices and heating oil costs go up substantially this winter, and now the Fed is about to tell everybody: We are going to raise your interest rates again; we are going to raise your mortgages rates again; we are going to raise the interest rates on your credit cards again. If you are a small business, we are going to raise your costs of doing business again. 
   I am not sure what is gained by these interest rate hikes. It puts a very heavy burden on those families where the husband and wife are both working and trying to pay the kids' tuition, pay the bills, and pay the mortgage. It certainly puts a heavy burden on small businesses in my State. 
   It will help some bankers, absolutely. It will help credit card companies, absolutely. It will help some of the wealthiest, absolutely. And maybe there is a plan in here that by helping all of them, some day it may help the people who keep the country going and pay the bills. Possibly. 
   I share the skepticism of those Vermonters, and I hope when this vote is cast, which I assume will be overwhelming for the reconfirmation of Chairman Greenspan, that he will not take this as some kind of an accolade that nobody disagrees with what he has done; that he will understand there are those who actually have to pay their mortgages, those who do not have millions of dollars, those who do not have six-figure incomes and are hurt by these interest rate hikes; that they are the ones who see no inflation and probably have been laid off from jobs because of mergers and are out seeking another job and are now hit with an extra whammy of paying more for their mortgages, their credit cards, for the things they need. 
   Some of the thoughts of the Fed that the boom will not continue, that inflation was around the corner has not been proven, and I do not think the steps they are taking are right. That is one person's opinion. Obviously, it is very much a minority opinion but certainly an opinion that is felt strongly by the average man and woman who are earning a weekly salary and paying the bills.  
   I hope the Fed will look at some of the data they have available to them and understand there are other ways of combating inflation than simply raising interest rates and that the country will realize there are a lot of very courageous people who voted for a balanced budget in 1993. Rather than simply talking about it, all those courageous people who lost their places in Congress for doing that are also the ones who deserve an enormous amount of credit today for the huge economy we have underway.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend Senator FEINGOLD, Senator REED of Rhode Island, and Senator HARKIN for the leadership they have shown on the East Timor issue. They have all been to East Timor and have consistently spoken out in support of independence for East Timor and human rights for its people. 
   Senator FEINGOLD's resolution would end all U.S. military cooperation with Indonesia on account of the Indonesian military's appalling abuses in East Timor. This would send an unequivocal message, not only there but throughout the world, that the United States will not resume any relationship with the Indonesian military until it is thoroughly reformed, and not only reformed, but the members who are responsible for the abuses are punished. 
   Some of these abuses, well documented by independent news media and eyewitness accounts, are so horrible they are reminiscent of the Dark Ages. 
   I understand the resolution is going to be withdrawn on account of the progress being made by the Indonesian Government in asserting control of the military. However, Senator FEINGOLD's determination to keep the Senate's attention on this important issue is well worthwhile. 
   Last September we watched in horror as a systematic campaign of terror and destruction waged in East Timor: Hundreds of innocent people were killed, hundreds of thousands more were forcibly uprooted from their homes, villages and towns were ransacked and family members were killed in front of other family members. Even today, U.N. investigators are unearthing what we are seeing too often in modern times: bodies in mass graves. 
   In the past two days, an Indonesian Government commission and a United Nations commission independently concluded that the Indonesian military bears ultimate responsibility for the bloodbath, and must be held accountable for its abuses in East Timor. This is an extremely important and encouraging step. 
   Under tremendous pressure--tremendous pressure to turn a blind eye to what happened in East Timor--and at great personal risk, Indonesian investigators have done a commendable job in determining the extent of the violence and identifying the individuals responsible, including not only those who gave the orders but those who had the power to stop the mayhem and instead simply stood by and let it happen. 
   There are sins of comission and there are sins of omission. If you are a military officer with the power to stop something from happening--an atrocity, a murder--and you stand by and allow it to go on, in my mind you are as equally guilty as those who commit the act. 
   As the leader of Indonesia's new democratic government, President Wahid has courageously voiced his willingness to confront the powerful Indonesian military establishment. He has called for the prosecutions of army leaders, including General Wiranto, former commander of the Armed Forces, who, until recently, was lauded by officials of our own Pentagon. 
   The United Nations commission called for the establishment of an independent national tribunal to bring those responsible for the violence in East Timor to justice. It is a proposal which the Indonesian Government has rejected, insisting it is capable of punishing the perpetrators itself. 
   While it is too early to say whether an Indonesian tribunal would have sufficient resources or authority to conduct what are likely to be long and expensive trials of military leaders, one thing is clear: now is not the time for the United States to follow the European Union's recent example of renewed military assistance or sales of military equipment to Indonesia. With all due respect to our European friends, sometimes I think they have a terribly 
   short memory. 
   Indonesia is at a critical juncture in its transition to democracy. The commission's findings will heighten the already tense relationship between the Indonesian Government and the Indonesian military. As pressure on the military increases, it is likely that rumors of a coup will become louder and more threatening. I believe the United States has to continue to show strong support for President Wahid and for an end to the long history of impunity and immunity enjoyed by members of the Indonesian military. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I don't pretend to know all the history or intricacies of the effort to bring about peace in Northern Ireland, notwithstanding the number of visits I have made there, notwithstanding the historic ties to that island that I have through my father's family, or even with the work I have done with our distinguished former colleague, George Mitchell, a man who deserves the highest credit for his tireless efforts towards peace in Northern Ireland. But I have met with those who are key figures in Ireland: David Trimble from the loyalists side; Seamus Mallon, Gerry Adams, and another key figure, John Hume. Mr. Trimble and Mr. Hume shared the Nobel Peace Prize for the work they did, and deservedly so. 
   I was one of those in the Senate who urged, near the beginning of President Clinton's term in office, to give a visa to Gerry Adams, the head of Sinn Fein and the one most visibly connected in this country with the IRA. I recall the State Department and the Justice Department being opposed to that visa, and the President courageously saying we are going to give him a visa. I think most people now accept the fact that because the President overrode the qualms of his own State Department and Justice Department in giving that visa, that we moved forward on peace for the first time.  
   For people who have always looked at each other through distrust and hatred--many times because of killings on both sides, killings of Catholics by Protestants and Protestants by Catholics, apparently all in the name of the greater good--they have come far and put together a government in Northern Ireland, 
   which can start to govern itself. Men and women of good will on both sides of this issue--men and women who a few years ago would never speak to each other--have come together. 
   This was recently disturbed by articles in the press indicated that the IRA still refuses to turn over any of their weapons. Ironically enough, this is at a time when the Republic of Ireland and authorities in Northern Ireland continue to find and destroy caches of weapons belonging to the IRA. I don't know what kind of stubborn humility or holding of ancient grudges would not allow the IRA to make this move. I brook no favor for those on either side who have been involved in atrocities because whether it is from the Ulster side or from the IRA side, there are atrocities aplenty--innocent people killed because of their religion, because of their allegiance. 
   In many ways, I want to say a pox on both your houses. But that only means that generations from now the fighting will continue over things that gain nothing for anybody, feuds of hundreds of years, and memories sometimes of just a few years. It is time, in a new century, to stop the killings, to finally allow Northern Ireland, this beautiful land, to move forward and join the rest of the island in the new economic prosperity--but in peace. 
   As a group of mothers, Catholic and Protestant, told me once--together--they agreed with my speech of the night before in which I had said in Belfast--or just outside of Belfast--that I condemn violence from either side. They said how much they agreed, and what they wanted was for their children to be able to go to school and be educated, to live in peace, to walk down the street without worrying about being shot. What mother would want otherwise? 
   Frankly, those in Sinn Fein who have called on their friends here in the Congress to help them with visas, to help them move forward, best help themselves because it would be tragedy compounded on tragedy if after all these years of seeking peace, after all the work of people such as John Hume and George Mitchell, David Trimble, and Gerry Adams--people who might not want their names put in the same sentence--after all their work, what a tragedy it would be if one party, one piece of this puzzle opted out by not at least doing the first necessary steps to build confidence; that is, give over their weapons.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to call attention to a growing national crisis in the administration of capital punishment. People of good conscience can and will disagree on the morality of the death penalty. But I am confident that we should all be able to agree that a system that may sentence one innocent person to death for every seven it executes has no place in a civilized society, much less in 21st century America. But that is what the American system of capital punishment has done for the last 24 years. 
   A total of 610 people have been executed since the reinstatement of capital punishment in 1976. During the same time, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, 85 people have been found innocent and were released from death row. These are not reversals of sentences, or even convictions on technical legal grounds; these are people whose convictions have been overturned after years of confinement on death row because it was discovered they were not guilty. Even though in some instances they came within hours of being executed, it was eventually determined that, whoops, we made a mistake; we have the wrong person. 
   What does this mean? It means that for every seven executions, one person has been wrongly convicted. It means that we could have more than three innocent people sentenced to death each year. The phenomenon is not confined to just a few States; the many exonerations since 1976 span more than 20 different 
   States. And of those who are found innocent--not released because of a technicality, but actually found innocent--what is the average time they spent on death row, knowing they could be executed at any time? What is the average time they spent on death row before somebody said, we have the wrong person? Seven and a half years. 
   This would be disturbing enough if the eventual exonerations of these death row inmates were the product of reliable and consistent checks in our legal system, if we could say as Americans, all right, you may spend 7 1/2 years on death row, but at least you have the comfort of knowing that we are going to find out you are innocent before we execute you. It might be comprehensible, though not acceptable, if we as a society lacked effective and relatively inexpensive means to make capital punishment more reliable. But many of the exonerated owe their lives to fortuity and private heroism, having been denied commonsense procedural rights and inexpensive modern scientific testing opportunities--leaving open the very real possibility that there have been a number of innocent people executed over the last few decades who were not so fortunate. 
   Let me give you a case. Randall Dale Adams. Here is a man who might have been routinely executed had his case not attracted the attention of a filmmaker, Earl Morris. His movie, ``The Thin Blue Line,'' shredded the prosecution's case and cast a national spotlight on Adams' innocence. 
   Consider the case of Anthony Porter. Porter spent 16 years on death row. That is more years than most Members of the Senate have served. He spent 16 years on death row. He came within 48 hours of being executed in 1998, but he was cleared the following year. Was he cleared by the State? No. He was cleared by a class of undergraduate journalism students at Northwestern University, who took on his case as a class project. That got him out. Then the State acknowledged that it had the wrong person, that Porter had been innocent all along. He came within 48 hours of being executed, and he would have been executed had not this journalism class decided to investigate his case instead of doing something else. Now consider the cases of the unknown and the unlucky, about whom we may never hear. 
   Last year, former Florida Supreme Court Justice Gerald Kogan said he had ``no question'' that ``we certainly have, in the past, executed.......people who either didn't fit the criteria for execution in the State of Florida, or who, in fact, were, factually, not guilty of the crime for which they have been executed.'' This is not some pie-in-the-sky theory. Justice Kogan was a homicide detective and a prosecutor before eventually rising to Chief Justice. 
   This crisis has led the American Bar Association and a growing number of State legislators to call for a moratorium on executions until the death penalty can be administered with less risk to the innocent. This week, the Republican Governor of Illinois, George Ryan, announced he plans to block executions in that State until an inquiry has been conducted into why more death row inmates have been exonerated than executed since 1977 when Illinois reinstated capital punishment. Think of that. More death row inmates exonerated than executed. 
   Governor Ryan is someone who supports the death penalty. But I agree with him in bringing this halt. He said: ``There is a flaw in the system, without question, and it needs to be studied.'' The Governor is absolutely right. I rise to bring to this body the debate over how we as a nation can begin to reduce the risk of killing the innocent. 
   I hope that nobody of good faith--whether they are for or against the death penalty--will deny the existence of a serious crisis. Sentencing innocent women and men to death anywhere in our country shatters America's image in the international community. At the very least, it undermines our leadership in the struggle for human rights. But, more importantly, the individual and collective conscience of decent Americans is deeply offended and the faith in the working of our criminal justice system is severely damaged. So the question we should debate is, What should be done?  
   Some will be tempted to rely on the States. The U.S. Supreme Court often defers to ``the laboratory of the States'' to figure out how to protect criminal defendants. After 24 years, let's take a look at that lab report. 
   As I already mentioned, Illinois has now had more inmates released from death row than executed since the death penalty was reinstated. There have been 12 executions, and 13 times they have said: Whoops, sorry. Don't pull the switch. We have the wrong person. This has happened four times in the last year alone. 
   In Texas, the State that leads the Nation in executions, courts have upheld death sentences in at least three cases in which the defense lawyers slept through substantial portions of the trial. The Texas courts said that the defendants in these cases had adequate counsel. Adequate counsel? Would any one of us if we were in a taxicab say we had an adequate driver who was asleep at the wheel? What we are saying is with a person's life at stake the defense lawyer slept through the trial, and the Texas courts say that is pretty adequate. 
   Meanwhile, in the past few years, the States have followed the Federal lead in expanding their defective capital punishment systems, curtailing appeal and habeas corpus rights, and slashing funding for indigent defense services. The crisis can only get worse. 
   The States have had decades to fix their capital punishment systems, yet the best they have managed is a system fraught with arbitrariness and error--a system where innocent people are sentenced to death on a regular basis, and it is left not to the courts, not to the States, not to the Federal Government, but to filmmakers and college undergraduates to correct the mistakes. History shows that we cannot rely on local politics to implement our national conscience on such fundamental points as the execution of the innocent. 
   What about the Supreme Court? In a 1993 case, it could not even make up its mind whether the execution of an innocent person would be unconstitutional. Do a referendum on that one throughout the Nation. Ask people in this Nation of a quarter billion people whether they think executing an innocent person should be considered constitutional or unconstitutional. Most in this country have no doubt that it would be unconstitutional, but that really does not matter: executing an innocent person is abhorrent--it is morally wrong. Whether you support the death penalty or not, executing an innocent person is wrong, and we in this body have the moral duty to express and implement America's conscience. We should be the Nation's conscience. The buck should stop in this Chamber where it always stops in times of national crisis. 
   How do we begin to stem the crisis? I have been posing this question to experts across the country for nearly a year. There is a lot of consensus over what must be done. In the next few weeks, I will introduce legislation that will address some of the most urgent problems in the administration of capital punishment. 
   Two problems in particular require our immediate attention. First, we need to ensure that defendants in capital cases receive competent legal representation at every stage in their case. Second, we have to guarantee an effective forum for death row inmates who may be able to prove their innocence. 
   In our adversarial system of justice, effective assistance of counsel is essential to the fair administration of justice. It is the principal bulwark against wrongful conviction. 
   I know this from my own experience as a prosecutor. It is the best way to reduce the risk that a trial will be infected by constitutional error, resulting in reversal, retrial, cost, delay, and repeated ordeals for the victim's family. Most prosecutors will tell you they would much prefer to have good counsel on the other side because there is less apt to be mistakes, there is less apt to be reversible error, and there is far more of a chance that you end up with the right decision. 
   Most defendants who face capital charges are represented by court-appointed lawyers. Unfortunately, the manner in which defense lawyers are selected and compensated in death penalty cases frequently fails to protect the defendant's rights. Some States relegate these cases to grossly unqualified lawyers willing to settle for meager fees. While the Federal Government pays defense counsel $125 an hour for death penalty work, the hourly rate in many States is $50 or less, and some States place an arbitrary and usually unrealistically low cap on the total amount a court-appointed attorney can bill. 
   New York recently slashed pay for counsel in capital cases by as much as 50 percent. They might say they are getting their money's worth if they cut out all the money for defense counsel. The conviction rate is probably going to shoot up. Let me tell you what else will go up--the number of innocent people who will be put to death. 
   Congress has done its part to make a bad situation worse. In 1996, Congress defunded the death penalty resource centers. This has sharply increased the chances that innocent persons will be executed. 
   You get what you pay for. Those who are on death row have found their lives placed in the hands of lawyers who are drunk during the trial--in some instances, lawyers who never bothered to meet their client before the trial; lawyers who never bothered to read the State death penalty statute; lawyers who were just out of law school and never handled a criminal case; and lawyers who were literally asleep on the job. 
   Even some of our best lawyers, diligent, experienced litigators, can do little when they lack funds for investigators, experts, or scientific testing that could establish their client's innocence. Attorneys appointed to represent capital defendants often cannot recoup even their out-of-pocket expenses. They are effectively required to work at minimum wag or below while funding their client's defense out of their own pockets. 
   Although the States are required to provide criminal defendants with qualified legal counsel, those who have been saved from death row and found innocent were often convicted because of attorney error. They might not have had postconviction review because their lawyer failed to meet a filing deadline. An attorney misses a deadline by even 1 day, and his death row client may pay the price with his life. 
   Let me be clear what I am talking about. I am not suggesting that there is a universal right to Johnnie Cochran's services. The O.J. Simpson case has absolutely nothing to do with the typical capital case, in which one or possibly two underfunded and underprepared lawyers try to cobble together a defense with little or no scientific or expert evidence and the whole process takes less than a week. These are two extremes. You go from the Simpson case, where the judge let the whole thing get out of control and we had a year-long spectacle, to the typical death penalty case which 
   is rushed through without preparation in a matter of days. Somewhere there must be a middle ground. 
   Let me give three examples of some of the worst things that have happened--but not untypical. 
   Ronald Keith Williamson. In 1997, a Federal appeals court overturned Williamson's conviction on the basis of ineffectiveness of counsel. The court noted that the lawyer, who had been paid a total of $3,200 for the defense, had failed to investigate and present a fact to the jury. What was that fact? Somebody else confessed to the crime. If I were the defense attorney, I think one of the things that I would want to bring to the jury is the fact that somebody else confessed to the crime; Williamson's lawyer did not bother. Then, two years after the appeals court decision, DNA testing ruled out Williamson as the killer and implicated another man--a convicted kidnapper who had testified against Williamson at trial. Of course, he did. He is the one who committed the crime. 
   Let's next consider George McFarland. According to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, McFarland's lawyer slept through much of his 1992 trial. He objected to hardly anything the prosecution did. Here is how the Houston Chronicle described what happened as McFarland stood on trial for his life. This is not for shoplifting. He is on trial for his life. 
   Let me quote from the Houston Chronicle:  
   Seated beside his client ..... defense attorney John Benn spent much of Thursday  afternoon's trial in apparent deep sleep. His mouth kept falling open and his head lolled back on his shoulders, and then he awakened just long enough to catch himself and sit upright. Then it happened again. And again. And again. 
   Every time he opened his eyes, a different prosecution witness was on the stand describing another aspect of the Nov. 19, 1991, arrest of George McFarland in the robbery-killing of grocer Kenneth Kwan. 
   When state District Judge Doug Shaver finally called a recess, Benn was asked if he truly had fallen asleep during a capital murder trial. ``It's boring,''' the 72-year-old longtime Houston lawyer explained. ..... Court observers said Benn seems to have slept his way through virtually the entire trial. 
   Unfortunately for McFarland, Texas' highest criminal court, several of whose members were coming up for reelection, concluded that this constituted effective criminal representation. 
   I guess they felt because the lawyer was in the courtroom, even though sound asleep, that would be effective representation. If you read the decision they probably would have ruled the same way if he had been at home sound asleep, so long as he had been appointed at some time. 
   McFarland is still on death row for a murder he insists he did not commit, on the basis of evidence widely reported by independent observers to be weak. 
   Then we have Reginald Powell, a borderline mentally retarded man who was 18 at the time of the crime. Mr. Powell was eventually executed. Why? Because he accepted his lawyer's advice to reject a plea bargain that would have saved his life. 
   There were a number of attorney errors at the trial. The advice he received seems to be very bad advice. Some may feel this advice, the advice given to this 18-year-old mentally retarded man, was affected by the flagrantly unprofessional conduct of the attorney, a woman twice Powell's age, who conducted a secret jailhouse sexual relationship with him during the trial. Despite this obvious attorney conflict of interest, Powell's execution went ahead in Missouri a year ago. 
   I ask each Member of the Senate when you go home tonight, or when you talk to your constituents, and when you consider the bill I will be introducing, to remember these cases and consult your conscience to ask whether these examples represent the best of 21st century American justice. 
   The judge who presided over McFarland's trial summed up the Texas court's view of the law quite accurately when he reasoned that, while the Constitution requires a defendant to be represented by a lawyer, it ``doesn't say the lawyer has to be awake.'' If your conscience says otherwise, maybe we ought to do something. 
   My proposal rests on a simple premise: States that choose to impose capital punishment must be prepared to foot the bill. They should not be permitted to tip the scales of justice by denying capital defendants competent legal services. We have to do everything we can to ensure the States are meeting their constitutional obligations with respect to capital representation. 
   Can miscarriages of justice happen when defendants receive adequate representation? Yes, they can still happen. So I think it is critical to ensure that death row inmates have a meaningful opportunity--not a fanciful opportunity but a meaningful opportunity--to raise claims of innocence based on newly discovered evidence, especially if it is evidence that is derived from scientific tests not available at the time of the trial. 
   Perhaps more than any other development, improvements in DNA testing have exposed the fallibility of the legal system. In the last decades, scores of wrongfully convicted people have been released from prison--including many from death row--after DNA testing proved they could not have committed the crimes for which they were convicted. In some cases the same DNA testing that vindicated the innocent helped catch the guilty. 
   Most recently, DNA testing exonerated Ronald Jones. He spent close to 8 years on death row for a 1985 rape and murder that he did not commit. Illinois prosecutors dropped the charges against Jones on May 18, 1999, after DNA evidence from the crime scene excluded him as a possible suspect. 
   It was also DNA testing that eventually saved Ronald Keith Williamson's life, as I discussed earlier. He spent 12 years as an innocent man on Oklahoma's death row. 
   Can you imagine how any one of us would feel, day after day for 12 years, never knowing if we were just a few hours or a few days from execution, locked up on death row for a crime we did not commit? 
   Some of the major hurdles to postconviction DNA testing are 
   laws prohibiting introduction of new evidence--laws that have tightened as death penalty supporters have tried to speed executions by limiting appeals. Only two States, New York and Illinois, require the opportunity for inmates to require DNA testing where it could result in new evidence of innocence. Elsewhere, inmates may try to get DNA evidence for years, only to be shut out by courts and prosecutors. 
   What possible reason could there be to deny inmates the opportunity to prove their innocence--and perhaps even help identify the real culprits--through new technologies? DNA testing is relatively inexpensive. But no matter what it costs, it is a tiny price to pay to make sure you have the right person. 
   The National Commission on the Future of DNA Evidence, a Federal panel established by the Justice Department and comprised of law enforcement, judicial, and scientific experts, issued a report last year urging prosecutors to consent to postconviction DNA testing, or retesting, in appropriate cases, especially if the results could exonerate the defendant. 
   In 1994, we set up a funding program to improve the quality and availability of DNA analysis for law enforcement identification purposes. The Justice Department has handed out tens of millions of dollars to States under this program. Last year alone, we appropriated another $30 million for DNA-related grants to States. That is an appropriate use of Federal funds. But we should not pass up the promise of truth and justice for both sides of our adversarial system that DNA evidence holds out. We at least ought to require that both sides have it available. 
   By reexamining capital punishment in light of recent exonerations, we can reduce the risk that people will be executed for crimes they did not commit and increase the probability that the guilty will be brought to justice. We can also help to make sure the death penalty is not imposed out of ignorance or prejudice. 
   I learned, first as a defense attorney and then as a prosecutor, that the pursuit of justice obliges us not only to convict the guilty, but also to exonerate the wrongly accused and convicted. That obligation is all the more urgent when the death penalty is involved. 
   Let's not have the situation where, today in America, it is better to be rich and guilty than poor and innocent. That is not equal justice. That is not what our country stands for. 
   I was proud to be a defense attorney. I was very proud to be a prosecutor. I have often said it was probably the best job I ever had. But there was one thought I always had every day that I was a prosecutor. I would look at the evidence over and over again and I would ask myself, not can I get a conviction on this charge, but will I be convicting the right person. I had cases where I knew I could get a conviction, but I believed we had the wrong person, and I would not bring the charge. I think most prosecutors feel that way. But sometimes in the passion of a highly publicized, horrendous murder, we can move too fast. 
   I urge Senators on both sides of the aisle, both those who support the death penalty and those who oppose it, to join in seeking ways to reduce the risk of mistaken executions. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the senior senator from Kansas today to introduce legislation to ban all betting on college and high school sporting events, the High School and College Sports Gambling Prohibition Act. The recent report of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission recommended this ban and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) strongly supports it to protect the integrity of college sports across the nation. I look forward to working with the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to pass our bipartisan legislation this year. 
   Our bipartisan bill would close a loophole in the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992. That law prohibits most sports betting on amateur events but continued to grandfather some sports gambling activity that our bill would now prohibit in light of the recent recommendations of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission. 
   I believe our legislation is needed to ensure the integrity of college sports across the country. Sports betting puts student athletes in vulnerable positions and threatens their integrity and the integrity of college and Olympic sports. It can devastate individuals and careers. In the past decade, college sports has suffered too many gambling scandals involving student athletes. For example, four football players at Northwestern University pled guilty to perjury charges related to gambling on their own games and, one player admitted to intentionally fumbling near the goal line in a 1994 game against Iowa. Just last year, a California State University at Fullerton student was charged with point shaving after allegedly offering $1,000 to a player on the school's basketball team to shave points in a game against the University of the Pacific. Other sports gambling scandals have rocked the football programs at Boston College and the University of Maryland, and the basketball programs at Arizona State University and Bryant College, in the 1990s. 
   Legal college sports betting undermines college sports across the country and encourages gamblers to tempt college students into gambling problems and point-shaving schemes. A national ban on college and high school sports betting will send a strong message to students that sports gambling and point shaving schemes will not be tolerated in this country, and it will help prevent these ravages. 
   In addition, the National Gambling Impact Study Commission found in its June 1999 report that sports wagering has serious social costs. Indeed, the Commission reported: ``Sports wagering threatens the integrity of sports, it puts student athletes in a vulnerable position, it can serve as gateway behavior for adolescent gamblers, and it can devastate individuals and careers.'' A national ban on amateur and college sports betting may help prevent these ravages of sports wagering. 
   The Commission concluded that legal sports betting spurs illegal gambling, finding ``legal sports wagering--especially the publication in the media of Las Vegas and offshore-generated point spreads--fuels a much larger amount of illegal sports wagering.'' Many newspapers publish point spreads on college games because wagers can be legally placed on college sporting events given the loophole in current law. Point spreads do not contribute to the popularity of sport; they only contribute to the popularity of sports gambling. 
   As a result of all of these findings, the Commission recommended that ``the betting on collegiate and amateur athletic events that is currently legal be banned altogether.'' I wholeheartedly agree. Closing this loophole is one of the Commission's clearest recommendations, and it is also a step that can find a clear consensus in Congress. 
   In addition, our legislation outlaws betting on competitive games at the Summer or Winter Olympics. The Olympic tradition honors sport at its purest level. We, in turn, should honor that proud tradition by cherishing the integrity of the Olympics and prohibiting gambling schemes on the Summer or Winter Games. There have been enough stories about corruption in connection with bidding on venues for Olympic Games. We do not need a scandal having to do with gamblers seeking to influence the outcome of Olympic events. If we act soon, we have the opportunity to put this into place before the next Olympic games. 
   During my time in the Senate, I have always tried to protect the rights of Vermont state and local legislators to craft their laws free from interference from Washington. As a defender of states' rights, I carefully considered the imposition of a total Federal ban on high school and college sports. After careful thought I have come to the conclusion that this ban is appropriate. Congress has already established a national policy against high school and college sports betting with passage of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992. Our bill closes a loophole in that law. 
   I want to make it clear that gambling on professional sports is also a serious matter, worthy of national attention. Congress recognized this fact explicitly when it passed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 to arrest the growth of state sponsored sports gambling. By focusing our legislation today on amateur sports gambling, we take a first step toward resolving a fundamental problem. In hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am confident that the companion subject of gambling on professional sports will be addressed. 
   Mr. President, our bipartisan bill is supported by a broad coalition of organizations dedicated to excellence in education and athletics. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the High School and College Sports Gambling Prohibition Act and I urge its swift passage into law.

    Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, earlier this month, the Burlington Free Press chose for its 1999 Vermonter of the Year, a woman who is widely recognized as the guardian angel of the homeless in Vermont, Rita Markley. For as long as I have known her, Rita has been a passionate, articulate, and very vocal advocate for our most needy residents. She has raised awareness that even in Vermont, there are people without a roof over their heads, and most importantly, that these people have names, and faces, and that many of them are children. They could not have a better defender. I would like to have printed in the RECORD the text of the Burlington Free Press article announcing the selection of Rita as Vermonter of the Year, and offer my congratulations and sincere thanks to our very own ``Saint'' Rita Markley. I ask that the article be printed in the RECORD.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Minnesota and I can work together during the break and see if we can reach an area of agreement. 
   During the last few days of the session, the distinguished Senator from Utah and I, the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. GRASSLEY, and the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. TORRICELLI, worked very hard to whittle down the numbers. The distinguished Senator from Nevada, the Assistant Democratic Leader, was his usual indefatigable self in working, cajoling, pleading, and, when all else failed, threatening to break arms to get rid of amendments. I knew we were successful when I saw so many Members going down to see the orthopedic surgeon in the Capitol physician's office after having a meeting with the Senator from Nevada. 
   I am also pleased to see my friend from Utah, the distinguished senior Senator, ORRIN HATCH, back on the Senate floor. The Senator is not only one of the most gifted legislators in Congress but one of the best known. More important, to me, though, he is one of the closest friends I have had in my 25 years in the Senate. He is such a good friend that while he was campaigning in Iowa, I offered to go out and either speak for or against him, whichever would help the most. Trust me, Mr. President, I have plenty of material either way on that. 
   I say to Chairman ORRIN HATCH, it is good to have you back here.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the reasons I am so happy to have him back is that the Senator from Utah and I, even though we bring different political philosophies to so many issues, know that on so many issues before the Judiciary Committee we have a responsibility to try to bring both sides of the aisle together and to span a wide philosophical gap among the 100 Senators. When we work together, as we have on many issues, we find that those issues pass the Senate overwhelmingly. That is why, I might say, as we start this new action in this new millennium, how much better it is, instead of having a cloture vote, that we are letting  the Senate process work--something both he and I have seen for a couple of decades here work the way it should. 
   Last year, the Democrats entered into a unanimous consent agreement to limit our rights to offer only three nonrelevant amendments and to file relevant amendments by November 5. We entered into this agreement to work in a bipartisan manner to improve the bill. We made bipartisan progress. I don't know how many Senators realize it, but we adopted 37 amendments to the underlying bill--amendments of both Democrats and Republicans. We worked that out on a consent basis. We cleared amendments. We set up rollcall votes. In fact, from a total of 320 amendments filed by Senators on both sides of the aisle on November 5, 1999, Senator TORRICELLI and I, working with the Senator from Nevada, Mr. REID, narrowed down the remaining Democratic amendments on this bill to a handful. The remaining amendments from our list are all relevant. We are ready to debate and work on them. 
   I am proud to cosponsor Senator SCHUMER's amendment on debts incurred through the commission of violence to health service clinics. The amendment makes sense. Under our unanimous consent agreement, we will have an up-or-down vote on it. Under our unanimous consent agreement, Senator LEVIN from Michigan will also have an up-or-down vote on his amendment on firearm-related debts. He is willing to limit the time on his amendment to 2 hours. Senator SCHUMER will have 40 minutes on his amendment. These are reasonable time limits. 
   There is another important amendment by Senators SARBANES and DURBIN to clarify the credit industry reforms in the bill. 
   Millions of credit card solicitations made to consumers have caused, in part, the rise in consumer bankruptcy filings. The credit card industry should bear more of the responsibility. So the Sarbanes-Durbin amendment improves the Truth in Lending Act by requiring more disclosure of credit information so consumers may better manage debts and avoid bankruptcy altogether. 
   In the last Congress, the Senate bankruptcy reform bill was fair and balanced because it included credit industry reforms. We passed that bill by 97-1 vote in 1998. The 1998 Senate-passed bill should be a model here in the year 2000. 
   Many Democratic Senators have offered short time agreements of a half hour or less on their amendments. The Democrats are prepared to debate and vote on these amendments. That is the way the Senate works best. I commend my colleagues for working to get this agreement. I look forward to a fair and full debate. 
   Mr. President, I am actually delighted to be back. It is nice for people in Washington to provide weather that looks like we have in Vermont--with one notable exception: With this little bit of snow on the ground, our government offices in Vermont would all be open. 
   In fact, all other offices would be open. I note that because we had a couple of calls from incredulous Vermonters who couldn't believe that the Federal Government had been closed down 2 days in a row for the kind of snow we might get in a morning. I want to assure them that the office of the senior Senator from Vermont is open. I suspect the offices of the other two Members of the Vermont delegation are open. I guess the one nice thing about it is there is no traffic going in and out. There is not much snow on the road either. 
   I wish all those employees who are having 2 days of vacation because of a little bit of snow have a good time. I hope they spend time with their children, read a good book, shovel their walks, and just be glad they are not living in an area where you would still go to work with an awful lot more snow. 
   I close again by saying it is good to see my good friend, the chairman of this committee. I look forward to starting the millennium and working well with him.

We were faced with what looked to be an impossible task when it began because of the number of amendments. I note for the record that the distinguished Senator dealt with this side in good faith. We were able, as a result, I think, to put the Senate in a position now where we are within range of being able to have a final vote, and the Senate will work its will either for or against the bill. We will actually be able to do that. It is because Senators on both sides of the aisle dealt with each other in good faith and got rid of a lot of amendments that we knew would go nowhere anyway. The Senator from Iowa and I have been able to accept 39 amendments. I think that is good progress, and I extend my appreciation to him.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is today considering H.R. 3111 to exempt from automatic elimination and sunset certain reports submitted to Congress that are useful and helpful in informing the  Congress and the public about the activities of federal agencies in the enforcement of federal law. Senator HATCH and I offer as an amendment to H.R. 3111 the text of a bill, S. 1769, which I introduced with Chairman HATCH on October 22, 1999 and which passed the Senate on November 5, 1999. This amendment will continue and enhance the current reporting requirements for the Administrative Office of the Courts and the Attorney General on the eavesdropping and surveillance activities of our federal and state law enforcement agencies. 
   For many years, the Administrative Office (AO) of the Courts has complied with the statutory requirement, in 18 U.S.C. &#167;2519(3), to report to Congress annually the number and nature of federal and state applications for orders authorizing or approving the interception of wire, oral or electronic communications. By letter dated September 3, 1999, the AO advised that it would no longer submit this report because ``as of December 21, 1999, the report will no longer be required pursuant to the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995.'' I commend the AO for alerting Congress that their responsibility for the wiretap reports would lapse at the end of this year, and for doing so in time for Congress to take action. 
   The AO has done an excellent job of preparing the wiretap reports. We need to continue the AO's objective work in a consistent manner. If another agency took over this important task at this juncture and the numbers came out in a different format, it would immediately generate questions and concerns over the legitimacy and accuracy of the contents of that report. 
   In addition, it would create difficulties in comparing statistics from prior years going back to 1969 and complicate the job of congressional oversight. Furthermore, transferring this reporting duty to another agency might create delays in issuance of the report since no other agency has the methodology in place. Finally, federal, state and local agencies are well accustomed to the reporting methodology developed by the AO. Notifying all these agencies that the reporting standards and agency have changed would inevitably create more confusion and more expense as law enforcement agencies across the country are forced to learn a new system and develop a liaison with a new agency. 
   The system in place now has worked well and we should avoid any disruptions. We know how quickly law enforcement may be subjected to criticism over their use of these surreptitious surveillance tools and we should avoid aggravating these sensitivities by changing the reporting agency and methodology on little to no notice. I appreciate, however, the AO's interest in transferring the wiretap reporting requirement to another entity. Any such transfer must be accomplished with a minimum of disruption to the collection and reporting of information and 
    with complete assurances that any new entity is able to fulfill this important job as capably as the AO has done. 
   The amendment would update the reporting requirements currently in place with one additional reporting requirement. Specifically, the amendment would require the wiretap reports prepared beginning in calendar year 2000 to include information on the number of orders in which encryption was encountered and whether such encryption prevented law enforcement from obtaining the plain text of communications intercepted pursuant to such order. 
   Encryption technology is critical to protect sensitive computer and online information. Yet, the same technology poses challenges to law enforcement when it is exploited by criminals to hide evidence or the fruits of criminal activities. A report by the U.S. Working Group on Organized Crime titled, ``Encryption and Evolving Technologies: Tools of Organized Crime and Terrorism,'' released in 1997, collected anecdotal case studies on the use of encryption in furtherance of criminal activities in order to estimate the future impact of encryption on law enforcement. The report noted the need for ``an ongoing study of the affect of encryption and other information technologies on investigations, prosecutions, and intelligence operations.'' As part of this study, ``a database of case information from federal and local law enforcement and intelligence agencies should be established and maintained.'' Adding a requirement that reports be furnished on the number of occasions when encryption is encountered by law enforcement is a far more reliable basis than anecdotal evidence on which to assess law enforcement needs and make sensible policy in this area. 
   The final section of this amendment would codify the information that the Attorney General already provides on pen register and trap and trace device orders, and require further information on where such orders are issued and the types of facilities--telephone, computer, pager or other device--to which the order relates. Under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (``ECPA'') of 1986, P.L. 99-508, codified at 18 U.S.C. 3126, the Attorney General of the United States is required to report annually to the Congress on the number of pen register orders and orders for trap and trace devices applied for by law enforcement agencies of the Department of Justice. As the original sponsor of ECPA, I believed that adequate oversight of the surveillance activities of federal law enforcement could only be accomplished with reporting requirements such as the one included in this law. 
   The reports furnished by the Attorney General on an annual basis compile information from five components of the Department of Justice: the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the United States Marshals Service and the Office of the Inspector General. The report contains information on the number of original and extension orders made to the courts for authorization to use both pen register and trap and trace devices, information concerning the number of investigations involved, the offenses on which the applications were predicted and the number of people whose telephone facilities were affected. 
   These specific categories of information are useful, and the amendment would direct the Attorney General to continue providing these specific categories of information. In addition, the amendment would direct the Attorney General to include information on the identity, including the district, of the agency making the application and the person authorizing the order. In this way, the Congress and the public will be informed of those jurisdictions using this surveillance technique--information which is currently not included in the Attorney General's annual reports. 
   The requirement for preparation of the wiretap reports will soon lapse so I am delighted to see the Senate take prompt action on this legislation to continue the requirement for submission of the wiretap reports and to update the reporting requirements for both the wiretap reports submitted by the AO and the pen register and trap and trace reports submitted by the Attorney General.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is today passing an important bill, H.R. 3456, which is the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer ``Digital Theft Deterrence and Copyright Damages Improvement Act of 1999.'' This legislation should help our copyright industries, which in turn helps both those who are employed in those industries and those who enjoy the wealth of consumer products, including books, magazines, movies, and computer software, that makes the vibrant culture of this country the envy of the world. 
   This legislation has already traveled an unnecessarily bumpy road to get to this stage of final passage, and it should be sent promptly to the President's desk. 
   On July 1, 1999, the Senate passed four intellectual property bills, which Senator HATCH and I had joined in introducing and which the Judiciary Committee had unanimously reported. Each of these bills (S. 1257, the text of which is considered today as H.R. 3456; S. 1258, the ``Patent Fee Integrity and Innovation Protection Act''; S. 1259, the ``Trademark Amendments Act''; and S. 1260, the ``Copyright Act Technical Corrections Act'') make important improvements to our intellectual  property laws, and I congratulate Senator HATCH for his leadership in moving these bills promptly through the Committee and the Senate. 
   Three of those four bills then passed the House without amendment and were signed by the President on August 5, 1999. The House sent back to the Senate S. 1257, the ``Digital Theft Deterrence and Copyright Damages Improvement Act,'' with two modifications which I will describe below. Working with Senator HATCH and our colleagues in the House, we agreed upon additional revisions in the bill, which was then introduced as H.R. 3456 and passed by the House yesterday in time for Senate consideration before the end of this congressional session. 
   I have long been concerned about reducing the levels of software piracy in this country and around the world. The theft of digital copyrighted works and, in particular, of software, results in lost jobs to American workers, lost taxes to Federal and State governments, and lost revenue to American companies. A recent report released by the Business Software Alliance estimates that worldwide theft of copyrighted software in 1998 amounted to nearly $11 billion. According to the report, if this ``pirated software has instead been legally purchased, the industry would have been able to employ 32,700 more people. In 2008, if software piracy remains at its current rate, 52,700 jobs will be lost in the core software industry.'' This theft also reflects losses of $991 million in tax revenue in the United States. 
   These statistics about the harm done to our economy by the theft of copyrighted software alone, prompted me to introduce the ``Criminal Copyright Improvement Act'' in both the 104th and 105th Congresses, and to work for passage of this legislation, which was finally enacted as the ``No Electronic Theft Act of 1997,'' Pub. L. 105-147. The current rates of software piracy show 
   that we need to do better to combat this theft, both with enforcement of our current copyright laws and with strengthened copyright laws to deter potential infringes. 
   The Hatch-Leahy-Schumer ``Digital Theft Deterrence and Copyright Damages Improvement Act'' would help provide additional deterrence by amending the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. &#167;504(c), to increase the amounts of statutory damages recoverable for copyright infringements. These amounts were last increased in 1988 when the United States acceded to the Berne Convention. Specifically, the bill would increase the cap on statutory damages by 50 percent, raising the minimum from $500 to $750 and raising the maximum from $20,000 to $30,000. In addition, the bill would raise from $100,000 to $150,000 the amount of statutory damages for willful infringements. 
   Courts determining the amount of statutory damages in any given case would have discretion to impose damages within these statutory ranges at just and appropriate levels, depending on the harm caused, ill-gotten profits obtained and the gravity of the offense. The bill preserves provisions of the current law allowing the court to reduce the award of statutory damages to as little as $200 in cases of innocent infringement and requiring the court to remit damages in certain cases involving nonprofit educational institutions, libraries, archives, or public broadcasting entities. 
   Finally, the bill provides authority for the Sentencing Commission expeditiously to fulfill its responsibilities under the ``No Electronic Theft Act,'' which directed the Commission to ensure that the guidelines provide for consideration of the retail value and quantity of the items with respect to which the intellectual property offense was committed. Since the time that this law became effective, the Sentencing Commission has not had a full slate of Commissioners serving. In fact, we have had no Commissioners since October, 1998. This situation was corrected on November 10th with the confirmation of seven new Commissioners. 
   As I noted, the House amended the version of S. 1257 that the Senate passed in July in two ways. First, the original House version of this legislation, H.R. 1761, contained a new proposed enhanced penalty for infringers who engage in a repeated pattern of infringement, but without any scienter requirement. I shared the concerns raised by the Copyright Office that this provision, absent a willfulness scienter requirement, would permit imposition of the enhanced penalty even against person who negligently, albeit repeatedly, engaged in acts of infringement. Consequently, the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer bill, S. 1257, that we sent to the House in July avoided casting such a wide net, which could chill legitimate fair uses of copyrighted works. Instead, the bill we sent to the House would have created a new tier of statutory damages allowing a court to award damages in the amount of $250,000 per infringed work where the infringement is part of a willful and repeated pattern or practice of infringement. The entire ``pattern and practice'' provision, which originated in the House, was removed from the version of S. 1257 sent back to the Senate. 
   Second, the original House version of this legislation provided a direction to the Sentencing Commission to amend the guidelines to provide an enhancement based upon the retail price of 
   the legitimate items that are infringed and the quantity of the infringing items. I was concerned that this direction would require the Commission and, ultimately, sentencing judges to treat similarly a wide variety of infringement crimes, no matter the type and magnitude of harm. This was a problem we avoided in the carefully crafted Sentencing Commission directive originally passed as part of the ``No Electronic Theft Act.'' Consequently, the version of S. 1257 passed by the Senate in July did not include the directive to the Sentencing Commission. Nevertheless, the House returned S. 1257 to the Senate with the same problematic directive to the Sentencing Commission. 
   I appreciate that my House colleagues and interested stakeholders have worked over the past months to address my concerns over the breadth of the proposed directive to the Sentencing Commission, and to find a better definition of the categories of cases in which it would be appropriate to compute the applicable sentencing guideline based upon the retail value of the infringed upon item. A better solution than the one contained in the ``No Electronic Theft Act'' remains elusive, however. 
   For example, one recent proposal sought to add to S. 1257 a direction to the Sentencing Commission to enhance the guideline offense level for copyright and trademark infringements based upon the retail price of the legitimate products multiplied by the quantity of the infringing products, except where ``the infringing products are substantially inferior to the infringed upon products and there is substantial price disparity between the legitimate products and the infringing products.'' This proposed direction appears to be under-inclusive since it would not allow a guideline enhancement in cases where fake goods are passed off as the real item to unsuspecting consumers, even though this is clearly a situation in which the Commission may decide to provide an enhancement. 
   In view of the fact that the full Sentencing Commission has not had an opportunity for the past two years to consider and implement the original direction in the ``No Electronic Theft Act,'' passing a new and flawed directive appears to be both unnecessary and unwise. This is particularly the case since the new Commissioners have already indicated a willingness to consider this issue promptly. In response to questions posed at their confirmation hearings, each of the nominated Sentencing Commissioners indicated that they would make this issue a priority. For example, Judge William Sessions of the District of Vermont specifically noted that:  
   If confirmed, our first task must be to address Congress' longstanding directives, including implementation of the guidelines pursuant to the NET Act. Congress directed the Sentencing Commission to fashion guidelines under the NET Act that are sufficiently severe to deter such criminal activity. I personally favor addressing penalties under this statute expeditiously.  
   I fully concur in the judgment of Chairman HATCH that the Sentencing Commission directive provision added by the House should be stricken. The House addressed these concerns by doing just that in the new version of the bill, H.R. 3456, which was introduced and passed by the House yesterday in time for Senate consideration before the end of this session. 
   This bill represents an improvement in current copyright law, and I commend its final passage.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have long been an advocate for legislation that ensures that existing laws keep pace with developing technology. It is for this reason that I have sponsored and supported over the past few years a host of bills to bring us into the 21st Century. 
   This same impetus underlies my support of legislation to ensure our nation's gambling laws keep pace with developing technology, particularly the Internet. The Department of Justice has noted that ``the Internet has allowed for new types of electronic gambling, including interactive games such as poker or blackjack, that may not clearly be included within the types of gambling currently made illegal. . . .'' This new technology clearly has the potential to diminish the effectiveness of current gambling statutes. 
   Vermonters have spoken clearly that they do not want certain types of gambling permitted in our state, and they do not want current laws to be rendered obsolete by the Internet. Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell strongly supports federal legislation to address Internet gambling, as do other law enforcement officials in Vermont. 
   I believe, therefore, that there is considerable value in updating our federal gambling statutes, which is why I voted for S. 692, the ``Internet Gambling Prohibition Act,'' during Senate Judiciary Committee consideration. I support the bill as a step forward in our bipartisan efforts to make sure our federal laws continue to keep pace with emerging technologies. 
   I do, however, have concerns that S. 692 might unnecessarily weaken existing federal and state gambling laws. 
   My first concern is that the bill provides unnecessary exemptions from its Internet gambling ban for certain forms of gambling activities without a clear public policy justification. For example, the bill exempts parimutuel wagering on horse and dog racing from its ban on Internet gambling. The sponsors of S. 692 have offered no compelling reason for this special treatment of one form of gambling. Indeed, the Department of Justice is ``especially troubled by the broad exemptions given to parimutuel wagering, which essentially would make legal on the Internet types of parimutuel wagering that are not legal in the physical world,'' according to its June 9, 1999 views letter on S. 692. 
   Broad exemptions from the Internet gambling ban also contradict the recent recommendations to Congress of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission. After 2 years of taking testimony at hearings across the country, the Commission has endorsed the need for Federal legislation to prohibit Internet gambling. But the Commission clearly rejected adding new exemptions to the law in such a ban. 
   Indeed, in a letter to me dated June 15, 1999, Kay C. James, Chair, and William Bible, Commissioner, of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, wrote:  
   The Commission recommends to the President, Congress, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) that the Federal government should prohibit, without allowing new exemptions or the expansion of existing federal exemptions to other jurisdictions, Internet gambling not already authorized within the United States or among parties in the United States and any foreign jurisdiction. (emphasis in the original)  
   My second concern is that the bill unnecessarily creates a new section in our Federal gambling statutes, which may prove inconsistent with existing law and established legal precedent. Instead of updating section 1084 of title 18, which has prohibited interstate gambling through wire communications since 1961, S. 692 creates a new section 1085 to title 18 to cover Internet gambling only. Creating a new section out of whole cloth with different definitions and other provisions from existing Federal gambling statutes creates overlapping and inconsistent Federal gambling laws for no good reason. 
   According to its views letter on S. 692, the Department of Justice believes overlapping and inconsistent Federal gambling laws can be easily avoided by amending section 1084 of title 18 to cover Internet gambling:  
   We therefore strongly recommend that Congress address the objective of this legislation through amending existing gambling laws, rather than creating new laws that specifically govern the Internet. Indeed, the Department of Justice believes that an amendment to section 1084 of title 18 could satisfy many of the concerns addressed in S. 692, as well as ensure that the same laws apply to gambling businesses, whether they operate over the Internet, the telephone, or some other instrumentality of interstate commerce.  
   I want to thank the sponsors of the legislation, Senators KYL and BRYAN, for addressing my third concern in their substitute amendment. I was concerned that the bill might 
   unnecessarily create immunity from criminal prosecution under State law for Internet gambling. Any new immunity would have been in sharp contrast to existing Federal law, which specifically does not grant immunity from State prosecution for illegal gambling over wire communications. 
   To address this concern, the substitute amendment adds a new Rules of Construction section, section 2 (g)(1), which I authored. This section makes it clear that, except for the liability limits provided to Interactive Computer Service Providers in section 2 (d) of the bill, S. 692 does not provide any other immunity from Federal or State prosecution for illegal Internet gambling. 
   Indeed, the New York Attorney General recently prosecuted an offshore Internet gambling company, World Interactive Gaming Corporation, for targeting New York citizens in violation of State and Federal anti-gambling statutes. This past July, the New York State Supreme Court upheld that prosecution. 
   As a former State prosecutor in Vermont, I strongly believe that Congress should not tie the hands of our State crime-fighting partners in the battle against Internet gambling when we do not mandate Federal preemption of state criminal laws for other forms of illegal gambling. Instead, we need to foster effective Federal-State partnerships to combat illegal Internet gambling. 
   During our consideration of the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act in this Congress and the last, the sponsors of the bill and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have improved and refined the bill on a bipartisan basis. The bill now applies only to gambling businesses, instead of individual betters. This will permit Federal authorities to target the prosecution of interstate gambling businesses, while rightly leaving the prosecution of individual bettors to the discretion of state authorities acting under state law. 
   As Senators continue to work together to enact a ban on Internet gambling, we should keep these words from the Department of Justice foremost in our minds: ``[A]ny prohibitions that are designed to prohibit criminal activity on the Internet must be carefully drafted to accomplish the legislation's objectives without stifling the growth of the Internet or chilling its use as a communication medium.'' 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and the administration to enact into law carefully drafted legislation to update our Federal gambling statutes to ensure that new types of gambling activities made possible by emerging technologies are prohibited.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is today considering for final passage S. 1769, as amended by the House. I introduced S. 1769 with Chairman HATCH on October 22, 1999 and it passed the Senate on November 5, 1999. This bill will continue and enhance the current reporting requirements for the Administrative Office of the Courts and the Attorney General on the eavesdropping and surveillance activities of our federal and state law enforcement agencies. The House amendment is the text of H.R. 3111, a bill to exempt from automatic elimination and sunset certain reports submitted to Congress that are useful and helpful in informing the Congress and the public about the activities of federal agencies in the enforcement of federal law. I am also glad to support this amendment. 
   For many years, the Administrative Office (AO) of the Courts has complied with the statutory requirement, in 18 U.S.C. &#167;2519(3), to report to Congress annually the number and nature of federal and state applications for orders authorizing or approving the interception of wire, oral or electronic communications. By letter dated September 3, 1999, the AO advised that it would no longer submit this report because ``as of December 21, 1999, the report will no longer be required pursuant to the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995.'' I commend the AO for alerting Congress that their responsibility for the wiretap reports would lapse at the end of this year, and for doing so in time for Congress to take action. 
   The AO has done an excellent job of preparing the wiretap reports. We need to continue the AO's objective work in a consistent manner. If another agency took over this important task at this juncture and the numbers came out in a different format, it would immediately generate questions and concerns over the legitimacy and accuracy of the contents of that report. 
   In addition, it would create difficulties in comparing statistics from prior years going back to 1969 and complicate the job of congressional oversight. Furthermore, transferring this reporting duty to another agency might create delays in issuance of the report since no other agency has the methodology in place. Finally, federal, state and local agencies are well accustomed to the reporting methodology developed by the AO. Notifying all these agencies that the reporting standards and agency have changed would inevitably create more confusion and more expense as law enforcement agencies across the country are forced to learn a new system and develop a liaison with a new agency. 
   The system in place now has worked well and we should avoid any disruptions. We know how quickly law enforcement may be subjected to criticism over their use of these surreptitious surveillance tools and we should avoid aggravating these sensitivities by changing the reporting agency and methodology on little to no notice. I appreciate, however, the AO's interest in transferring the wiretap reporting requirement to another entity. Any such transfer must be accomplished with a minimum of disruption to the collection and reporting of information and with complete assurances that any new entity is able to fulfill this important job as capably as the AO has done.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today is passing the Abraham-Leahy substitute amendment to S.761, the Millennium Digital Commerce Act. This bill seeks to permit and encourage the continued expansion of electronic commerce, and to promote public confidence in its integrity and reliability. These are worthy goals--goals that I have long sought to advance. In the last Congress, many of us worked together to pass the Government Paperwork Elimination Act, which established a framework for the federal government's use of electronic forms and electronic signatures. Today's legislation is part of our continuing efforts to ease the burdens of conducting business electronically. 
   This is an important bill on an issue of paramount concern to American businesses that engage in electronic commerce. It has had a long journey since it was reported by the Commerce Committee in June. As reported, the bill took a sweeping approach, preempting untold numbers of federal, state and local laws that require contracts, records and signatures to be in traditional written form. I was concerned that such a sweeping approach would radically undermine legislation that is currently in place to protect consumers. 
   For example, the Committee-passed bill would have enabled businesses to use their superior bargaining power to compel or confuse consumers into waiving their rights to insist on paper disclosures and communications, even when they do not have the technological capacity to receive, retain, and print electronic records. Could a borrower be compelled to receive delinquency or foreclosure notices by electronic mail, even if she did not have a computer, or her computer could not read the notices in the electronic format in which they were sent? Would she be entitled to revert to paper communications if her computer broke or became obsolete? Could a company require customers to check its Web site for important safety information regarding its products, or for recall notices? 
   Under S.761 as reported, the company would not have been required to provide any information on paper, even if a state consumer protection law so required. Crucial information about the consumer's rights and obligations would not be received. It was federal preemption beyond need, to the detriment of American consumers. 
   The problem did not stop there. When information is provided electronically, for it to be useful at a later time to prove its contents, the electronic file must be tamperproof. Otherwise, a consumer could inadvertently change a single byte on the file and thus make it technically different from the original, and useless to prove its contents. The consumer would be left without any means of proving critical terms of the contract, including the terms of the warranty. 
   I have been working with Senator ABRAHAM and others since August to address these and other concerns I had with the bill. We crafted a bipartisan compromise several weeks ago, but it fell apart after certain industry representatives complained that it did not go far enough to relieve them of federal and state regulatory authority. Fortunately, other industry representatives recognized that this was not the primary or even an intended purpose of this legislation, and worked to get the legislative process back on track. I am pleased that we were able to do this and that we were able to reach agreement, for the second time, on an Abraham-Leahy substitute that encourages the continued expansion of electronic commerce, while leaving in place essential safeguards protecting the nation's consumers. 
   In a letter dated November 5, 1999, the National Conference of State Legislatures identified what it believed were four essential criteria for any federal legislation related to electronic signatures:

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is today passing an important bill, S. 1257, the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer ``Digital Theft Deterrence and Copyright Damages Improvement Act of 1999.'' This legislation should help our copyright industries, which in turn helps both those who are employed in those industries and those who enjoy the wealth of consumer products, including books, magazines, movies, and computer software, that makes the vibrant culture of this country the envy of the world. This legislation has already traveled an unnecessarily bumpy road to get to this stage, and it is my hope that it will be sent promptly to the President's desk. 
   On July 1, 1999, the Senate passed four intellectual property bills which Senator HATCH and I had joined in introducing and which the Judiciary Committee had unanimously reported. Each of these bills (S. 1257, which we consider today; S. 1258, the Patent Fee Integrity and Innovation Protection Act; S. 1259, the Trademark Amendments Act; and S. 1260, the Copyright Act Technical Corrections Act) make important improvements to our intellectual property laws, and I congratulate Senator HATCH for his leadership in moving these bills promptly through the Committee. 
   Three of those four bills then passed the House without amendment and were signed by the President on August 5, 1999. The House sent back to the Senate S. 1257, the Digital Theft Deterrence and Copyright Damages Improvement Act, with two modifications which I will describe below. 
   I have long been concerned about reducing the levels of software piracy in this country and around the world. The theft of digital copyrighted works and, in particular, of software, results in lost jobs to American workers, lost taxes to Federal and State governments, and lost revenue to American companies. A recent report released by the Business Software Alliance estimates that worldwide theft of copyrighted software in 1998 amounted to nearly $11 billion. According to the report, if this ``pirated software has instead been legally purchased, the industry would have been able to employ 32,700 more people. In 2008, if software piracy remains at its current rate, 52,700 jobs will be lost in the core software industry.'' This theft also reflects losses of $991 million in tax revenue in the United States. 
   These statistics about the harm done to our economy by the theft of copyrighted software alone, prompted me to introduce the ``Criminal Copyright Improvement Act'' in both the 104th and 105th Congresses, and to work for passage of this legislation, which was finally enacted as the ``No Electronic Theft Act of 1997,'' Pub. L. 105-147. The current rates of software piracy show that we need to do better to combat this theft, both with enforcement of our current copyright laws and with strengthened copyright laws to deter potential infringes. 
   The Hatch-Leahy-Schumer ``Digital Theft Deterrence and Copyright Damages Improvement Act'' would help provide additional deterrence by amending the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. &#167;504(c), to increase the amounts of statutory damages recoverable for copyright infringements. These amounts were last increased in 1988 when the United States acceded to the Berne Convention. Specifically, the bill would increase the cap on statutory damages by 50 percent, raising the minimum from $500 to $750 and raising the maximum from $20,000 to $30,000. In addition, the bill would raise from $100,000 to $150,000 the amount of statutory damages for willful infringements. 
   Courts determining the amount of statutory damages in any given case would have discretion to impose damages within these statutory ranges at just and appropriate levels, depending on the harm caused, ill-gotten profits obtained and the gravity of the offense. The bill preserves provisions of the current law allowing the court to reduce the award of statutory damages to as little as $200 in cases of innocent infringement and requiring the court to remit damages in certain cases involving nonprofit educational institutions, libraries, archives, or public broadcasting entities. 
   Finally, the bill provides authority for the Sentencing Commission expeditiously to fulfill its responsibilities under the No Electronic Theft Act, which directed the Commission to ensure that the guidelines provide for consideration of the retail value and quantity of the items with respect to which the intellectual property offense was committed. Since the time that this law became effective, the Sentencing Commission has not had a full slate of Commissioners serving. In fact, we have had no Commissioners since October, 1998. This situation was corrected last week with the confirmation of seven new Commissioners. 
   As I noted, the House amended the version of S. 1257 that the Senate passed in July in two ways. First, the original House version of this legislation, H.R. 1761, contained a new proposed enhanced penalty for infringers who engage in a repeated pattern of infringement, but without any scienter requirement. I shared the concerns raised by the Copyright Office that this provision, absent a willfulness scienter requirement, would permit imposition of the enhanced penalty even against person who negligently, albeit repeatedly, engaged in acts of infringement. Consequently, the Hatch-Leahy-Schumer bill, S. 1257, that we sent to the House in July avoided casting such a wide net, which could chill legitimate fair uses of copyrighted works. Instead, the bill we sent to the House would have created a new tier of statutory  damages allowing a court to award damages in the amount of $250,000 per infringed work where the infringement is part of a willful and repeated pattern or practice of infringement. The entire ``pattern and practice'' provision, which originated in the House, has been removed from the version of S. 1257 sent back to the Senate. 
   Second, the original House version of this legislation provided a direction to the Sentencing Commission to amend the guidelines to provide an enhancement based upon the retail price of the legitimate items that are infringed and the quantity of the infringing items. I was concerned that this direction would require the Commission and, ultimately, sentencing judges to treat similarly a wide variety of infringement crimes, no matter the type and magnitude of harm. This was a problem we avoided in the carefully crafted Sentencing Commission directive originally passed as part of the No Electronic Theft Act. Consequently, the version of S. 1257 passed by the Senate in July did not include the directive to the Sentencing Commission. The House then returned S. 1257 with the same problematic directive to the Sentencing Commission. 
   I appreciate that my House colleagues and interested stakeholders have worked over the past months to address my concerns over the breadth of the proposed directive to the Sentencing Commission, and to find a better definition of the categories of cases in which it would be appropriate to compute the applicable sentencing guideline based upon the retail value of the infringed upon item. A better solution than the one contained in the No Electronic Theft Act remains elusive, however. 
   For example, one recent proposal seeks to add to S. 1257 a direction to the Sentencing Commission to enhance the guideline offense level for copyright and trademark infringements based upon the retail price of the legitimate products multiplied by the quantity of the infringing products, except where ``the infringing products are substantially inferior to the infringed upon products and there is substantial price disparity between the legitimate products and the infringing products.'' This proposed direction appears to be under-inclusive since it would not allow a guideline enhancement in cases where fake goods are passed off as the real item to unsuspecting consumers, even though this is clearly a situation in which the Commission may decide to provide an enhancement. 
   In view of the fact that the full Sentencing Commission has not had an opportunity for the past two years to consider and implement the original direction in the No Electronic Theft Act, passing a new and flawed directive appears to be both unnecessary and unwise. This is particularly the case since the new Commissioners have already indicated a willingness to consider this issue promptly. In response to questions posed at their confirmation hearings, each of the nominated Sentencing Commissioners indicated that they would make this issue a priority. For example, Judge William Sessions of the District of Vermont specifically noted that:  
   If confirmed, our first task must be to address Congress' longstanding directives, including implementation of the guidelines pursuant to the NET Act. Congress directed the Sentencing Commission to fashion guidelines under the NET Act that are sufficiently severe to deter such criminal activity. I personally favor addressing penalties under this statute expeditiously.  
   I fully concur in the judgment of Chairman HATCH that the Sentencing Commission directive provision added by the House and to send, again, S. 1257 to the House for action. 
   This bill represents an improvement in current copyright law, and I hope that it will soon be sent to the President for enactment.

   Mr. LEAHY. The manufacture and distribution of methamphetamines and amphetamines is an increasingly serious problem, and this bill would provide significant additional resources for both law enforcement and treatment. It was unfortunate that the majority has played politics with this important issue and strained the strong bipartisan support for this bill by including its provisions in a larger, controversial amendment to S. 625, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999, which amendment was approved by a vote of 50-49 on November 10, 1999. I strongly opposed that amendment, which significantly increased the use of mandatory minimum penalties for powder cocaine offenses and unwisely diminished local control of schools. 
   That amendment to the bankruptcy bill mandated a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence for crimes involving 500 grams or more of powder cocaine, instead of the current 5 kilogram threshold. It also instituted a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence for crimes involving 50 grams or more of powder cocaine, instead of the current 500-gram threshold. I oppose mandatory minimums both because they are extraordinarily costly for taxpayers and because they are counterproductive to our law enforcement efforts. The Justice Department estimated that the amendment's powder cocaine provision would cost more than $10 billion over the next 30 years simply to build 11,000 more prison beds. Moreover, the use of mandatory minimums for smaller and smaller quantities of drugs gives federal prosecutors further incentive to prosecute lower-level drug offenders, further distorting the balance between state and federal law enforcement responsibilities. It simply makes no sense--except perhaps as a matter of politics--to federal our Nation's drug laws to such an extreme extent. 
   In addition, that amendment provided the wrongheaded approach to the necessary task of rectifying the disparity between sentences for powder and crack cocaine. Under current law, the quantity threshold to trigger mandatory minimum penalties for crack offenders is 100 times more severe than for powder cocaine offenders. Under this amendment the quantity threshold to trigger mandatory minimums for crack offenders would still be 10 times more severe, and the amendment would do nothing to mitigate the unnecessary federalization and extreme penalties that the criminal justice system imposes for lower-level crack offenses. 
   Finally, that amendment contained education provisions that would take funding and control away from local school authorities. First, it dictates that local school boards adopt certain  specific policies on illegal drug use by students, including mandatory reporting of students to law enforcement and mandatory expulsion for at least one year of students who possess illegal drugs on school property. Second, it authorizes the use of public funds to pay tuition for any private schools, including parochial schools, for students who were injured by violent criminal offenses on public school grounds. This provision raises serious constitutional and policy questions, and should not have been slipped into an end-of-session amendment to a bankruptcy bill. 
   Because of the extreme reservations that I and many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle expressed about that amendment to the bankruptcy bill, I pressed for the original methamphetamine bill to be considered as a separate matter. I am pleased that we have an opportunity to consider and pass this legislation without the poison pills that the Republican leadership inserted. 
   I continue to have some reservations about this bill. For example, I disapprove of its order to the Sentencing Commission to increase penalties for certain amphetamine and methamphetamine crimes by a specific number of base offense levels. I oppose such specific directives for some of the same reasons that I oppose mandatory minimums--they subvert the considered sentencing process that Congress wanted when it established the Sentencing Commission. 
   But the good in this bill outweighs the bad. In addition to creating tougher penalties for those who manufacture and distribute amphetamines as illicit drugs, this bill allocates additional funding to assist local law enforcement, allows for the hiring of new DEA agents, and increases research, training and prevention efforts. This is a good and comprehensive approach to America's growing amphetamine problem. 
   We significantly improved this bill during committee considerations. As the comprehensive substitute for the original bill was being drafted, I had three primary reservations: First, earlier versions of the bill imposed numerous mandatory minimums. As I stated earlier, I continue to believe that mandatory minimums are generally an inappropriate tool in our critically important national fight against drugs. Simply imposing or increasing mandatory minimums subverts the more considered process Congress set up in the Sentencing Commission. The Federal Sentencing Guidelines already provide a comprehensive mechanism to equalize sentences among persons convicted of the same or similar crime, while allowing judges the discretion they need to give appropriate weight to individual circumstances. 
   The Sentencing Commission goes through an extraordinary process to set sentence levels. For example, pursuant to our 1996 antimethamphetamine law, the Sentencing Commission increased meth penalties after careful analysis of recent sentencing data, a study of the offenses, and information from the DEA on trafficking levels, dosage unit size, price and drug quantity. Increasing mandatory minimums takes sentencing discretion away from judges. We closely examine judges' backgrounds before they are confirmed and should let them do their jobs. 
   Mandatory minimums also impose significant economic and social costs. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the annual cost of housing a federal inmate ranges from $16,745 per year for minimum security inmates to $23,286 per year for inmates in high security facilities. It is critical that we take steps that will effectively deter crime, but we should not ignore the costs of the one size fits all approach of mandatory minimums. We also cannot ignore the policy implications of the boom in our prison population. In 1970, the total population in the federal prison system was 20,686 prisoners, of whom 16.3 percent were drug offenders. By 1997, the federal prison population had grown to almost 91,000 sentenced prisoners, approximately 60 percent of whom were sentenced for drug offenses. The cost of supporting this expanded federal criminal justice system is staggering. We ignore at our peril the findings of RAND's comprehensive 1997 report on mandatory minimum drug sentences: ``Mandatory minimums are not justifiable on the basis of cost-effectiveness at reducing cocaine consumption, cocaine expenditures, or drug-related crime.'' 
   This is why I have repeatedly expressed my concerns about creating new mandatory minimum penalties, including as recently as last October, when another antimethamphetamine bill was before the Judiciary Committee. 
   Second, earlier drafts of this bill would have contravened the Supreme Court's 1999 decision in Richardson versus U.S. I, along with some other members of the Committee, believed that it would be inappropriate to take such a step without first holding a hearing and giving thorough consideration to such a change in the law. The Chairman of the Committee, Senator HATCH, was sensitive to this concern and I thank him for agreeing to remove that provision from this legislation. 
   Third, an earlier version of the bill contained a provision that would have created a rebuttable presumption that may have violated the Constitution's Due Process Clause. Again, I believed that we needed to seriously consider and debate such a provision before voting on it. And again, the Chairman was sensitive to the concerns of some of us on the Committee and agreed to remove that provision. 
   By reaching an accord on each of those issues, I was able to join as a cosponsor of this bill. I support it strongly, and I look forward to seeing it become law.

We held a hearing on that report. I recently received a letter from the Register of Copyrights reaffirming this interpretation. Indeed, in that letter, dated November 10, 1999, the Register stated that ``the compulsory license for secondary transmissions of television broadcast signals by cable systems does not apply to digital online communication services,'' and specifically that ``the section 111 license does not and should not apply to Internet transmissions.''

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Judiciary Committee is about to achieve an end-of-the-session high technology sweep that comes on the heels of landmark Internet and intellectual property reforms that our committee achieved in the 105th Congress. 
   Others are observing that this is the most productive and forward-looking two years of achievement in updating intellectual property laws of this or any previous era. I believe they are right. 
   We may never have another such set of opportunities where we are able to provide so many benefits to consumers, innovators and to the high technology innovators in the business community in such a short span of time. 
   In one fell swoop we are providing consumers with local-into-local television, protecting patent terms, spurring innovation and enhancing electronic commerce and protecting trademarks. 
   One of the challenges we face at this early stage of the Information Age is to bring the order of intellectual property law to the Wild West of the Internet and to other burgeoning information technologies. That challenge is at the heart of these three bills. 
   I want to make just a couple points about each of them. The patent bill is long overdue. It will put American innovations on a more equal footing with European and Japanese inventors. It also helps protect inventors against invention promotion scams and against needless PTO delay in approving patents. 
   The anti-cybersquatting bill protects merchants who want to be able to control where their names and brands are being displayed and protect them from abuse. More than 200 years ago Ben Franklin said that a person's honor and good name is like fine china--easily broken but impossible to mend. This is still the case today and the bill protects the rights of trademark holders against malicious abuse. It arms on-line merchants and consumers with new tools to derail these ``squatters'' who try to create bad waves for honest cybersurfers. 
   And then there is the satellite bill, which is a charter for a new era of television service competition that will benefit consumers in several tangible ways. It sets the stage for the first real head-to-head competition between cable and satellite TV that will be a brand new experience for hundreds of communities. 
   It will contribute a new unifying influence and greater sense of community in states like Vermont, where citizens in most of the state for the first time will have access to all Vermont stations. It will avert further waves of programming cutoffs to satellite TV customers, including what would have been the largest cutoff of all, in December. 
   The satellite bill will, over time, mean that some families will be able to  get local network television for the first time ever. I believe that making local television signals available throughout much of a state will be a unifying force and enhance public participation in state and community issues. It will remove the artificial isolation caused by mountain ridges or distance from broadcast towers. It will also prevent these infuriating and seemingly mindless cutoffs and promote direct head-to-head 
   competition with cable. 
   We have had some major bumps in the road in getting here with these three bills. 
   I want to mention the rural satellite TV provisions. I know that we had preliminary discussions about this six months ago and that Department of Agriculture attorneys and program experts met with our staffs to go over the details months ago. 
   I proposed that USDA handle this loan guarantee program because they have 50 years of experience with financing rural telephone and rural electric cooperatives. Vast areas of this nation were able to get electric and telephone service solely because of these programs. 
   It is hard to believe in this day and age, but thousands of Americans still remember when these USDA loan programs gave them electricity for the first time. 
   I am disappointed that the final bill does not include this provision that we worked on--but I am pleased that the Senate leaders have worked out an arrangement with us so that this matter will be resolved early next year. 
   Without this loan guarantee program I am convinced that rural areas--75 percent of the U.S. landmass--might not receive local-into-local satellite TV until 10 or 20 years after urban areas do. 
   Another major hurdle concerned a request by AOL and YAHOO for changes to the bill. This concerned whether or not they should receive a compulsory license to show regular TV programming over the Internet. Chairman HATCH and I resolved this by agreeing to have hearings on this important matter of convergence of technology and the protection of copyrighted material--converging TV, data, telephone, messages and other transmissions through broadband technologies while protecting ownership rights to copyrighted material. 
   A third bump in the road was over the GAO study Senator HATCH and I proposed of current practices regarding the patent protection for business methods resulting from the State Street case. In the end, we took out that language but agreed that we would ask the GAO to look into this for us. This issue will test the limits of what is proper subject matter to be patented and what is not. I can easily see Senator HATCH and I having more than one hearing on this issue. 
   So here we are in the death throes of this session of Congress. It is satisfying to know that some of the farthest-reaching achievements of this session are the products of the work of the Judiciary Committee, and of my partnership with Chairman HATCH. 
   I am delighted that as Conferees on the satellite bill that we have been able to put this complex and important legislation, which originated with the Hatch-Leahy Satellite Home Viewers Improvements Act in the Senate, into final form. 
   We worked closely with a number of Senators and members of the other body on this important legislation. Any time that you work with four Committees in a Conference there are a lot of members and staff who do very creative and important work late into the night, night after night after night. 
   I want to single out just a few staff even though I know I am leaving out many who deserve equal praise. Shawn Bentley with Chairman HATCH displayed enormous poise and breath of knowledge regarding satellite TV issues. He balanced, as did his Chairman, a variety of complex issues very carefully and very well. 
   Troy Dow similarly was extremely helpful regarding patent and cybersquatting issues and deserves a great deal of credit. 
   I want to also thank Ed Barron of my staff regarding the satellite TV and patent bills and Beryl Howell on cybersquatting. They both worked very diligently on these and other issues and did a great job. 
   Subcommittee Chairman DEWINE and ranking Member KOHL were also Conferees, along with Senator THURMOND, and played a major role regarding satellite TV issues. 
   This bill will provide viewers with more choices and will greatly increase competition in the delivery of television programming, while ensuring minimal interference with the free market copyright system that serves our country so well. 
   For years I have raised concerns about the lack of competition with cable TV and escalating cable rates. This bill will allow satellite TV providers to compete directly with cable in offering local stations and will give consumers a wider range of choice. It also protects local TV affiliates while postponing certain cutoffs of satellite TV service. 
   Most promisingly, the bill will permit local TV signals, as opposed to distant out-of-state network signals, to be offered to viewers via satellite. Vermont is a state in which satellite dishes play a very important role, and I know that Vermont viewers eagerly await the day when their local stations will be available by satellite. 
   It is absurd for home dish owners--whether they live in Vermont, Utah, or California--to have to watch network stations imported from distant states instead of local stations. They should have a choice. I expect the satellite industry to do everything in its power to extend local-to-local coverage beyond the biggest cities and into important smaller markets such as those in Vermont, and the satellite industry should not expect further Congressional largesse if it fails to do so. 
   One satellite company called Capitol Broadcasting has already committed to serve Vermont once its spot beam technology satellites have been launched and other technological requirements have been put in place. I am counting on that happening over the next two or three years. 
   I was very pleased to have met with the moving force behind Capitol Broadcasting--Jim Goodmon. This company was formed by his grandfather, A. J. Fletcher, in 1937. Under Jim Goodmon's management, Capitol Broadcasting has expanded into satellite communications, the Internet and high definition television. In April, Jim received the Digital Television Pioneer Award from Broadcasting and Cable magazine. One of their stations, CBC, was the first broadcaster to transmit a high definition television digital signal. I look forward to helping inaugurate their local-into-local service into Vermont. 
   I expect that others will compete in Vermont. I understand 
   the EchoStar, under its CEO, Charlie Ergen, and DirecTV, are also looking at providing service to Vermont. 
   Providing local TV stations to Vermont dish owners will lead to head-to-head competition between cable and satellite TV providers which should lead to more services for Vermonters at lower prices. Also, the bill will allow households who want to subscribe to this new satellite TV service to receive all local Vermont TV stations over the satellite. 
   The goal is to offer Vermonters with more choices, more TV selections, but at lower rates. In areas of the country were there is this full competition with cable providers, rates to customers are considerably lower. 
   Over time this initiative will permit satellite TV providers to offer a full selection of all local TV channels to viewers throughout most of Vermont, as well as the typical complement of superstations, weather and sports channels, PBS, movies and a variety of other channels. 
   This means that local Vermont TV stations will be available over satellite to many areas of Vermont currently unserved by satellite or by cable. 
   I have gotten lots of letters from Vermonters who complained about the current situation where local TV stations challenged their right to receive that signal. 
   Under current law, it is illegal for satellite TV providers to offer local TV channels over a satellite dish when you live in an area where you are likely to get a clear TV signal with a regular rooftop antenna at least half of the time. 
   This means that thousands of Vermonters living in or near Burlington cannot receive local signals over their satellite dishes.  
   Under current law, those families must get their local TV signals over an antenna which often does not provide a clear picture. This bill will remove that legal limitation and allow satellite carriers to offer local TV signals to viewers no matter where they live in Vermont. 
   Presently, Vermonters receive satellite signals with programming from stations in other states--in other words they would get a CBS station from another state but not WCAX, the Burlington CBS affiliate. 
   By allowing satellite providers to offer a larger variety of programming, including local stations, the satellite industry would be able to compete with cable, and the cable industry will be competing with satellite carriers. Cable will continue to be a very effective competitor with its ability to offer extremely high-speed Internet connections to homes and businesses. 
   As mentioned earlier, the second major improvement in this initiative is that satellite carriers that offer local Vermont channels in their mix of programming will be able to reach Vermonters throughout Vermont. The system will be based on regions called Designated Market Areas, or DMAs. Vermont has one large DMA covering most of the state and part of the Adirondacks in New York--the Burlington-Plattsburg DMA--and parts of two smaller ones in Bennington County (the Albany-Schenectady-Troy DMA) and in Windham county (the Boston DMA). 
   This new satellite system is not available yet, and may not be available in Vermont until two to three years from now. Companies such as Capitol Broadcasting are preparing to launch spot-beam satellites to take advantage of this bill. Using current technology, signals would be provided by spot-beam satellites using regional uplink sites throughout the nation to beam local signals up to one or two satellites. Those satellites could use 60 spot beams to send those local signals, received from the regional uplinks, back to satellite dish owners. High definition TV would be offered under this system at a later date. 
   Under this bill, Vermonters will have more choices. I want to point out that those who want to keep their current satellite service can do just that. 
   In addition, we have protected the C-Band dish owners who have invested a lot of money in this now out-dated, but still used, technology. I did not think it was fair to pull the plug on them. 
   Those who want to stick with cable, or with regular broadcast TV, are welcome to continue to participate that way. 
   Since technology advances so quickly, other systems could be developed before this bill is fully implemented that would provide similar service but using a different technology. 
   The bill will also extend the distant signal compulsory license in Section 119. In almost all respects, the distant signal license will apply in the same way in the future as it applies today. The most important exception is that the bill will allow continued delivery of distant network stations to thousands of Vermonters and residents of other states who would otherwise have distant network satellite service terminated at the end of the year (or who have had such service terminated by court order since July 1998). 
   The purpose of this temporary ``grandfathering'' is not to reward satellite carriers that have broken the law. Rather, the purpose of the grandfathering is to assist certain subscribers in Vermont and elsewhere who might have been misled by satellite companies into believing that they were eligible to receive distant network programming by satellite. The purpose is also to aid in achieving a smooth transition to local-into-local programming which avoids many of these issues. 
   The subscribers who will be grandfathered are those who are not predicted to receive a signal of Grade A intensity from any station affiliated with the relevant network, along with certain additional C-band subscribers. 
   I want to make clear that I do not condone lawbreaking by satellite companies or anyone else, and nothing that Congress is doing today should be read in that light. Satellite companies remain liable for every other remedy provided by the Copyright Act or other law for any infringements they have committed. Satellite carriers should not be heard to argue for any grandfathering beyond what Congress has expressly approved, or to contend that they should be relieved of any other available remedy because of Congress' actions. 
   The second change to Section 119 is that there will no longer be a 90-day waiting period for cable subscribers that is currently part of the definition of ``unserved household.'' This change will 
   help to make the satellite industry more competitive with cable, an objective I know every member of this body shares. Third, the bill will limit to two the number of distant signals that a satellite carrier may deliver to unserved households. 
   Except with respect to these specific changes in Section 119, nothing in the law we are passing today will take away any of the rights and remedies available to the parties to copyright infringement litigation against satellite carriers. Nor does anything in this bill suggest any criticism of the courts for enforcing the Copyright Act. It is their job to apply the law to the facts. 
   It is crucial to our system that all players in the marketplace, including satellite carriers, be required to obey the law and held accountable in the courts for the consequences of their own lawbreaking. Indeed, if a particular satellite carrier has engaged in a willful or repeated pattern or practice of infringements, it should be held to the statutory consequences of that misconduct. 
   The addition of the word ``stationary'' to the phrase ``conventional outdoor rooftop receiving antenna'' in Section 119(d)(10) of the Copyright Act merits a word of discussion. As the Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over copyright matters, and one of the original sponsors of this legislation, I want to emphasize that use of this word should not be misunderstood. 
   The new language says only that the antenna is to be ``stationary''; it does not say that the antenna is to be improperly oriented, that is pointed in way that does not obtain the strongest signal. The word ``stationary'' means, for example, that testing should be done using a stationary antenna, as the FCC has directed. 
   Satellite companies must not be encouraged to urge consumers to point antennas in the wrong direction to qualify for different treatment. 
   As to antenna orientation, the relevant guidance is provided in Section 119(a)(2)(B)(ii)(II) of the bill, which specifies that the FCC's procedures (requiring correct orientation) be followed. Since satellite dishes must be properly oriented to receive a picture at all, it would make no sense to specify misorientation of over-the-air antennas. 
   Permitting misorientation would also be inconsistent with the entire structure of the definition of ``unserved household,'' which looks to whether a household is capable of receiving a signal of Grade B intensity from a particular type of affiliate, that is an ABC station or a Fox station, not whether it is capable of receiving all of the stations in the market. 
   As I mentioned before, the Copyright Act amendments direct courts to continue to use the accurate, consumer-friendly prediction and measurement tools developed by the FCC for determining whether particular households are served or unserved. If the Commission is able to refine its so-called ``ILLR'' predictive model to make it even more accurate--as I hope it will--the courts should apply those further refinements as well. 
   In fact, the Copyright Act amendments in the bill specifically address the possibility that the FCC may be able to modify its ILLR model to make it even more accurate. Specifically, the Act provides in new Section 119(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I) of the Copyright Act that if the FCC should later modify the ILLR model to make it still more accurate, courts should, under Section 119(a)(2)(B)(ii)(I), use the even more accurate version in the future for predictive purposes. 
   Whether a proposed modification to the ILLR model makes it more accurate is an empirical question that the Commission should address by comparing the predictions made by any proposed model against actual measurements of signal intensity. The Commission's analysis should reflect our  policy objective: to determine whether a household is--or is not--capable of receiving a signal of Grade B intensity from at least one station affiliated with the relevant network. 
   The FCC has properly recognized that reducing one type of errors, underprediction, while increasing another type of errors, overprediction, does not increase accuracy, but simply puts a thumb on the scale in favor of one side or the other. The issue under Section 119(a)(2)(B)(ii) is the overall accuracy of the model, as tested against available measurement data, with regard to whether a household is, or is not, capable of receiving a Grade B intensity signal from at least one affiliate of the network in question. 
   The conferees and many other members of this body have worked hard to achieve the carefully balanced bill now before the Senate. I urge my colleagues to give it their full support. Most of all, I thank and congratulate my distinguished colleague and good 
   friend, Chairman HATCH, for his outstanding work over many months on this important bill, which will provide lasting benefits for my constituents in Vermont and for citizens in every other state. 
   I'm also pleased that the Conference Report directs the Federal Communications Commission to take expedited action on getting new technologies deployed that can deliver local television signals to viewers in smaller television markets. We've known all along, if we pass legislation authorizing local-into-local, the DBS carriers would readily deliver local channels to those subscribers who are fortunate enough to live in the largest markets. There are 210 local television Designated Market Areas in our country, and most Vermonters live in the 91st-ranked DMA. That is why it is so important for the FCC to expedite review of alternative technologies, such as the digital terrestrial wireless system developed by Northpoint Technology, which are capable of delivering local signals into all markets on a must carry basis. 
   I want to briefly mention the patent bill. 
   This patent bill is important to America's future. I have heard from inventors, from businesses large and small, from hi-tech to low-tech firms--this bill will give American inventors and businesses an improved competitive edge now enjoyed by many European countries. 
   We should be on a level playing field with them. 
   This bill reduces patent fees for only the second time in history. The first time that was done was in a Hatch-Leahy bill passed by the Senate in the 105th Congress. 
   All the concepts in this bill--such as patent term guarantees, domestic publication of patent applications filed abroad, first inventor defense--have been thoroughly examined. Indeed, they have been included in several bills that the Congress has carefully studied. 
   I wish to point out that the Senate Judiciary Committee last year also developed a strong bill--S. 507--which contained many of the same concepts and approaches found in H.R. 1907 and S. 1798. 
   American business needs this patent bill, American 
   technology companies need this patent bill, American inventors and innovators need this patent bill. 
   The Administration says that we must have the reforms in this bill. It will: reduce legal fees that are paid by inventors and companies; eliminate duplication of research efforts and accelerate research into new areas; increase the value of patents to inventors and companies; and facilitate U.S. inventors and companies' research, development, and commercialization of inventions. 
   In Vermont, we have a number of independent inventors and small companies. It is, therefore, especially important to me that this bill be one that helps them as well as the larger companies in Vermont like IBM. 
   Over the past several years, Congress has held eight Congressional hearings with over 80 witnesses testifying about the various proposals incorporated in the bill. Republican and Democratic Administrations alike, reaching back to the Johnson Administration, have supported these similar reforms. 
   I also want to thank Secretary Daley and the Administration for their unflagging support of effective patent reform. 
   The ``American Inventors Protection Act'' was designed to make targeted improvements to the patent code in order to enable the American patent system to meet the challenges of new technology and new markets as we approach the next millennium. 
   The bill builds upon compromises forged in the Senate Judiciary Committee in the 105th Congress, as well as additional compromises in the House of Representatives in the 106th Congress, to achieve these goals while protecting and promoting the interest of American inventors at home and abroad. 
   I also want to discuss the comments of Senators SCHUMER and TORRICELLI regarding the patent bill and the State Street decision. I look forward to working with both of those Senators on the issues they raise. I expect that the Committee will have hearings on this matter next year. Also, the Conference Report on the bill contains a detailed analysis of these important issues which was accepted by all Conferees. 
   The FY 2000 Omnibus Appropriations bill also includes provisions that Senator HATCH and I and others have crafted to address cybersquatting on domain names. We have worked hard to craft this legislation in a balanced fashion to protect trademark owners and consumers doing business online, and Internet users who want to participate in what the Supreme Court has described as ``a unique and wholly new medium of worldwide human communication.'' Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844. 
   Trademarks are important tools of commerce. The exclusive right to the use of a unique mark helps companies compete in the marketplace by distinguishing their goods and services from those of their competitors, and helps consumers identify the source of a product by linking it with a particular company. The use of trademarks by companies, and reliance on trademarks by consumers, will only become more important as the global marketplace grows larger and more accessible with electronic commerce. The reason is simple: when a trademarked name is used as a company's address in cyberspace, customers know where to go online to conduct business with that company. 
   The growth of electronic commerce is having a positive effect on the economies of small rural states like mine. A Vermont Internet Commerce report I commissioned earlier this year found that Vermont gained more than 1,000 new jobs as a result of Internet commerce, with the potential that Vermont could add more than 24,000 jobs over the next two years. For a small state like ours, this is very good news. 
   Along with the good news, this report identified a number of obstacles that stand in the way of Vermont reaching the full potential promised by Internet commerce. One obstacle is that ``merchants are anxious about not being able to control where their names and brands are being displayed.'' Another is the need to bolster consumers' confidence in online shopping. 
   Cybersquatters hurt electronic commerce. Both merchant and consumer confidence in conducting business online are undermined by so-called ``cybersquatters'' or ``cyberpirates,'' who abuse the 
   rights of trademark holders by purposely and maliciously registering as a domain name the trademarked name of another company to divert and confuse customers or to deny the company the ability to establish an easy-to-find online location. A recent report by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on the Internet domain name process has characterized cybersquatting as ``predatory and parasitical practices by a minority of domain registrants acting in bad faith'' to register famous or well-known marks of others--which can lead to consumer confusion or downright fraud. 
   Enforcing trademarks in cyberspace will promote global electronic commerce. Enforcing trademark law in cyberspace can help bring consumer confidence to this new frontier. That is why I have long been concerned with protecting registered trademarks online. Indeed, when the Congress passed the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, I noted that:  
   Although no one else has yet considered this application, it is my hope that this  antidilution statute can help stem the use of deceptive Internet addresses taken by those who are choosing marks that are associated with the products and reputations of others.  
   The Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995 has been used as I predicted to help stop misleading uses of trademarks as domain names. One court has described this exercise by saying that ``attempting to apply established trademark law in the fast-developing world of the Internet is somewhat like trying to board a moving bus.....'' Bensusan Restaurant Corp. v. King, 126 F.3d 25. Nevertheless, the courts appear to be handling ``cybersquatting'' cases well. As University of Miami Law Professor Michael Froomkin noted in testimony submitted at the Judiciary Committee's hearing on this issue on July 22, 1999, ``in every case involving a person who registered large numbers of domains for resale, the cybersquatter has lost.'' 
   For example, courts have had little trouble dealing with a notorious cybersquatter, Dennis Toeppen from Illinois, who registered more than 100 trademarks--including  
   ``yankeestadium.com,'' ``deltaairlines.com,''  
   and ``neiman-marcus.com''--as domain names for the purpose of eventually selling the names back to the companies owning the trademarks. The various courts reviewing his activities have unanimously determined that he violated the Federal Trademark Dilution Act. 
   Similarly, Wayne State University Law Professor Jessica Litman noted in testimony submitted at the Judiciary Committee's hearing that those businesses that ``have registered domain names that are confusingly similar to trademarks or personal names in order to use them for pornographic web sites *.*.* have without exception lost suits brought against them.'' 
   Even as we consider this legislation, we must acknowledge that enforcing or even modifying our trademark laws will be only part of the solution to cybersquatting. Up to now, people have been able to register any number of domain names in the popular ``.com'' domain with no money down and no money due for 60 days. Network Solutions Inc., the dominant Internet registrar, recently announced that it was changing this policy, and requiring payment of the registration fee up front. In doing so, NSI admitted that it was making this change to curb cybersquatting. 
   In addition, we need to encourage the development of alternative dispute resolution procedures that can provide a forum for global users of the Internet to resolve domain name disputes. For this reason, I authored an amendment that was enacted last year as part of the Next Generation Internet Research Act authorizing the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to study the effects on trademark holders of adding new top-level domain names and requesting recommendations on inexpensive and expeditious procedures for resolving trademark disputes over the assignment of domain names. Both the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers and WIPO are also making recommendations on these procedures. Adoption of a uniform trademark domain name dispute resolution policy should be of enormous benefit to American trademark owners. 
   We should encourage the sensible development of case law in this area, the ongoing efforts within WIPO 
   and ICANN to build a consensus global mechanism for resolving online trademark disputes, and the implementation of domain name registration practices designed to discourage cybersquatting. The legislation we pass today as part of the Omnibus Appropriations bill for the upcoming fiscal year is intended to build upon this progress and provide constructive guidance to trademark holders, domain name registrars and registries and Internet users registering domain names alike. 
   This legislation has been significantly improved since it was first introduced. As originally introduced by Senator ABRAHAM and others, S. 1255, the ``Trademark Cyberpiracy Prevention Act'', proposed to make it illegal to register or use any ``Internet domain name or identifier of an online location'' that could be confused with the trademark of another person or cause dilution of a ``famous trademark.'' Violations were punishable by both civil and criminal penalties. 
   I voiced concerns at a hearing before the Judiciary Committee that, in its original form, S. 1255 would have a number of unintended consequences that would have hurt rather than promoted electronic commerce, including the following specific problems: 
   The definition was overbroad. As introduced, S. 1255 covered the use or registration of any ``identifier,'' which could cover not just second level domain names, but also e-mail addresses, screen names used in chat rooms, and even files accessible and readable on the Internet. As one witness pointed out, ``the definitions will make every fan a criminal.'' How? A file document about Batman, for example, that uses the trademark ``Batman'' in its name, which also identifies its online location, could land the writer in court under that bill. Cybersquatting is not about file names. 
   The original bill threatened hypertext linking. The Web operates on hypertext linking, to facilitate jumping from one site to another. The original bill could have disrupted this practice by imposing liability on operators of sites with links to other sites with trademark names in the address. One could imagine a trademark owner not wanting to be associated with 
   or linked with certain sites, and threatening suit under this proposal unless the link were eliminated or payments were made for allowing the linking. 
   The original bill would have criminalized dissent and protest sites. A number of Web sites collect complaints about trademarked products or services, and use the trademarked names to identify themselves. For example, there are protest sites named ``boycott-cbs.com'' and ``www.PepsiBloodbath.com.'' While the speech contained on those sites is clearly constitutionally protected, as originally introduced, S. 1255 would have criminalized the use of the trademarked name to reach the site and made them difficult to search for and find online. 
   The original bill would have stifled legitimate warehousing of domain names. The bill, as introduced, would have changed current law and made liable persons who merely register domain names similar to other trademarked names, whether or not they actually set up a site and used the name. The courts have recognized that companies may have legitimate reasons for registering domain names without using them and have declined to find trademark violations for mere registration of a trademarked name. For example, a company planning to acquire another company might register a domain name containing the target company's name in anticipation of the deal. The original bill would have made that company liable for trademark infringement. 
   For these and other reasons, Professor Litman concluded that, ``as introduced, S. 1255 would in many ways be bad for electronic commerce, by making it hazardous to do business on the Internet without first retaining trademark counsel.'' Faced with the risk of criminal penalties, she stated that ``many start-up businesses may choose to abandon their goodwill and move to another Internet location, or even to fold, rather than risk liability.'' 
   Domain name cybersquatting is a real problem. For example, whitehouse.com has probably gotten more traffic from people trying to find copies of the President's speeches than those interested in adult 
   material. 
   While the problem is clear, narrowly defining the solution is trickier. The mere presence of a trademark is not enough. Legitimate conflicts may arise between companies offering different services or products under the same trademarked name, such as Juno Lighting Inc. and Juno online services over the juno.com domain name, or between companies and individuals who register a name or nickname as a domain name, such as the young boy nicknamed ``Pokey'' whose domain name ``pokey.org'' was challenged by the toy manufacturer who owns the rights to the Gumby and Pokey toys. A site may also use a trademarked name to protest a group, company or issue, such as pepsibloodbath.com, or even to defend one's reputation, such as www.civil-action.com, which belongs not to a motion picture studio, but to W.R. Grace to rebut the unflattering portrait of the company as a polluter  and child poisoner created by the movie. 
   There is a world of difference between these sorts of sites and those which use deceptive naming practices to draw attention to their site for example, whitehouse.com, or those who use domain names to misrepresent the goods or services they offer, for instance, dellmemory.com, which may be confused with the Dell computer company. 
   We must also recognize certain technological realities. For example, merely mentioning a trademark is not a problem. Posting a speech that mentions AOL on my web page and calling the page aol.html, confuses no one between my page and America Online's site. Likewise, we must recognize that while the Web is a key part of the Internet, it is not the only part. We simply do not want to pass legislation that may impose liability on Internet users with e-mail addresses, which may contain a trademarked name. Nor do we want to crack down on newsgroups that use trademarks descriptively, such as alt.comics.batman. 
   In short, it is important that we distinguish between the legitimate and illegitimate use of domain names, and the cybersquatting legislation that we 
   pass today does just that. 
   Due to the significant flaws in S. 1255, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported and the Senate passed a complete substitute to that bill. On July 29, 1999, Senator HATCH and I, along with several other Senators, introduced S. 1461, the ``Domain Name Piracy Prevention Act of 1999.'' This bill then provided the text of the Hatch-Leahy substitute amendment that the Senate Judiciary Committee reported unanimously to S. 1255 the same day. This substitute amendment, with three additional refinements contained in a Hatch-Leahy clarifying amendment, was passed by the Senate on August 5, 1999. 
   This Hatch-Leahy substitute provided a better solution than the original, S. 1255, in addressing the cybersquatting problem without jeopardizing other important online rights and interests. 
   Following Senate passage of the bill, the House passed a version of the legislation, H.R. 3208, the ``Trademark Cyberprivacy Prevention Act'', which has been modified for inclusion in the FY 2000 Omnibus Appropriations bill. 
   This legislation, now called the ``Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act'', would amend section 43 of the Trademark Act by adding a new section to make liable for actual or statutory damages any domain name registrant, who with bad-faith intent to profit from the goodwill of another's trademark, without regard to the goods or services of the parties, registers, traffics in or uses a domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to a distinctive trademark or dilutive of a famous trademark. The fact that the domain name registrant did not compete with the trademark owner would not be a bar to recovery. This legislation also makes clear that personal names that are protected as marks would also be covered by new section 1125. 
   Furthermore, this legislation should not in any way frustrate the global efforts already underway to develop inexpensive and expeditious procedures for resolving domain name disputes that avoid costly and 
   time-consuming litigation in the court systems either here or abroad. In fact, the legislation expressly provides liability limitations for domain name registrars, registries or other domain name registration authorities when they take actions pursuant to a reasonable policy prohibiting the registration of domain names that are identical or confusingly similar to another's trademark or dilutive of a famous trademark. The ICANN and WIPO consideration of these issues will inform the development by domain name registrars and registries of such reasonable policies. 
   Uses of infringing domain names that support liability under the legislation are expressly limited to uses by the domain name registrant or the registrant's authorized licensee. This limitation makes clear that ``uses'' of domain names by persons other than the domain name registrant for purposes such as hypertext linking, directory publishing, or for search engines, are not covered by the prohibition. 
   Other significant sections of this legislation are discussed below: 
   Domain names are narrowly defined to mean alphanumeric designations registered with or assigned by domain name registrars or registries, or other domain name registration authority as part of an electronic address on the Internet. Since registrars only register second level domain names, this definition effectively excludes file names, screen names, and e-mail addresses and, under current registration practice, applies only to second level domain names. 
   The terms ``domain name registrar, domain name registry, or other domain name authority that registered or assigned the domain name'' in Section 3002(a) of the Act, amending 15 U.S.C. 1125(d)(2)(a), is intended to refer only to those entities that actually place the name in a registry, or that operate the registry, and would not extend to other entities, such as the ICANN or any of its constituent units, that have some oversight or contractual relationship with such registrars and registries. 
   Only these entities that actually offer the challenged name, placed it in a registry, or operate the relevant registry are intended to be covered by those terms. 
   Liability for registering a trademark name as a domain name requires ``bad faith intent to profit from that mark''. The following non-exclusive list of nine factors are enumerated for courts to consider in determining whether such bad faith intent to profit is proven:

   Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, just so we know the numbers, we had 320 amendments and are now down to 14. I compliment Senators on both sides of the aisle. Senator REID deserves enormous credit. Senator GRASSLEY, Senator TORRICELLI, Senator HATCH, and I worked very hard on that. We are working very hard again on both sides of the aisle. I think most Senators want a bankruptcy bill. We know there has to be a change. 
   Mr. President, I am disappointed that the majority filed cloture on the Bankruptcy Reform Act. 
   This week we made bipartisan progress on the Bankruptcy Reform Act by disposing of amendments. On Wednesday, we were able to clear 9 more amendments and accepted another one by a roll call vote for a total of 10 amendments that were accepted to improve this bill. 
   During our debate on the bill, the managers have accepted 37 amendments to improve the Bankruptcy Reform Act, amendments offered by Democrats and Republicans. 
   Senator TORRICELLI, Senator REID and I worked in good faith with Senator GRASSLEY and Senator HATCH to clear amendments and set roll call votes on amendments that we could not clear. 
   From a total of 320 amendments that were filed by senators on both sides of the aisle on November 5th, Senator TORRICELLI and I, working with the Assistant Democratic Leader, have narrowed down the remaining Democratic amendments on this bill to a mere handful. 
   We are ready to debate and vote on these Democratic amendments. The remaining amendments from our list are all relevant to the issues of bankruptcy under our unanimous consent agreement. 
   It appears the majority is refusing to allow the Senate to consider two amendments. One by Senator LEVIN on firearm-related debts in bankruptcy and one by Senator SCHUMER on debts incurred through the commission of violence at health service clinics. 
   Both of these amendments are relevant to the issue of bankruptcy. 
   Senator LEVIN is willing to limit the time on his amendment to 70 minutes and Senator SCHUMER is willing to limit the time on his amendment to only 30 minutes. These are very reasonable time agreement offers. 
   I am a cosponsor of Senator SCHUMER's amendment, but I am not sure if I will support Senator LEVIN's amendment. But I am sure that both these Senators deserve to debate and vote on their relevant amendments. What is the majority afraid of? Vote on the amendments up or down? 
   Some of the other remaining amendments focus on adding credit industry reforms to the bill. The millions of credit card solicitations made to American consumers the past few years have caused, in part, the rise in consumer bankruptcy filings. The credit card industry should bear some of this responsibility and reform its lax lending practices. These amendments improve the Truth In Lending Act to provide for better disclosure of credit information so consumers may better manage their debts and avoid bankruptcy altogether. 
   Last year's Senate bankruptcy reform bill was fair and balanced because it included credit industry reforms. We should remember that last year's fair and balanced bill passed this chamber by a vote of 97-1. 
   We should strive to follow last year's Senate-passed bill as the model during the remainder of debate on this bill. 
   Democrats are also ready to offer short time agreements on our remaining amendments if we cannot agree with the majority on them. Many Democratic senators are willing to offer time agreements of a half hour or an hour on their amendments. 
   Democrats are prepared to debate this bill and vote on amendments. This is how the Senate works and how it should work. 
   I commend Senators for coming to the floor last week and this week to offer their amendments. Despite hours of debate on four non-germane, nonrelevant amendments and party caucuses and extended morning business hours last week and this week, Senators from both sides of the aisle offered 64 amendments to improve the Bankruptcy Reform Act. 
   Unfortunately, the Senate did not consider the Bankruptcy Reform Act yesterday or today. I do not understand why the majority is refusing to allow the Senate to debate this bill. 
   Next year, I hope we can have a full and fair debate on the few remaining  amendments to the Bankruptcy Reform Act and then proceed to a vote on final passage. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. I did not want to speak until that was done. I thank the distinguished majority leader and the distinguished Democratic leader. Both of them are dear friends of mine with whom I have served for many, many years. 
   I thank them for their consideration, especially of Calendar No. 292. That is not simply a number on the calendar. It represents a very real person. Richard Linn is an extraordinary man, extraordinary husband, extraordinary father, and wonderful bother. He will do a great job and be an outstanding judge. I thank both leaders for their help and their consideration.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the Senate concludes this first session of the 106th Congress, I want to take a moment to thank Senator LOTT, the majority leader, and Senator HATCH, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for working with us to confirm some of the judges desperately needed around the country. 
   Senator HATCH has pressed forward with three confirmation hearings since October 5, in the last five weeks of this session to bring the total number of hearings to seven for the year. Those hearings allowed for 12 additional judicial nominees to be reported to the Senate calendar and another two being ready for action by the committee. Senator HATCH supported all but one of the nominees voted upon by the Senate this year and worked hard to clear judicial nominees reported by the committee for action by the Senate. 
   I thank the majority leader for working with me and Senator DASCHLE, our Democratic leader, to find a way to consider each of the judicial nominations reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee. In early October he committed to working with us and last week he announced that he would press forward for votes on the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon by March 15 and on the other nominations left pending on the Senate Executive Calendar, as well. With his assurance, Senator BOXER was willing to proceed immediately to consider a nomination important to the Senator from Mississippi. I want to commend Senator BOXER and Senator FEINSTEIN for their efforts on behalf of both Judge Paez and Ms. Berzon. With their support these nominees are each now headed toward final confirmation votes. 
   For the year, the senate confirmed 33 federal judges to the District Courts and Courts of Appeals around the country and to the Court of International Trade. The Senate has voted to fill only 33 of the 90 vacancies that have existed throughout the year, however, and there remain 36 judicial nominees still pending before the Senate. Most regrettably, the Senate rejected the nomination of Justice Ronnie White on an unprecedented part-line vote. Senator HATCH is fond of saying that the Senate could do better. I agree with him and hope that we will continue to do much better next year. 
   I began this year challenging the Senate to maintain that pace it established last year when the Senate confirmed 66 judges. I urged the Senate to move away from ``the destructive politics of [1996 and 1997] in which the Republican Senate confirmed only 17 and 36 judges.'' We did not achieve much movement in the first 10 months of this year. It is my hope that developments over the last week signal that the Senate is finally moving toward recognition of our constitutional duty regarding judicial nominations and that we will consider them more promptly and fairly in the coming months. 
   I note that during the last two years of the Bush Administration, a Democratic Senate confirmed 106 federal judges. To reach that total this Congress, the Senate next year will need to confirm 73 additional judges. That will take commitment and work, but we can achieve it. In 1994, with a Democratic majority in the Senate, we confirmed 101 judges, and in 1992, the last year of the Bush Administration, a Democratic Senate confirmed 64 federal judges. 
   Meanwhile we end this year with more judicial vacancies than existed when we adjourned at the end of last year. We have again lost ground in our efforts to fill longstanding judicial vacancies that are plaguing the federal courts. In 1983 vacancies numbered only 16. Even after the creation of 85 new judgeships in 1984, the number of vacancies had been reduced to only 33 by the end of the 99th Congress in 1986. At the end of the 100th Congress in 1988, which had a Democratic majority and a Republican President, judicial vacancies numbered only 23. In 1999 the Republican Senate adjourns leaving 57 current vacancies with 10 on the horizon. 
   Moreover, the Republican Congress has refused to consider the authorization of the additional judges needed by the federal judiciary to deal with their ever-increasing workload. In 1984 and in 1990, Congress did respond to requests for needed judicial resources by the Judicial Conference. Indeed, in 1990, a Democratic majority in the Congress created judgeships during a Republican presidential administration. Two years ago the Judicial Conference of the United States requested that an additional 53 judgeships be authorized around the country. This year the Judicial Conference renewed its request but increased it to 72 judgeships needing to be authorized around the country. If Congress had passed the Federal Judgeship Act of 1999, S. 1145, as it should have, the federal judiciary would have 130 vacancies today. That is the more accurate measure of the needs of the federal judiciary that have been ignored by the Congress over the past several years. 
   More and more of the vacancies are judicial emergencies that have been left vacant for longer periods of time. The President has sent the Senate qualified nominees for 15 of the current judicial emergency vacancies, which nominations remain pending as the Senate adjourns for the year. 
   Most troubling is the circuit emergency that had to be declared three months ago by the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. That is a situation that we should have confronted by expediting consideration of the nominations of Alston Johnson and Enrique Moreno this year. I hope that the Senate will consider them both promptly in the early part of next year. In the meantime, I regret that the Senate is adjourning and leaving the Fifth Circuit to deal with the crisis in the federal administration of justice in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi as best it can but without the resources that it desperately needs.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has approved the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act, which Senator DEWINE and I recently introduced in the Senate. Our bipartisan legislation builds on the successful passage into law of the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998, which Senator DEWINE and I sponsored in the last Congress. Our bill also complements S. 249, the Missing, Exploited and Runaway Children Protection Act, which Senator HATCH and I worked together to steer to final passage just last month. 
   Unfortunately, the number of abused or neglected children in this country nearly doubled between 1986 and 1993. Each day there are 9,000 reports of child abuse in America and more than three million cases annually of abused or neglected children. In my home state of Vermont, 2,309 children were reported to child protective services for child abuse or neglect investigations in 1997, the last year data is available. After investigation, 1,041 of these reports found substantiated cases of child maltreatment in Vermont. 
   Each child behind these statistics is an American tragedy. 
   But we can help. The Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act provides these abused or neglected children with the Federal assistance that they deserve. And our legislation can make a real difference in the lives of our nation's children without any additional cost to taxpayers. 
   Our bipartisan legislation will make a difference by giving State and local officials the flexibility to use existing Department of Justice grant programs to prevent child abuse and neglect, investigate child abuse and neglect crimes and protect children who have suffered from abuse and neglect. The bill does this by making three changes to current law. 
   First, the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act amends the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998 to make grant dollars available specifically to enhance the capability of criminal history information to agencies and workers for child welfare, child abuse and adoption purposes. Congress has authorized $250 million annually for grants under the Crime Identification Technology Act. 
   Second, the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act amends the Byrne Grant Program to permit funds to be used for enforcing child abuse and neglect laws, including laws protecting against child sexual abuse, and promoting programs designed to prevent child abuse and neglect. Congress has traditionally funded the Byrne Grant Program at about $500 million a year. 
   Third, the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act doubles the available funds, from $10 million to $20 million, for grants to each State for child abuse treatment and prevention from the Crime Victims Fund. This fund is financed through the collection of criminal fines, penalties and other assessments against persons convicted of crimes against the United States. In the 1998 fiscal year, the Crime Victims Fund held $363 million. To ensure that other crime victim programs support by the Fund are not reduced, the expansion of the child abuse treatment and prevention earmark applies only when the Fund exceeds $363 million in a fiscal year. This year, the Crime Victims Fund is expected to collect more than $1 billion due in part to large anti-trust penalties. 
   Despite the tireless efforts of concerned Vermonters, including the many dedicated workers and volunteers at Prevent Child Abuse in Vermont and the Vermont Department of Social and Rehabilitative Services, Vermont is below the national average for its ability to provide services to abused or neglected children. In 1997, 411 children found to be abused or neglected received no services, about 40 percent of investigated cases. Nationally, about 25 percent of all abused or neglected children received no services. Our legislation provides more resources to help Vermonters and other Americans provide services to all abused or neglected children. 
   I want to thank the many advocates who support our bill and the companion legislation introduced by Representatives PRYCE and TUBBS JONES, H.R. 764, which passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 425-2 on October 5, 1999. These advocates include the diverse National Child Abuse Coalition: ACTION for Child Protection; Alliance for Children and Families; American Academy of Pediatrics; American Bar Association; American Dental Association; American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children; American Prosecutors Research Institute; American Psychological Association; Association of Junior Leagues International; Boy Scouts of America; Child Welfare League of America; Childhelp USA; Children's Defense Fund; General Federation of Women's Club; National Alliance of Children's Trust and Prevention Funds; National Association of Child Advocates; National Association of Counsel for Children; National Association of Social Workers; National Children's Alliance; National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse; National Council of Jewish Women; National Court Appointed Special Advocates Association; National Education Association; National Exchange Club Foundation for Prevention of Child Abuse; National Network for Youth; National PTA; Parents Anonymous; and Parents United. In addition, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and Prevent Child Abuse America have endorsed our bill and its House counterpart. 
   I look forward to the House of Representatives passing the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act for the sake of our nation's children.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I read an editorial this morning in the Wall Street Journal that made incorrect  statements about both the distinguished majority leader, Senator LOTT, and the Northeast Dairy Compact. In fact, the editorial was totally, factually wrong. If the editorial writers would have checked their facts, they would have known that. 
   Basically, the writers used arguments of opponents of the Northeast Dairy Compact, and they used those arguments without any determination of whether they are accurate or not. This time they used the arguments to go after the distinguished majority leader and others who supported the compact. They have used the so-called facts other times, but, again, they have always used them in the same wrong arguments. 
   I have referred many times to the major GAO study that was issued on milk prices. I have referred to the detailed OMB study on the compact. Opponents never offer any proof for their arguments. I am fed up with the Compact being criticized as a back room deal because I remind everybody that we actually had a vote on it, albeit in the form of a cloture motion, but we had a vote on it on the floor of the Senate and a majority of Senators, Republicans and Democrats alike, voted for it. The majority voted for it this year. Now those who oppose it are using filibusters and parliamentary dodges because they know that they lost the vote. 
   I am fed up with opponents attacking the compact as a special interest cartel, a compact which is made up of family farms, considering the largest opponent of the compact is Philip Morris, the tobacco giant which owns Kraft. The supporters are family farmers; the opponent, Philip Morris. It does not sound as if the supporters are really a cartel. 
   I am fed up when opponents of the compact say milk prices are higher in New England when typically milk prices are higher in Wisconsin and Minnesota than they are in New England. The places that do not have the compact and who are attacking it the most charge their consumers more for milk on average than the area that does have the compact. 
   GAO did a study of this and they looked at milk prices during the first six months after the Compact was implemented. GAO found that consumers in New England were able to buy milk considerably cheaper than in Wisconsin or Minnesota. The editorial writers and opponents of the compact do not point this out. Why do they not point this out? Because it points to the success of the compact and does not support the arguments made by the cartels that are opposed to it. 
   Let me read some examples from the GAO report. For example: In February, 1998 the average price of a gallon of whole milk in Augusta, ME, was $2.47. The price in Milwaukee, WI, was $2.63, and in Minneapolis, MN., it was $2.94 per gallon. 
   Take another New England city, Boston. In February 1998, the price of a gallon of milk was $2.54 as compared to Minneapolis, where the price, on average, was $2.94 a gallon. 
   Or let's look at the cost of 1 percent milk for November 1997. In Augusta, ME, it was $2.37 per gallon, the same average price for Boston and New Hampshire and Rhode Island. But in Minnesota, the price was $2.82 a gallon, in other words, 45 cents more per gallon in the area that opposes the compact as compared to the much lower price in the area that has the compact. 
   I could go on and on and compare low New England retail prices with higher prices in cities outside of New England. I invite anybody to review this GAO report. 
   There is another report on the compact that was done by OMB. They issued a report which found the retail milk prices in New England, after the Compact was in place, were, on average, lower than for the rest of the Nation. 
   The Wall Street Journal editorial page writers have ignored both the GAO report and the OMB report. Why? These are factual 
   and objective reports that the Journal should have reviewed. 
   It is clear that our compact is working perfectly by benefiting consumers, local economies, and farmers, something that is not stated in the editorial that attacked Senator LOTT. 
   I am especially fed up when opponents say the compact blocks interstate trade in milk when OMB reports the compact has increased the sales of milk into New England as neighboring farmers in New York, who did not have the Compact, take advantage of it. OMB reported that while the Compact was in force for the first six months, there was an 8 percent increase in milk sales into the region. Instead of blocking interstate commerce, I would say an 8-percent increase in interstate commerce is an 8-percent increase in interstate commerce. 
   I am fed up when opponents say the compact does not help dairy farmers stay in business, when it greatly increases their income. My best guess is dairy farmers, just as wheat, corn, or soybean farmers, when their income increases, they are more likely to stay in business. I recognize the Nation's major opponent of the compact, Kraft, owned by Philip Morris, does not want farmers to have the additional income the compact provides. But opponents of the compact should not argue it does not give farmers more income when, in fact, it does. 
   Opponents of the compact say farmers in Wisconsin and Minnesota are going out of business, even though this is comparing apples with oranges. Even though the compact doesn't have an effect on them, they say we should not have a compact in the Northeast. Let farmers in the Midwest set up their own compact. I would vote for a compact for them or any other reasonable proposal that helps their farmers. Do not condemn one section of the country that is doing fine and protecting their farmers when, if they wanted to, they could do exactly the same thing in their own part of the country. 
   I wish to mention for a minute what the compact replaces. Opponents of the compact prefer prices to be set by Federal bureaucrats. Supporters of the compact prefer pricing to be determined by consumers and local representatives, not by the Federal Government. The Governors and legislators in the six New England States had five goals in mind when they enacted the compact into law in each of their States. They wanted to assure fresh local supplies of milk to consumers at lower prices than found in most of the Nation. 
   They wanted to keep dairy farmers in business. They wanted to protect New England's rural environment from sprawl and destructive development, and they wanted to do this without burdening Federal taxpayers. 
   The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has delivered beyond the expectations of those Governors and State legislatures. The compact provided an added benefit. It has increased interstate trade into the region as neighboring farmers have taken advantage of the compact. 
   This great idea, coming from those six New England States, has created a successful and enduring partnership between dairy farmers and consumers throughout New England. 
   Thanks to the Northeast Compact, the number of farmers going out of business has declined throughout New England for the first time in many years. 
   It is unfortunate that some still favor Federal bureaucrats running this farm program. We ought to instead be blessing this compact. Here is something not run by the Federal Government, not costing the taxpayers anything, but being done by the people who are affected by it. Indeed, half the Governors of the Nation, half the State legislatures in the Nation, asked that the Congress allow their States to set their own dairy policy through interstate compacts that cost taxpayers nothing. It costs taxpayers nothing. Let me say it again: It costs taxpayers nothing. Why do people oppose a program that is not costing taxpayers anything and affects just the people in the region who want it? 
   This dairy compact passed with overwhelming support in almost all these States--Republicans and Democrats in the legislatures; Republican and Democratic Governors. Major environmental groups have endorsed the Northeast Dairy Compact. A New York Times and National Geographic article discussed the importance of keeping dairy farmers in business from an environmental standpoint. 
   Consumer prices are lower, farm income is higher, and no increased costs to taxpayers. One wonders, why does anybody oppose it? 
   One asks, why is it opposed? The answer is simple: Huge milk manufacturers, such as Suiza, headquartered in  Texas, Kraft, which is owned by the tobacco giant Philip Morris, and other processors represented by the International Dairy Foods Association oppose the compact because they want to keep the money themselves. They do not want the farmers to have any of these profits. 
   Even the most junior investigative reporter could figure out the answer. All anyone has to do is look up the donations made by these and other giant processors. All the negative news stories about the compact have their genesis in the efforts of these giant processors and their front organizations. 
   I say this again on the floor, just so people understand, because it was an unfair editorial in singling out the distinguished majority leader of the Senate using facts which bear scrutiny. Indeed, one of the corporation front organizations, Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, apparently could not continue to exist when it was obvious that their policies were determined by corporate dollars rather than good policy. They had to close up shop when they lost their conscience. 
   I have detailed the close alliances between their lead executive who handled compact issues for them and the job he negotiated to represent the huge processors a couple of times on the Senate floor. 
   I will give the press another lead on the next public interest group whose funding should be investigated--the Consumer Federation of America. Indeed, one of their officers--formerly from Public Voice--is being taken around Capitol Hill offices by lobbyists representing processors. A glance at who funds their functions and efforts will be as instruction as investigations of Public Voice. 
   Why should Philip Morris or Kraft want to use these organizations instead of directly going to the editorial boards of the New York Times or the Washington Post to badmouth the compact? The question does not need me to provide the answer. 
   What would be the best attack--whether true or not--on the Compact that might swing public opinion? 
   It might be to simply allege that milk prices are higher for children in the school lunch program. Who would the editorial boards more likely listen to regarding school children: a public interest group or a tobacco company?

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am today submitting a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of Congress regarding measures to achieve a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the state of Chiapas, Mexico. 
   This resolution is cosponsored by Senators KENNEDY, FEINSTEIN, JEFFORDS, TORRICELLI, MURRAY, DURBIN, WELLSTONE, FEINGOLD, HARKIN, KERRY, MIKULSKI, and BOXER. 
   Congresswoman NANCY PELOSI is introducing an identical resolution today in the House of Representatives. 
   The purpose of this resolution is to convey our support for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Chiapas that has been simmering since the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Since then, and despite repeated attempts at negotiations, the situation remains tense and prospects for productive dialogue remote. In August, armed confrontations between members of the Mexican military and Zapatista supporters in Chiapas was a reminder of the political violence that has plagued the region for years. I submitted a similar resolution just over a year ago and, unfortunately, the situation remains largely unchanged. 
   This resolution does not attempt to take sides or to dictate an outcome of that conflict. It is not meant to embarrass or interfere in Mexico's internal affairs. The situation in Chiapas is a complex one that has social, ethnic, economic and political dimensions. It is a manifestation of years of Mexican history. It is for the Mexican people to resolve. 
   But despite its complexities, there is no doubt that the indigenous people of Chiapas have been the victims of injustice for centuries. Most do not own any land and they live--as their parents and grandparents did--in abject poverty. The 1994 Zapatista uprising, in which some 150 people died, was a reflection of that injustice and despair, and the political tension and violence of recent years has only exacerbated their plight. 
   To his credit, President Zedillo has devoted considerable financial resources to address the poverty and lack of basic services in Chiapas. On September 7, 1999, he pledged to renew dialogue with the Zapatistas and investigate human rights abuses there. The scheduled November 23rd visit to Mexico by Mary Robinson, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, is an important and welcome development. I am hopeful that the Mexican Government will engage in an open dialogue with Ms. Robinson and that progress can be made on ways to further promote and protect human rights in Mexico. 
   Despite these positive steps, however, Mexican officials indicate that they expect little progress toward resolving the conflict before the presidential elections in July 2000. This is very disappointing. While mistrust runs deep on both sides, a great deal can be accomplished in eight months if the parties to the conflict are willing to take the steps to create conditions for good faith negotiations to succeed, and then sit down at the table together. 
   There is little evidence that the Mexican Government's strategy is working. Since early 1998, the Zedillo administration has, on the one hand, lavishly funded social programs in those indigenous communities in Chiapas that are willing to accept them. On the other hand, Mexican troops have tightened their grip on the impoverished communities of Zapatista supporters. They patrol the roads in and out of Chiapas in armored vehicles, brandishing weapons and establishing military check-points and bases when it is abundantly clear that neither the communities, nor the Zapatistas themselves, pose a credible threat to the Mexican Government. In addition, paramilitary forces, responsible for some of the worst atrocities, continue to operate in the region. 
   Human rights monitors, including Mexican citizens, have been harassed, and foreigners, including American citizens, have been summarily expelled from Mexico for activities that amount to nothing more than criticizing the policies of the Mexican Government. 
   The Zapatistas have also contributed to their isolation. They have not accepted the Mexican Government's recent overtures to resume dialogue and seem resigned to wait in their jungle stronghold until there is a new government before considering a return to talks. Again, July is a long way away, especially for the Zapatistas' supporters who struggle every day just to find food and shelter for themselves and their families. They have suffered long enough. 
   Mr. President, this resolution calls on our Secretary of State to encourage the Mexican Government and the Zapatistas to support negotiations that address the underlying causes of the conflict, to achieve a lasting peace. It seeks to convey our concern about the people of Chiapas, and the urgent need for concrete progress to resolve a conflict that has cost many innocent lives and threatens the economic and political development of our southern neighbor. 
   A stable, peaceful and prosperous Mexico is not only in the best interest of all Mexicans, it is also in the economic and security interests of the United States. And human rights abuses, wherever and however they occur, deserve our attention. 
   The resolution urges the Secretary of State to ensure that the United States is not contributing to the political violence, by reaffirming current law which limits assistance and exports of equipment only to Mexican security forces  who are primarily involved in counter-narcotics activities and who do not commit human rights abuses. In order to ensure that the law is faithfully implemented, the State Department needs to know who we train and who receives our equipment. 
   It calls on the Mexican Government to respect the freedoms of movement, association and expression by implementing the recommendations of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, particularly with regard to American citizens and others who have been summarily expelled from Mexico in violation of Mexican law and international law. 
   And it urges both sides to take initiatives for peace. 
   Mr. President, some may ask why we are submitting this resolution today, when this conflict has been simmering for years, It is my hope that in conjunction with Mary Robinson's visit next week, this Resolution will send a strong message to the Mexican Government, the Zapiatislas, our own administration and the international community that an intensified effort is needed urgently to resolve the conflict peacefully.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, just so that colleagues on both sides will know, last week, and again yesterday for that matter, we made more progress on this bill. 
   We have been able to clear 27 amendments to improve the Bankruptcy Reform Act. Those are amendments offered by both Republicans and Democrats. 
   Senator TORRICELLI, Senator HARRY REID, and I have been working in good faith with Senator GRASSLEY and Senator HATCH to clear amendments. We have been able to do that, and we will try to clear even more. 
   I am pleased, on a personal point, that the majority accepted my amendment regarding the mandate to file tax returns under the bill. That will save $24 million over the next 5 years. But there are a lot of amendments similar to this that have improved it. 
   Senator TORRICELLI and I are working together with the deputy Democratic leader, and we are preparing to enter a unanimous consent request to limit the remaining Democratic amendments to 27 amendments. Fifteen of these have already been offered to the bill and are the pending business. All 27 were filed by November 5. Most of these are going to have very short time agreements. Many will be accepted. From a total of 320 amendments that were filed by both Republicans and Democrats on November 5, the managers of the bill on both sides have boiled down the remaining Democratic and Republican amendments to about 35--from 320 to 35. 
   Many of them are going to be acceptable either with modifications or in the present form. The remaining ones are critical to the debate on this bill. 
   Remember that for the first time in our Nation's history this bill would restrict the rights of Americans to file for bankruptcy based on the debtor's income. If we are going to adopt a means-tested bankruptcy law, we should have a full and fair debate on that. The American people would ask for nothing more. 
   The credit card industry is going to get billions out of this and should have to bear some responsibilities for its lax lending practices. We have heard a lot of stories about 5-year-olds getting credit cards in the mail with a multi-thousand-dollar limit. 
   Then we have the Truth in Lending Act on here. 
   I would like to get as close to a fair and balanced bill as we passed last year. 
   But we have come to the floor to offer amendments. We had only 4 hours of debate on Monday, and a disrupted day yesterday with caucuses and other things. But we have moved very quickly on this. We have disposed of 35 amendments with only 8 rollcalls. 
   I urge Senators to move forward. The leaders are trying to move forward. 
   I thank my colleagues for allowing me to break in to bring people up to date. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I should note just on the bankruptcy bill, we are making more progress. This morning we were able to clear four more amendments. I understand there is a total of 31 amendments that been accepted to improve the Bankruptcy Reform Act. These are amendments that have been offered on both sides of the aisle. 
   I commend the distinguished deputy Democratic leader, the Senator from Nevada, Mr. REID, for his help. He has  been, as I described him in the caucus, indefatigable in his efforts to move this through. He and I and the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. TORRICELLI, and the Senator from Iowa, Mr. GRASSLEY, and the Senator from Utah, Mr. HATCH, have all worked to clear amendments or to set rollcalls on those we cannot clear. 
   I have urged Members to have short time agreements, and they have agreed to that. I think we have gone from some 300 or more potential amendments down to only a dozen or so, if that, that are remaining. 
   When you are dealing with a piece of legislation as complex as this, as important as this, when we are only 2 to 3 weeks before the end of this session--when we are only 2 to 3 weeks before the end of this session--I was hoping somebody would jump up and disagree on that ``2 to 3 weeks'' bit--or possibly a few days before the end of this session, it shows how well we have done. 
   But as I said earlier, before he came on the floor, I 
   commend the Senator from Nevada, who has worked so hard to bring down those numbers on the amendments. 
   Frankly, I would like to see us wrap this up. I would like to go to Vermont.

   Mr. LEAHY. I am at a loss to understand why we cannot. 
   I say to my friend from Nevada, yesterday morning--and I normally speak at about an octave higher than this; I am coming out of a bout of bronchitis--I came back to be here at 10 o'clock because we were going to be on the bill. Instead, we had morning business, I believe, until about 4 o'clock in the afternoon. That is 6 hours. That is what it would have taken to finish the bill, especially after the work of the Senator from Nevada, and others, in clearing out so many of the Republican and Democratic amendments to get them accepted or voted on. 
   I understand we are waiting for the other body to get the appropriations bill over here. I would think between now and normal suppertime today we could finish this bill, if people want to. We are willing to move on our side. We are willing to have our amendments come up. 
   I see the distinguished Senator from California on the floor. She has waited some time. She has been here several days waiting with an amendment. She has indicated she is willing to go ahead with a relatively short period of time. The Senator from New York, Mr. SCHUMER, has said the same. We are ready to go, and I wish we would. 
   As I stated earlier, I would have liked very much to get this done. I would actually like very much to finish all the items we have. I wish we could have finished a couple weeks ago. I want to go to Vermont. I want to be with my family. It was snowing there yesterday, as I am sure it was in parts of the State of the distinguished Presiding Officer. I see the distinguished Senator from Maine on the floor. I expect it did in her State.

   Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Nevada has the good fortune as I do: We both represent two magnificent and beautiful States. He has the ability, however, in his State to go far greater ranges in 
   climate, in temperature, over a distance of 100 miles or so than just about anywhere else in the country. We sometimes do those ranges in temperature and climate in one afternoon in Vermont, but we are not always happy about it. 
   I would like to see us get moving and get out of here. I see the distinguished Senator from California, who has asked me to yield to her. I am prepared to do that, but I also note that we will not start on any matter until the distinguished floor leader on the other side is on the floor. So I am at a bit of a quandary. I wanted to yield to the distinguished Senator from California with her amendment, but the distinguished floor leader on the Republican side is not here. 
   So I ask that the Senator from California withhold a bit. I see the Senator from--I may be a traffic cop here. I see my good friend and neighbor from New England, the Senator from Maine. 
   I ask, could she indicate to me just about how much time she may need?

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I could take a moment to comment, I compliment Senator LINCOLN for her comments. I totally agree with her. There was a long and difficult conference. It was the Intellectual Property Communication Omnibus Reform Act--a long and difficult conference. We had a lot of give and take. We had conferees from two Senate committees. It became a Rubik's Cube, where everybody had to give something. We got it through, and it passed. I believe my friend said the vote in the House was 411-8. In my little State, we have 70,000 homes with satellite dishes that will be left dark if we don't get this. There are 12 million nationwide. 
   I hope we can do this before we go out. The heavy lifting has already been done. It was done in the committee of conference. The distinguished Senator from Arkansas made very clear throughout that whole time the needs of her constituents, as have other Senators. I hope that whether they are sitting in a farmhouse in Vermont, a home in Arkansas, or anywhere else, if on New Year's Eve they want to watch the festivities by satellite, they can do that. I compliment the Senator.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today Senators BROWNBACK, FEINGOLD, KENNEDY, KERRY, JEFFORDS, and I are introducing the Refugee Protection Act of 1999, a bill to limit and reform the expedited removal system currently operating in our ports of entry. 
   In 1996, I introduced an amendment that would have only authorized the use of expedited removal at times of immigration emergencies. The bill I introduce today--with the cosponsorship of two Republican and three Democratic Senators--is modeled on that proposal. That amendment passed the Senate with bipartisan support, but was omitted from the bill that was reported out of a partisan, closed conference. As a result, expedited removal took effect on April 1, 1997. America's historic reputation as a beacon for refugees has suffered as a consequence. 
   Expedited removal allows INS inspections officers summarily to remove aliens who arrive in the United States without travel documents, or even with facially valid travel documents that the officers merely suspect are fraudulent, unless the aliens utter the magic words ``political asylum'' upon their first meeting with American immigration authorities. This policy is fundamentally unwise and unfair, both in theory and in practice. 
   First, this policy ignores the fact that many deserving asylum applicants are forced to travel without papers. For example, victims of repressive governments often find themselves forced to flee their homelands at a moment's notice, without time or means to acquire proper documentation. Or a government may systematically strip refugees of their documentation, as we saw Serb soldiers do in Kosovo earlier this year. 
   Second, expedited removal places an undue burden on refugees, and places too much authority in the hands of low-level INS officers. Refugees typically arrive at our borders ragged and tired from their ordeals, and often with little or no knowledge of English. Our policy forces them to undergo a secondary inspection interview with a low-level INS officer who can deport them on the spot, subject only to a supervisor's approval. By law, anyone who indicates a fear of persecution or requests asylum during this interview is to be referred for an interview with an asylum officer. But no safeguards exist to guarantee that this happens, and the secondary inspection interviews take place behind closed doors with no witnesses. Indeed, this interview often becomes unduly confrontation and intimidating. As the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights has documented, refugees are detained for as long as 36 hours, are deprived of food and water, and are often shackled. If they are lucky, they will be provided with an interpreter who speaks their language. If they are unlucky, they will receive no interpreter at all, or an interpreter who works for the airline owned by the government that they claim is persecuting them. Such a system is a betrayal of our ideals, and is already producing a human cost. 
   Indeed, only a few years into this new regime, there are extraordinary troubling stories of bona fide refugees who were turned away unjustly at our borders. I will talk about two such refugees today. 
   ``Dem'' (a pseudonym) was a 21-year-old ethnic Albanian student in Kosovo. In October 1998, Serbian police seized him and tortured him for 10 days, accusing him of terrorism and threatening to kill his family. Immediately after this experience, Dem fled Kosovo, without travel documents. He traveled through Albania to Italy, where he purchased a Slovenian passport. In January of this year, he flew via Mexico City to California, hoping to find refuge in the United States. 
   Dem's hopes were not realized. The INS referred him for a secondary inspection interview and provided for a Serbian translator to participate by telephone. Since Dem could speak only Albanian, the interpreter was useless. Instead of finding an interpreter who could speak Albanian, the INS officers simply closed Dem's case, handcuffed his hands behind his back and put him on a plane back to Mexico City. In other words, Dem--a victim of an ethnic conflict that was already front page news in America's newspapers--was removed from the United States without ever being asked in a language he could understand whether he was afraid to return to Kosovo. Luckily, Dem succeeded in a second attempt to enter the United States, has since been found to have a credible fear of persecution, and is now awaiting an asylum hearing. One can only wonder how many refugees in Dem's position never receive such a second chance. 
   While Dem was arriving in Los Angeles this January, a Tamil from Sri Lanka named Arumugam Thevakumar arrived at JFK Airport in New York seeking asylum. Mr. Thevakumar had escaped from Sri Lanka and its bloody civil war, but only after being persecuted by the army because he is a Tamil. When he had his secondary inspection interview, he told the interpreter that he was a refugee and sought asylum. The translator laughed and said that he was unable to translate Mr. Thevakumar's request into English. In addition to battling a language barrier and an uncooperative translator, Mr. Thevakumar's ability to convince the INS of his sincerity was further handicapped by the fact that he was handcuffed and shackled for significant portions of the interview. 
   Following his interview, Mr. Thevakumar was briefly detained and was allowed to telephone a cousin, who arranged for a lawyer. The lawyer contacted the INS to clarify that Mr. Thevakumar wanted to apply for asylum. But the INS sent Mr. Thevakumar back to Istanbul, where his flight to New York had originated, without affording him even the opportunity to show that he was deserving of asylum. Indeed, the INS faulted him for not making his intention to apply for asylum clear during his secondary inspection interview. 
   Mr. Thevakumar's ordeal did not end there. When he landed in Turkey, he was jailed for four days by immigration officials, who beat and interrogated him before handing him over to regular police. When he was finally released by the police, he was referred to a United Nations office in Ankara, halfway across the country from Istanbul. After 15 days of travel wearing clothes that were completely unsuitable for the Turkish winter, he finally arrived at the U.N. office and requested refugee status and asked not to be sent back to Sri Lanka. He is currently living in a Red Cross facility in Turkey. 
   These stories--just two of the many stories demonstrating the human cost of expedited removal--go a long way toward showing the inhumanity of the new immigration regime that Congress imposed in 1996. But refugees are not the only people affected by expedited removal. Human rights groups have also documented numerous cases where people traveling to the United States on business, with proper travel documents, have been removed based on the so-called ``sixth sense'' of a low-level INS officer who suspected that their facially valid documents were fraudulent. In other words, the damage done by expedited removal also threatens the increasingly international American economy--if businesspeople from  around the world are treated disrespectfully at our ports of entry, they are likely to take their business elsewhere. 
   But perhaps the most distressing part of expedited removal is that there is no way for us to know how many deserving refugees have been excluded. Because secondary inspection interviews are conducted in secret, we typically only learn about mistakes when refugees manage to make it back to the U.S. a second time, like Dem, or when they are deported to a third country they passed through on their way to the U.S., like Mr. Thevakumar. This uncertainty should lead us to be especially wary of continuing this failed experiment. 
   As I said, my bill would limit the use of expedited removal to times of immigration emergencies, defined as the arrival or imminent arrival of aliens that would substantially exceed the INS' ability to control our borders. The bill gives the Attorney General the discretion to declare an emergency migration situation, and the declaration is good for 90 days. During those 90 days, the INS would be authorized to use expedited removal. The Attorney General is given the power to extend the declaration for further periods of 90 days, in consultation with the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. s 
   This framework allows the government to take extraordinary steps when a true immigration emergency threatens our ability to patrol our borders. At the same time, it recognizes that expedited removal is an extraordinary step, and is not an appropriate measure under ordinary circumstances. 
   This bill also provides safeguards that will ensure that refugees are assured of some due process rights, even during immigration emergencies. First, aliens would be given the right to have an immigration judge review a removal order, and would have the right both to speak before the immigration judge on their own behalf and to be represented at the hearing at their own expense. To make these rights meaningful, immigration officers would be required to inform aliens of their rights before they are removed or withdraw their application to enter the country. This provision takes away from low-level INS officers the unilateral power to remove an alien from the United States. 
   Second, expedited removal will not apply to aliens who have fled from a country that engages in serious human rights violations. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, will develop and maintain a list of such countries. This will help ensure that even during an immigration emergency, we will provide added protection for many of our most vulnerable refugees. 
   Third, this bill reforms the procedures used to determine whether an applicant who seeks asylum has a credible fear of persecution. If an asylum officer determines that an applicant does not have a credible fear of persecution, the applicant will now have a right to a prompt review by an immigration judge. The applicant will have the right to appear at that review hearing and to be represented, at the applicant's expense. In addition to providing procedural guarantees, the bill also redefines ``credible fear of persecution'' as a claim for asylum that is not clearly fraudulent and is related to the criteria for granting asylum. In combination, these changes will make it easier for aliens requesting asylum in the United States to receive an appropriate asylum hearing before an immigrant judge. 
   Fourth, the bill clarifies that the Attorney General is not obligated to detain asylum applicants while their claims are pending. Asylum seekers are not criminals and they do not deserve to be imprisoned or detained against their will. There may be cases where detention is appropriate, and this bill allows for such cases, but I believe that that power should only be used in very rare cases. After all, these applicants have by definition demonstrated a credible fear of persecution. Moreover, detaining asylum applicants imposes a significant burden on the taxpayers, who of course must foot the bill for the detention. This bill also gives the Attorney General the ability to release an asylum applicant from detention pending a final determination of credible fear of persecution. 
   Finally, this Refugee Protection Act also addresses a few other problems that have arisen under the restrictive immigration laws Congress passed in 1996. First, it gives aliens the opportunity to demonstrate good cause for filing for asylum after the one-year time limit for claims has expired. By definition, worthy asylum applicants have arrived in the United States following traumatic experiences abroad. They often must spend their first months here learning the language and adjusting to a culture that in many cases is extraordinarily different from the one they know. Therefore, although I can understand the desire to have asylum seekers submit timely applications, we must apply the one-year rule with some discretion and common sense. Indeed, when the Senate passed the 1996 immigration law, it contained a broad ``good cause'' exception that did not survive to become part of the final legislation. The Senate should take up this issue again; we were right in 1996, and the need is still there today. 
   In a similar vein, the bill allows asylum applicants whose claims have been rejected to submit a second application where they can show good cause. No one wants to allow aliens to submit repeated applications and drain the resources of our INS officers and immigration courts. But there are exceptional cases where a second application is justified, beyond the ``changed circumstances'' exception that exists under current law. For example, extraordinarily worthy asylum applicants, unfamiliar with the United States and its legal system, might submit an application without the benefit of counsel and without an understanding of the legal requirements of a successful asylum claim. Such people deserve a second chance to demonstrate that they deserve to receive asylum. 
   In conclusion, I point out that even in 1996, a year in which immigration was as unpopular in this Capitol as I can remember, this body agreed that expedited removal was inappropriate for a country of our ideals and our historic commitment to human rights. And that agreement cut across party lines, as many of my Republican colleagues voted to implement expedited removal only in times of immigration emergencies. I urge them, as well as my fellow Democrats, to support this legislation and to work for its passage before the end of the 106th Congress.

   Mr. LEAHY. 
   Mr. President, Vermonters have a proud tradition of protecting our environment. We have some of the strongest environmental laws in the country. Yet despite this proud tradition of environmental stewardship, we have seen how pollution from outside our state has affected our mountains, lakes and streams. Acid rain caused from sulfur dioxide emissions outside Vermont has drifted through the atmosphere and scarred our mountains and poisoned our streams. Mercury has quietly made its deadly poisonous presence into the food chain of our fish to the point where health advisories have been posted for the consumption of several species. And, despite our own tough air laws and small population, the EPA has considered air quality warnings in Vermont that are comparable to emissions consistent for much larger cities. Silently each night, pollution from outside Vermont seeps into our state, and our exemplary and forward-looking environmental laws are powerless to stop or even limit the encroachment. 
   The Clean Air Act of 1970 was a milestone law which established national air quality standards for the first time and attempted to provide protection for populations who are affected by emissions outside their own local and state control. That bill did much to halt declining air quality around the country and improve it in some areas. It also acknowledged that fossil fuel utility plants contribute a significant amount of air pollution not only in the area immediately around the plant but can affect air quality hundreds of miles away. 
   While the bill has improved air quality, changes in the utility market since passage of the Clean Air Act make it necessary to consider important updates to the legislation. States throughout the country are deregulating utilities and soon Congress may consider federal legislation on this issue. I support these economic changes but Congress and the Administration should keep pace with this changing market. Breaking down the barriers of a regulated utility market can have important economic consequences for utility customers. More competition will drive down prices. But these lower costs will come with a price--the cheapest power is unfortunately produced by some of the dirtiest power plants. Most of these power plants were grandfathered under the Clean Air Act. 
   So today I am introducing the ``Clean Power Plant and Modernization Act'' to address the local, regional, and global air pollution problems that are posed by fossil-fired power plants under a deregulated market. 
   In the last few weeks, the EPA and the Administration have taken some important steps to address the power plant loophole in the Clean Air Act that allows hundreds of old, mostly coal-fired power plants to continue to pollute at levels much higher than new plants. Closing this loophole is critical to protecting the health of our environment and the health of our children. 
   Last week the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency filed suit against 32 coal-fired power plants who had made major changes to their plants without also installing new 
   equipment to control smog, acid rain and soot. This is illegal, even under the Clean Air Act, and it spotlights the glaring need to level the playing field for all power plants. This is particularly as our country moves toward a deregulated electricity industry. 
   Unfortunately, some of our colleagues decided that this move unfairly targeted some of their utilities that have benefitted from this loophole for almost thirty years. I would point out that many of us from New England and New York believe it is unfair that our states have been the dumping ground for the pollution coming out of these plants for the past thirty years. My colleagues have heard me speak on the floor about how this pollution is contaminating our fish with mercury, damaging our lakes and forests with acid rain, and causing respiratory problems and obscuring the view of Vermont's mountains with summertime ozone pollution from nitrogen oxide emissions. 
   Now, added to these concerns is the growing body of knowledge showing that carbon dioxide emissions are having an impact on the global climate. More than a decade of record heat, reports from around the globe of dying coral reefs, and melting glaciers should be warning signals to all of us. 
   In Vermont, one of our warning signals is the impact to sugar maples. Sugar maple now range naturally as far south as Tennessee and west of the Mississippi River from Minnesota to Missouri. Given the current predictions for climate changes, by the end of the next century the range of sugar maples in North America will be limited the state of Maine and portions of eastern Canada. Vermont's climate may not  change so much that palm trees will line the streets of Burlington and Montpelier, but the impact on the character and economy of Vermont and many other states will be profound. 
   It is hard to imagine a Vermont hillside in the fall without the brilliant reds of the sugar maples, and it is hard to imagine a stack of pancakes without Vermont maple syrup. And it is unlikely that sugar maples will be the only species or crop that will be affected by climate change, or that the effects will be limited to Vermont. Many like to dismiss concerns about pollution from power plants as a ``Northeastern issue.'' It is not; it affects all of us, perhaps in ways that we have not even begun to imagine. 
   I can show you maps that mark the deposition ``hot spots'' for these pollutants in the Everglades, the Upper Midwest, New England, Long Island Sound, Chesapeake Bay and the West Coast. This clearly is not a regional issue. Collectively, fossil fuel-fired power plants constitute the largest source of air pollution in the United States, annually emitting more than 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide, more than 12 million tons of acid rain producing sulfur dioxide, nearly 6 million tons of smog producing nitrogen oxides, and more than 50 tons of highly toxic mercury. 
   These are staggering sums. Consider the fact that it would take nearly 25,000 Washington Monuments, weighing 81,120 tons apiece, to add up to 2 billion tons. And that is just one year. 
   Why are we continuing to allow pollutants on that enormous scale to be dumped on some of our most fragile ecosystems, much less into our lungs through the air we breathe? It is because 
   Congress assumed when it passed the 1970 Clean Air Act that these old pollution-prone plants would be retired over time and replaced by newer, cleaner plants. It has not worked out that way, and it is time for the Congress to rethink our strategy. 
   More than 75 percent of the fossil-fuel fired plants in the United States began operation before the 1970 Clean Air Act was passed. As a result, they are ``grandfathered'' out from under the full force of its regulations. Many of the environmental problems posed by this industry are linked to the antiquated and inefficient technologies at these plants. The average fossil-fuel fired power plant uses combustion technology devised in the 1950's or before. Would any of us buy a car today that was still using 1950s technology? Of course not. So why are we still going out of our way to preserve 1950s technology for power plants? 
   As long as we allow these plants to operate inefficiently they will produce enormous amounts of air pollution. My bill takes a new approach to reducing this pollution by retiring the inefficient ``grandfathered'' power plants and bring new, clean, and efficient technologies for the 21st Century on line. 
   Obviously, major changes in this industry will not occur over night. The ``continue-business-as-usual'' inertia is enormous. The old, inefficient, pollution-prone power plants will operate until they fall down because they are paid for, burn the cheapest fuel, and are subject to much less stringent environmental requirements. ``Grandfathered'' plants have the statutory equivalent of an eternal lifetime under the Clean Air Act loophole. 
   Mr. President, this article in Forbes Magazine describes how valuable the old ``grandfathered'' power plants are. The article cites the example of the ``grandfathered'' Homer City generating station outside of Pittsburgh. Until last year, the utility valued this plant at $540 million. According to the Forbes article, last year the utility sold the plant for $1.8 billion. That works out to $955 per kilowatt of generating capacity, or about the cost of building a new plant. Why are these old pollution-prone plants suddenly so valuable? Maybe their ``grandfathered'' status has something to do with it. 
   What does my bill propose to do? First, it closes the ``grandfather'' loophole. Second, it lays out an aggressive but achievable set of air pollution and efficiency requirements for fossil-fired power plants. Third, the emissions standards will allow clean coal technologies to have a fair chance to compete in the future mix of electrical power generation. Fourth, it provides industry decision-makers with a comprehensive and predictable set of regulatory requirements and tax code changes so they can see up-front what the playing field is going to look like in the future. This will allow them to make informed, comprehensive, and economically efficient business decisions. Public health and the environment will benefit, consumers will benefit, and the utility companies will benefit from this approach. 
   As U.S. power plants become more efficient and more power is produced by renewable 
   technologies, less fossil fuel will be consumed. This will have an impact on the workers and communities that produce fossil fuels. These effects are likely to be greatest for coal, even with significant deployment of clean coal technology. The bill provides funding for programs to help workers and communities during the period of transition. I am eager to work with organized labor to ensure that these provisions address the needs of workers, particularly those who may not fully benefit from retraining programs. 
   The bill provides substantial additional funding for research, development, and commercial demonstrations of renewable and clean energy technologies such as solar, wind, biomass, and fuel cells. As utilities retire their ``grandfathered'' plants and plan for future generating capacity, renewable and clean technologies need to be part of the equation. My bill also authorizes expenditures for implementing known ways of biologically sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere such as planting trees, preserving wetlands, and soil restoration. 
   How will the environment benefit from the emission and efficiency standards in my bill? Mercury emissions will be cut from more than 50 tons per year to no more than 5 tons per year. Annual emissions of sulfur dioxide that causes acid rain will be cut by more than 6 million tons beyond the requirements in Phase II of the Clean Air Act of 1990. Nitrogen oxide emissions that result in summertime ozone pollution will be cut by more than 3 million tons per year beyond Phase II requirements. And the bill would prevent at least 650 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. 
   Of course, this discussion should not just be about the impact to our environment. This debate should equally be focused on public health. There is mounting evidence of the health effects of these pollutants. The Washington Post Magazine ran an alarming article that documented the escalating number of children with asthma, jumping to 17.3 million in 1998 from 6.8 million in 1980. Asthma may not be caused directly by air pollution, but it certainly aggravates it and can lead to premature deaths. 
   The American public still overwhelmingly supports the commitment to the environment that we made in the early 1970s. As stewards of the environment for our children and our grandchildren, we need to act without delay to ensure that in the new millennium the United States produces electricity more efficiently and with much less environmental and public health impact. There is no reason why we should go into the next century still using technology from the era of Ozzie and Harriet.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week there was a terrible tragedy affecting the United Nations' World Food Program. This occurred when one of their planes crashed in Kosovo on an errand of mercy. 
   Since its inception in 1963, the World Food Program has been the United Nations' front line for fighting hunger throughout the world. It is the world's largest food aid organization. 
   Last year, the World Food Program assisted 75 million people in 80 countries around the world. This summer I observed their operations in Kosovo. In fact, at one point I was invited to fly on the same plane that crashed, to go and see what they were doing. 
   The World Food Program's mission is to eradicate hunger. I think that in the last seven years it has moved closer and closer to accomplishing this goal under the leadership of Executive Director Catherine Bertini. I was very proud to support Catherine when she was appointed to be executive director in 1992, during the administration of President Bush. She became the first woman to head the World Food Program. I have been a strong supporter for her ever since. She has done a great job as executive director, and I am glad that she continues to lead the World Food Program today. 
   For many, the World Food Program is known for its emergency response efforts. It was one of the first organizations to move into the Balkan region when the conflict in Kosovo began. 
   As I mentioned earlier, during the August recess I visited the World Food Program and met with Catherine Bertini and talked to her about how their efforts were going. I believe they are doing a great job. Areas which had previously been empty fields have been transformed into makeshift cities where thousands of people seeking safety, food and shelter have found relief, thanks to the efforts of the World Food Program, Catholic Relief Services and other international organizations. 
   But emergency relief efforts such as this reflect only a portion of the World Food Program's responsibilities. The World Food Program's Food for Work programs feed millions of chronically hungry people worldwide. They contribute more grants to developing countries than any other United Nations agency. That is why so many people around the world felt the same degree of sadness that I and others in the Senate did when we learned of the plane crash on Friday in which a World Food Program plane, en route from Rome to Pristina, crashed into a mountain ridge just miles from their destination, 
   killing all 24 people aboard the plane. 
   The passengers aboard this plane were an international group of aid workers. They were all headed to Kosovo to become part of the humanitarian mission there. In a war-torn area, these were 24 people going to bring solace, aid, and help to people who have seen so little of it over the years. They were people who were motivated by the greatest sense of charity and giving to their fellow human beings. They worked for U.N. agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and government agencies, all united by a sense of humanitarianism. 
   The loss of these individuals is going to be felt throughout the world. They were people who demonstrated over and over again that their fellow human beings were the most important things in their lives. Their deaths are a major loss to their families, as well as the organizations, including the World Food Program, for which they worked. 
   I send my sincere condolences to the families of those killed in this tragic crash, and I hope the world will understand they have lost 24 of their finest people.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know we are going on to the bankruptcy bill later today. We made progress on the bill last week. We cleared 25 amendments and improved the Bankruptcy Reform Act. We will continue to try to do that again today. The distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Senator TORRICELLI, and I, working with the distinguished deputy Democratic leader, the Senator from Nevada, are prepared to enter into a unanimous consent agreement to limit the remaining Democratic amendments to only 28 amendments. Most of these would limit us to very short time agreements. I will speak on this more this afternoon. I want Senators to know that.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hope that the leadership will soon bring up for a vote the conference report regarding the Satellite Home Viewers Act and the Patent Reform Act. This legislation passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 411-8. According to an informal whip count, if it came to a vote in the Senate, it would pass by something like 98-2, and no worse than 95-5. So we ought to bring it up for a vote. 
   I don't know when I have gotten so much mail on any subject as I have on satellite home viewing. If you come from a rural area, you know how important this legislation is. If we do not pass the Satellite Home Viewers Act, on December 31 hundreds of thousands--maybe millions--of satellite viewers will find that a number of their channels will be simply cut off, especially in rural areas. 
   So when we have something that could easily be passed, we ought to do it. The patent legislation is supported--the so-called Hatch-Leahy bill--by most businesses I know. It would be a tremendous step forward in helping us to be competitive with the rest of the world in our patent legislation. It is also the second time in history that we have lowered the cost of patent registration to the taxpayers. So I urge that when we have a piece of legislation like this, which has passed the House of Representatives 411-8, which would pass overwhelmingly in the Senate, that the Republican leadership bring it up. Passing this bill will give some aid to many businesses throughout the country, including some of the finest technological businesses in the world. 
   And on the satellite front, this bill will allow the many individuals who rely on satellite dishes because they live in rural areas to be able to continue to get their television. 
   I think of States like my own State of Vermont, such as the State of Montana, the State of Texas, the State of Wyoming, and the State of Nevada, to name a few, where because of our rural nature, people are very dependent on satellite dishes. These satellite dish owners are justifiably concerned that on December 31, many of their channels are going to go dead. We can stop that by passing this legislation this week. 
   The Satellite Home Viewers Act conference report will soon be before us. It  passed overwhelmingly in the House, as it will here. I only know of two or three people who are opposed to it. That should not be enough to stop this bill. 
   In fact, I will join with the majority leader if he wants to bring the satellite bill up and instantly file cloture. I could get him the necessary signatures in 20 seconds. I can guarantee him that if it was necessary--and I hope that it would not be--to vote cloture, he would get far more than the 60 votes necessary for it; 90 to 95 Members of the Senate want to pass this. I hope the distinguished majority leader will allow it to come to a vote. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Financial Information Privacy and Security Act of 1999. I am pleased that Senators BRYAN, HARKIN, DURBIN, and FEINGOLD are original cosponsors of this legislation to protect the financial privacy of all Americans. 
   The right of privacy is a personal and fundamental right protected by the Constitution of the United States. But today, the American people are growing more and more concerned over encroachments on their personal privacy. 
   New technologies, new communications media, and new business services created with the best of intentions and highest of expectations also pose a threat to our ability to keep our lives to ourselves, and to live, work and think without having personal information about us collected without our knowledge or consent. 
   This incremental invasion of our privacy has happened through the lack of safeguards on personal, financial and medical information, which can be stolen, sold or mishandled and find its way into the wrong hands with the push of a button or click of a mouse. 
   Our right of privacy has become one of the most vulnerable rights in the information age. The digitalization of information and the explosion in the growth of computing and electronic networking offer tremendous potential benefits to the way Americans live, work, conduct commerce, and interact with their government. 
   It makes it possible for me, sitting in my farmhouse in Vermont, to connect with any Member of Congress or friends around the world, to get information with the click of a mouse on my computer. 
   But the new technology also presents new threats to our individual privacy and security, in particular, our ability to control the terms under which our personal information is acquired, disclosed, and used. 
   Just last week, President Clinton signed into law the landmark Financial Modernization Act of 1999, which updates our financial laws and opens up the financial services industry to become more competitive, both at home and abroad. I supported this legislation because I believe it will benefit businesses and consumers. It will make it easier for banking, securities, and insurance firms to consolidate their services, cut expenses and offer more products at a lower cost to all. But it also raises new concerns about our financial privacy. 
   New conglomerates in the financial services industry may now offer a widening variety of services, each of which may require a customer to provide financial, medical or other personal information. Nothing in the new law prevents these new subsidiaries or affiliates of financial conglomerates from sharing this information for uses beyond those the customer thought he or she was providing it. 
   For example, the new law has no requirement for the consumer to consent before these new financial subsidiaries or affiliates sell, share, or publish information on savings account balances, certificates of deposit maturity dates and balances, stock and mutual fund purchases and sales, life insurance payouts or health insurance claims. 
   That is wrong. You shouldn't be able to have that information and go around to anybody who wants to use it to pitch you some new product or scare you into cashing in life savings or anything else. 
   As President Clinton recently warned:  
   Although consumers put a great value on privacy of their financial records, our laws have not caught up to technological developments that make it possible and potentially profitable for companies to share financial data in new ways. Consumers who undergo physical exams to obtain insurance, for example, should not have to fear the information will be used to lower their credit card limits or deny them mortgages.  
   I strongly agree. If we had this information in a desk drawer at home, nobody could come in and just take it. Instead, it is in the electronic desk drawer of one of the companies we have given it to, and they can share it with anybody they want within their organization. 
   Mr. President, the Financial Information Privacy and Security Act of 1999 offers this Congress the historic opportunity to provide fundamental privacy of every American's personal financial information. This bill would protect the privacy of this financial information by directing the Federal Reserve Board, Office of Thrift Supervision, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Securities and Exchange Commission jointly to promulgate rules requiring the financial  institutions they regulate to: (1) inform their customers about what information may be disclosed, and under what circumstances, including when, to whom and for what purposes; (2) allow customers to review the information for accuracy; (3) establish safeguards to protect the confidentiality of personally identifiable customer information and records to prevent unauthorized disclosure; and (4) for new customers, obtain the customers' consent to disclosure, and for existing customers, give the customers a reasonable opportunity to object to disclosure. These financial institutions could use confidential customer information from other entities only if the entities provides their customers with similar privacy protections. 
   In addition, this bill provides individuals the civil right of action to enforce their financial privacy rights and to recover punitive damages, reasonable attorneys fees, and other litigation costs. Privacy rights must be enforceable in a court of law to be truly effective. 
   To be sure, this legislation would not affect any state law which provides greater financial privacy protections to its citizens. Some states have already recognized the growing need for financial privacy protections. For example, I am proud to say that Vermont instituted cutting edge financial privacy laws five years ago. This bill is intended to provide the most basic rights of financial privacy to all American consumers. They deserve nothing less. 
   When President Clinton signed the financial modernization bill last week, he directed the National Economic Council to work with the Treasury Department and Office of Management and Budget to craft legislative proposals to forward to Congress next year to protect financial privacy in the new financial services marketplace. I believe the Financial Information Privacy and Security Act of 1999, which we are introducing today, should serve as the foundation for the Administration's financial privacy bill. 
   Americans ought to be able to enjoy the exciting innovations of this burgeoning information era without losing control over the use of their financial information. 
   The Financial Information Privacy and Security Act updates United States privacy laws to provide these fundamental protections of personal financial information in the evolving financial services industry. 
   I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   On privacy, in Vermont we care greatly about this. I have been in public life for a long time. During that time, I have only clipped and actually saved and framed a couple articles about me from the press. 
   My distinguished friend from Nevada, who is on the floor, like me lives in a rural area--he in Searchlight, I in Middlesex, VT. I live on this dirt road. I look down this valley, 35 miles down a valley, mountains on either side. I literally cannot see another house from my front yard. It is a beautiful spot, this place my parents got when I was a teenager just for a summer home. Marcelle and I have made a year-round place out of it. There is a neighboring farm family who, for 40 years, have hayed the fields and done work around there. They have known me since I was a teenager. The article I cut from the papers was from one of our largest newspapers. It was a sidebar. Here is almost verbatim the way it went. 
   The out-of-State reporter drives up to a farmer who is sitting on his porch along the dirt road. He says to the farmer, ``Does Senator LEAHY live up this road?'' The farmer said, ``You a relative of his?'' He said, ``No, I am not.'' He says, ``You a friend of his?'' He said, ``Not really.'' He says, ``Is he expecting you?'' The reporter says, ``No.'' The farmer looks him right in the eye and says, ``Never heard of him.'' 
   Now, we Vermonters like our privacy. This was a Saturday, and the farmer wasn't about to tell somebody where I lived and direct him down the dirt road to it. It is a humorous story, but I kept that over the years because it reminds me of other ways to protect our privacy. By the same token, I would not want--whether it is that reporter or somebody I never met--to go onto a computer and find my bank statements, my medical records, my children's medical records, or my spouse's, and find out whether we have applied for a mortgage or not, or find out whether we have bought life insurance or cashed in life insurance. So I think we have to ask ourselves as we go into the new millennium, one where information will flow quicker and in more detail than could have even been conceived a generation ago--it could not have been conceived at the time my parents purchased that beautiful spot in Vermont. Ten years from now, we will move faster and with more complexity than we could even think of today. 
   So I think the Congress, if it is going to fulfill its responsibility to the American people, has to do more and more to protect our privacy and allow technology to move as fast as it can, but not at the price of our individual privacy. We all know basically what we, our friends, neighbors, families, would want to give up of their personal privacy--not very much. Think to yourself, if this was something you had in the top drawer of your desk at home, knowing nobody could get it, they would need search warrants or they would break the law by coming in and taking it. That is all the more reason why on somebody's computer they should not be allowed to take it.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, asset forfeiture is a powerful crime-fighting tool. It has been a particularly potent weapon in the war on drugs, allowing the government to take the cars and boats and stash houses amassed by drug dealers and put them to honest use. Last year alone, the government was able to seize nearly half a billion dollars worth of assets, cutting a big chunk out of criminals' profit stream and returning it to the law-abiding community. 
   Unfortunately, our nation's asset forfeiture is not fail-safe; it can be abused. In hearings on this issue, the Judiciary Committee has heard examples of what happens when prosecutorial zeal skirts the boundaries of due process, leading to the taking of private property regardless of whether the owner is innocent of, or even cognizant of, the property's use in an illegal act. 
   In recent years, our nation's asset forfeiture system has drawn increasing and exceedingly sharp criticism from scholars and commentators. Federal judges have also added their voices to the growing chorus of concern. In 1992, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals stated, ``We continue to be enormously troubled by the government's increasing and virtually unchecked use of the civil forfeiture statutes and the disregard for due process that is buried in those statutes.'' Four years later, the Eighth Circuit rebuked the government for capitalizing on the claimants' confusion to forfeit over $70,000 of their currency, and expressed alarm that:  
   the war on drugs has brought us to the point where the government may seize ..... a citizen's property without any initial showing of cause, and put the onus on the citizen to perfectly navigate the bureaucratic labyrinth in order to liberate what is presumptively his or hers in the first place. .....  Should the citizen prove inept, the government may keep the property, without ever having to justify or explain its actions.  
   Similarly, the Seventh Circuit recently expressed its belief that ``the government's conduct in forfeiture cases leaves much to be desired,'' and ordered the return of over $500,000 in currency that had been improperly seized from a Chicago pizzeria. 
   Civil asset forfeiture rests upon the medieval notion that property is somehow guilty when it causes harm to another. The notion of ``guilty property'' is what enables the government to seize property regardless of the guilt or innocence of the property owner. In many asset forfeiture cases, the person whose property is taken is never charged with any crime. 
   The ``guilty property'' notion also explains the topsy-turvy nature of today's civil forfeiture proceedings, in which the property owner--not the government--bears the burden of proof. Under current law, all the government must do is make an initial showing of probable 
   cause that the property is ``guilty'' and subject to forfeiture; it is then up to the property owner to prove a negative--that the property was not involved in any wrongdoing. 
   It is time to reexamine the obsolete underpinnings of our civil forfeiture laws and bring these laws in line with more modern principles of due process and fair play. We must be especially careful to ensure that innocent property owners are adequately protected. 
   The Hatch-Leahy Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act provides greater safeguards for individuals whose property has been seized by the government. It incorporates all of the core reforms of H.R. 1658, which passed the House of Representatives in June by an overwhelming bipartisan majority. The Hatch-Leahy bill also includes a number of additional reforms which, among other things, establish a fair and uniform procedure for forfeiting real property, and entitle property owners to challenge a forfeiture as constitutionally excessive. 
   During our hearing this year on civil asset forfeiture reform, the Justice Department and other law enforcement organizations expressed concern that some of the reforms included in the House bill would interfere with the government's ability to combat crime. The bill we introduce today addresses the legitimate concerns of law enforcement. In particular, the bill puts the burden of proof on the government by a preponderance of the evidence, and not by clear and convincing evidence. The preponderance standard is used in virtually all other civil cases, and we believe it is sufficient to protect the interests of property owners. 
   We have also removed provisions in H.R. 1658 that would allow criminals to leave their ill-gotten gains to their heirs, and would bar the government from forfeiting property if it inadvertently sent notice of a seizure to the wrong address. These provisions did little more than create procedural ``gotchas'' for criminals and their heirs, and are neither necessary nor desirable as a matter of policy. 
   The Hatch-Leahy bill also differs from the House bill in its approach to the issue of appointed counsel. Under H.R. 1658, anyone asserting an interest in seized property could apply for a court-appointed lawyer. There is no demonstrated need for such an unprecedented extension of the right to counsel, nor is there any principled distinction between defendants in civil forfeiture actions and defendants in other federal enforcement actions who are not eligible for court-appointed counsel. Moreover, property owners who are indigent may be eligible to obtain representation through various legal aid clinics. 
   The Hatch-Leahy bill authorizes courts to appoint counsel for indigent claimants in just two limited circumstances. First, a court may appoint counsel in the handful of forfeiture cases in which the property at issue is the claimant's primary residence. When a forfeiture action can result in a claimant's eviction and homelessness, there is more at stake than just a property interest, and it is fair and just that the claimant be provided with an attorney if she cannot otherwise afford one. Second, if a claimant is already represented by a court-appointed attorney in a related federal criminal case, the court may authorize that attorney to represent the claimant 
   in the civil forfeiture action. This is both fair and efficient, and eliminates any appearance that the government chose to pursue the forfeiture in a civil proceeding rather than as part of the criminal case in order to deprive the claimant of his right to counsel. 
   For claimants who were not appointed counsel by the court, the Hatch-Leahy bill allows for the recovery of reasonable attorney fees and costs if they substantially prevail in court. The bill also makes the government liable for post-judgment interest on any money judgment, and imputed interest in certain cases involving currency or negotiable instruments. 
   Another core reform of the Hatch-Leahy bill is the elimination of the so-called ``cost bond.'' Under current law, a property owner that seeks to recover his property after it has been seized by the government must pay for privilege by posting a bond with the court. The government has strongly defended the ``cost bond,'' not as a device for ensuring that its court costs are covered, but as a way of deterring frivolous claims. Of course, we are all in favor of deterring frivolous claims, but there are ways to deter frivolous claims without offending the fundamental principle of equal and open access to the courts, a bedrock of our American system of justice. The Hatch-Leahy bill provides that a person who challenges a forfeiture must file his claim on oath, under penalty of perjury. Claimants also remain subject to the general sanctions for bad faith in instituting or conducting litigation. Further, most claimants will continue to bear the substantial costs of litigating their claims in court. The additional financial burden of the ``cost bond'' serves no legitimate purpose. 
   Under current law, a property owner has only 20 days from the date of first publication of the notice of seizure to file a claim challenging an administrative forfeiture, and only 10 days to file a claim challenging a judicial forfeiture. It is therefore unlikely that anyone who misses the first of three published notices will be able to file a timely claim. The Hatch-Leahy bill extends the property owner's time to file a claim following administrative and judicial forfeiture actions to 30 days. The bill also codifies current Department of Justice policy with respect to the time period for sending notice of seizure, and establishes a 90-day period for filing a complaint. The bill leaves undisturbed current laws and procedures with respect to the proper form and content of notices, claims and complaints. 
   Finally, the Hatch-Leahy bill will allow property owners to hold on to their property while a case in process, if they can show that continued possession of the government will cause substantial hardship to the owner, such as preventing him from working, and that this hardship outweighs the risk that the property will be destroyed or concealed if returned to the owner during the pendency of the case. Unlike H.R. 1658, the Hatch-Leahy bill adopts the primary safeguards that the Justice Department wanted added to the provision--that property owners must have sufficient ties to the community to provide assurance that the property will not disappear and that certain property, such as currency and property particularly suited for use in illegal activities, cannot be returned. As amended, the hardship provision in the Hatch-Leahy bill is substantially similar to the hardship provision in another civil asset forfeiture bill, S. 1701, which the Justice Department has endorsed. 
   The fact is, the Justice Department has endorsed most of the core reforms contained in the Hatch-Leahy bill. Indeed, the Department has already taken administrative steps to remedy many of the civil forfeiture abuses identified in recent years by the federal courts. For this, the Department is to be commended. But administrative policy can be modified on the whim of whoever is in charge, and the law remains susceptible to abuse. 
   It is time for Congress to catch up with the Justice Department and the courts on this important issue. Due to internecine fighting among law enforcement officials whose views Congress always wants to take into consideration, action on civil forfeiture reform has been delayed for far too long. The Hatch-Leahy bill strikes the appropriate middle ground between the  House bill and S. 1701, providing comprehensive and meaningful reform while ensuring the continued potency of civil asset forfeiture in the war on crime. 
   Senator HATCH and I share a longstanding and deeply-held appreciation for law enforcement and the officers who work on the front lines to protect our families and communities, and we have worked together on a number of crime-related issues in the past. I want to commend him for his commitment, not just to law enforcement, but to the rights of all Americans. It has been my pleasure to work with him on this issue, to bring balance back in the relationship between our police forces and the citizens of this country.

   Mr. LEAHY. I understand this time is not coming out of the time of either side, just so people understand. 
   Mr. President, yesterday we made some progress on the bill and were able to clear 22 amendments to improve it. Those were amendments offered by both Democrats and Republicans. Senator TORRICELLI, the ranking member of the appropriate subcommittee, and I have been working in good faith with Senator GRASSLEY, the chairman of the appropriate subcommittee, and Senator HATCH, the chairman of the full committee, to clear amendments. We will try to make some more progress on amendments today.  
   I thank the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Utah for their willingness to accept my amendment to provide that the expenses needed to protect debtors and their families from domestic violence is properly considered in bankruptcy proceedings. Domestic violence remains a serious problem in our society. We need to do all we can to protect victims and potential victims of domestic violence. 
   Some of the other amendments we accepted are also quite important. For example, we improved the bill by accepting an amendment offered by Senators GRASSLEY, TORRICELLI, SPECTER, FEINGOLD, and BIDEN, giving bankruptcy judges the discretion to waive the $175 filing fee for chapter 7 cases for debtors whose annual income is less than 125 percent of the poverty level. Bankruptcy is the only civil proceeding that in forma pauperis filing status is not permitted. This amendment corrects that anomaly. 
   We also accepted a Feingold-Specter amendment which improves the bill by striking the requirement that a debtor's attorney must pay a trustee's attorney's fees if the debtor is not ``substantially justified'' in filing for chapter 7. The bill's current requirement that a debtor's attorney must pay a trustee's attorneys' fees could chill eligible debtors from filing chapter 7 because they could fear they would have to pay future attorney's fees. This is something we had tried to correct when the committee considered the bill. I am glad we have finally done so. 
   I commend Senators who came to the floor on Friday and Monday and yesterday to offer their amendments. Despite only 4 hours of debate on Friday, and 4 hours on Monday, and, of course, yesterday we had our party caucuses, and we had extended debate on two nongermane, nonrelevant amendments on other matters, Senators from both sides of the aisle have offered 49 
   amendments to improve the bill. And we disposed of 27 of those so far in this debate. 
   I hope all Senators with amendments will continue to come to the floor today to offer their relevant amendments. 
   But unfortunately, while we continue to make progress on the underlying bill in some regards, the Senate's two votes rejecting important amendments offered by Senators DURBIN and DODD were missed opportunities to improve the bill. 
   Senator DURBIN's amendment would have allowed us to confront predatory lending practices. Senator DODD's would have provided some restraint on the virtually unrestrained solicitation of young people by the credit card industry. 
   I spoke earlier about the Austin Powers credit card campaign. Kids going into the movie theater to see ``Austin Powers'' were given a chance to get a credit card with a long credit line and get a free Coke, too, if they wanted, but they could also end up with 10-, 25- and almost 30-percent interest payments. I think many who got that suddenly found it was the most expensive soft drink they ever got at a movie. 
   These are the practices on which we ought to put some limits. It does not help when the credit card companies come here crying crocodile tears that these children they have given credit cards to suddenly actually used them and have run up huge debts, or the people who have been given unrestrained credit cards actually use them and have run up huge debts. So I commend Senators DURBIN and DODD for their amendments. We actually should have accepted both of them. 
   Most importantly, yesterday the Senate took several actions that will make it much harder to enact bankruptcy reform legislation. The Senate rejected the Kennedy amendment to provide a real minimum-wage increase and, on a virtually party-line vote, chose to adopt an amendment that includes special interest tax breaks that are not paid for, under the guise of being a real increase in the minimum wage, when in fact it is not. 
   The President has now promised to veto the bill if it reaches his desk in this form. He noted that the Republican majority used its amendment ``as a cynical tool to advance special interest tax breaks,'' which it was. 
   The Senate's actions yesterday in these regards were both unfortunate and unwise.

   Mr. LEAHY. In addition to those provisions adopted yesterday, I want to raise again the question of the costs and the burdens of this bill. We have not talked here about the costs of this bill. But according to the Congressional Budget Office--and this is what everybody watching who is interested in this debate ought to stop and ask themselves: Is this an improvement in our bankruptcy laws or are the taxpayers going to pay for it? 
   According to the Congressional Budget Office, the bill reported by the Judiciary Committee will cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The cost to the Federal Government, estimated by CBO, is at least $218 million over the next 5 years. 
   Much of the cost will be borne by our bankruptcy and Federal courts without any provision to assist them in fulfilling the mandates of this bill. Dockets are already overcrowded in our bankruptcy courts. We are not providing new judges. We are now suddenly telling those bankruptcy judges and Federal judges to carry an even heavier burden, but we will not give them additional resources. As a practical matter, somebody is going to have to pay. We are going to have to pay because the courts will get so clogged, the reaction will be to improve that, and we will have to pay for that. 
   We have to ask, who are the principal beneficiaries? Right now, they are the companies that make up the credit industry. I searched high and low in the bill for the provisions by which these companies are asked to pay for these mandates that benefit them or even contribute to the costs and burdens of the bill, a bill that they support. If  they are getting these huge benefits, are they required to pay anything for them? They are not. I can find no provisions by which credit card companies and others who expect to receive a multibillion-dollar windfall from this bill will have to pay the added costs of this measure. 
   Investing a couple hundred million of taxpayers' money to make several billion dollars for the credit card industry might seem to be a good business investment but not if the taxpayers have to pick up the bill to hand over a multibillion-dollar benefit to the credit card companies. 
   In addition to these costs to the Federal Government, there are the additional mandates imposed on the private sector. We keep saying how we want to keep Government off the back of the private sector. In fact, CBO estimates the private sector mandates imposed by just two sections of the bill will result in annual increased costs of between $280 million and $940 million a year. 
   Are we willing to tell the private sector that with this bill we are, in effect, putting a tax on them of $280 million to $940 million a year, which over 5 years will amount to between $1.4 billion and $4.7 billion to be borne by the private sector? If we vote for this bill, are we going to tell them we just gave that kind of a tax increase to them? 
   The CBO estimate explains these costs are likely to be borne by the bankruptcy debtors, thereby ``reducing the pool of funds available to creditors.'' You pay at the beginning or you pay in the end, but you are going to pay. 
   So all in all, this amounts to a bill of an estimated cost over 5 years of $5 billion to be borne by taxpayers and debtors so the credit industry can pocket another $5 billion. Not a bad day's work by the credit industry lobbyists but not a good result for the American people. They are going to be happy if they get the American taxpayers to give them $5 billion just like that. They ought to be awfully happy. 
   I asked last Friday that those who are proposing this bill to come forward and answer the simple question I posed then: What language in the bill guarantees that any savings from this bill will be passed on to consumers? I continue to ask whether credit card interest rates will be reduced by any savings created by this bill. Certainly the 25- to 26- and 27-percent interest rates ought to be reduced. I continue to ask whether credit fees will be reduced by any savings generated by provisions of this bill. I continue to ask how the $400 per American family the proponents of the bill estimate will be saved by provisions of this bill are going to get to these families. Everybody says we are saving money for the American families. So far all I see is a $5 billion transfer from those American families to the credit card industry. 
   I haven't heard or seen any answers to those basic questions. I think those who say this is going to benefit the American public ought to be more specific. CBO doesn't see it that way. They see a great transfer from the American public to one industry. For all that I can see, any savings generated by this bill will be gobbled up in windfall profits for the credit industry, without any guarantee of benefits for working people, and with a $1 billion per year out-of-pocket cost to taxpayers and those in the bankruptcy system. 
   Mr. President, I understand time will now go back on the amendment. I think we had a unanimous consent request at this point that when we went back on the bill, the Senator from Minnesota was going to be recognized. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair and my good friend from Montana. 
   Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from Alabama for his comments and others who have spoken on this. He and I belong to that great fraternity which I have always considered the best fraternity--former prosecutors. I have sometimes said the best job I ever had was as a prosecutor, although I must admit, when I told the U.S. attorney of our State, Charles Tetzlaff, who is a superb U.S. attorney, I often wanted to trade with him, he said: ``Yeah, sure you do.'' In my view, it is one of the best positions one can have in government, also one that requires the most concern for the public. 
   I wear both hats of a Senator and also as a former prosecutor in opposing this amendment. I am not opposing the motivation of Senators who want to stop what has become a scourge of drug use in our country. When I think of the young people in this country whose lives are damaged by drugs, when I think of families who are damaged, when I think of the people who are victims of crime from those seeking money to buy drugs, I fully appreciate what a scourge it is. 
   Right on Capitol Hill, one of the most beautiful parts of our Nation, we have seen people suffer burglaries, muggings, thefts, and assaults by people trying to get money for drugs. It is a problem our country, probably more than any other country, has to face because we are the wealthiest nation on Earth and we, as a nation, fuel the drug trade because of all the money we put into it. 
   It is ironic, in a way, that we send in troops and helicopters and chemicals to countries to stem the drug production and trade from their country, when the answer, of course, is within our borders. If we worked harder stopping the demand for drugs in the United States, that drug traffic would dry up. If you could turn off the drug production in a country in Central America and could somehow hermetically seal that country, as long as there are tens of billions, even hundreds of billions, of dollars willingly spent by U.S. citizens for drugs, drug production will just take place somewhere else. It is the ultimate example of supply and demand. The supply is always going to be there. We do far too little to stop the demand. 
   We are not going to stop the demand by this amendment because it takes the wrong approach to combating illegal drug use in this country. The amendment would dramatically increase mandatory minimum penalties for cocaine trafficking. It would throw the principle of federalism out the window by telling local schools and school districts how they must deal with illegal drug use by students. Frankly, how my State of Vermont may want to deal with this may be far different than the State of Montana, the State of Alabama, or any other State. I have to think we know our people the best within our States and they are capable of making those decisions. 
   The amendment attempts to solve the unfair discrepancy between sentences for powder and crack cocaine.  There is an unfair discrepancy, and I do not think people are that far off when they say that discrepancy may have racist overtones. We should all agree the discrepancy is unfair. In solving that discrepancy between powder and crack cocaine, this amendment is going about it in precisely the wrong way by increasing the use of mandatory minimums for those who manufacture, distribute, dispense, or 
   possess with intent to distribute powder cocaine. 
   Under the current law--and this is how we get into the improper and unfair discrepancy--the quantity threshold to trigger mandatory minimum penalties for crack offenders is 100 times more severe than for powder cocaine offenders. Let me put this in a different way. 
   If you have an offender charged with a 5-gram-crack-cocaine offense, they would be subject to the same 5-year minimum sentence that would apply to somebody who was caught with 500 grams of powder cocaine. These harsher crack sentences have resulted in a disparate impact on the African American community. African Americans constitute 12 percent of the American population but account for 40 percent of our prison population. Anybody looking at those numbers know something has gone astray. Eighty-eight percent of those convicted of crack offenses are black and, of course, crack offenses always carry the higher penalties. In 1993, the number of African American men under the control of the criminal justice system was greater than the number of African American men enrolled in college. Something has gone dramatically astray in our country. 
   While it is true that Federal courts have held the disparate impact caused by the crack and powder cocaine mandatory sentencing thresholds does not violate constitutional protections, the fact existing laws fall within the judicially determined boundaries of constitutional acceptability does not absolve Congress of its ongoing responsibility to implement the most just and effective ways to combat drugs in America. 
   Just because an act of Congress may be constitutionally acceptable does not mean it makes sense. On national highways we could probably constitutionally set a $500 fine for somebody driving 5 miles an hour over the speed limit. It would probably be upheld constitutionally, but do we have any constituents who would say it made sense? Of course not. 
   I have repeatedly stated my objections to the shortsighted use of mandatory minimums in the battle against illegal drugs because of the way they are applied. My objections are all the more grave when an attempt is made to increase the use of mandatory minimums through provisions placed in the middle of--what?--an amendment to a bankruptcy bill offered as the adjournment bells are almost ringing at the end of the session. 
   We can debate whether mandatory minimums are an appropriate tool in our critically important national fight against illegal drugs. I believe they have not made that much difference. Others would believe otherwise. In my view, simply imposing or increasing mandatory minimums undercuts and even subverts the more considered process Congress set up with the Sentencing Commission. 
   The Federal sentencing guidelines already provide a comprehensive mechanism to mete out fair sentences. They allow judges the discretion they need to give appropriate weight to individual circumstances. In other words, sentencing guidelines allow judges to do their jobs. 
   The Sentencing Commission goes through an extensive and thoughtful process to set sentence levels. For example, pursuant to our 1996 anti-methamphetamine law, the Sentencing Commission increased meth penalties after very careful analysis of sentencing data, especially recent sentencing data. They studied the offenses. They had information from the Drug Enforcement Agency on trafficking levels, dosage unit size, price, and drug quantity. They took all those matters into consideration. Simply increasing arbitrarily, in the middle of a bankruptcy bill, mandatory minimums goes too far in taking sentencing discretion away from judges. 
   Would it not make far more sense if we set this amendment aside, and at the Judiciary Committee, which certainly has jurisdiction over this issue, have real hearings and have people discuss whether it is a good idea or bad idea? Bring in drug enforcement people, bring in local authorities, bring in everybody else involved, and have a real hearing. If we simply do it because it sounds good at the moment, I think we make a mistake. 
   That is why I have repeatedly expressed my concerns about creating new mandatory minimum penalties, including as recently as in August, when the methamphetamine bill that has contributed many of this bill's provisions was considered by the Judiciary Committee. 
   The meth bill, which was reported by the Judiciary Committee, is contained in this amendment to the bankruptcy bill. It contains a provision directing the Sentencing Commission to amend the guidelines to make penalties for amphetamine offenses comparable to the offense levels for methamphetamine. 
   Congress recently increased mandatory minimum sentences for methamphetamine. Stiff mandatory minimum penalties were slipped into last year's omnibus appropriations bill. As a result, now methamphetamine penalties are the same as crack penalties. This amendment in the bankruptcy bill would now order the Sentencing Commission to increase penalties for amphetamine crimes by a number of base offense levels so the same penalties apply to both meth and amphetamine offenses. 
   So what do we get for a result? Even without the question of mandatory minimums, you are going to have dramatic increases in the penalties for amphetamine offenses. 
   We ought to first pass a resolution saying, we are all against illegal drug use. We live in neighborhoods. We are parents or grandparents. We walk the streets of America. We have seen the dangers of illegal drug use--all Senators, Republican and 
   Democrat. We are all against it. That should be a given. But do we need to stand up here, the 100 of us who are suppose to represent a quarter of a billion Americans, and prove over and over and over again that we are against illegal drug usage by imposing harsher and harsher penalties, without any regard to whether spending more taxpayer money on more prisons and more prison guards is really the most cost-effective way to address this problem? 
   In many parts of this country we spend far more money building new prisons than we do building new schools. We spend far more money increasing the number of prison guards and on their pensions and their pay, and everything else that goes for them, than we do in hiring new science teachers or math teachers or language teachers. We ought to ask ourselves: Does this picture make that much sense? 
   I agree with the distinguished Senator from Alabama, Mr. SESSIONS, that we have put a misplaced emphasis on long mandatory minimum penalties as the primary tool we use to fight illegal drug trafficking. When I was a prosecutor, I must admit, there were many times I asked for a stiff penalty, when the case called for it. But I also knew enough to know that stiffer penalties by themselves are not the whole answer. There are a whole lot of other things involved. For one thing, a lot of people committing a crime do not get too concerned about the penalty if they think they are not going to get caught. 
   So the example I have used before is, you have two warehouses side by side. One has all kinds of alarm systems and security personnel. The other has a rusted old padlock, no lights, and nobody around it. They both are filled with, say, television sets. The penalties for breaking in and stealing those TV sets are the same, whether you break into the warehouse that has its security system, the lights, and the guards, or if you break into the one with the rusty old padlock with no guards and no lights. It does not take a criminologist to know which one is going to get broken into. Why would somebody break into one where they might get caught when they can go into the one where they assume they will not get caught? The penalties are the same, so the penalty is not the deterrent. 
   We have to make drug dealers feel vulnerable and make drug dealing a risky business. We do this by making  sure they are caught and prosecuted, not simply piling on lengthier prison terms with increased mandatory minimum penalties for the few on the fringes who do get caught. 
   These mandatory minimums also carry with them significant economic and social costs. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the annual cost of housing a Federal inmate ranges from $16,745 per year for minimum security inmates to $23,286 per year for inmates in high-security facilities. 
   Mr. President, you and I and every taxpayer is paying for that. It is critical that we take steps that will effectively deter crime, but we should not ignore the costs of this one-size-fits-all approach to mandatory minimums. 
   We also cannot ignore the policy implications of the boom in our prison population. Let me just tell you about this. In 1970--5 years before I came to the Senate--the total population in the Federal prison system was 20,868 prisoners, of whom 16.3 percent were drug offenders. 
   By 1997, the federal prison population had grown to almost 91,000 sentenced prisoners, approximately 60 percent of whom were sentenced for drug offenses. The cost of supporting this expanded federal criminal justice system is staggering. The portion of federal drug control spending attributable to the criminal justice system grew from $415 million in 1981 to over $8.5 billion in 1999. Imprudently lowering the cocaine sentencing threshold without considering the fiscal consequences would further encumber our already overworked system. We ignore at our peril the findings of RAND's comprehensive 1997 report on mandatory minimum drug sentences: ``Mandatory minimums are not justifiable on the basis of cost-effectiveness at reducing cocaine consumption, cocaine expenditures, or drug-related crime.'' 
   Reducing the disparity between sentences for powder and crack cocaine in the manner proposed in this amendment is simply wrongheaded. Sentencing parity at any cost is not the smartest way to wage our war on drugs. Drastically increasing the mandatory minimum penalties for powder cocaine in this hasty, end-of-session amendment will be costly to taxpayers far into the future, as we will have to build numerous new prisons to house non-violent drug offenders who are subject to lengthy federal prison terms under this amendment. Indeed, when a bill seeking to make identical changes to our powder cocaine laws was introduced in the last Congress, I wrote to the Attorney General requesting a prison impact assessment. I received a letter from the Justice Department on June 1, 1998, estimating that the total cost of this legislation over 30 years would be over $10.6 billion, including construction of nine new medium security federal prisons to house 11,000 more prison beds.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEAHY. We are going to see the effects of this amendment much earlier than 30 years from now. Most of us won't be here 30 years from now to answer for it; some may be. We have to look at this and ask, do these costs justify what we wanted to do? 
   We also will be focusing a lot more Federal resources on lower-level drug dealers. We will have to hire a whole lot of new drug enforcement officers right off the bat, but we are going to be refocusing them on lower-level drug dealers. I do not believe this is the most cost-effective allocation of Federal resources. 
   In addition to being costly, another consequence of lowering the powder cocaine threshold is that more federal resources will be focused on lower-level drug dealers. We must ask whether this is the most cost-effective allocation of federal resources. In adopting the federal sentencing scheme, Congress intended state and local drug enforcement personnel to investigate and prosecute small-time offenders, while  the federal government was to use its more sophisticated law enforcement weapons to investigate and prosecute higher-level drug traffickers. Recently, Congress has made great strides toward balancing the federal budget and has opted to devolve many federal programs to states in the belief that certain programs can be more efficiently administered by state and local governments. Likewise, Congress should be wary of assuming the costs associated with federal intrusion into the traditional domain of the states in prosecuting criminal offenses. Ill-considered expansion of the federal criminal justice system has recently come under fire from Chief Justice Rehnquist, who criticized the Congress for federalizing the criminal justice system during a period in which the Senate has failed even to keep the federal bench adequately filled. 
   A 50-gram powder cocaine offense is a serious criminal charge. No one is debating whether a 50-gram powder cocaine dealer should be subject to the possibility of incarceration. What is debatable, however, is whether a 50-gram powder cocaine offender is the type of high-level dealer that should be dealt with harshly by federal rather than state authorities. It is inevitable that the possibility of harsh federal sentences will encourage more federal prosecutions. The question is whether a 50-gram powder cocaine dealer is the type of sophisticated drug trafficker that requires the expense of federal technical expertise. If not, then we should be looking very seriously at more cost-effective ways of distributing law enforcement, prosecution, and incarceration obligations between the federal and state governments in order to maximize the efficiency of our nation's drug control strategy. By restructuring the federal sentencing scheme, we can ensure that state and local governments can assume greater responsibility for the investigation and prosecution of low-level dealers, whose offenses are of particular local concern. Federal resources can then be freed to pursue traffickers higher in the distribution chain. 
   Other aspects of this amendment also turn principles of federalism on their head. For example, the amendment contains a federal mandate for the disciplinary policies of local schools. It would require local schools to adopt certain specific policies on illegal drug use by students, including mandatory reporting of students to law enforcement and mandatory expulsion for at least one year of students who possess illegal drugs on school property. This turns on its head our traditional idea that state and local governments should have the primary responsibility for education, even though that idea is one that is constantly put forward by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and indeed is currently being used by them to 
   justify their opposition to the President's plan to provide funding for schools to hire additional teachers and reduce class size. 
   I am particularly concerned about this one-size-fits-all mandate on the expulsion of students. Expulsion is an option that schools need to have so they can deal with particularly intractable behavior problems among their students. But only local teachers and principals can know which students who violate policies or laws should be expelled, and which deserve a different punishment. 
   I can just see the school principal in Tunbridge, VT getting a directive from the Federal Government, based on something we passed in a bankruptcy bill, telling them how they are going to run disciplinary procedures in Tunbridge. We may find ourselves back to the days when Vermont decided they wanted to be a republic. 
   I am not willing to tell thousands of school principals and administrators around the country, the U.S. Congress will tell you when to expel your students. If I did that, I would almost expect a recall petition and expulsion petition from the people of my State. 
   Finally, I object to the provision in this amendment that authorizes the use of public funds to pay tuition for any private schools, including parochial schools, for students who were injured by violent criminal offenses on public school grounds. Such a provision obviously raises serious Establishment Clause questions that deserve a fuller airing than is possible in an end-of-session amendment. It also gives rise to the numerous policy questions surrounding the issue of school vouchers, which could cause significant damage to our public school system. As a practical matter, this provision also raises the very real possibility of fraud and collusion to manufacture injuries in order to attend a private school at the taxpayers' expense. 
   I do believe that there are good things contained in the parts of this amendment that deal with our methamphetamine and amphetamine problems, most of which are borrowed from a bill that was reported by the Judiciary Committee in August. That bill managed to help local law enforcement in its daily battle against drugs, provide funding for the hiring of new DEA agents, and increase research and prevention funding, all without imposing mandatory minimums. I supported each of those provisions. But the good things included within this amendment are outweighed by the amendment's return to the failed drug policies of the recent past and its unwise and likely unconstitutional educational policies. Therefore, I will vote against this amendment. 
   Mr. President, I know others wish to speak. I know the distinguished Senator from New York was waiting to speak.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in voicing my strong objection to a rider that I understand may be attached to one of the remaining appropriations bills. The rider would block all or part of an ongoing federal environmental enforcement action. If what I hear is true, I am troubled on several levels. First, I think that it would set a very dangerous precedent for Congress to attempt to squash Federal enforcement actions of any kind. The procedures for testing and appealing the appropriateness and reach of enforcement actions through the court system and under the Administrative Procedures Act are well established. These procedures do not include a back door, last minute ``Hail Mary pass'' by Congress using a rider to an appropriations bill as the vehicle. In this instance, someone does not like an environmental enforcement action. If we do it here, will we attach something to appropriations bill to stop antitrust enforcement actions? How about price fixing cases? Where would this type of meddling cease? 
   What we may be seeing with the filing by EPA and DOJ is an enforcement action that has hit the bull's eye dead-on. And now utilities who may have crossed the line are pulling out all the stops to thwart the action. 
   Let's not kid ourselves about what is at stake. Many of us have drafted and introduced legislative proposals to address power plant pollution. We have turned up the heat, and the industry has taken notice. Further, the debate over electric utility restructuring is starting up again in the House of Representatives and the Senate. While there are substantial economic benefits possible under restructuring, Congress should also address environmental consequences of deregulation. In order to alert the Senate leadership of this important issue that has so far been ignored in the restructuring debate, I have asked my colleagues to join me in sending a letter to the Senate leadership requesting that the Senate include a provision to eliminate the grandfather loophole for older power plants. My colleagues from Connecticut and New York certainly knows the history of the Clean Air Act more than any of us. Senator LIEBERMAN, how do you see this enforcement action affecting the Clean Air Act loophole?

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEAHY. And, I think we are making a fair statement in saying that these grandfathered power plants will enjoy an important competitive advantage under restructuring because they do not have to meet the same air quality standards as newer plants. Many of these grandfathered plants are currently not running at a high capacity because demand for their power production is limited to the size of their local distribution area. Under restructuring, the entire nation becomes the market for power and production at these grandfathered plants and their emissions will increase. Deregulation of all utilities will drive a national race to capture market share and profit through producing the cheapest power. 
   Some or all of the rider may apply to plants operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). What do we know about TVA's fossil fired power plants in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alabama? Fifty-eight of 59 units are grandfathered, with the average startup year being 1957, 13 years before the Clean Air Act was passed. The average electricity prices for the TVA states are 6.03 cents in Tennessee, 5.58 cents in Kentucky, and 6.74 cents in Alabama. The average price nationally in 1997 was 8.43 cents. TVA sells some of the cheapest electricity, in part, because it is operating these old, subsidized grandfathered plants. In a deregulated national market, will TVA be competitive? The answer is yes. 
   TVA-wide in 1997 the 59 units emitted 98.5 million tons of CO2, nearly 5% of the U.S. total for power plants. If the TVA plants were all in one state that state would rank sixth in CO2 emissions. In 1997, the TVA plants emitted 808,500 tons of acid rain producing SO2. If the TVA plants were all in one state that state would rank fifth in SO2 emissions. Unfortunately we do not have comparable data for ozone producing nitrogen oxide emissions or for emissions of toxic mercury, but I think my point on emissions is made. We should not be looking for a way to unfairly exempt TVA or other grandfathered plants from environmental regulations, rather we need to be looking for the best ways to bring these old plants up to date with current technology. 
   Again, I want to thank my colleagues for their conviction on objecting to this rider. Congress needs to close the grandfather loophole, not attempt backdoor ways to thwart the will of the prior Congresses that enacted the Clean Air Act of 1970, and the amendments to it in 1977 and 1990.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the recent escape of convicted child murderer Kyle Bell from a private prison transport bus should serve as a wake-up call, to the Congress and to the country. Kyle Bell slipped off a TransCorp America bus on October 13, while the bus was stopped in New Mexico for gas. Apparently, he picked the locks on his handcuffs and leg irons, pushed his way out of a rooftop vent, hid out of sight of the guards who traveled with the bus, and then slipped to the ground as it pulled away. He was wearing his own street clothes and shoes. The TransCorp guards did not notice that Bell was missing until nine hours later, and then delayed in notifying New Mexico authorities. Bell is still at large. 
   Kyle Bell's escape is not an isolated case. In recent years, there have been several escapes by violent criminals when vans broke down or guards fell asleep on duty. There have also been an alarming number of traffic accidents in which prisoners were seriously injured or killed because drivers were tired, inattentive, or poorly trained. 
   Privatization of prisons and prisoner transportation services may be cost efficient, but public safety must come first. The Interstate Transportation of Dangerous Criminals Act requires the Attorney General to set minimum standards for private prison transport companies, including standards on employee training and restrictions on the number of hours that employees can be on duty during a given time period. A violation is punishable by a $10,000 fine, plus restitution for the cost of recapturing any violent prisoner who escapes as the result of such violation. This should create a healthy incentive for companies to abide by the regulations and operate responsibly. 
   I commend Senator DORGAN for his leadership on this legislation and urge its speedy passage.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, any American who wants to travel to Iran, to North Korea, to Syria, to Serbia, to Vietnam, to just about anywhere, can do so, as long as that country gives them a visa. As far as the United States Government is concerned, they can travel there at their own risk. 
   Cuba, on the other hand, a country 90 miles away that poses about as much threat to the United States as a flea does to a buffalo, is off limits unless you are a journalist, government official, or member of some other special group. If not, you can only get there by breaking the law, which an estimated 10-15,000 Americans did last year. 
   Of all the ridiculous, anachronistic, and self-defeating policies, this has got to be near the top of the list. 
   For forty years, administration after administration, and Congress after Congress, has stuck by this failed policy. Yet Fidel Castro is as firmly in control today as he was in 1959, and the Cuban people are no better for it. 
   This legislation attempts to put some sense into our policy toward Cuba. It would also protect one of the most fundamental rights that most Americans take for granted, the right to travel freely. I commend the senior Senator From Connecticut, Senator DODD, who has been such a strong and persistent advocate on this issue. I am proud to join him in cosponsoring this legislation, which is virtually identical to an amendment he and I sponsored earlier this year. That amendment came within 7 votes of passage. 
   Mr. President, in March of this year I traveled to Cuba with Senator JACK REED. We were able to go there because we are Members of Congress. 
   I came face to face with the absurdity of the 
   current policy because I wanted my wife Marcelle to accompany me as she does on most foreign trips. A few days before we were to leave, I got a call from the State Department saying that they were not sure they could approve her travel to Cuba. 
   I cannot speak for other Senators, but I suspect that like me, they would also not react too kindly to a policy that gives the State Department the authority to prevent their wife, or their children, from traveling with them to a country with which we are not at war and which, according to the Defense Department and the vast majority of the American public, poses no threat to our security. 
   I wonder how many Senators realize that if they wanted to take a family member with them to Cuba, they would probably be prevented from doing so by United States law. 
   Actually, because the authors of the law knew that a blanket prohibition on travel by American citizens would be unconstitutional, they came up with a clever way of avoiding that problem but accomplishing the same result. Americans can travel to Cuba, they just cannot spend any money there. 
   Almost a decade has passed since the collapse of the former Soviet Union. Eight years have passed since the Russians cut their $3 billion subsidy to Cuba. We now give hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Russia. 
   Americans can travel to North Korea. There are no restrictions on the right of Americans to travel there, or to spend money there. Which country poses a greater threat to the United States? Obviously North Korea. 
   Americans can travel to Iran, and they can spend money there. The same  goes for Sudan. These are countries that pose far greater threats to American interests than Cuba. 
   Our policy is hypocritical, inconsistent, and contrary to our values as a nation that believes in the free flow of people and ideas. It is impossible for anyone to make a rational argument that America should 
   be able to travel freely to North Korea, or Iran, but not to Cuba. It can't be done. 
   We have been stuck with this absurd policy for years, even though virtually everyone knows, and says privately, that it makes absolutely no sense and is beneath the dignity of a great country. 
   It not only helps strengthen Fidel Castro's grip on Cuba, it hands a hug advantage to our European competitors who are building relationships and establishing a base for future investment in a post-Castro Cuba. When that will happen is anybody's guess. President Castro is no democrat, and he is not going to become one. But it is time we pursued a policy that is in our national interest. 
   Let me be clear. This legislation does not, I repeat does not, lift the U.S. embargo. It is narrowly worded so it does not do that. It only permits travelers to carry their personal belongings. We are not opening a floodgate for United States imports to Cuba. 
   The amendment limits what Americans can bring home from Cuba to the current level for government officials and other exempt categories, which is $100. 
   It reaffirms the President's authority to prohibit travel in times of war, armed hostilities, or if there is imminent danger to the health or safety of Americans. 
   Those who want to prevent Americans from traveling to Cuba, who oppose this legislation, will argue that spending United States dollars there helps prop up the Castro Government. To some extent that is true. The government does run the economy. It also runs the schools and hospitals, maintains roads, and, like the United States Government, is responsible for the whole range of social services that benefit ordinary Cubans. Any money that goes into the Cuban economy supports those programs. 
   But there is also an informal economy in Cuba, because no one but the elite can survive on their meager government salary. So the income from tourism also fuels that 
   informal sector, and it goes in to the pockets of ordinary Cubans. 
   It is also worth pointing out that while the average Cuban cannot survive on his or her government salary, you do not see the kind of abject poverty in Cuba that is so common elsewhere in Latin America. In Brazil, or Panama, or Mexico, or Peru, there are children searching through garbage in the streets for scraps of food, next to gleaming high rise hotels with Mercedes limousines lined up outside. 
   In Cuba, almost everyone is poor. But they have access to the basics. The literacy rate is 95 percent. The life expectancy is about the same as in our country, even though the health system is very basic and focused on preventive care. 
   The point is that while there are obviously parts of the Cuban economy that we would prefer not to support--as there is in North Korea, China, or Sudan, or in any country whose government we disagree with, much of the Cuban Government's budget benefits ordinary Cubans. So when opponents of this legislation argue that we cannot allow Americans to travel to Cuba because the money they spend there would prop up Castro, remember what they are not saying: those same dollars also help the Cuban people. 
   It is also worth saying that as much as we want to see a democratic Cuba, President Castro's grip on power is not going to be weakened by keeping Americans from traveling to Cuba. History has proven that. He has been there for forty years, and as far as anyone can tell he is not going anywhere. 
    Mr. President, it is about time we injected some maturity into our relations with Cuba. Let's have a little more faith in the power of our ideas. Let's have the courage to admit that the cold war is over. Let's get the State Department out of the business of telling our wives, our children, and our constituents where they can travel and spend their own money--in a country that the Pentagon say poses no security threat to us. 
   This legislation will not end the embargo, but it will do far more to win the hearts and minds of the Cuban people than the outdated approach of those who continue to defend the status quo.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has voted today on the confirmation of Judge Florence-Marie Cooper to be a United States District Court Judge for the Central District of California. 
   Florence-Marie Cooper is a distinguished Californian. She has distinguished herself with a long career of service in the California state court system. She was a Deputy City Attorney for the City of Los Angeles in 1977. From 1978 to 1983, she was a Senior Research Attorney for the California Court of Appeal Second Appellate District. Then, from 1983-1990 she was a Court Commissioner for the Los Angeles Superior Court. From 1990-1991 she was a Judge in the Los Angeles Municipal Court. Since 1991 she has been a Judge in the Los Angeles Superior Court. 
   Judge Cooper received her undergraduate degree in 1971 from the City College of San Francisco, and her law degree from Whittier College School of Law in 1975. Following law school, she clerked for the Honorable Arthur Alarcon on the Los Angeles Superior Court Appellate Department. 
   The Senate could help Judge Florence-Marie Cooper's future workload if it would likewise take up and consider the nominations of the other nominees to her District Court: Judge Virginia Phillips, Dolly Gee and Frederic Woocher. Virginia Phillips was first nominated back in May 1998 and is still awaiting a hearing in order to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on that Court. The Judiciary Committee recently received a letter from Chief Judge Hatter of that Court in which he implored the Senate to act promptly on the nomination of Judge Virginia Phillips. Judge Hatter notes that the Eastern Division of the Central District is one of the fastest growing areas in the nation and has only one judge with a ``staggering caseload.'' He explains that the reassignment of cases to Los Angeles from San Bernadino ``results in a large number of litigants, witnesses, lawyers, and law enforcement officers having to travel to Los Angeles, some sixty (60) miles away, by way of the most traffic congested roads in the United States.'' I thank Chief Judge Hatter for his letter and want him to know that I, for one, understand. Those who say there is no judicial vacancies problem ought to consider Chief Judge Hatter's perspective and the problems created for thousands of people each year in his District. 
   The Senate also has before it ready for a final confirmation vote the nominations of Judge Richard Paez, Marshal Berzon and Ronald Gould, to the Ninth Circuit. The nomination that has been longer before the Senate is that of Judge Richard Paez, 44 months. The nomination that has been longest on the Senate Executive Calendar is that of Marshal Berzon, whose nomination was reported on July 1, before the 4th of July recess, before the extended August recess and before the Columbus Day recess. 
   The Senate could and should be voting up or down on the Paez and Berzon nominations. The Senate needs to fulfill its duty to each of these outstanding nominees and to the tens of millions of 
   people served by the Ninth Circuit. A few anonymous Republican Senators are holding up action on these important nominations. Two weeks ago, the Majority Leader came to the floor and said that he would try to find a way to have these two nominations considered by the Senate. The way is to call them to a fair up-or-down vote. I want to help the Republican leader and help the Senate find its way clear to do that without additional delay and obstruction. 
   Despite the policy announced at the beginning of this year doing away with ``secret holds,'' that is what Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon still confront as their nominations continuing to be obstructed under a cloak of anonymity after 44 months and 20 months, respectively. That is wrong and unfair. This continuing delay demeans the Senate, itself. 
   I have great respect for this institution and its traditions. Still, I must say that this use of secret holds for extended periods that doom a nomination  from ever being considered by the United States Senate is wrong and unfair and beneath us. Who is it that is afraid to vote on these nominations? Who is it that must hiding their to these nominees? After almost 4 years with respect to Judge Paez and almost 2 years with respect to Marsha Berzon, it is time for the Senate to vote up-or-down on these nominations. 
   The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court wrote in January last year:  
   Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. *.*.* The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.  
   At the time the Chief Justice issued this challenge, Judge Paez' nomination had already been pending for 24 months. The Senate received the Berzon nomination within days of the Chief Justice's report. That was almost 2 years ago and still the Senate stalls and refuses to vote. Let us follow the advice of the Chief Justice. Let the Republican leadership schedule fair up or down votes on the nominations of Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon so that the Senate can finally act on them. Let us be fair to all. 
   The debate on judicial nominations over the last couple of weeks has focused the Senate and the public on the unconscionable treatment by the Senate majority of selected nominees. The most prominent current examples of that treatment are Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon. With respect to these nominations, the Senate is refusing to do its constitutional duty and vote. I challenged the Senate last Friday, in the aftermath of the rejection of the nomination of Justice Ronnie White by the Republican caucus, to vote on the nominations of Judge Paez, Marshal Berzon, Judge Julio Fuentes, Judge Ann Williams, Judge James Wynn, Kathleen McGee Lewis and Enrique Moreno. 
   Nominees deserve to be treated with dignity and dispatch--not delayed for 2 and 3 and 4 years. I continue to urge the Republican Senate leadership to proceed to vote on the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon. There was never a justification for the Republican majority to deny these judicial nominees a fair up or down vote. There is no excuse for their continuing failure to do so. 
   I know the Senate has done the right thing and confirmed Judge Florence-Marie Cooper to the Central District of California and that she will be an outstanding judge. I will continue my efforts to bring to a vote the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished acting majority leader for the number of nominations that have been cleared. I hope my side of the aisle will work with the majority leader to clear some more before we go out, especially among the judges. We have a number that have been pending and are noncontroversial and should be cleared. 
   I also hope that on Wednesday we will go to the conference report on the satellite bill. It passed the House, I think, 411-8, which shows the enormous support it has. I hope we get it out of here; otherwise, we run the risk of hundreds of thousands of satellite dishes and TV sets around this country 
   going black on a number of their channels on December 31. This has enormous importance. 
   As I said, the House passed it 411-8. They are showing more unanimity than on just about anything they have done this year. We passed it, I believe, unanimously. That, and the attendant Hatch-Leahy patent bill--which I think  is extremely important--I hope we get through before we go out. 
   I mention that, but I also did want to commend the Senator from Iowa, both in his capacity as the Senator from Iowa and in his capacity as acting leader, for the number of nominations that have gone through. I hope my side of the aisle will be as diligent in clearing the rest.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, to bring Senators up to date on where we are, the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. TORRICELLI, and I have been working with the distinguished Senators from Iowa and Utah, Messrs. GRASSLEY and HATCH, to clear as many amendments as we can agree to. Senators GRASSLEY, HATCH, TORRICELLI, and I have been able to get a number of these agreed to. We have more than 10 amendments we are ready to accept to show we are making progress on this bill. 
   For the benefit of Senators, I will briefly describe these amendments we are prepared to accept. We are prepared to accept the Feingold amendment No. 2745, an amendment to improve the bill by prohibiting retroactive assessments of disposable income. It ensures that farmers forced into bankruptcy can continue to carry on their farming operations without retroactive assessments against their disposable income. 
   We are prepared to accept Robb amendment No. 1723 which improves the bill by clarifying the trustees shall return any payments not previously paid and not yet due and owing to lessors and purchase money secured creditors if a plan is not confirmed. 
   We are prepared to accept Grassley amendment No. 1731, a bipartisan amendment improving the bill by giving bankruptcy judges the discretion to waive the $175 filing fee for chapter 7 cases for debtors whose annual income is less than 125 percent of the poverty level. Bankruptcy is the only civil proceeding where in forma pauperis filing status is not permitted. This amendment corrects that anomaly. The Grassley amendment is cosponsored by Senators TORRICELLI, SPECTER, FEINGOLD, and BIDEN. 
   Feingold amendment No. 2743 improves the bill by striking the requirement that debtor's attorneys must pay a trustee's attorney fees if the debtor is not substantially justified in filing for chapter 7. The current requirement that debtor's attorney must pay a trustee attorney's fee often causes a chilling effect of discouraging eligible debtors from filing chapter 7 for fear of paying future fees. Senator SPECTER is a sponsor of this amendment. 
   We have Hatch amendment No. 1714 improving the bill by adding procedures for the prosecution of materially fraudulent claims in bankruptcy schedules. 
   Hatch amendment No. 1715 improves the bill by dismissing bankruptcy cases if the debtor commits a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime.  
   The Kerry amendment No. 1725 modifies the deadlines for small business bankruptcy filings. Small businesses need the reasonable time limits of this amendment to reorganize their business. 
   We have the Collins amendment No. 1726, a bipartisan amendment improving the bill by providing bankruptcy rules for family fishermen. The amendment is cosponsored by Senators KERRY of Massachusetts, MURRAY, STEVENS, and KENNEDY. 
   Johnson amendment No. 2654 improves the bill by paying chapter 7 trustees if a case is dismissed or diverted under the bill's means test. 
   The DeWine amendment No. 1727 improves the bill by clarifying that a debt from a qualified education loan under the Internal Revenue Service Code is nondischargable. 
   Grassley amendment No. 2514 improves the bill by clarifying a special tax assessment on real property secured debts under bankruptcy laws. Many municipal governments, particularly in California, depend on these real estate taxes or assessments for revenues. The distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, is a cosponsor of this amendment. 
   Senators had been coming to the floor Friday and Monday to offer amendments. Even though we had only half a day of debate yesterday, Senators from both sides of the aisle offered amendments to improve the bill. 
   So I urge Senators to continue to do that. We could accept a vote or otherwise dispose of the Democratic and Republican amendments. I have discussed this with the distinguished Senator from Iowa. Both of us would like, if at all possible, to whittle down the number and be able to tell our colleagues at what point we are apt to finish the bill. We have been working. I don't think we have even had quorum calls. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by my good friend, the senior senator from Montana, Senator BAUCUS, in introducing the ``Downtown Equity Act of 1999.'' 
   The location of federal buildings and facilities have a tremendous impact on local communities. We are introducing the ``Downtown Equity Act'' to ensure that the federal government is a good neighbor that promotes the vibrancy of communities throughout the country. 
   Guidance for federal agencies on the location of their facilities exists in two executive orders. Unfortunately, these directives are at times inconsistent with each other and have been used to support different goals. This became clear to me when I worked closely with the General Services Administration (GSA), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and the city of Burlington. In 1998, I called together a meeting with all these interested parties to discuss eligible locations for a new INS facility in downtown Burlington. Officials from the city cited one executive order about locating buildings in downtown areas while INS officials countered with another executive order that promotes the location of federal facilities in rural areas. Instead of complementing one another to promote a reasonable policy, the two executive orders are negating each other and clearly neither have enough teeth to result in the policy proclaimed in either order. 
   Mr. President, managing a city is a difficult enough task. Mayors and city managers across the country should not have to also wade through dueling executive orders when they share the same goals as the Administration to re-energize town centers. The federal government needs to set a clear policy on the location of federal buildings in downtown areas. Without legislation to clarify this policy, agencies make decisions about the location of buildings and operations that can undercut the viability of central business districts, encourage sprawl, degrade the environment, and have an adverse impact on historical economic development patterns. Federal facilities should be sited, designed, built and operated in ways that contribute to--not detract from--the economic well-being and character of our cities and towns. Federal facilities can have a tremendous impact and we need to make sure that location decisions do not erode the character and quality of life in our cities and towns. I want to prevent a repeat of the experiences in Vermont, and I know that Senator BAUCUS has many of the same concerns in Montana. 
   The Downtown Equity Act of 1999 clarifies the intention of these dueling executive orders by directing federal officials to give priority to locating federal facilities in central business  areas. This bill does not pit urban areas versus rural areas, but instead promotes the siting of these facilities in downtown areas--urban or rural. By adopting this legislation, the Federal government can become a leader in the effort to limit sprawl and support the economic vitality of central business areas. 
   There is a fundamental problem with development that our bill also tries to address: it's more expensive to build and rent in a traditional downtown area than to build on an empty site outside of a business district. Downtown areas have great difficulty competing in the procurement process because of the higher costs generally associated with downtown areas. Sometimes, despite the best intentions of federal officials, sites with the lowest absolute cost are predisposed to win. This approach is too simplistic. Our ``Downtown Equity Act of 1999'' directs the General Services Administration to study the feasibility of establishing a system for giving equal consideration to both the absolute and adjusted costs of locating in urban and rural areas, and between projects inside and outside of central business areas. While the absolute cost of projects will always be important, a more balanced and robust consideration of the costs of a project is needed. 
   The benefits of limiting sprawl, supporting historic development patterns, and revitalizing our downtown central business areas can mitigate the higher costs associated with constructing, leasing, and operating Federal establishments inside central business areas. Unless the overriding mission of the agency or economic prudence absolutely dictate otherwise, location of Federal facilities should be supportive of local growth management plans for downtown central business areas. 
   When Federal landlords or tenants arrive in town, we have every right to expect that they will be good neighbors. Beyond that, the Federal government also needs to be a leader in the effort to limit sprawl and protect the environment and the character of our cities and towns. Livable and thriving central business districts can be a renewable resource, and the Federal government should be part of the solution, not part of the problem. 
   Senator BAUCUS and I look forward to working with our colleagues and with the Executive Branch to bring much needed reform to the decision-making process that governs the siting of Federal facilities. We all recognize that decisions to prevent or limit sprawl will always be made locally, but the Federal Government can do much to help our communities act on their decisions. And, the Federal Government must stop being an unwitting accomplice to sprawl by siting buildings outside of downtown areas.

   Mr. LEAHY. That is my understanding. 
   Mr. President, I see my good friend, the Senator from Iowa, on the floor. I will speak in my capacity as ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I know Senator HATCH has spoken in his capacity as chairman of the committee. I know the Senator from Iowa, Mr. GRASSLEY, is here as chairman of the appropriate subcommittee, and Senator TORRICELLI of New Jersey will be here as ranking member of that subcommittee. 
   This is an important issue. It is safe to say every American agrees with the basic principle that debts should be repaid. It certainly is a principle I was brought up to believe and one my fellow Vermonters share. In fact, this country is blessed with prosperity, and the vast majority of Americans are able to meet their obligations. But for those who fall on financial hard times, bankruptcy should be available in a fair and balanced way. In fact, our country's founders believed the principle was so important they enshrined it in the Constitution, one of the few such specific reliefs enshrined in the Constitution. 
   Article I, section 8, of the Constitution explicitly grants Congress power to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States. 
   We in Congress have a constitutional responsibility to oversee our Nation's bankruptcy laws. Unfortunately, more and more Americans are filing for bankruptcy. In fact, 1.4 million Americans filed for bankruptcy last year. That was an increase 
   in the number of filings from 1997, and in 1997 there was an increase in the number of filings from 1996. I find this trend extremely disturbing because the economy is doing so well. Even this morning, we hear of unemployment at an all-time low, inflation is steady, and the economy is booming. The unemployment rate keeps going down, inflation remains low, and the Nation's personal bankruptcies keep going up. 
   Vermont has traditionally had one of the lowest rates of bankruptcy per capita in the Nation. But in my home State of Vermont, personal bankruptcies have increased in each of the last 4 years, with annual personal bankruptcies more than doubling since 1994. I said this has occurred even though we have kept our low ranking compared to other States in the number of personal bankruptcy filings per capita. We will be able to keep that ranking because personal bankruptcy rates have gone up far more dramatically in other States. 
   If the rise in personal bankruptcy is caused in part by some Americans abusing the bankruptcy system, then we in Congress should move in a major, balanced way to correct our bankruptcy laws. Working together, we saw a way we could do this. We did last year. Democrats and Republicans molded a bill that corrected abuses by debtors and creditors, and it preserved access to the bankruptcy system for honest debtors. 
   The distinguished senior Senator from Illinois, Mr. DURBIN, who worked with the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. GRASSLEY, did yeoman's work on last year's bill. They produced a bipartisan bill. As I recall--my colleague from Iowa can correct me if I am wrong--I believe it passed the Senate with something like 97 votes and only 1 or 2 votes against it. It is pretty amazing to have that strong support when we have a piece of legislation that balances such contrasting, sometimes conflicting, interests around the country. It is a credit to the two Senators who crafted it. They balanced the competing interests of debtors and creditors to put together a bill that is fair to all. 
   I am on the floor today because I have a concern that the bill before us strays from the blueprint of last year's balanced reforms in the Senate. For example, today's bill requires the means  testing of debtors to complete chapter 7 filings based on expense standards that are formulated by the Internal Revenue Service. 
   Last year, Congress was exposing the IRS as an agency out of control in its enforcement of the Internal Revenue Code, but now we say we will trust the IRS with enforcement of the bankruptcy code. We were saying last year they could not enforce the Internal Revenue Code, the area of their own expertise, but now we say we will let them help enforce the bankruptcy code, an area in which they have no expertise or jurisdiction. In my State, we say that lacks common sense. 
   This means testing severely restricts a judge's discretion to take into account individual debtors' circumstances. As a result, it has the potential to cause an unforgiving and inflexible result of denying honest debtors access to a postbankruptcy fresh start and would go against basically the way the bankruptcy code has been followed since the beginning of this country. 
   I believe most Americans, perhaps not all but most Americans, who file for bankruptcy honestly need relief from their creditors to get back on their feet financially. We have recent research that shows stagnant wages and consumer credit 
   card debt are the primary reasons for the rise in bankruptcy filings. If there are abuses in the credit industry, then we should move in a major and balanced way to correct them. 
   I believe last year's Senate consumer bankruptcy reform bill, which, as I said, passed this Chamber by a near unanimous vote of 97-1, provides us with a blueprint for balanced reforms. 
   Moreover, the latest study by the nonpartisan American Bankruptcy Institute found that only 3 percent of chapter 7 filers could afford to repay some portion of their debt. To force the other 97 percent of chapter 7 debtors to submit to this arbitrary means test in trying to reach 3 percent lacks common sense and poses an additional burden on the 97 percent for something that does not apply to them. The Congress seems to be stepping on people it should not. 
   To the credit of the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from New Jersey, they are working to moderate the bill's arbitrary means testing provisions, and I commend them for working together to improve the underlying bill. I also commend the Senator from Illinois, Mr. DURBIN, and the Senator from New York, Mr. SCHUMER, for their leadership on this issue. I hope we can significantly improve the bill's means test provisions in the coming days, and we can if we want to work at it. 
   I am also concerned that today's bill, at least as it is now, prior to any amendments, is missing a key ingredient from last year's balanced reforms in the Senate: consumer credit information and protection. 
   Last year's Senate-passed bill required the disclosure of information on credit card fees and charges and also protection against unjustified credit industry practices. As the Department of Justice stated in its written views on the bill:  
   The challenge posed by the unprecedented level of bankruptcy filings requires us to ask for greater responsibility from both debtors and creditors. Credit card companies must give consumers more and better information so they can understand and better manage their debt.  
   The administration has made it clear that for the President to sign bankruptcy reform legislation into law, it has to contain strong consumer credit disclosure and protection provisions. I agree with that. The credit card industry has to shoulder some responsibility for the nationwide rise in personal bankruptcy filings. 
   Last year, credit card lenders sent out 3.4 billion solicitations--3.4 billion. There are only 260 million people in this country, from the child born this morning on through. We are talking about 12 credit card solicitations per year for every man, woman, and child in America. 
   I constantly hear from parents that their 10-year-old child may receive a letter: You have been preapproved for credit; X number thousands of dollars. Here is your credit card. 
   I am not as concerned about the 10-year-old because usually the parent will grab that. I am a little bit concerned about the 16- or 17-year-old who has been eyeing a stereo set, or whatever, and they get the credit card preapproved. How about the college kids who get four or five of those in the mail: You have been preapproved. Suddenly they say: Wow, I'm worth $75,000. I have it right here in plastic. Unfortunately, when they spend it, they have to pay it back. We need a little more responsibility on this. 
   Do we want to send a 10-year-old down to the store with $3,000 worth of credit in their credit card? I would think not. But I also don't want the credit card companies crying when they do this and then the bills do not get paid. A little bit of effort should be made first to make sure you know who you are preapproving. 
   I add, there are times when somebody's pet has been preapproved. My eldest son has two beautiful Labrador retrievers--nice dogs, friendly dogs but, as most labs, probably more friendly than bright. I am not sure I want to give them credit cards. And for all the Labrador retriever owners who might have heard that and will call my office, please understand, I do like those dogs, but I am still not going to give them a credit card. 
   Clearly, the billions of credit card solicitations that are sent to Americans every year have contributed to an era of lax credit practices. That, in turn, contributes to the steep rise in personal bankruptcy filings. I am hopeful we can add credit industry reforms to this bill in the coming days. 
   Senators TORRICELLI and GRASSLEY have prepared a managers' amendment that incorporates many credit industry reforms proposed by Senators SCHUMER, REED, DODD, and others. I commend these Senators for working together on these bipartisan credit card reforms. I am pleased, actually, to cosponsor the amendment I have just referred to because it adds more balance to the bill. 
   Another area where we can add needed balanced reform to this legislation is in the homestead exemption. You have States--Florida and Texas, for example--where debtors are permitted to take an unlimited exemption from their creditors for the value of their home. We understand the policy reasons for protecting one's home. But I think the policy was determined when you think of the average home. Unfortunately, this exemption has led to wealthy debtors abusing their State laws to protect multimillion-dollar mansions from their creditors. 
   I do not think we intend somebody to be able to run up millions of dollars of debt, have a multi-multimillion-dollar mansion and say: Wait a minute. I need my humble home. 
   Home may be where the heart is, but it is not necessarily where the bankruptcy protection should be. This is a real abuse of bankruptcy's fresh start protection. 
   The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. KOHL, has been a leader in trying to end homestead bankruptcy abuses. He 
   has, again, prepared a bipartisan amendment to cap any homestead exemption at $100,000. I hope the full Senate will adopt the Kohl amendment to place reasonable limits on homestead exemptions. 
   The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. KENNEDY, plans to offer an amendment to increase the minimum wage over the next 2 years from $5.15 to $6.15 an hour. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment, as I have been before. 
   It is more than appropriate to help working men and women earn a living wage on a bill related to bankruptcy. These minimum-wage workers are some of the same Americans who are struggling to make a living every day and might be forced into bankruptcy by job loss or divorce or other unexpected economic event. 
   More than 11 million workers will get a pay raise as a result of a $1 increase in the minimum wage. We ought to agree to help millions of hard-working American families live in dignity. 
   I plan to offer an amendment that would save the taxpayers millions of dollars in wasteful spending and improve the bill by revising the requirement for all debtors to file with the court copies of their tax returns for the past 3 years. If the requirement was in effect last year, the 1.4 million Americans who filed for bankruptcy would have produced at least 4.2 million copies of their tax returns. 
   It might sound like a great idea, but the Congressional Budget Office estimates it will cost taxpayers about $34  million over the next 5 years for the courts to store and provide access to more than 20 million tax returns. It is a pretty big expense for very little benefit. 
   Every time we do something with one of these mandates, it may sound great, but we ought to ask ourselves, what does this cost? What do we get out of it? My amendment makes more sense. It does what the original amendment wanted to do but without the cost. It would strike the requirement. It would, instead, permit any party in interest--a creditor, judge, trustee or whoever--to request copies of a debtor's tax returns once the bankruptcy is filed. It is a targeted approach, targeted to verify a debtor's assets and income. I think it is workable and efficient because most bankruptcy cases involve debtors with no assets and little income, thus no need for the review of tax returns and no need for the taxpayers to spend $34 million to store paper nobody is ever going to look at. 
   So let's not pile up millions and millions and millions of these pieces of paper, hire hundreds and hundreds of people to store them, and then have something nobody is ever going to look at anyway. 
   I have consulted with our bankruptcy judge and trustee in Vermont. I will continue to do so. They caution that we remember the purpose bankruptcy serves: a safety net for many of our constituents. Those who are using it are usually the most vulnerable of America's middle class. They are older Americans who have lost their jobs or are unable to pay their medical debts. They are women attempting to raise their families or to secure alimony or child support after divorce. They are individuals struggling to recover from unemployment. 
   As we move forward with reforms that are appropriate to eliminate abuses in the system--and we should eliminate such abuses--we need to remember that people use the system, both the debtors and the creditors. We need to balance the interests of creditors with those of middle-class Americans who need the opportunity to resolve overwhelming financial burdens. 
   On a personal note, I welcome the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. TORRICELLI, who is the new ranking member of the Administrative Oversight and the Courts Subcommittee, to the challenges this matter presents. I know he and his staff have been working hard in good faith to improve this bill. 
   As the last Congress proved, there are many competing interests in the bankruptcy reform debate that make it difficult to enact a balanced and bipartisan bill into law. Unfortunately, overall, the Congress failed to meet that challenge last year, even though I believe we met it here in the Senate, in the Grassley-Durbin bill, which passed 97 to 1. 
   I was pleased and proud to be a supporter of that. The mistake came in the conference. It broke down into a partisan fight, as though there is a difference between a Republican or a Democrat who is seeking bankruptcy relief or a difference between a Republican or a Democrat creditor whose interests have to be protected in bankruptcy. 
   This is an American issue. We handled it as such in the Senate a year ago. We should do it again. I hope we can set, again, the standard, Republicans and Democrats in the Senate working together to pass and enact into law balanced legislation that will correct abuses by both debtors and creditors in the bankruptcy system. We are going to be better off for it. I hope that is what we can do. 
   Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from Iowa.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to commend, as I did earlier, Senators GRASSLEY, TORRICELLI, KOHL, SESSIONS, DURBIN, FEINGOLD, and HATCH for coming forward very promptly to offer amendments to improve this bill. 
   In the 4 hours we have had today, I see six amendments have been called up. On first blush, I think I am probably going to be supportive of some of these amendments, if not all. I think if we can continue to improve the bill at this rate, we may well end up getting the same kind of a vote--the 97-1 vote--we had last year on this bill. 
   I would note one thing. I hope Senators will look at this: We have been told of all the money the bill is going to save families in America--$400 each--and that the credit card industry will save $5 or $10 billion by the reforms in this bill. 
   I have a simple question: If we are going to be giving the credit card companies this $5 or $10 billion in savings from this bill, I am just wondering if they are going to do anything to change some of the charges and interest rates they charge consumers--those in a different era we would consider usury, at best. 
   So my simple question is this: What language in the bill will guarantee that savings from the bill will be passed on to consumers? Is there anything that says the credit card fees or consumer credit interest rates will be reduced by the huge savings that some say will come from the enactment of this bill? 
   If the consumer credit industry is going to keep several billions of dollars in savings from enactment of the bill, are those savings going to go to credit card consumers? Even some of the savings? I think that is a fundamental question supporters of the bill should ask themselves as we go forward. We know that more and more, many bankruptcies come about following the enormous--enormous--fees and interest rates charged by credit card companies. They are going to get billions of dollars in savings here. Will they pass any of those on? 
   Mr. President, I understand we have to file amendments by 5 p.m. today. I send an amendment to the desk and ask that it be appropriately filed.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I offer this amendment to protect victims of domestic violence in a bankruptcy proceeding. I am pleased that Senators MURRAY and FEINSTEIN are joining me as cosponsors. 
   Unfortunately, domestic violence pervades all areas of our country. Last year, the Department of Justice reported more than 960,000 incidents of violence against a current or former spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend occur each year, and about 85 percent of the victims are women. 
   As if those statistics were not disturbing enough, the report went on to say that only half of the incidents of intimate violence experienced by women are reported to the police. That leaves almost 1 million incidents that go unreported every year. 
   The pain and terror caused by these crimes of violence are all too often also shared by children, as the Justice Department found that more than half of female victims of intimate violence live in households with children under the age of 12.  
   As our government and community organizations grow more responsive to the needs of victims of intimate and domestic abuse, more victims are leaving their abusive homes seeking safety and assistance. There are a number of programs, including the Rural Domestic Violence and Child Victimization Enforcement Grants, which I authored in the 1994 crime law, that make victim services more accessible to women and children escaping domestic violence. 
   For some victims, however, escaping domestic violence means starting a whole new life away from danger. It sometimes means permanently leaving one's home to find safe housing. Safe housing could be across town or in another state--and it often means having to purchase or rent a new home. 
   Escape from domestic violence sometimes necessitates victims to leave their job, which could leave a woman and her children without an income. Recovery from domestic violence could--and often does--also involve long-term medical and counseling services. These are all necessary expenses which the victim must face. 
   The amendment that I am proposing today would ensure that victims are not penalized for such expenses in a bankruptcy proceeding. 
   My amendment would ensure that additional expenses and income adjustments associated with the protection of a victim and the victim's family from domestic violence are included in their monthly expenses under the bill's means test. 
   I believe that we must ensure that we protect the victims of domestic violence if they are forced to file for bankruptcy. I urge my colleagues to support our amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment to make this bill more workable in the real world and to save the taxpayers of this country $24 million over the next five years. 
   This bankruptcy bill now requires filing of millions of copies of personal income tax returns. Section 315(b) of the bill requires debtors to file with the court copies of their tax returns for the three years preceding their bankruptcy filings as well as tax returns filed while the bankruptcy was pending. 
   If this requirement was in effect last year, the 1.4 million Americans who filed for bankruptcy would have produced at least 4.2 million copies of their tax returns. More than 4 million copies of tax returns would produce mountains of paperwork and clog the files of most, if not all, bankruptcy courts across the country. 
   Where are the bankruptcy courts going to put these millions of copies of tax returns? And why do the courts need to keep them? Good questions that the sponsors of this bill have not answered. 
   Most bankruptcy filers have no assets and little income so there is no reason to review their tax returns. These debtors have no ability to repay their debts and their creditors know it. This blanket requirement to file tax returns for the last three years for all debtors, regardless of the debtor's assets or income, fails to make any common sense. It is simply silly. 
   Moreover, this blanket requirement to file tax returns ignores the reality that many debtors, just like other citizens, may not have access to their tax returns for the past three years. 
   For example, a recently divorced mother of two children may not have copies of her past tax returns if the couple's tax returns are kept by her former husband. Or a debtor, just like other citizens, may not have copies of past records such as tax returns. In either case, the debtor would have to contact the Internal Revenue Service to request copies of past tax returns before being able to seek bankruptcy relief. 
   Depending on the quick service of the IRS is not reassuring to an honest debtor who may honestly need bankruptcy relief. This mandate to keep copies of tax returns for the past three years is unnecessary and unrealistic. 
   Indeed, this burdensome and unworkable mandate is opposed by the Consumer Bankruptcy Legislative Group, Department of Justice, Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, Judicial Conference, and National Bankruptcy Conference. Bankruptcy judges, creditor and debtor attorneys and other practitioners know this mandate will not work in the real world. 
   The Leahy amendment strikes this section of S. 625 and replaces it with the option that any party in interest may request and get a copy of a debtor's tax return after the bankruptcy filing. 
   Under the Leahy amendment, a creditor, judge or trustee may force a debtor to file copies of tax returns if the facts of the case warrant it by simply asking for the returns. In most cases, a  party in interest will not want to review tax returns if a debtor has no assets or little income. But if a creditor, judge or trustee does want to copies of the tax returns then they simply request it under my amendment and the debtor must furnish past and current tax returns. 
   This is a common sense approach to verifying debtor income and assets when a creditor, judge or trustee wants verification. The current blanket requirement for all debtors to file copies of their tax returns for the past three years will waste millions of taxpayer dollars. 
   Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that it will cost $34 million over the next five years to store and provide access to more than 20 million tax returns. Some experts predict it will take up 20 miles of shelf space to store all these tax returns. 
   The Leahy amendment saves $24 million over the next five years by striking this mandatory tax return filing requirement, according to CBO. 
   There are better ways to verify debtor income and assets that are workable, efficient and save taxpayer dollars. Under current law, U.S. Trustees and private trustees may review a debtor's tax returns if the facts of the case warrant it. 
   In addition, the Leahy amendment permits any party in interest to request a debtor to file copies of his or her past and current tax returns. The party in interest does not have to a hearing or even give a reason for wanting the tax returns. 
   But in the real world, a creditor or trustee will only want to see the tax returns of a debtor in a few cases--cases where there are actual questions about the debtor's assets or income. This targeted approach will save millions of taxpayer dollars and save the courts from filing millions of pages of unnecessary paperwork. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for the Leahy amendment to save U.S. taxpayers $24 million and make this bill far more workable in the real world. 
   Mr. President, I understand we now have eight amendments pending. I note the latest one is a Leahy amendment. I see my distinguished colleague from Alabama on the floor. If somebody else wants to bring up another amendment, I have no objection to mine being set aside so they could do it. I am just trying to get these on the calendar, as the Senator knows and as Senator TORRICELLI and Senator HATCH and others have earlier today. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is today considering S. 1769, which I introduced with Chairman HATCH on October 22, 1999. This bill will continue and enhance the current reporting requirements for the Administrative Office of the Courts and the Attorney General on the eavesdropping and surveillance activities of our federal and state law enforcement agencies. 
   For many years, the Administrative Office (AO) of the Courts has complied with the statutory requirement, in 18 U.S.C.  2519(3), to report to Congress annually the number and nature of federal and state applications for orders authorizing or approving the interception of wire, oral or electronic communications. By letter dated September 3, 1999, the AO advised that it would no longer submit this report because ``as of December 21, 1999, the report will no longer be required pursuant to the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995.'' I commend the AO for alerting Congress that their responsibility for the wiretap reports would lapse at the end of this year, and for doing so in time for Congress to take action. 
   The AO has done an excellent job of preparing the wiretap reports. We need to continue the AO's objective work in a consistent manner. If another agency took over this important task at this juncture and the numbers came out in a different format, it would immediately generate questions and concerns over the legitimacy and accuracy of the contents of that report. 
   In addition, it would create difficulties in comparing statistics from prior years going back to 1969 and complicate the job of congressional oversight. Furthermore, transferring this reporting duty to another agency might create delays in issuance of the report since no other agency has the methodology in place. Finally, federal, state and local agencies are well accustomed to the reporting methodology developed by the AO. Notifying all these agencies that the reporting standards and agency have changed would inevitably create more confusion and more expense as law enforcement agencies across the country are forced to learn a new system and develop a liaison with a new agency. 
   The system in place now has worked well and should be continued. We know how quickly law enforcement may be subjected to criticism over their use of these surreptitious surveillance tools  and we should avoid aggravating these sensitivities by changing the reporting agency. 
   The bill would update the reporting requirements currently in place with one additional reporting requirement. Specifically, the bill would require the wiretap reports prepared beginning in calendar year 2000 to include information on the number of orders in which encryption was encountered and whether such encryption prevented law enforcement from obtaining the plain text of communications intercepted pursuant to such order. 
   Encryption technology is critical to protect sensitive computer and online information. Yet, the same technology poses challenges to law enforcement when it is exploited by criminals to hide evidence or the fruits of criminal activities. A report by the U.S. Working Group on Organized Crime titled, ``Encryption and Evolving Technologies: Tools of Organized Crime and Terrorism,'' released in 1997, collected anecdotal case studies on the use of encryption in furtherance of criminal activities in order to estimate the future impact of encryption on law enforcement. The report noted the need for ``an ongoing study of the effect of encryption and other information technologies on investigations, prosecutions, and intelligence operations''. As part of this study, ``a database of case information from federal and local law enforcement and intelligence agencies should be established and maintained.'' Adding a requirement that reports be furnished on the number of occasions when encryption is encountered by law enforcement is a far more reliable basis than anecdotal evidence on which to assess law enforcement needs and make sensible policy in this area. 
   The final section of this bill would codify the information that the Attorney General already provides on pen register and trap and trace device orders, and require further information on where such orders are issued and the types of facilities--telephone, computer, pager or other device--to which the order relates. Under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (``ECPA'') of 1986, P.L. 99-508, codified at 18 U.S.C. &#167;3126, the Attorney General of the United States is required to report annually to the Congress on the number of pen register orders and orders for trap and trace devices applied for by law enforcement agencies of the Department of Justice. As the original sponsor of ECPA, I believed that adequate oversight of the surveillance activities of federal law enforcement could only be accomplished with reporting requirements such as the one included in this law. 
   The reports furnished by the Attorney General on an annual basis compile information from five components of the Department of Justice: the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the United States Marshals Service and the Office of the Inspector General. The report contains information on the number of original and extension orders made to the courts for authorization to use both pen register and trap and trace devices, information concerning the number of investigations involved, the offenses on which the applications were predicted and the number of people whose telephone facilities were affected. 
   These specific categories of information are useful, and the bill we have introduced would direct the Attorney General to continue providing these specific categories of information. In addition, the bill would direct the Attorney General to include information on the identity, including the district, of the agency making the application and the person authorizing the order. In this way, the Congress and the public will be informed of those jurisdictions using this surveillance technique--information which is currently not included in the Attorney General's annual reports. 
   The requirement for preparation of the wiretap reports will soon lapse so I am delighted to see the Senate take prompt action on this legislation to continue the requirement for submission of the wiretap reports and to update the reporting requirements for both the wiretap reports submitted by the AO and the pen register and trap and trace reports submitted by the Attorney General.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the Conference Report on S. 900, the Financial Modernization Act of 1999. As we prepare to enter the 21st century, it is critical that our laws governing financial services reflect the reality of the current marketplace and establish a sound legal framework that will carry us well into the new millennium. 
   This legislation will repeal the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law that separates the banking, securities, and insurance industries. The Glass-Steagall Act was originally adopted in 1933 to stave off another Great Depression. 
   While it clearly served its purpose back then, the law regulating our financial service industries is now sorely out of date. 
   The face of financial services has changed dramatically in recent years. We are already witnessing a marketplace at work that is producing new services offered by financial institutions of all shapes and sizes. But under current law, the financial firms are often forced to work around existing prohibitions on the coupling of different services, often incurring unnecessary costs to the ultimate detriment of the consumer. 
   Modernizing current law will make the financial services industry more competitive, both at home and abroad. This legislation will make it easier for banking, securities, and insurance firms to consolidate their services, allowing them to cut expenses and offer more products at a lower cost to businesses and consumers. 
   The Treasury Department has estimated that increased competition in the securities, banking, and insurance industry could save consumers as much as $15 billion annually. 
   I want to praise the Clinton Administration and the Senate and House conferees for reaching a fair and equitable compromise regarding the application the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Since the enactment of the CRA in 1977, financial institutions have committed more than one trillion dollars to low and moderate income communities. 
   The continued strength of the CRA means that hundreds of billions of dollars worth of new home mortgage and small business loans will be made in low- and moderate-income urban and rural communities in the next century. 
   The compromise contained in the conference report prevents a bank from moving into a new line of business if it does not have a satisfactory lending record under the CRA, while limiting the frequency of reviews under the CRA for small banks with a satisfactory or excellent record. 
   I am pleased to report that in my home state of Vermont, no banks, large or small, have received less than a satisfactory CRA rating. It is my hope that this legislation will encourage banks in other states to improve their community lending records. Enforcement of the CRA is a win-win situation for banks and neighborhoods across the country. 
   In addition, this legislation allows states to continue to regulate insurance sales by banks and other new financial entities, keeping this authority where it properly belongs. The Vermont Department of Banking, Insurance and Securities has strongly supported its continued oversight of insurance sales by banks and other financial firms in my home state because of the agency's experience and expertise, and I agree. 
   I am also pleased that the conferees did not include the medical privacy language included in the House-passed bill in the conference report. Senators KENNEDY and JEFFORDS joined me in sending a letter on July 20 to the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee requesting that this section be struck in conference. 
   This language had been inserted in the House bill under the guise of providing medical privacy protections, but it would do no such thing. The language actually would have created a laundry list of lawful uses of personally identifiable health information without any consent by the patient. 
   Moreover, the House-passed language would have wiped out the August deadline for Congressional action included in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. I strongly opposed this wrongheaded approach. 
   I still have significant concerns about how this bill may negatively impact the privacy of individuals medical records. However, I believe the recent steps by the Clinton Administration to establish federal regulations governing some medical records of Americans is an important step forward. 
   And I will reaffirm something I have said over, and over again--this Congress must act on its own and pass a comprehensive federal law that will govern all medical records and all those who could have access to them. 
   Mr. President, I must also express my deep disappointment with conference report's financial privacy provisions. Congress has missed an historic opportunity to provide fundamental privacy of every American's personal financial information. 
   Our right of privacy has become one of the most vulnerable rights in the Information Age. We must master new threats to our individual privacy and security, and in particular, to our ability to control the terms under which our personal information is acquired, disclosed and used. 
   But this conference report fails to give consumers the control over their personal financial information that every American deserves. 
   After this conference report becomes law, new conglomerates in the financial services industry will begin offering a widening variety of services, each of which requires a customer to provide financial, medical or other personal information. But nothing in the new law will prevent these new subsidiaries or affiliates of financial conglomerates from sharing this information for uses beyond those the customer thought he or she was providing it for. 
   For example, the conference report has no consumer consent requirements for these new financial subsidiaries or affiliates to sell, share, or publish savings account balances, certificates of  deposit maturity dates and balances, stock and mutual fund purchases and sales, life insurance payouts or health insurance claims. That is wrong. 
   I am an enthusiast when it comes to the Internet and our burgeoning information technologies. These are exciting times, and the digitalization of information and the explosion in the growth of computing and electronic networking offer tremendous potential benefits to the way Americans live, work, conduct commerce, and interact with their government. But we must make sure that information technology remains our servant, instead of becoming our master. 
   Tuesday, I spoke with Treasury Secretary Summers about the need for additional legislation to provide real financial privacy safeguards. In the next session of the 106th Congress, I look forward to working with him and Senator SHELBY, Senator BRYAN, Senator SARBANES and others on the Senate Banking Committee to enact comprehensive legislation to update our laws to provide fundamental privacy protections of the personal financial information of all Americans. 
   The need for financial privacy protection will not go away, and Congress should address it without further delay.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate voted on a modest package of trade bills which included the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act. As a long time supporter of expanding trade opportunities for Vermonters and all Americans, as well as people in developing countries, I reluctantly cast my vote against this bill. 
   Exports are a key component of Vermont's economy. As a small state, we must promote our products beyond the Green Mountains. Vermonters are reaping the benefits of more open markets around the world and these markets are creating new jobs here at home. Not long ago, I led a Vermont trade delegation to Ireland which has one of the fastest growing economies in Europe. 
   Having said that, trade is about more than financial statistics. It is about more than increasing market opportunities for American products, as important and laudable a goal as that is. In our increasingly inter-connected world, trade involves a broad range of issues and concerns. As the wealthiest nation, we also have a responsibility to do what we can to ensure that the benefits of the global economy are enjoyed by people from every walk of life, here and abroad. And when we vote, we have a responsibility to ensure that legislation entitled the ``African Growth and Opportunity Act'', actually benefits African workers and protects their families' health and welfare, and the natural environment. The bill that was passed yesterday will not do that. 
   I have felt for some time that our relationship with Africa needs to change. It cannot continue to be based almost exclusively on aid, when the real engine of development, as we have seen  elsewhere in the world, is investment and trade. However, in developing a trade policy toward Africa--where poverty is deeply rooted and protections for the environment and the rights of workers are virtually non-existent--precautions must be taken to ensure that it is a sound policy that responds to Africa's unique and urgent needs. 
   It used to be that workers' rights and environmental concerns were treated separately from trade considerations, or not at all. Fortunately, that has begun to change. One of the reasons I voted for NAFTA was because it contained side agreements on labor and environmental issues. 
   However, while those agreements were a step forward, time has shown that they did not go far enough. Unfortunately, even the modest labor and environmental agreements that we fought hard to include in NAFTA were not included in the African Growth and Opportunity Act and virtually every amendment to add similar provisions was defeated. Such a step backward makes absolutely no sense. 
   The African Growth and Opportunity Act's provision on workers' rights, which has been included in other trade legislation, has routinely allowed countries notorious for abuses to escape without penalty. Unions have rightly criticized this provision for being vague and 
   unenforceable. It is an invitation for exploitation of cheap African labor. 
   The African Growth and Opportunity Act does not include a single provision related to environmental concerns. Multinational corporations, especially mining and timber companies, have a long history of taking advantage of Africa's weak environmental laws and contributing to pollution, deforestation and the uprooting of people. If barriers to foreign investment are lowered or eliminated--as the Act calls for--and meaningful, enforceable environmental protections are not put in place, these problems will only get worse. 
   Like the NAFTA debate, however, the rhetoric on both sides of this issue was overblown. The African Growth and Opportunity Act is not, as some of its supporters claimed, an historic step toward integrating Africa into the global economy. At best, this Act will have a modest impact. It simply offers limited market access to African countries under the Generalized System of Preferences and establishes a U.S.-African trade and economic forum. 
   On the other hand, the African Growth and Opportunity Act will not, as some of its opponents claimed, force African countries to cut spending on education and health care, and to adhere to stringent International Monetary Fund conditions. It rewards African countries that are taking steps toward economic and political reforms, as most African countries are already doing, but it does not force them to do anything. 
   In all my time in the Senate, this is the first attempt that has been made to redefine our relationship with Africa from one of dependency to one which begins to promotes economic growth and self-reliance. This is long overdue, and the opportunity to address these issues is not likely to come again soon. I had hoped that when the African Growth and Opportunity Act reached the floor it would have provided for expanded export opportunities for both Africans and Americans while protecting African workers and the environment. 
   Many of my concerns about the African Growth and Opportunity Act, also hold true for the Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act. I fully support efforts to expand U.S. trade with Caribbean Basin countries and to provide these countries with trade benefits that will help them compete in the global economy. However, again, it is vitally important that the trade benefits included in this Act actually benefit those who often need them the most--workers and their families. Virtually every amendment that would have required Caribbean companies to institute fair and enforceable labor standards before they could be eligible for trade benefits under the Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act was defeated, and crucial protections were therefore not included. 
   Mr. President, it is disappointing that given the opportunity to simultaneously redefine our relationship with Africa, re-examine our trade policy toward the Caribbean Basin and expand international economic opportunities for Americans, that the approach and the outcome was so flawed.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr President, I am delighted that the Senate is considering S. 1754, the ``Denying Safe Haven to International and War Criminals Act of 1999,'' along with a technical amendment that strikes several provisions in the bill reported by the Judiciary Committee that would have had the effect of altering the applicability of current law in certain instances. Senator HATCH and I introduced this bill on October 20, 1999, with a number of provisions that I have long supported. The legislation will give United States law enforcement agencies important tools to help them combat international crime by facilitating international cooperation in the prosecution of criminal cases and ensuring that human rights abusers are denied safe haven in this country. 
   Unfortunately, crime and terrorism directed at Americans and American interests abroad are part of our modern reality. Furthermore, organized criminal activity does not recognize national boundaries. With improvements in technology, criminals now can move about the world with ease. They can transfer funds with the push of a button, or use computers and credit card numbers to steal from American citizens and businesses from any spot on the globe. They can commit crimes here or abroad and flee quickly to another jurisdiction or country. The playing field keeps changing, and we need to change with it. 
   This bill will help make needed modifications in our laws, not with sweeping changes but with thoughtful provisions carefully targeted at specific problems faced by law enforcement. We cannot stop international crime without international cooperation, and this bill gives additional tools to investigators and prosecutors to promote such cooperation, while narrowing the room for maneuver that international criminals, including human rights abusers, and terrorists now enjoy. 
   Regarding the Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act (Title III), this bill contains as its last title the ``Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act,'' which I introduced as S. 1375, on July 15, 1999, with Senator KOHL. Senator LIEBERMAN is also a cosponsor. This legislation has garnered bipartisan support both in the Senate and the House, where the measure has been introduced by Representatives FOLEY, FRANKS and ACKERMAN     
   I have been appalled that this country has become a safe haven for those who exercised power in foreign countries to terrorize, rape, and torture innocent civilians. For example, three Ethiopian refugees proved in an American court that Kelbessa Negewo, a  former senior government official in Ethiopia engaged in numerous acts of torture and human rights abuses against them in the late 1970's when they lived in that country. The court's descriptions of the abuse are chilling, and included whipping a naked woman with a wire for hours and threatening her with death in the presence of several men. The court's award of compensatory and punitive damages in the amount of $1,500,000 to the plaintiffs was subsequently affirmed by an appellate court. See Abebe-Jira v. Negewo, 72 F.3d 844 (11th Cir. 1996). Yet, while Negewo's case was on appeal, the Immigration and Naturalization Service granted him citizenship. 
   As Professor William Aceves of California Western School of Law has noted, this case reveals ``a glaring and troubling limitation in current immigration law and practice. This case is not unique. Other aliens who have committed gross human rights violations have also gained entry into the United States and been granted immigration relief.'' The Rutland Herald got it right when it opined on October 31, 1999, that:  
   For the U.S. commitment to human rights to mean anything, U.S. policies must be strong and consistent. It is not enough to denounce war crimes in Bosnia and Kosovo or elsewhere and then wink as the perpetrators of torture and mass murder slip across the border to find a home in America.  
   The Immigration and Nationality Act currently provides that (i) participants in Nazi persecutions during the time period from March 23, 1933 to May 8, 1945, and (ii) aliens who engaged in genocide, are inadmissible to the United States and deportable. See 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(E)(i) and 1227(a)(4)(D). This legislation would amend these sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act by expanding the grounds for inadmissibility and deportation to cover aliens who have engaged in acts of torture abroad. 
   ``Torture'' is already defined in the Federal criminal code, 18 U.S.C.  2340, in a law passed as part of the implementing legislation for the ``Convention Against Torture,'' under which the United States has an affirmative duty to prosecute torturers within its boundaries regardless of their respective nationalities. 18 U.S.C.  2340A (1994). As defined in the federal criminal code, torture means any act committed by a person acting under the color of law specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering upon another person within his custody or physical control. This could include prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from the infliction or threat to inflict physical pain, threats to kill another person, or the administration of mind-altering substances or procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or personality of another person. Under this definition, torturers include both those who issue the orders to torture innocent people as well as those who implement those orders. 
   The legislation would also amend the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.  1103, by directing the Attorney General to establish an Office of Special Investigations (OSI) within the Department of Justice with authorization to investigate, remove, denaturalize, or prosecute any alien who has participated in torture or genocide abroad. Attorney General Civiletti established OSI in 1979 within the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice, consolidating within it all ``investigative and litigation activities involving individuals, who prior to and during World War II, under the supervision of or in association with the Nazi government of Germany, its allies, and other affiliated [sic] governments, are alleged to have ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person because of race, religion, national origin, or political opinion.'' (Attorney Gen. Order No. 851-79). The OSI's mission continues to be limited by that Attorney General Order. 
   The legislation would provide statutory authorization for Office of Special Investigation, and would expand its jurisdiction to authorize investigations, prosecutions, and removal of any alien who participated in torture and genocide abroad--not just Nazis. The success of OSI in hunting 
   Nazi war criminals demonstrates the effectiveness of centralized resources and expertise in these cases. OSI has worked, and it is time to update its mission. The knowledge of the people, politics and pathologies of particular regimes engaged in genocide and human rights abuses is often necessary for effective prosecutions of these cases and may best be accomplished by the concentrated efforts of a single office, rather than in piecemeal litigation around the country or in offices that have more diverse missions. 
   I appreciate that this part of the legislation has proven controversial within the Department of Justice, but others have concurred in my judgment that the OSI is an appropriate component of the Department to address the new responsibilities proposed in the bill. Professor Aceves, who has studied these matters extensively, has concluded that OSI's ``methodology for pursuing Nazi war criminals can be applied with equal rigor to other perpetrators of human rights violations. As the number of Nazi war criminals inevitably declines, the OSI can begin to enforce U.S. immigration laws against perpetrators of genocide and other gross violations of human rights.'' 
   Similarly, the Rutland Herald recently noted that the INS has never deported an immigrant on the basis of human rights abuses, while the OSI has deported 48 ex-Nazis and stripped 61 of U.S. citizenship, while maintaining a list of 60,000 suspected war criminals with the aim of barring them from entry. Based on this record, the Rutland Herald concluded that the legislation correctly looks to OSI to carry out the additional responsibilities called for in the bill, noting that:  
   It resolves a turf war between the INS and the OSI in favor of the OSI, which is as it should be. The victims of human rights abuses are often victimized again when, seeking refuge in the United States, they are confronted by the draconian policies of the INS. It's a better idea to give the job of finding war criminals to the office that has shown it knows how to do the job.  
   Unquestionably, the need to bring Nazi war criminals to justice remains a matter of great importance. Funds would not be diverted from the OSI's current mission. Additional resources are authorized in the bill for OSI's expanded duties. I would like to recognize the reporting of Boston Globe reporter Steve Fainaru, whose ground-breaking series has illuminated the need for a more focused response to this problem. 
   Regarding the sections Denying Safe Haven to International Criminals and Promoting Global Cooperation (Title I and II), I initially introduced title I, section 102 of this bill, regarding fugitive disentitlement, on April 30, 1998, in S. 2011, the ``Money Laundering Enforcement and Combating Drugs in Prisons Act of 1998,'' with Senators DASCHLE, KOHL, FEINSTEIN and CLELAND. Again, on July 14, 1998, I introduced with Senator BIDEN, on behalf of the Administration, S. 2303, the ``International Crime Control Act of 1998,'' which contains most of the provisions set forth in titles I and II of this bill. Virtually all of the provisions in these two titles of the bill were also included in another major anti-crime bill, S. 2484, the ``Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998,'' which I introduced on September 16, 1998, along with Senators DASCHLE, BIDEN, Moseley-Braun, KENNEDY, KERRY, LAUTENBERG, MIKULSKI, BINGAMAN, REID, MURRAY, DORGAN, and TORRICELLI. In addition, Senator HATCH and I included title II, section 201 of this bill, regarding streamlined procedures for MLAT requests in S. 2536, our ``International Crime and Anti-Terrorism Amendments of 1998,'' which passed the Senate last October 15, 1998. 
   We have drawn from these more comprehensive bills a set of discrete improvements that enjoy bipartisan support so that important provisions may be enacted promptly. Each of these provisions has been a law enforcement priority. 
   Title I sets forth important proposals for combating international crime and denying safe havens to international criminals. The substitute amendment adopted by the Judiciary Committee to the original bill removed sections 1 and 2, which set forth detailed procedures and safeguards for proceeding with extradition for offenses not covered in a treaty. 
   Section 101 of the bill considered by the Senate today would add a new section 4116 to title 18, United States Code, authorizing the Attorney General to request the temporary transfer to the United States of a person, who is in pretrial detention or custody in a  foreign country, to face prosecution, if the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, determines that such transfer would be consistent with the international obligations of the United States. The section would also authorize the Attorney General to transfer temporarily to a foreign country a person, who is in pretrial detention or custody in the United States and found extraditable to the foreign country, to face prosecution in the foreign country, if the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, determines that such transfer would be consistent with the international obligations of the United States. Consent of state authorities would be required for persons in state custody. 
   Section 102 is designed to stop drug kingpins, terrorists and other international fugitives from using our courts to fight to keep the proceeds of the very crimes for which they are wanted. Criminals should not be able to use our courts at the same time they are evading our laws. Specifically, this section adds a new section 2466 to title 28, United States Code, that would bar a person, who purposely leaves the United States or declines to submit to or otherwise evades U.S. jurisdiction where a criminal case is pending against the person, from participating as a party in a civil action over a related civil or criminal forfeiture claim. The Supreme Court recently decided that a previous judge-made rule to the same effect required a statutory basis. This section provides that basis. 
   Section 103 would amend section 4100(b) of title 18, United States Code, to permit transfer, on a case-by-case basis, of prisoners to their home country to serve their sentences, where such transfer is provided by treaty. Under this section, the prisoner need not consent to the transfer. 
   Section 104 would add a new section 4087 to title 18, United States Code, that would provide a statutory basis for holding and transferring prisoners who are sent from one foreign country to another through United States airports, at the discretion of the Attorney General. 
   Title II of the bill is designed to promote global cooperation in the fight against international crime. Section 201 would permit United States courts involved in multi-district litigation to enforce mutual legal assistance treaties and other agreements to execute foreign requests for assistance in criminal matters in all districts involved in the litigation. Specifically, this provision would add a new section 1785 to title 18, United States Code, that would authorize the Attorney General to present requests from foreign governments for assistance in criminal cases pursuant to mutual legal assistance treaties and other agreements when the enforcement involves multiple districts. Compulsory measures may be used to require persons to produce testimony or evidence where they reside or the evidence is located, or the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. A person ordered to produce testimony or evidence outside the jurisdiction of residence may petition to appear in the district where the person resides. 
   Section 202 outlines procedures for the temporary transfer of incarcerated witnesses. Mutual legal assistance treaties (``MLATS'') generally already provide a mechanism for the United States to send and receive persons in custody who are needed as witnesses, either in our courts or foreign courts for criminal cases. These witnesses are often cooperating to obtain a lighter sentence. Section 3508 of title 18, United States Code, enacted in 1988, already provides the authority, absent such a MLAT, for the Attorney General to request foreign witnesses, who are in custody, to come to the United States to testify in criminal cases here, and to assure their expeditious return to the foreign country. The bill would amend section 3508 to permit the Attorney General, as a matter of comity and reciprocity, to send United States prisoners abroad to testify, according to the terms and conditions of the MLAT. If there is no MLAT, the Attorney General may only send a United States prisoner abroad to testify with the prisoner's consent and, where applicable, the State holding the prisoner. Decisions of the Attorney General respecting such transfers are to be made in conjunction with the Secretary of State. 
   These are important provisions that I have advocated for some time. They are helpful, solid law enforcement provisions. I thank my friend from Utah, Senator HATCH, for his help in making this bill a reality. Working together, we were able to pass bipartisan legislation that will accomplish what all of us want, a safer and more secure America.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the singular most important issues facing us today is education. Affordable higher education is an opportunity that must be made available to all of our young people. To that end, public and private scholarships, grants and loans have long assisted our nation's students in pursuing college degrees. 
   Phony scholarship offerings, scams and frauds do great harm to our nation's students. No student seeking to attend a college or university should have to worry about whether a scholarship offering is legitimate or wonder whether the business to which he or she has mailed an application fee actually exists. I am glad to join in the effort of Senators ABRAHAM and FEINGOLD to add to the arsenal of our current laws to combat these types of frauds. 
   I commented at a Judiciary Committee hearing on this bill earlier this month that the goals of this legislation are laudable. We need to do more to combat scholarship scams and promote the dissemination of information about legitimate sources of higher education funding. Nevertheless, I raised questions about whether the original bill reflected the most effective way to pursue the goals we all share. I am pleased to join as a cosponsor of the substitute amendment that addresses the concerns I raised. 
   For instance, the original bill proposed raising the long-standing statutory maximum punishment of five years for mail and wire fraud to ten years in cases of scholarship scams. In light of the fact that scholarship scams often involve more than one victim and may result in multiple charges, raising the statutory penalties may not be necessary to effectuate punishment goals. I suggested that a more appropriate and effective solution to ensure adequate punishment may be to direct the Sentencing Commission to consider a guideline enhancement for cases involving fraudulent scholarship offerings. The substitute amendment makes this change and directs the Sentencing Commission to amend the sentencing guidelines to provide enhanced penalties for any offenses involving scholarship scams such that those penalties are comparable to the base offense level for misrepresentation that the defendant was acting on behalf of a charitable, educational, religious, or political organization, or a government agency. In effect, this amendment directs the Sentencing Commission to increase the guideline offense levels by 2 levels. 
   The substitute amendment is an improvement since it avoids complicating the wire and mail fraud statutes with different penalties depending on the nature of the underlying fraud. 
   The substitute amendment directs the Attorney General and the Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Federal Trade Commission to report to Congress on the nature and quantity of incidents of scholarship scams. This report will assist the Judiciary Committee in monitoring whether additional legislative steps are needed in this area. 
   The substitute amendment makes important improvements in the original bill, and I urge the Congress to pass this legislation promptly.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this morning I voted against the Conference Report for the Labor-HHS-Education-DC Appropriations bill. I am extremely disappointed with the budgetary stalemate that this Congress seems to have reached. This Congress is yet to do much work that we should be proud of and more than a month into the new fiscal year, we have failed to even complete our appropriations work. 
   I want to mention just a few of the problems I had with this Conference Report. First, this Report made significant reductions to essential programs funded through the Education Department. For example, the proposal before us provided no funding for a class size reduction program that this Congress supported just last year. Vermont is a state that generally enjoys small class sizes for our students. But even Vermont, a rural state with fairly small student to teacher ratios benefits, from the President's visionary program to put more teachers into our class rooms. 
   Second, this Conference Report made unacceptable cuts to programs funded through the Department of Health and Human Services. For example, this bill cuts $44 million in requests from the Centers for Disease Control to immunize over 333,000 children against childhood diseases. 
   In addition to these programmatic cuts, the Conference Report contained  budget gimmicks including the use of the Social Security Trust Fund and an across the board cut in spending that reflects Congress' inability to budget responsibly. I understand the President made it very clear that he will veto this Report when it gets to his desk. In spite of this knowledge, my colleagues on the other side felt it was a productive use of our time to none the less move forward with an unacceptable bill, rather than attempt to negotiate and reach a compromise. 
   The conference report included a .97 percent across the board, government-wide cut in all discretionary programs. This included the funding for programs such as education and crime prevention--two essential programs for ensuring the safety of our youth. The Office of Management and Budget has estimated some of the effects of this type of across the board cut. For example, approximately 71,000 fewer women, infants, and children would benefit from the important Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, also known as the WIC program. An across the board cut of this nature would also mean 1.3 million fewer Meals on Wheels will be delivered to the elderly. 
   Americans have witnessed over the past several weeks an enormous amount of finger pointing from both sides of the aisle about who's using the Social Security surplus and who's not. I don't think there's much to dispute. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, even with the so-called across the board cuts, the Republican proposed spending plan will still mean taking $17 billion from the Social Security Trust Fund. 
   Let's step back and look at the message that we have sent to Americans by agreeing to this Conference Report and sending it to the President. We have made a statement that we are not interested in placing our students into smaller class sizes even though research has shown they will learn faster with less discipline problems and will have higher high school graduation rates. We have said that we are not interested in ensuring the health of our children by providing immunizations that are known to prevent severe illness and even death form numerous childhood diseases. Finally, we have said that we are not concerned about the nutrition of our women and children nor are we interested in the nutrition of our homebound elderly. 
   What kind of priorities does this Congress have? Looking at this Conference Report and at our work over the past few months, it's hard for me to tell. We have failed on many fronts to do the work the people of this country have sent us here to do. We haven't passed a comprehensive Patients' Bill of Rights. We have not passed responsible gun control legislation. Just last week we were reminded that we have failed to pass comprehensive medical privacy legislation, leaving the Administration to do our work for us. And now, we can't even do one of our most important jobs--appropriating responsibly. 
   Mr. President, the Labor-HHS-Education-DC Appropriations Conference Report that this Senate passed this morning is just another example of where this Congress has failed. I look forward to the day when we can return to a time when we act responsibly and do the work the American people expect of us.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to stand up for a small business in my home state--the Rutland Fire Clay Company of Rutland, VT. 
   For the past week, a coalition of 240 special interest organizations have run a series of the same paid advertisements in such Washington-based publications as Roll Call and National Journal's Congress Daily AM . The targets of these interest groups in this expensive ad campaign are, of course, the members of this body and of the House of Representatives. The advertisement uses the recent bankruptcy reorganization filing of the Rutland Fire Clay Company to promote the Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act, S. 758 and H.R. 1283. 
   Mr. President, here is a copy of this ad. The headline is: ``How asbestos litigation ruined a family business.'' Then in the body of the advertisement is this pullout headline: ``Rutland Fire Clay Files For Chap. 11.'' Throughout the ad is the history of this 116-year-old Vermont firm as reported in the Rutland Herald on October 19, 1999.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am offended by this slick advertisement. It is clear that the executives on Madison Avenue who crafted this ad want lawmakers--you, me, and all of our colleagues--to believe that the employees of the Rutland Fire Clay Company support the Fairness in Asbestos Compensation Act and that this bill would have helped the Vermont firm avoid reorganization in bankruptcy. Nothing is further from the truth. 
   Thomas Martin, who is the President of the Rutland Fire Clay Company, and who is named in the advertisement, has written to me to set the record straight. Mr. Martin writes: ``I reviewed the bill and my opinion is it would not help Rutland Fire Clay Company reduce this [asbestos litigation] burden, nor would it help other small businesses with thousands of claims. ..... Under S. 758 costs would be apportioned to Rutland Fire Clay Company equally, and thus higher, than under the current system.'' 
   Mr. Martin continues: ``The advertisement's heading gave the impression that our family business would be `ruined' and that our 22 employees would be out of work. The truth is that we have worked out a consensual bankruptcy plan which recognizes the value of Rutland Fire Clay Company and its employees. No jobs will be lost and we will continue to serve the fireplace and home repair markets as we have for 116 years.'' 
   Finally, Mr. Martin notes: ``our firm in no way assisted in preparation of the CAR advertisement nor did we have any knowledge of it until your office sent me a copy.''

   Mr. LEAHY. I have met with Tom Martin of the Rutland Fire Clay Company and corresponded with him about asbestos litigation. Mr. Martin should be commended for reaching a settlement with his insurers and the trial bar concerning his firm's asbestos problems. Unlike some big businesses that are trying to avoid any accountability for their asbestos responsibilities through national legislation, Mr. Martin and the Rutland Fire Clay Company are trying to do the right thing within the legal system. 
   Mr. Martin plans to lead the Rutland Fire Clay Company from bankruptcy next year as a stronger firm with a solid financial foundation for the 21st Century. I applaud Tom Martin and the employees of the Rutland Fire Clay Company for their efforts. 
   Mr. President, I am willing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and with interested parties to craft fair legislation to help victims and businesses, large and small, affected by asbestos. But exploiting the bankruptcy filing of a small firm in Vermont and using misleading advertisements to promote a flawed bill are not the right ways to advance our consideration of this issue, and they are certainly not an admirable way to attempt to sway opinion in or outside of this body. 
   I believe the 240 special interest organizations that sponsored this advertisement owe an apology to Tom Martin and the other Vermonters who work for the Rutland Fire Clay Company, and I will remind them of that obligation until they offer that apology.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Majority Leader for the proposal he made to the Senate last night on moving a portion of the Executive Calendar. I would like to see those nominees he mentioned confirmed as well as the others on the calendar. I want to work with him to have them all considered and confirmed. I want to be sure that the Senate treats them all fairly and accords each of them an opportunity for an up or down vote. I want to share with you a few of the cases that cry out for a Senate vote: 
   The first is Judge Richard Paez. He is a judicial nominee who has been awaiting consideration and confirmation by the Senate since January 1996--for over 3 1/2 years. The vacancy for which Judge Paez was nominated became a judicial emergency during the time his nomination has been pending without action by the Senate. His nomination was first received by the Senate almost 45 months ago and is still without a Senate vote. That is unconscionable. 
   Judge Paez has twice been reported favorably by the Senate Judiciary Committee to the Senate for final action. He is again on the Senate calendar. He was delayed 25 months before finally being accorded a confirmation hearing in February 1998. After being reported by the Judiciary Committee initially in March 1998, his nomination was held on the Senate Executive Calendar without action or explanation for over 7 months, for the remainder of the last Congress. 
   Judge Paez was renominated by the President again this year and his nomination was stalled without action before the Judiciary Committee until late July, when the Committee reported his nomination to the Senate for the second time. The Senate refused to consider the nomination before the August recess. I have repeatedly urged the Republican leadership to call this nomination up for consideration and a vote. The Republican leadership in the Senate has refused to schedule this nomination for an up or down vote. 
   Judge Paez has the strong support of both California Senators and a `well-qualified' rating from the American Bar Association. He has served as a municipal judge for 13 years and as a federal judge for four years. 
   In my view Judge Paez should be commended for the years he worked to  provide legal services and access to our justice system for those without the financial resources otherwise to retain counsel. His work with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, the Western Center on Law and Poverty and California Rural Legal Assistance for 9 years should be a source of praise and pride. 
   Judge Paez has had the strong support of California judges and law enforcement representatives familiar with his work, such as Justice H. Walter Crosky, and support from an impressive array of law enforcement officials, including Gil Garcetti, the Los Angeles District Attorney; the late Sherman Block, then Los Angeles County Sheriff; the Los Angeles County Police Chiefs' Association; and the Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs. 
   I have previously commended the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his support of this nominee and Senator BOXER and Senator FEINSTEIN of California for their efforts on his behalf. In the Senate's vote earlier this month on the nomination of Justice Ronnie White, Republican Senators justified their vote by deferring to home state Senators and local law enforcement. When it comes to Judge Paez, he has the strong support of both home state Senators and local law enforcement. Accordingly, I would hope and expect that the Senate will see a strong Republican vote for Judge Paez. 
   The Hispanic National Bar Association, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, and many, many others have been seeking a vote on this nomination for what now amounts to years. 
   Last year the words of the Chief Justice of the United States were ringing in our ears with respect to the delays in Senate consideration of judicial nomination. He had written:  
   Some current nominees have been waiting considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote....... The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.  
   Richard Paez's nomination to the Ninth Circuit had already been pending for 24 months when the Chief Justice issued that statement--and that was almost 2 years ago. The Chief Justice's words resound in connection with the nomination of Judge Paez. He has twice been reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee. It was been pending for 45 months. The court to which he was nominated has multiple vacancies. In fairness to Judge Paez and all the people served by the Ninth Circuit, the Senate should vote on this nomination. 
   I have been concerned for the last several years that it seems women and minority nominees are being delayed and not considered. I spoke to the Senate about this situation on May 22, June 22 and, again, on October 8 last year, and a number of times this year, including on October 15 and October 21. Over the last couple of years the Senate has failed to act on the nominations of Judge James A. Beaty, Jr. to be the first African-American judge on the Fourth Circuit; Jorge C. Rangel to the Fifth Circuit; Clarence J. Sundram to the District Court for the Northern District of New York; Anabelle Rodriguez to the District Court in Puerto Rico; and many others. 
   In explaining why he chose to withdraw from consideration for renomination after waiting 15 months for Senate action, Jorge Rangel wrote to the President and explained:  
   Our judicial system depends on men and women of good will who agree to serve when asked to do so. But public service asks too much when those of us who answer the call to service are subjected to a confirmation process dominated by interminable delays and inaction. Patience has its virtues, but it also has its limits.  
   Last year the average for all nominees confirmed was over 230 days and 11 nominees confirmed last year took longer than 9 months: Judge William Fletcher's confirmation took 41 months--it became the longest-pending judicial nomination in the history of the United States, a record now held by Judge Paez; Judge Hilda Tagle's confirmation took 32 months, Judge Susan Oki Mollway's confirmation took 30 months, Judge Ann Aiken's confirmation took 26 months, Judge Margaret McKeown's confirmation took 24 months, Judge Margaret Morrow's confirmation took 21 months, Judge Sonia Sotomayor's confirmation took 15 months, Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer's confirmation took 14 months, Judge Ivan Lemelle's confirmation took 14 months, Judge Dan Polster's confirmation took 12 months, and Judge Victoria Roberts' confirmation took 11 months. Of these 11, 8 are women or minority nominees. Another was Professor Fletcher who was held up, in large measure because of opposition to his mother, Judge Betty Fletcher. 
   In 1997, of the 36 nominations eventually confirmed, 9, fully one-quarter of all those confirmed, took more than 9 months before a final favorable Senate vote. 
   In 1996, the Republican Senate shattered the previous record for the average number of days from nomination to confirmation for judicial confirmation. The average rose to a record 183 days. In 1997, the average number of days from nomination to confirmation rose dramatically yet again, and that was during the first year of a presidential term. From initial nomination to confirmation, the average time it took for Senate action on the 36 judges confirmed in 1997 broke the 200-day barrier for the first time in our history. It was 212 days. 
   Unfortunately, that time grew again last year to the detriment of the administration of justice. Last year the Senate broke its dismal record. The average time from nomination to confirmation for the 65 judges confirmed in 1998 was over 230 days. The independent and bipartisan study of Task Force on Judicial Selection formed by Citizens for Independent Courts recently confirmed what I have been observing for the past few years--the time to consider judicial nominations has been increased significantly over the last few years and women and minority judicial nominees are more likely to take significantly longer to be considered, if they are considered at all. 
   We have had too many cases in which it has taken women nominees years before the Judiciary Committee would act and the Senate would vote. Eventually, we have been able to confirm many of these outstanding nominees, people like Margaret Morrow, Sonia Sotomayor, Ann Aiken, Margaret McKeown and Susan Oki Mollway. The current victim of the extensive delays caused by unusually intensive scrutiny of many women judicial nominees is Marsha Berzon. 
   Marsha Berzon is one of the most qualified nominees I have seen in 25 years, and Senator HATCH has agreed with that assessment publically. He voted for her in the Judiciary Committee. Her legal skills are outstanding, her practice and productivity have been extraordinary. Lawyers against whom she has litigated regard her as highly qualified for the bench. She was first 
   nominated in January 1998, some 20 months ago. Her nomination remains the subject of ``secret holds'' from anonymous Senate Republicans. 
   Senator FEINSTEIN has made the point that it may be subtle forms of disparate treatment and double standards to which these nominations are subjected. She has lectured the Committee and the Senate from time to time on our insensitivity to the experiences of these nominees. Women still do not have the good old boy network of some nominees and often show leadership and get experience by being involved in community activities and with charities and with organizations that some conservative Republicans apparently view negatively and with suspicion. 
   Marsha Berzon is an outstanding nominee. By all accounts, she is an exceptional lawyer with extensive appellate experience, including a number of cases heard by the Supreme Court. She has the strong support of both California Senators and a well-qualified rating from the American Bar Association. 
   She was initially nominated in January 1998, 21 months ago. She participated in an extensive two-part confirmation hearing before the Committee back on July 30, 1998. Thereafter she received a number of sets of written questions from a number of Senators and responded in August of last year. A second round of written  questions was sent and she responded by the middle of September of last year. Despite the efforts of Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator KENNEDY, Senator SPECTER and myself to have her considered by the Committee, she was not included on an agenda and not voted on during all of 1998. Her nomination was returned to the President without action by this Committee or the Senate last October. 
   This year the President renominated Ms. Berzon in January. She participated in her second confirmation hearing in June, was sent additional sets of written questions, responded and got and answered another round. I do not know why those questions were not asked last year. 
   Finally, on July 1 almost 4 months ago, the Committee considered the nomination and agreed to report it to the Senate favorably. After more than a year and one-half the Senate should, at long last, vote on the nomination. Senators who find some reason to oppose this exceptionally qualified woman lawyer can vote against her if they choose, but she should be accorded an up or down vote. That is what I have been asking for and that is what fairness demands. 
   Senator HATCH was right 2 years ago when he called for an end to the political game that has infected the confirmation process. These are real people whose lives are affected. Judge Richard Paez has been waiting patiently for 45 months, almost 4 years, for the Republican Senate to vote on his nomination, a nomination that Senator HATCH voted for twice. Marsha Berzon has been held hostage for 21 months not knowing what to make of her private practice or when the Senate will deem it appropriate to finally vote on her nomination. 
   Last week I received a Resolution from the National Association of Women Judges. I hope that the Senate will respond to Resolution, in which the NAWJ urges expeditious action on nominations to federal judicial vacancies. The President of the Women Judges, Judge Mary Schroeder, is right when she cautions that ``few first-rate potential nominees will be willing to endure such a tortured process'' and the country will pay a high price for driving away outstanding candidates to fill these important positions. The Resolution notes the scores of continuing vacancies with highly qualified women and men nominees and the nonpartisan study of delays in the confirmation process, and even more extensive delays for women nominees, found by the Task Force on Judicial Selection formed by Citizens for Independent Courts. The Resolution notes that such delay ``is costly and unfair to litigants and the individual nominees and their families whose lives and career are on hold for the duration of the protracted process.'' In conclusion, the National Association of Women Judges ``urges the Senate of the United States to bring the pending nominations for the federal judiciary to an expeditious vote so that those who have been nominated can get on with their lives and these vacancies can be filled.'' 
   Although this is not just about numbers, the numbers are damning. So far this year the Senate has received 70 judicial nominations and confirmed only 25. By this time last year, the Senate had confirmed 66 judges--more than twice as many. By this time in 1992, the last year of President Bush's term, a Democratic Senate had confirmed 64 judges. By this time in 1994, a Democratic Senate had confirmed over 100 judges. 
   There are judicial emergencies vacancies all over the country. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has had to declare that entire Circuit in an emergency. Its workload has gone up 65 percent in the last 9 years; but they are being forced to operate with almost one-quarter of their bench vacant. The Senate has not given any attention to the two nominees pending in Committee--either Enrique Moreno or Alston Johnson. 
   We had a similar emergency a year or so ago in the Second Circuit. We finally ended that crisis when we fought through secret Republican holds and got the Senate after 15 months to vote on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor. She was confirmed overwhelmingly. 
   At the time I was struck by an article by Paul Gigot in the Wall Street Journal, which explained why Judge Sotomayor was being held up--it was not because she was not qualified to serve on the Second Circuit but because some felt that she was so well qualified President Clinton might nominate her to the United States Supreme Court if a vacancy were to arise. Imagine that, anonymous holds to ensure that a superbly talented Hispanic woman judge not be seen as a good bet to nominate to the Supreme Court. I fear that the opposition to Marsha Berzon may partake of some of this kind of thinking. She is so well qualified, so clearly likely to be an outstanding judge on the Ninth Circuit, that perhaps some anonymous Republican Senators are afraid that she will be too good, that her opinions will be too well reasoned that her application of the law will be too sound. 
   Weeks ago the Majority Leader came to the floor and said that he would try to find a way to have the Paez and Berzon nominations considered by the Senate. I have tried to work with Majority Leader on all of these nominations. I would like to work with those Senators whom the Majority Leader is protecting from having to vote on the Paez and Berzon nominations, but I do not know who they are. Despite the policy announced at the beginning of this year doing away with ``secret holds,'' that is what Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon still confront as their nominations continue to be obstructed under a cloak of anonymity after 45 months and 21 months, respectively. That is wrong and unfair. 
   This continuing delay demeans the Senate, itself. I have great respect for this institution and its traditions. Still, I must say that this use of secret holds for extended periods that doom a nomination from ever being considered by the United States Senate is wrong and unfair and beneath us. Who is it that is afraid to vote on these nominations? Who is it that is hiding their opposition and obstruction of these nominees? After almost 4 years with respect to Judge Paez and almost 2 years with respect to Marsha Berzon, it is time for the Senate to vote up-or-down on these nominations. 
   The Senate should be fair and vote on these nominations. Anonymous Republican Senators are being unfair to the judicial nominees on the calendar. These qualified nominees are entitled to an up or down vote, too. 
   The Atlanta Constitution noted recently:  
   Two U.S. appellate court nominees, Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, both of California, have been on hold for four years and 20 months respectively. When Democrats tried.......to get their colleagues to vote on the pair at long last, the Republicans scuttled the maneuver....... This partisan stalling, this refusal to vote up or down on nominees, is unconscionable. It is not fair. It is not right. It is no way to run the federal judiciary....... This ideological obstructionism is so fierce that it strains our justice system and sets a terrible partisan example for years to come.  
   It is against this backdrop that I, again, ask the Senate to be fair to these judicial nominees and all nominees. For the last few years the Senate has allowed one or two or three secret holds to stop judicial nominations from even getting a vote. That is wrong. 
   The Washington Post has noted:  
   [T]he Constitution does not make the Senate's role in the confirmation process optional, and the Senate ends up abdicating responsibility when the majority leader denies nominees a timely vote. All the nominees awaiting floor votes.......should receive them immediately.  
   The Florida Sun-Sentinel has written:  
   The ``Big Stall'' in the U.S. Senate continues, as senators work slower and slower each year in confirming badly needed federal judges....... This worsening process is inexcusable, bordering on malfeasance in office, especially given the urgent need to fill vacancies on a badly undermanned federal bench....... The stalling, in many cases, is nothing more than a partisan political dirty trick.  
   Nominees deserve to be treated with dignity and dispatch--not delayed for 2 and 3 and 4 years. I continue to urge the Republican Senate leadership to proceed to vote on the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon. There was never a justification for the Republican majority to deny these judicial nominees a fair up or down vote. There is no excuse for their continuing failure to do so. 
   Acting to fill judicial vacancies is a constitutional duty that the Senate--and all of its members--are obligated to fulfill. In its unprecedented slowdown in the handling of nominees since  the 104th Congress, the Senate is shirking its duty. That is wrong and should end. These are the nominations that the Senate on which the Senate should be working toward action. 
   I understand that nominations are not considered in lockstep order based on the date of receipt. I understand and respect the prerogatives of the majority party and the Republican leader. I do not want to oppose any nomination on the calendar and only ask that the Senate be fair to these other nominees, as well. Nominees like Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon should be voted on up or down by the Senate. We are asking and have been asking the Republican leadership to schedule votes on those nominations so that action on all the nominations can move forward. 
   I know that there were no objections on the Democratic side of the aisle to the three judicial nominations that the Majority Leader included in his proposal last night. No Democrat has a hold on the nominations of Judge Florence-Marie Cooper, Barbara Lynn or Ronald Gould. No Democrat has any objection to proceeding to confirm by voice vote or to proceed to roll call votes on these nominations. No Democratic Senator has any objection to proceeding to confirm by voice vote or to proceed to rollcall votes on any of the 9 judicial nominations on the Senate's executive calendar. What we do ask is that Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon not be left on the calendar without a vote at the end of another session of Congress. We have been unable even to obtain a commitment from the Majority Leader to schedule a fair up or down vote on these nominations at any time in the future. We respectfully request his help in scheduling such action by the Senate.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, about two months ago, Senator ABRAHAM and I began holding a series of meetings involving industry and consumer representatives to work out a bill that would permit and encourage the continued expansion of electronic commerce, and promote public confidence in its integrity and reliability. Together, we solicited and received technical assistance from the Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission. In late September, we put the finishing touches on a Leahy-Abraham substitute to S. 761. 
   On Tuesday night, after most members had left for the day, Senator ABRAHAM went to the floor and propounded a unanimous consent on a very different substitute to S. 761. Because I was not able to respond fully to his comments the other night, I would like to do so now. 
   At the outset, let me say that I support the passage of federal legislation in this area. In particular, we need to ensure that contracts are not denied validity that they otherwise have simply because they are in electronic form or signed electronically. 
   As I have said many times, however, we must tread cautiously when legislating in cyberspace. Senator ABRAHAM's bill, S. 761, takes a sweeping approach, preempting countless laws and regulations, federal and state, that require contracts, records and signatures to be in traditional written form. My concern is that such a sweeping approach would radically undermine laws that are currently in place to protect consumers. 
   We are told that S. 761 will have tremendous benefits for ``the public.'' Who exactly is ``the public'' that will benefit from this legislation? Not consumers. The bill is strongly opposed by consumer organizations across the country. 
   Supporters of this bill say that consumers will benefit from S. 761 because it will permit them to contract electronically for goods and services, and to obtain electronic records of their transactions. I agree that consumers should be able to contract online, but that is not the issue. Consumers already can contract for most things online, as anyone who has heard of such businesses as ``amazon.com'' and ``ebay.com'' knows. The issue here is whether we are going to allow public interest protections now applicable to private paper transactions to be circumvented simply by conducting the same transaction electronically. 
   Let me tell you about an incident that occurred in my office just this week. An industry lobbyist called to ask for a copy of my recent floor statement regarding this legislation. We sent him a copy as an attachment to an e-mail. An hour later, the same lobbyist called back to say that he had received the e-mail, but could not read the attachment. So we e-mailed it to him again, this time using a different word processing format. The lobbyist called back a third time to say that he still could not read the statement, and would we please fax a copy to his office, which we did. This sort of thing happens every day in offices and homes across the country. 
   It was only after we sent the fax that it occurred to me that under this bill, the unfortunate caller would have been deemed to have received written notice of my floor statement, in duplicate no less, before it ever reached him in a form he could read. No great loss in the case of my floor statement, but swap a bank and a homeowner for the Senator and the lobbyist in this story, and a foreclosure notice for the floor statement, and you can begin to see the harm this legislation could cause to ordinary Americans on a regular basis.  
   Many fine and responsible companies have called my office over the last few months, to express support for one or another version of S. 761. I have no doubt that they and a great many other American businesses that respect and value their customers would benefit from federal e-commerce legislation and share the benefits with their consumers. 
   We must not forget, however, that the purpose of consumer protection legislation is not so much to reinforce the good business practices of the best businesses in our society, but rather to protect consumers from the abusive and fraudulent minority of businesses that will take any opportunity to use new technologies to prey on consumers. That is why we must keep the interests of consumers in mind. While I do not question in any way the good intentions of the industry representatives who support this bill, they do not have the duty that we in Congress do to represent the broader public interest. 
   In urging speedy passage of S. 761, Senator ABRAHAM pointed to ``the fact'' that it passed the Commerce Committee unanimously, and ``the fact'' that the President endorsed it. The fact is, the bill that Senator ABRAHAM asked us to pass earlier this week is not the same bill that the Commerce Committee reported in June. 
   For one thing, it includes a new and complex provision regarding what it calls ``transferable records,'' that has never been considered by any Committee of the House or Senate. The bill also contains a host of other new provisions and amendments, including provisions and amendments relating to agreements, admissibility of evidence, record retention, and checks. 
   Furthermore, this bill is far less respectful of the states than the Commerce-passed bill, which was itself unprecedentedly preemptive. This legislation should be an interim measure to ensure the validity of electronic agreements entered into before the states have a chance to enact the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. Once the UETA is adopted by a state, the federal rule is unnecessary and should ``sunset.'' 
   Unlike the Commerce-passed bill, the new S. 761 would maintain a strong federal hand in the commercial law of electronic signatures and electronic records within a state even after it adopts the UETA. This is true because the bill would lift its preemptive effect only to the extent that a state's UETA is consistent with the provisions of S. 761. The reformulation can have only one possible objective, which is to prevent states like Vermont or California or even Michigan from passing e-commerce legislation that is more protective of consumers than federal law. 
   That is why the bill is so strongly opposed by the States. The National Conference of State Legislatures writes that the latest version of S. 761 ``would eviscerate consumer protections which consumers now enjoy off-line and mandate how states are to transact business.'' The New Jersey Law Revision Commission, an agency of the New Jersey Legislature, writes that it ``vigorously opposes'' S. 761, calling it ``an unwarranted imposition on State law'' that ``would create more problems than it would solve.'' Other representatives of the States have expressed similar concerns. 
   To summarize, the Commerce Committee did not unanimously report this bill, nor did the Administration endorse it. Indeed, I doubt that anyone in the Administration set eyes on this bill before Monday, when it was filed as a substitute to S. 761. 
   Moreover, the Administration does not currently endorse even the more modest bill reported by the Commerce Committee. In a recent letter to the House Judiciary Committee regarding title I of H.R. 1714, which substantially resembles S. 761, the General Counsel of the Commerce Department noted that, at the time S. 761 was reported, the spillover effect of its provisions on electronic contracts on existing consumer protection and regulatory standards had not been identified. He concluded:  
   Now that this effect has become clear, and it is equally clear that enactment of this measure is desired by some precisely because of this spillover effect, we [i.e., the Administration] must oppose these provisions as currently drafted.  
   The same letter states:  
   Consumer protection is [an] important area where the public interest has been found to require government oversight. States, as well as the Federal government, must not be shackled in their ability to provide safeguards in this area. Yet this is precisely what this legislation would do.  
   The recently-filed substitute version of S. 761 would do the same. 
   I was surprised to hear Senator ABRAHAM say that his efforts to negotiate with those of us who had concerns about the bill had been ``unsuccessful.'' As I have already discussed, those negotiations were very successful. They produced a truly bipartisan bill that promoted e-commerce for the benefit of all Americans and not just special interests. It took many weeks of hard work to achieve that result. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose the substitute for S. 761.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Intellectual Property Protection Restoration Act of  1999, a bill to restore federal remedies for violations of intellectual property rights of States. 
   Innvoation and creativity have been the fuel of our national economic boom over the past decade. The United States now leads the world in computing, communications and biotechnologies, and American authors and brand names are recognized across the globe. 
   Our national prosperity is, first and foremost, a tribute to American ingenuity. But it is also a tribute to the wisdom of our Founding Fathers, who made the promotion of what they called ``Science and the Useful Arts'' a national project, which they constitutionally assigned to Congress. And it is no less of a tribute to the successive Congresses and Administrations of both parties who have striven to provide real incentives and rewards for innovation and creativity by providing strong and even-handed protection to intellectual property rights. Congress passed the first federal patent law in 1790, and the U.S. Government issued its first patent the same year--to Samuel Hopkins of my home State of Vermont. The first federal copyright law was also enacted in 1790, and the first federal trademark laws date back to the 1870s. 
   The Supreme Court has long recognized that intellectual property rights bear the hallmark of true constitutional property rights--the right of exclusion against the world--and are therefore protection against appropriation both by individuals and by government. Consistent with this understanding of intellectual property, Congress has long ensured that the rights secured by the federal intellectual property laws were enforceable against the federal governments by waiving the government's immunity in suits alleging infringements of those rights. 
   No doubt Congress would have legislated similarly with respect to infringements by State entities and bureaucrats had there been any doubt that they were already fully subject to federal intellectual property laws. But there was no doubt. States had long enjoyed the benefits of the intellectual property laws on an equal footing with private parties. By the same token, and in accordance with the fundamental principles of equity on which our intellectual property laws are founded, the States bore the burdens of the intellectual property laws, being liable for infringements just like private parties. States were free to join intellectual property markets as participants, or to hold back from commerce and limit themselves to a narrower governmental role. The intellectual property right of exclusion meant what it said and was enforced evenhandley for public and private entities alike. 
   This harmonious state of affairs ended in 1985, with the Supreme Court's announced of the so-called ``clear statement'' rule in Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon. The Court in Atascadero held that Congress must express its intention to abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity ``in unmistakable language in the statute itself.'' A few years later, in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., the Supreme Court assured us that if the intent to abrogate were expressed clearly enough, it would be honored. 
   Following Atascadero, some courts held that States and State entities and officials could escape liability for patent, copyright and trademark infringement because the patent, copyright and trademark laws lacked the clear statement of congressional intent that was now necessary to abrogate State sovereign immunity. 
   To close this new loophole in the law, Congress promptly did precisely what the Supreme Court had told us was necessary. In 1990 and 1992, Congress passed three laws--the Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification Act, the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act, and the Trademark Remedy Clarification Acts. The sole purpose of these Clarification Acts was to make it absolutely, unambiguously, 100 percent clear that Congress intended the patent, copyright and trademark laws to apply to everyone, including the States, and that Congress did not intend the States to be immune from liability for money damages. Each of three Clarification Acts passed unanimously. 
   In 1996, however, by a five-to-four-vote, the Supreme Court in Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida reversed its earlier decision in Union Gas and held that Congress lacked authority under article I of the Constitution to abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court. 
   Then, on June 23, by the same bare majority, the Supreme Court in Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board v. College Savings Bank told us that it did not really mean what it said in Atascadero and invalidated the Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification Act. In a companion case decided on the same day, the same five Justices held that the Trademark Remedy Clarification Act also failed to abrogate State sovereign immunity. 
   The Court's latest decisions have been the subject of bipartism criticism. In a floor statement on July 1, I highlighted the anti-democratic implications of the approach of the activist majority of the Supreme Court, who have left constitutional text behind, ripped up precedent, and treated Congress with less respect than that due to an administrative agency in their haste to impose their natural laws notions of sovereignty as a barrier to democratic regulations. I also noted that ``the Court's decisions will have far-reaching consequences about how ..... intellectual property rights may be protected against even egregious infringements and violation by the State.'' 
   One of my Republican colleagues on the Judicial Committee, Senator SPECTER, expressed similar concerns in a floor statement on August 5. He noted that the Court decisions ``leave us with an absurd and untenable state of affairs,'' where ``States will enjoy an enormous advantage over their private sector competitions.'' 
   Not surprisingly, alarm has also been expressed in the business community about the potential of the Court's recent decisions to harm intellectual property owners in a wide variety of ways. A commentary in Business Week on August 2, 1999, gave these examples:  
   Watch out if you publish software that someone at a State university wants to copy for free ..... Watch out if you own a patent on a medical procedure that some doctor in a State medical school wants to use. Watch out if you've invested heavily in a great trademark, like Nike's Swoosh, and a bureaucrat decides his State program would be wildly promoted if it used the same mark.  
   Charles Fried, a professor at Harvard Law School and former Solicitor General during the Reagan Administration, has called the Court's decisions in Florida Prepaid and College Savings Bank ``truly bizarre.'' He observed, in a July 6 opinion editorial in the New York Times:  
   [The Court's decisions] did not question that States are subject to the patent and trademark laws of the United States. It's just that when a State violates those laws--as when it uses a patented invention without permission and without paying for it--the patent holder cannot sue the State for infringement. So a State hospital can manufacture medicines patented by others and sell or use them, and State schools universities can pirate textbooks and software, and the victims cannot sue for infringement.  
   I believe that these concerns are very real. As Congress realized when it waived federal sovereign immunity in the area, it would be naive to imagine that reliance on the commercial decency of the government and its myriad agencies and officials would provide the security needed to promote investment in research and development and to facilitate negotiation in the exclusive licensing arrangements that are often necessary to bring valuable products and creations to market. 
   The issue is not whether State infringement has been frequent in the past, but rather whether we can assure American inventors and investors and our design trading partners that, as State involvement in intellectual property becomes ever greater in the new information economy, U.S. intellectual property rights are backed by guaranteed legal remedies. It is a question of economics: our national economy depends on real and effective intellectual property rights. It is also a question of justice: in conceding that the States are constitutionally bound to respect federal intellectual property rights but invalidating the remedies Congress has created to enforce those rights, the Court has jeopardized one of the key principles that distinguishes our Constitution from the Constitution of the old Soviet Union--the principle that where there is a right, there must also be a remedy.  
   Some have suggested that a constitutional amendment may be the only way to restore protection to patent, copyright and trademark owners as against States. But even if Congress were to adopt such an amendment, I do not expect that we will see a lot of States rushing to ratify an amendment that forces them to pay for things that they can currently get for free. 
   Fortunately, however, while the implications of the Court's decisions for our constitutional scheme are serious, we can restore the guarantees of our intellectual property laws without resorting to a constitutional amendment. After close consideration of Florida Prepaid and the other recent Supreme Court precedents, I have no doubt that they leave several constitutional mechanisms open to us to restore substantial protection for patents, copyrights and trademarks through ordinary legislation. The Supreme Court's hyper-technical constitutional interpretations require us to jump through some technical constitutional hoops of our own, but that the exercise is now not merely worthwhile, but essential to safeguard both U.S. prosperity and the continued authority of Congress. 
   The Intellectual Property Protection Restoration Act is based on a simple supposition--that there is no inherent entitlement to federal intellectual property rights. In discussing the policies underlying the patent laws, the Supreme Court has emphasized that ``[t]he grant of a patent is the grant of a special privilege `to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts,' '' and that ``[i]t is the public interest which is dominant in the patent system.'' Similarly, in discussing the copyright laws, the Court has underscored that ``the monopoly privileges that Congress has authorized, while `intended to motivate the creative activity of authors and inventors by the provision of a special reward,' are limited in nature and must ultimately serve the public good.'' 
   The Constitution empowers but does not require Congress to make intellectual property rights available, and Congress should do so on in a manner that encourages and protects innovation in the public and private sector alike. 
   States and their institutions, especially State universities, benefit hugely from the federal intellectual property laws. All 50 States own or have obtained patents--some hold many hundreds of patents. States also hold other intellectual property rights secured by federal law, and the trend is toward increased participation by the States in commerce involving intellectual property rights. 
   Principles of State sovereignty tell us that States are entitled to a free and informed choice of whether or not to participate in the federal intellectual property schemes, subject only to their constitutional obligations. Equity and common sense tell us that one who chooses to enjoy the benefits of a law--whether it be a federal grant or the multimillion-dollar benefits of intellectual property protections--should also bear its burdens. Sound economics and traditional notions of federalism tell us that it is appropriate for the federal government to assist and encourage the sovereign States in their sponsorship of whatever innovation and creation they freely choose to sponsor by giving them intellectual property protection and, on occasion, funding, so long as the States reciprocate by assisting the federal governments to keep its promise of guaranteed exclusive rights to intellectual property owners. 
   The IPPRA builds on these principles. In order to promote cooperative federalism in the intellectual property arena, it provides a mechanism for States to affirm their willingness to participate in our national intellectual property project and so ``opt in'' as full and equal 
   participants. A State would opt in to the federal intellectual property system every time it applied for protection under a federal intellectual property law, by promising to waive its sovereign immunity from any subsequent suit against the State arising under such a law. 
   States take their commitments seriously. We can therefore expect that a State, having promised to waive its immunity if called upon to do so, would take whatever steps were necessary to fulfill that promise. At least in theory, however, a State could assert its immunity regardless of any assurance to the contrary. 
   The IPPRA addresses this problem by conditioning a State's intellectual property rights on its adherence to its promise to waive immunity. Thus, a State's refusal to waive immunity in an intellectual property suit after it has accepted benefits under an intellectual property law would have a number of consequences. Most significantly, it would give private parties the right to assert an immunity-like defense to damages claims in any action to enforce an intellectual property right that is or has been owned by the State during the five years preceding the State's assertion of immunity. This quid pro quo provision restores the level playing field by putting States that assert immunity in essentially the same position as private parties who seek to endorse federal intellectual property rights against them. 
   The IPPRA does this without coercing the State to waive by threatening pre-existing benefits. The quid pro quo provision only affects those intellectual property rights that the State acquired by virtue of its promise to waive immunity. To ensure that State waivers are voluntary, State intellectual property rights that pre-date the passage of the IPPRA are preserved regardless of waiver. 
   This scheme is consistent with the spirit of federalism, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, because it gives the States a free, informed and meaningful choice to waive or not to waive immunity at any time. It is also plainly authorized by the letter of the Constitution. Article I empowers Congress to ``promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.'' Incident to this power, Congress may attach conditions on the receipt of exclusive intellectual property rights. Indeed, we have always attached certain conditions, such as the requirements of public disclosure of an invention at the Patent and Trademark Office in order to obtain a patent. 
   Congress may attach conditions on States' receipt of federal intellectual property protection under its Article I intellectual property power just as Congress may attach conditions on States' receipt of federal funds under its Article I spending power. Either way, the power to attach conditions to the federal benefit is an integral part of the greater power to deny the benefit altogether. Either way, States have a choice--to forgo the federal benefit and exercise their sovereign power however they wish subject to the Constitution, or to take the benefit and exercise their sovereign power in the manner requested by Congress. In South Dakota v. Dole, for example, the Supreme Court held that Congress may condition federal highway funds on a State's agreement to raise its minimum drinking age to 21. The condition imposed on receipt of federal benefits by the IPPRA--submitting to suit under laws that are already binding on the States--is not onerous, nor does it co-opt any State resources to the service of federal policy. 
   Given the choice between opting in to the intellectual property laws and forgoing intellectual property protection under the federal laws, most States are likely to choose to former. The benefits secured by those laws far outweigh the burdens. Most States already respect intellectual property rights and will seldom find themselves in infringement suits. To deny the States the choice that the IPPRA offers them would amount to penalizing States that play by the federal intellectual property rules for the free-riding violations of the minority of States that refuse to commit to do so. As is normally the case in a federal system, cooperation between the States and the federal government is likely to be beneficial to all concerned. 
   However, some States and some State entities and officials have infringed patents and violated other intellectual property rights in the past, and the massive growth of both intellectual property and State participation in intellectual property that we are seeing as we move into the next century give ample cause for concern that such violations will continue. Now that the Supreme Court has seemingly given States and State entities carte  blanche to violate intellectual property rights free from any adverse financial consequences so long as they stand on their newly augmented sovereign immunity, the prospect of States violating federal law and then asserting immunity is too serious to ignore. 
   The IPPRA therefore also provides for the limited set of remedies that the Supreme Court's new jurisprudence leaves available to Congress to enforce a non-waiving State's obligations under federal law and the United States Constitution. The key point here is that, while the Court struck down our prior effort to enforce the intellectual property laws themselves by authorizing actions for damages against the States, it nonetheless acknowledged Congress' power to enforce constitutional rights related to intellectual property. 
   First, for the avoidance of doubt, the IPPRA ensures the full availability of prospective equitable relief to prevent States from violating or exceeding their rights under federal intellectual property laws. As the Supreme Court expressly acknowledged in its Seminole Tribe decision in 1996, such relief is available, notwithstanding any assertion of State sovereign immunity, under what is generally known as the doctrine of Ex parte Young. 
   Second, to address the harm done to the rights of intellectual property owners before they can secure an injunction, the IPPA also provides a damages remedy against non-consenting States, to the full extent of Congress' power to enforce the constitutional rights of intellectual property owners. Under the Supreme Court's recent decisions, this remedy is necessarily limited to the redress of constitutional violations, not violations of the federal intellectual property laws themselves. However, as I have already noted, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed on many occasions that the intellectual property owner's right of exclusion is a property right fully 
   protected from governmental violation under the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause and under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. 
   Under the Fifth Amendment, a State can be sued for damages for taking an intellectual property right. Although States can normally take a property right constitutionally, so long as they do so for a ``public purpose'' and provide ``just compensation,'' the Supreme Court held in 1984 that the ``public purpose'' requirement for a lawful taking means that the taking must be a valid exercise of the State's eminent domain powers. Because of the uniquely federal nature of federal intellectual property rights of exclusion, States have no eminent domain or other sovereign power over them. ``When Congress grants an exclusive right or monopoly, its effects are pervasive; no citizen or State may escape its reach.'' Therefore, every State taking of an intellectual property right, with or without some promise of subsequent compensation, is a constitutional violation ripe for congressional enforcement under section five of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
   Stangely, and I think improperly, the Supreme Court declined to decide in Florida Prepaid whether our earlier Clarification Acts could be sustained as an enforcement of the Takings Clause. The Court also did not resolve when a violation of intellectual property rights amounts to an unconstitutional taking. Because the Court emphasized that the resolution of such constitutional questions is its job, and not ours, the IPPRA simply provides a federal cause of action for an unconstitutional taking of intellectual property rights, leaving the courts to make the final determination of what is a constitutional violation and what remedy is constitutionally authorized. The IPPRA does, however, instruct the courts to interpret both the right and the remedy as broadly as constitutionally permissible. At the same time, by excluding treble damages from the remedies provided and by adopting the same standard of compensation--``reasonable and entire compensation''--that is currently available against the federal government for patient infringements, the bill respects the States' dignity and responds to the Court's objection that the Clarification Acts provided identical remedies against States and private parties. 
   Finally, in order to ensure the full availability of constitutionally permissible remedies if the courts adopt a narrow view of the Takings Clause in this context, the IPPRA adopts a similar approach in providing the fullest remedies constitutionally available, up to and including ``reasonable and entire compensation'' but excluding treble damages, for State violations of a federal intellectual property owner's Fourteenth Amendment right not to be deprived of her property without due process of law. 
   In sum, the constitutional remedy provided by the IPPRA closely resembles the remedy that Congress provided decades ago for deprivations of federal rights by persons acting under color of State law. The bill does not expand the property rights secured by the federal intellectual property laws--these laws are already binding on the States--nor does the bill interfere with any governmental authority to regulate businesses that own such rights. It simply restores the ability of private persons to sue in federal court to enforce such rights against the States. 
   I view this bill as an exercise in cooperative federalism. Clear, certain and uniform national rules protecting federal intellectual property rights benefit everyone: consumers, businesses, the federal government and the States. The IPPRA preserves States' rights, and gives the States a free choice. At the same time, it ensures effective protection for individual constitutional rights, and fills the gap left by recent Supreme Court decisions in which there are federal rights unsupported by effective remedies. 
   There are, to be sure, other approaches that Congress could take to address the problems created by the Court's decisions. For example, Congress could condition a State's receipt of federal funds--including federal research funds used to generate intellectual property--on the State's wavier of immunity from any suit arising under the federal intellectual property laws. As I previously discussed, this approach is squarely supported by the Court's decisions in the spending cases. In my view, however, such an approach would be less respectful of State sovereignty than the opt-in-scheme proposed by the IPPRA. It would also impede the States' ability to conduct research in a manner that the IPPRA would not. 
   There is another approach that remains open to Congress that would provide a remedy for intellectual property owners against States, respect State sovereignty, and restore some degree of uniformity and consistency in the construction of the federal intellectual property laws. That is, Congress could give State courts jurisdiction over intellectual property suits or just compensation claims against the States, and then require the United States Supreme Court to exercise appellate review of the resulting State court judgment. There is no possible constitutional objection to this approach; the Eleventh Amendment does not defeat the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction over suits brought against the States. We should not, however, burden the Supreme Court in this manner when, as the IPPRA demonstrates, there are efficient and proper ways to bring these claims into the lower federal courts in which intellectual property expertise resides. 
   Intellectual property is the currency of the new global economy. As we move into the 21st century, we should not allow that currency to be devalued by abstruse 18th century legal formalities. For that reason, I believe that legislation is imperative to minimize the ill effects of the Supreme Court's latest attack on our ability to protect our national economic assets. The IPPRA restores protection for violations of intellectual property rights that may, under current law, go unremedied, and so provides the certainty and security necessary to foster innovation and creativity. We unanimously passed more sweeping legislation earlier this decade, but were thwarted by Supreme Court technicalities. The IPPRA is designed to restore the benefits we sought to provide intellectual property owners while meeting the Supreme Court's technical requirements. We should move to consider this legislation as soon as we return next year.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on Monday, as so many others in this body, I was shocked to hear the news of the passing of my dear friend and our colleague, Senator John Chafee. 
   I spoke out at that time of the feelings that both my wife Marcelle and I have for John and for Ginny and for their family. I would like to expand on that just a little bit further on the floor of the Senate. 
   When I spoke first, it was off the floor. But John and I spent so much time in this body that I felt it would be only appropriate to say something here because I feel that it was an incredible privilege to have served with him. I know his presence is going to be missed greatly by everyone. 
   It still seems strange to stand on the Senate floor and see his desk with a black shroud on it and the flowers there--something that in my 25 years I have seen several times for colleagues. You always hope you will not see it because when you see it you know--whichever side of the aisle it is on--that you will miss a Member of this very special family. There are only 100 who are privileged to serve, at any one time, in this body representing a quarter of a billion people. We have respect for each other, affection for many. 
   I think in this case, when you hear what has been said by Senators on both sides of the aisle, you know the great affection and respect there is for John Chafee. And it is only natural. He was a truly extraordinary man. He dedicated his life to serving his State of Rhode Island and his country. He did so with a commitment that yielded many benefits to all Americans, way beyond Rhode Island or New England. 
   He had a distinguished military career. He never questioned when duty called, even when it was at his own personal expense. He left Yale University as an undergraduate to serve in World War II. He returned to active duty in Korea shortly after receiving a law degree from Harvard. His contribution to Rhode Island and our country continued as Governor of his State, as Secretary of the Navy, and as a Senator. 
   The list of positions he held indicates a man of rare qualities. But what he did in those positions is what places John amongst the finest Americans to have served in the Senate. He was passionate about issues, but he had the unique ability to search for compromise among otherwise divided colleagues. He never seemed to lose sight of the fact that the Senate was working toward a common good, not an individual one.  
   From taking the office of Governor in 1962, in a largely Democratic State, to his four terms in the Senate, John Chafee showed the country he was willing to look past party lines and see what was at the heart of the issue at hand. 
   He made so many significant, visible and invisible, contributions to the Senate in the 24 years he served in this body. I was privileged to serve with him in each of those years. He was a tireless advocate of the environment, becoming the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee in 1994. He was a staunch supporter and advocate of many of the most important environmental protection laws that have been passed, including the Clean Air Act of 1990. He was always one of the strongest voices behind the protection of our wetlands, as well as the need to stop global warming from further progression. 
   I remember our latest legislative effort together on the so-called takings legislation, when John and I took to the Senate floor defending the rights of States and local officials to make their own decisions about their communities. I am sure many in the Senate probably grew tired as the two of us reminisced about New England character and the landscape we love so much. At times during that debate I thought the Chambers of Commerce of Rhode 
   Island and Vermont should probably have hired us for all the things we were saying, but we made our point. 
   In health care, John was an advocate of compromise. His efforts to strengthen Medicare and Medicaid were actually seen as trying to appease Republicans and Democrats alike. What he was trying to do was to bring us together, because in every bend of the road, John was an advocate of serving his country to the very best of his ability. And he was successful in that every day of his life. 
   I think of arms control issues in the 1980s. John Chafee, John Heinz, Dale Bumpers--I remember working with them. We were sometimes referred to as the ``Gang of Four'' as we worked to bring reason to the nuclear arms race, even though we spanned the political spectrum among us. But as a veteran, as a decorated veteran, as a respected veteran, as a respected former Secretary of the Navy, John was not only an inspirational strategist in the ``Gang of Four'' but also an important resource of knowledge about the needs of an operationally effective nuclear triad. 
   So all of us have lost a beloved friend, one who will be missed dearly in the Senate. But the country should know the country suffered a great loss. Here was a man whose outlook and morals were of the highest standard. That should be something Senators in the present and the future should emulate. He was an anchor of civility for the Senate. 
   It is interesting that both he and my distinguished predecessor, as the senior Senator from Vermont, Bob Stafford, served as chairmen of the Environment Committee--both bringing those New England characteristics of civility in working for the better good. 
   Marcelle's and my thoughts and prayers are with Ginny and the rest of the Chafee family; and also with John Chafee's staff, who are among the finest people here--his extended family. 
   He will be missed. It was a privilege for the 99 remaining Senators to have served with him. And I think all 99 know that. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with Senator HATCH in introducing the ``American Inventors Protection Act of 1999,'' which I hope can be enacted into law this year. 
   This patent bill is important to America's future. I have heard from inventors, from businesses large and small, from hi-tech to low-tech firms that this bill will give American inventors and businesses an improved competitive edge now enjoyed by many European countries. 
   We should be on a level playing field with them. 
   This bill reduces patent fees for only the second time in history. The first time that was done was also in a Hatch-Leahy bill passed by the Senate in the 105th Congress. 
   All the concepts in this bill--such as patent term guarantees, domestic publication of patent applications filed abroad, first inventor defense--have been thoroughly examined. Indeed, they have been included in several bills that the Congress has carefully studied. 
   Chairman HATCH and I have worked closely on this bill. I believe that we can get a good patent bill to the President before we go out of session this year. I look forward to working with the House on these issues and appreciate the hard work and careful crafting that went into their bill--H.R. 1907. 
   I wish to point out that the Senate Judiciary Committee last year also developed a strong bill--S. 507--which contained many of the same concepts and approaches found in H.R. 1907 and S. 1798. 
   It is long past time for the Senate to consider and pass this patent reform legislation. Our patent bill will be good for Vermont, good for Utah and every state in the Nation, good for American innovators of all sizes, and good for America. 
   We will be working with the Administration, the full Senate and with the House to move this bill along quickly. I hope we can keep this bipartisan coalition together because otherwise this bill will die, as past efforts have. 
   The patent bill will reform the U.S. patent system in important ways. 
   It will reduce legal fees that are paid by inventors and companies; eliminate duplication of research efforts and accelerate research into new areas; increase the value of patents to inventors and companies; and facilitate U.S. inventors and companies' research, development, and commercialization of inventions. 
   In Vermont, we have a number of independent inventors and small companies. It is, therefore, especially important to me that this bill will be one that helps them as well as the larger companies in Vermont like IBM. 
   Over the past several years, Congress has held eight Congressional hearings with more than 80 witnesses testifying about the various proposals incorporated in the bill. Republican and Democratic Administrations alike, reaching back to the Johnson Administration, have supported these similar reforms. 
   I also thank Secretary Daley and the administration for their unflagging support of effective patent reform. I also know that they worked closely with the House on H.R. 1907. I will submit a more detailed statement on S. 1798 before we proceed to Senate consideration.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we approach the beginning of the next century, we have much to be proud of as a nation. The stock market has reached an historic 10,000 mark. We are in the midst of one of the greatest economic expansions in our nation's history. More Americans own their own homes  than at any time, and we have the lowest unemployment and welfare caseloads in a generation. 
   Yet, there are millions of Americans who go hungry every day. Just this past July, the Department of Agriculture published a report entitled ``Household Food Security in the United States 1995-1998'' which reported that last year, 36 million persons--of which approximately 40% were children--lived in households that experienced hunger. 
   While it is true that food stamp and welfare program caseloads have dropped over the past few years, hunger has not. As families try to make the transition from welfare to work, too many are falling out and being left behind. And too often, it is our youth who is feeling the brunt of this, as one out of every five people lining up at soup kitchens is a child. 
   Second Harvest, the nation's largest hunger relief charity, distributed more than one billion pounds of food to an estimated 26 million low-income Americans last year through their network of regional food banks. These food banks provide food and grocery products to nearly fifty thousand local charitable feeding programs--food shelves, pantries, soup kitchens and emergency shelters. 
   Yet as the demand has risen at local hunger relief agencies, too many pantries and soup kitchens have been forced to turn needy people away because the request for their services exceeds available food. 
   Last year, the U.S. Conference of Mayors released its Annual Survey of Hunger and Homelessness, which reported that the demand for hunger relief services grew 14 percent last year. Additionally, 21 percent of requests for emergency food were estimated to have gone unmet. This is the highest rate of unmet need by emergency food providers since the recession of the early 1990s. And this is not just a problem of the inner cities. According to the Census Bureau, hunger and poverty are growing faster in the suburbs than anywhere else in America. In my own state of Vermont, one in ten people is ``food insecure,'' according to government statistics. That is, of course, just a clinical way to say they are hunger or at risk of hunger. 
   Under the leadership of Deborah Flateman, the Vermont Food Bank distributes food to approximately 240 private social service agencies throughout the state to help hungry and needy Vermonters. The local food shelves and emergency kitchens which receive food from the Vermont Food Bank clearly are on the front-line against hunger. And what they are seeing is very disturbing--one in four seeking hunger relief is a child under the age of 17. Elderly people 
   make up more than a third of all emergency food recipients. We cannot continue to allow so many of our youngest and oldest citizens face the prospect of hunger on a daily basis. Another extremely troubling statistic about hunger in Vermont is that in 45 percent of the households that receive charitable food assistance, one or more adults are working. Nationwide, working poor households represent more than one-third of all emergency food recipients. These are people in Vermont and across the U.S. who are working, paying taxes and contributing to the economic growth of our nation, but are reaping few of the rewards. 
   Our government has taken numerous steps to alleviate hunger in America, but clearly more still needs to be done. 
   The Emergency Food Assistance Program has been essential in the fight against hunger by providing USDA commodities to the nation's food banks and local emergency feeding charities. As the demands continue to grow, however, TEFAP resources are running on empty. The Hunger Relief Act would increase funding for TEFAP, thus helping community charities cope with increased local demand for hunger relief. 
   Perhaps more than any other program, the Food Stamp Program has been critical to the prevention and alleviation of hunger and poverty, and is essential to helping families on welfare transition to work. Nationally, one in ten people--half of which are children--participates in the Food Stamp Program. 
   In this time of economic booms, one in five U.S. children--approximately 15 million children--lives in a household receiving food stamps. 
   And far too many families with full-time or part-time minimum wage jobs need food stamps just to approach the poverty line. 
   For many families, the choice between paying the rent and buying food is becoming more and more common. While the Food Stamp Program does adjust benefits for families with high shelter costs, this adjustment has been artificially capped. In 1993, Congress passed a phased-out elimination of the cap on the food stamp shelter deduction. With the passage of the Welfare Reform bill, however, Congress repealed the phase-out and the cap remained in place. 
   The cap on the shelter deduction has had a significant impact on working families, who tend to have higher shelter costs than families receiving public housing assistance. The Hunger Relief Act raises the shelter cap from $275 to $340, and then indexes it to inflation, increasing access to Food Stamps for approximately 1.25 million people. 
   Many working poor families, particularly in rural areas, own a modestly valued car, necessary to get to work, but of a value greater than the antiquated food stamp vehicle limit. In the last 22 years, the limit on car values has increased a total of $150, and in many states the Food Stamp vehicle allowance is much lower than the TANF vehicle allowance. The Hunger Relief Act would give states more freedom, allowing states the option of using the same limits for vehicles under both TANF and Food Stamps. The Hunger Relief Act would also complete the restoration of food stamp benefits to thousands of immigrants who were pushed out of the program by the Welfare Reform Act. 
   Last Congress I worked hard to include $818 million in the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reauthorization Act to restore food stamp benefits for thousands of legal immigrants. This legislation restored food stamps to legal immigrants who are disabled or elderly, or who later become disabled, and who resided in the United States prior to August 22, 1996. That law also increased food stamp eligibility time limits--from five years to seven years--for refugees and asylees who came to this country to avoid persecution. Hmong refugees who aided U.S. military efforts in Southeast Asia were also covered, as were children residing in the United States prior to August 22, 1996. 
   Though the Agriculture Research Act restored food stamp eligibility to children of legal immigrants, many of these children are not receiving food stamps and are experiencing alarming instances of hunger. In its recent report entitled ``Who is Leaving the Food Stamp Program? An Analysis of Caseload Changes from 1994 to 1997,'' the United States Department of Agriculture reported that participation among children living with parents who are legal immigrants fell significantly faster than children living with native-born parents. It appears that restrictions on adult legal immigrants deterred the participation of their children. That is a disturbing development that must be rectified, and the Hunger Relief Act would go along way toward making the situation right by restoring food stamp eligibility to all legal immigrants. 
   Of the many problems that we face as a nation, hunger is one that is entirely solvable. Hunger is not a Democrat or Republican issue. Hunger is a problem that all Americans should agree must be ended in our nation. I am proud to join with Senators KENNEDY, SPECTER, and JEFFORDS in introducing the Hunger Relief Act, and I look forward to working with members of the Senate to see the passage of this legislation.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 10 years ago, Caryl Stewart, Executive Director of the Vermont Development Credit Union, had a dream for a grass roots community development ``bank'' to serve low and moderate income people in Burlington, Vermont. Who would have guessed them that her dream would become a growing credit union with over $10 million in assets and 5,000 members in 175 Vermont towns? 
   Through it all, the credit union, with Caryl at its helm, has stayed true to its vision of serving lower income families and small business entrepreneurs in Vermont. Not just with loans, but also with the personal attention and counseling needed to ensure that loan  recipients succeed, whatever their goals. It is that commitment to Vermonters and the communities they live in that has won the Credit Union the support and patronage of so many Vermont businesses and organizations. 
   It has also won the organization support from far beyond Vermont's borders. From Fannie Mae to the Community Development Financial Institutions program the Vermont Development Credit Union has received funding and won national recognition for its innovative lending and support programs. 
   Vermont Development came from very small beginnings in a very small city of our very small State. But like that State, it had very big ideas and has earned its place as a model for organizations providing credit and financial assistance to low and moderate income people throughout the country. 
   Happy Birthday, Vermont Development Credit Union and congratulations on 10 years of bringing hope and opportunity to thousands of Vermonters.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is about to pass S. 1748, the Multi-District Jurisdiction Act of 1999, and H.R. 2112, as amended by the Hatch-Leahy substitute during its consideration in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Our substitute amendment is the text of S. 1748, the Multi-District Jurisdiction Act of 1999, which the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and I, along with Senators GRASSLEY, TORRICELLI, KOHL, and SCHUMER, introduced last week. Our bipartisan legislation is needed by Federal judges across the country to restore their power to promote the fair and efficient administration of justice in multi-district litigation. 
   Current law authorizes the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation to transfer related cases, pending in multiple Federal judicial districts, to a single district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. This makes good sense because transfers by the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation are based on centralizing those cases to serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and to promote efficient judicial management. 
   For nearly 30 years, many transferee judges, following circuit and district court case law, retained these multi-district cases for trial because the transferee judge and the parties were already familiar with each other and the facts of the case through the pretrial proceedings. The Supreme Court in Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U.S. 26 (1998), however, found that this well-established practice was not authorized by the general venue provisions in the United States Code. Following the Lexecon ruling, the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation must now remand each transferred case to its original district at the conclusion of the pretrial proceedings, unless the case is already settled or otherwise terminated. This new process is costly, inefficient and time consuming. 
   The Multi-District Jurisdiction Act of 1999 seeks to restore the power of transferee judges to resolve multi-district cases as expeditiously and fairly as possible. Our bipartisan bill amends section 1407 of title 28 of the United States Code to allow a transferee judge to retain cases for trial or transfer those cases to another judicial district for trial in the interests of justice and for the convenience of parties and witnesses. The legislation provides transferee judges the flexibility they need to administer justice quickly and efficiently. Indeed, our legislation is supported by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the Judicial Conference of the United States and the Department of Justice. 
   In addition, we have included a section in our bill to ensure fairness during the determination of compensatory damages by adding the presumption that the case will be remanded to the transferor court for this phase of the trial. Specifically, this provision provides that to the extent a case is tried outside of the transferor forum, it would be solely for the purpose of a consolidated trial on liability, and if appropriate, punitive damages, and that the case must be remanded to the transferor court for the purposes of trial on compensatory damages, unless the court to which the action has been transferred for trial purposes also finds, for the convenience of the parties and witnesses and in the interests of justice, that the action should be retained for the determination of compensatory damages. This section is identical to a bipartisan amendment proposed by Representative Berman and accepted by the House Judiciary Committee during its consideration of similar legislation earlier this year. 
   Multi-district litigation generally involves some of the most complex fact-specific cases, which affect the lives of citizens across the nation. For example, multi-district litigation entails such national legal matters as asbestos, silicone gel breast implants, diet drugs like fen-phen, hemophiliac blood products, Norplant contraceptives and all major airplane crashes. In fact, as of February 1999, approximately 140 transferee judges were supervising about 160 groups of multi-district cases, with each group composed of hundreds, or even thousands, of cases in various stages of trial development. 
   But the efficient case management of these multi-district cases is a risk after the Lexecon ruling. Judge John F. Nangle, Chairman of the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation, recently testified before Congress that: ``Since Lexecon, significant problems have arisen that have hindered the sensible conduct of multi-district litigation. Transferee judges throughout the United States have voiced their concern to me about the urgent need to enact this legislation.'' 
   Mr. President, Congress should listen to the concerned voices of our Federal Judiciary and swiftly send the Multi-District Jurisdiction Act of 1999 to the President for his signature into law.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, along with many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I have long been an advocate of legislation to enable and encourage the expansion of electronic commerce, and to promote public confidence in its integrity and reliability. In that bipartisan spirit, many of us worked together in the last Congress to pass the Government Paperwork Elimination Act, which established a framework for the federal government's use of electronic forms and signatures. I believe that the same spirit, and the same process of listening to the people involved and the experts on the issue, and of reasoned deliberation, could yield an electronic signatures and electronic contracting bill that would benefit our entire national economy. 
   Sadly, however, the bill before us today is not the product of such a process, and it is not such a bill. Where the Government Paperwork Elimination Act was an object lesson in bipartisanship, the bill before us today is an object lesson in special interest politics. 
   This bill has a history. If we listen to that history, we may hear some of the voices that have been silenced in the rush to bring it to the floor. So let me recount it briefly. 
   On May 27, the Commerce Committee held hearings on Senator ABRAHAM's original S. 761. Remarkably, for a bill that proscribed rules for business-to-consumer transactions as well as business-to-business transactions, neither the Federal Trade Commission, nor state consumer protection authorities, nor any consumer advocates, were invited to testify at those hearings. Sometimes it seems that we forget that the purpose of commerce is to provide goods and services for consumers. 
   In June, neglecting the concerns of silent consumers, the Commerce Committee reported a bill of quite unprecedentedly sweeping preemptive effect. The Commerce-passed bill would have overridden untold numbers of federal, state and local laws that require contracts, signatures and other documents to be in traditional written form. 
   I was concerned that the Commerce-passed bill was federal preemption beyond need, to the detriment of American consumers. For example, the bill would have enabled businesses to use their superior bargaining power to compel or confuse consumers into waiving their rights to insist on paper disclosures and communications, even  when they do not have the technological capacity to receive, retain, and print electronic records. 
   On August 10, I asked the FTC whether S. 761 as reported by the Commerce Committee could undermine consumer protections in state and federal law, and how the bill might be improved. The FTC responded by letter dated September 3 that, while it shared the broad goals of S. 761, the bill's potential application to consumer transactions raised questions that needed to be addressed:  
   For instance, would the bill preempt numerous state consumer protection laws? Would borrowers be bound by a contract requiring that they receive delinquency or foreclosure notices by electronic mail, even if they did not own a computer? Would consumers who had agreed to receive electronic communications be entitled to revert to paper communications if their computer breaks or becomes obsolete? Would consumers disputing an electronic signature have to hire an encryption expert to rebut a claim that they had `signed' an agreement when, in fact, they had not? What evidentiary value would an electronic agreement have if it could easily be altered electronically?  
   The FTC concluded that further clarification was needed to provide protection for consumers while allowing business-to-business commerce to proceed unimpeded. 
   Consumer and privacy advocates, consumer lawyers and law professors echoed the FTC's views. Among the many national organizations opposed to the bill: Consumer Union, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America, National Consumer Law Center, National Association of Consumer Agency Administrators, National Consumers League, National Center on Poverty Law, National Legal Aid and Defenders Association, National Senior Citizens Law Center, Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, United Auto Workers, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, and Utility Consumers Action Network. They wrote to the Senate on September 9, that, while consumers can potentially benefit from receiving information electronically, ``the broad-brush approach of S. 761.......would eviscerate important consumer protections in state and federal law, as well as interfere with a state's rights to protect its own consumers without imposing any protections against misuse, mistake, or fraud.'' 
   The Commerce Department also came to oppose S. 761 as reported by the Commerce Committee, because of its spillover effect on existing consumer protection and regulatory standards. In a letter this month to the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, the Commerce Department noted its concern that enactment of S. 761 was desired by some precisely because of this spillover effect. 
   Faced with a bill that proclaimed an objective that I agreed with, but also presented serious dangers for consumers, I committed to working with Senator ABRAHAM and others to rewrite S. 761 in a manner that would benefit businesses and consumers alike. For many weeks, we strove to do the work that the Commerce Committee had failed to do, meeting with business and consumer representatives in order to make sure that we understood and fully addressed their concerns. 
   I was and still am proud of what this consultative process produced. The Leahy-Abraham compromise bill satisfied the primary and valid goal of the business community, which was to ensure that contracts could not be invalidated solely because they were in electronic form or because they were signed electronically. The bill also promoted competition and innovation by proscribing that regulations would not discriminate between reasonable authentication technologies. At the same time, the bill left in place essential safeguards protecting the nation's consumers. 
   As of September 28, then, the prospects looked good for a bipartisan compromise that furthered the interests of industry and consumers alike. The prospects looked even better two weeks later, when a bipartisan majority of the House Judiciary Committee adopted the Leahy-Abraham compromise bill as a substitute to the radically preemptive H.R. 1714. 
   That was the history of S. 761, until today. Senator ABRAHAM is now seeking unanimous consent to pass a totally different bill, a bill that is more preemptive and potentially more harmful to consumers than the bill reported by the Commerce Committee in June. How did this reversal happen? I as one of the architects of the compromise was not consulted. But that is not what troubles me. 
   What troubles me is that, so far as I know, the FTC was not consulted; the Commerce Department was not consulted, and consumer groups were certainly not consulted. I do not know who was consulted, but I do know that, whatever process created this new bill, it was not a bipartisan process, it was not an open process, and it completely bypassed the Committee system. 
   What is in this mystery bill, which was unveiled less than 24 hours ago, and which we are now asked to pass by unanimous consent? A very small part of this bill focuses, as did the Leahy-Abraham compromise, on validating electronic contracts. A much larger part of the bill is devoted to electronic records, which is broadly and vaguely defined in such a way as to encompass any text on any computer anywhere. 
   The bill provides that if any law, federal or state, requires a record to be in writing, an electronic record satisfies the law. I frankly do not know what that means. My fear is it means that if a patient purchases medication from ``drugstore.com,'' the listing of dosage instructions and counter-indications on the ``drugstore.com'' web site could be deemed to satisfy the FDA's safety labeling requirements. To take another example, what happens if the homeowner cannot access an email from the bank threatening foreclosure because her computer is broken? 
   The bill also sweeps unduly broadly in its provisions on electronic signatures. Under this bill, if any law, federal or state, requires a signature, an electronic signature is deemed to satisfy that law. The term ``electronic signature'' is defined to include any electronic sound, symbol or process used with intent to sign and associated with an electronic record. This captures everything from the most secure, encrypted, state-of-the-art authentication technology to my typing my initials at the end of an email. 
   This one-size-fits-all legislative approach substitutes for the uniqueness and reliability of a human signature a wide range of unreliable and unauthenticable technologies, without providing any of the protections that, say, credit card owners have. To take an old-fashioned example, where parents used to sign their children's homework, this approach would suggest that the teacher should be satisfied by the sight of the parent's initials attached to an email. The ramifications are much more serious when we consider the prospect of children using insecure technologies to bind their parents to electronic transactions that they cannot afford. 
   There are other problems with this bill as well. It has a new and complex provision regarding what it calls ``transferable records,'' in effect, electronic negotiable instruments. This provision has never been considered by any Committee of the House or Senate, or to my knowledge by any banking regulators. Maybe the sponsors of the bill are prepared to take us through it in detail on the floor today. If not, we would be derelict in our duty if we brought into force a whole new legal regime that we have neither scrutinized nor understood. 
   Then there is the issue of preemption. State laws include a large number--usually thousands--of references to signatures and writings. A recent review of the Massachusetts General Laws uncovered over 4,500 sections dealing with or requiring a signature or writing, and I understand that this is typical among the states. 
   In some cases, it may be appropriate to reform such requirements to allow electronic means rather than paper and pen. In other cases, it may be appropriate to maintain paper requirements or, if the law is to be changed to allow electronic means, to tailor the law to maintain the legislative intent, as for example in the case of consumer protection provisions requiring conspicuous terms. But aside from a handful of specific exclusions, the new S. 761 does not attempt to differentiate among state laws, nor does it concern itself with the reasons why state legislatures required a signature or writing in the first place; rather, S. 761 simply wipes these thousands of state laws off the books. 
   We have heard a lot of late about the integrity of state law. We have heard that providing federal protections for battered women would unduly intrude on the states' authority. We have heard that allowing federal authorities to prosecute hate crimes would violate state sovereignty. It is interesting to note that the principal sponsor of this bill is also a cosponsor of S. 1214, the Federalism Accountability Act, which aims to protect the reserved powers of the states by imposing accountability for federal preemption of state and local laws. 
   I myself have always taken a more pragmatic line about the pros and cons of federal versus state law. But it is ironic to hear Members who speak the rhetoric of states' rights on a regular basis to turn around and advocate a bill that would preempt thousands of state laws ranging from the common-law statute of frauds to California's recent enactment of a modified version of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. 
   Finally, one important provision that we included in the Leahy-Abraham compromise is missing from this bill--a provision that asked the FTC to study the effectiveness of federal and state consumer protection laws with respect to electronic transactions involving consumers. That kind of scrutiny would be all the more valuable in the context of this new bill, which would radically change the legal landscape by stripping consumers of a host of current legal protections. 
   It is a disturbing testament to the power of special interests that the reporting provision at the end of this bill one-sidedly demands a report on what it calls ``barriers to electronic commerce,'' while creating no provision for any investigation of the effects of its new regime on the nation's consumers. 
   I do not consent to passage of S. 761 in its current form.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will approve S. 1235, legislation which I introduced to provide railroad police officers the opportunity to attend the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Academy for law enforcement training in  Quantico, Virginia. I thank Senators HATCH, BIDEN, DEWINE, SCHUMER, HELMS, and GRAMS for their co-sponsorship of our bipartisan bill. 
   The FBI is currently authorized to offer the superior training available at the FBI's National Academy only to law enforcement personnel employed by state or local units of government. Police officers employed by railroads are not allowed to attend this Academy despite the fact that they work closely in numerous cases with Federal law enforcement agencies as well as State and local law enforcement. Providing railroad police with the opportunity to obtain the training offered at Quantico would improve inter-agency cooperation and prepare them to deal with the ever increasing sophistication of criminals who conduct their illegal acts either using the railroad or directed at the railroad or its passengers. 
   Railroad police officers, unlike any other private police department, are commissioned under State law to enforce the laws of that State and any other State in which the railroad owns property. As a result of this broad law enforcement authority, railroad police officers are actively involved in numerous investigations and cases with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. 
   For example, Amtrak has a police officer assigned to the New York City Joint Task Force on Terrorism, which is made up of 140 members from such disparate agencies as the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service, the U.S. Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. This task force investigates domestic and foreign terrorist groups and responds to actual terrorist incidents in the Metropolitan New York area. 
   Whenever a railroad derailment or accident occurs, often railroad police are among the first on the scene. For example, when a 12-car Amtrak train derailed in Arizona in October 1995, railroad police joined the FBI at the site of the incident to determine whether the incident was the result of an intentional criminal act of sabotage. 
   Amtrak police officers have also assisted FBI agents in the investigation and interdiction of illegal drugs and weapons trafficking on transportation systems in the District of Columbia and elsewhere. In addition, using the railways is a popular means for illegal immigrants to gain entry to the United States. According to recent congressional testimony, in 1998 alone, 33,715 illegal aliens were found hiding on board Union Pacific railroad trains and subject to arrest by railroad police. 
   With thousands of passengers traveling on our railways each year, making sure that railroad police officers have available to them the highest level of training is in the national interest. The officers that protect railroad passengers deserve the same opportunity to receive training at 
   Quantico that their counterparts employed by State and local governments enjoy. Railroad police officers who attend the FBI National Academy in Quantico for training would be required to pay their own room, board and transportation. 
   This legislation is supported by the FBI, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Union Pacific Railroad Company, and the National Railroad Passenger Corporation. 
   I urge prompt consideration by the House of Representatives of this legislation to provide railroad police officers with the opportunity to receive training from the FBI that would increase the safety of the American people.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today a bill to continue and enhance the current reporting requirements for the Administrative Office of the Courts and the Attorney General on the eavesdropping and surveillance activities of our federal and state law enforcement agencies. 
   For many years, the Administrative Office (AO) of the Courts has complied with the statutory requirement, in 18 U.S.C. &#167;2519(3), to report to Congress annually the number and nature of federal and state applications for orders authorizing or approving the interception of wire, oral or electronic communications. By letter dated September 3, 1999, the AO advised that it would no longer submit this report because ``as of December 21, 1999, the report will no longer be required pursuant to the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995.'' 
   The AO has done an excellent job at preparing the wiretap reports. We need to continue the AO's objective work in a consistent manner. If another agency took over this important task at this juncture and the numbers came out in a different format, it would immediately generate questions and concerns over the legitimacy and accuracy of the contents of that report. In addition, it would create difficulties in comparing statistics from prior years going back to 1969 and complicate the job of Congressional oversight. Furthermore, transferring this reporting duty to another agency might create delays in issuance of the report since no other agency has the methodology in place. Finally, federal, state and local agencies are well accustomed to the reporting methodology developed by the AO. Notifying all these agencies that the reporting standards and agency have changed would inevitably create more confusion and more expense as law enforcement agencies across the country are forced to learn a new system and develop a liaison with a new agency. 
   The system in place now has worked well and should be continued. We know how quickly law enforcement may be subjected to criticism over their use of these surreptitious surveillance tools and we should avoid aggravating these sensitivities by changing the reporting agency. 
   The bill would update the reporting requirements currently in place with one additional reporting requirement. Specifically, the bill would require the wiretap report to include information on the number of orders in which encryption was encountered and whether such encryption prevented law enforcement from obtaining the plaintext of communications intercepted pursuant to such order. 
   Encryption technology is critical to protect sensitive computer and online information. Yet, the same technology poses challenges to law enforcement when it is exploited by criminals to hide evidence or the fruits of criminal activities. A report by the U.S. Working Group on Organized Crime titled, ``Encryption and Evolving Technologies: Tools of Organized Crime and Terrorism,'' released in 1997, collected anecdotal case studies on the use of encryption in furtherance of criminal activities in order to estimate the future impact of encryption on law enforcement. The report noted the need for ``an ongoing study of the effect of encryption and other information technologies on investigations, prosecutions, and intelligence operations. As part of this study, a database of case information from federal and local law enforcement and intelligence agencies should be established and maintained.'' Adding a requirement that reports be furnished on the number of occasions when encryption is encountered by law enforcement is a far more reliable basis than anecdotal evidence on which to assess law enforcement needs and make sensible policy in this area. 
   The final section of this bill would codify the information that the Attorney General already provides on pen register and trap and trace device orders, and require further information on where such orders are issued and the types of facilities--telephone, computer, pager or other device--to which the order relates. Under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (``ECPA'') of 1986, P.L. 99-508, codified at 18 U.S.C. &#167;3126, the Attorney General of the United States is required to report annually to the Congress on the number of pen register orders and orders for trap and trace devices applied for by law enforcement agencies of the Department of Justice. As the original sponsor of ECPA, I believed that adequate oversight of the surveillance activities of federal law enforcement could only be accomplished with reporting requirements such as the one included in this law. 
   The reports furnished by the Attorney General on an annual basis compile information from five components of the Department of Justice: the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the United States Marshals Service and the Office of the Inspector General. The report contains information on the number of original and extension orders made to the courts for authorization to use both pen register and trap and trace devices, information concerning the number of investigations involved, the offenses on which the applications were predicted and the number of people whose telephone facilities were affected. 
   These specific categories of information are useful, and the bill we introduce today would direct the Attorney General to continue providing these specific categories of information. In addition, the bill would direct the Attorney General to include information on the identity, including the district, of the agency making the application and the person authorizing the order. In this way, the Congress and the public will be informed of those jurisdictions using this surveillance technique--information which is currently not included in the Attorney General's annual reports. 
   The requirement for preparation of the wiretap reports will soon lapse. I therefore urge prompt action on this legislation to continue the requirement for submission of the wiretap reports and to update the reporting requirements for both the wiretap reports submitted by the AO and the pen register and trap and trace reports submitted by the Attorney General.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday was the 6 month anniversary of the shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. Fourteen students and a teacher lost their lives in that tragedy on April 20, 1999. But still the Congressional leadership refuses to send to the President comprehensive juvenile justice legislation. 
   This is shameful. 
   As we have for months now, Senate and House Democrats stand ready to work with Republicans to enact into law an effective juvenile justice conference report that includes reasonable gun safety provisions. Yesterday, all the House and Senate Democratic conferees sent a letter to Senator HATCH and Congressman HYDE calling for an open meeting of the juvenile justice conference. 
   We need to bring this up. Vote it up. Vote it down. I don't know what everybody is scared of. But at least let's vote. 
   This delay is simply because of the opposition of the gun lobby to any new firearm safety laws. Even though the Senate passed the Hatch-Leahy Juvenile Justice Bill in May, we still have not moved forward on a juvenile justice conference report. 
   I hope the majority will hear the call of our nation's law enforcement officers to act now to pass a strong and effective juvenile justice conference report. 
   Ten national law enforcement organizations, representing thousands of law enforcement officers, yesterday endorsed the Senate-passed gun safety amendments and support loophole-free firearm laws: International Association of Chiefs of Police; International Brotherhood of Police Officers; Police Executive Research Forum; Police Foundation; Major Cities Chiefs; Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association; National Sheriffs Association; National Association of School Resource Officers; National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives; and Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association. 
   Law enforcement officers in this country need help in keeping guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. I am not talking about people who use guns for hunting or for sport, but about criminals and unsupervised children. 
   The thousands of law enforcement officers represented by these organizations are demanding that Congress act now to pass a strong and effective juvenile justice conference report. As a conferee, I am ready to work with Republicans and Democrats to do just that. 
   According to press reports, the Republicans are meeting and having sensitive negotiations over gun proposals. Apparently, the Republicans on the conference and the Republican leadership met last Thursday to hammer out an agreement on guns. They were not successful. Bicameral Republican meetings cannot be confused with bipartisan conference meetings. Only in open conference meetings with an opportunity for full debate will we be able to resolve the differences in the juvenile justice bills and get a law enacted. 
   Every parent, teacher and student in this country is concerned about school violence over the last two years and worried about when the next shooting may occur. They only hope it does not happen at their school or involve their children. 
   We all recognize that there is no single cause and no single legislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our schools or in our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to do our part. We should seize this opportunity to act on balanced, effective juvenile justice legislation, and measures to keep guns out of the hands of children and away from criminals. 
   I hope we get to work soon and finish what we started in the juvenile justice conference. It is well past the time for Congress to act. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, for many months I had been calling for a fair vote on the nomination of Justice Ronnie White to the federal court. Instead, the country witnessed a party line vote as all 54 Republican members of the Senate present that day voted against confirming this highly qualified African-American jurist to the federal bench. I believe that vote to have been unprecedented--the only party line vote to defeat a judicial nomination I can find in our history. 
   There was brief debate on this nomination and two others the night before the vote. At that time, I attempted, as best I could through questions in the limited opportunity allotted, to clarify the record of this outstanding judge with respect to capital punishment appeals and to outline his background and qualifications. 
   I noted that Justice White had, in fact, voted to uphold the imposition of  the death penalty 41 times. I observed that other members of the Missouri Supreme Court, including members of the Court appointed by Republican governors, had similar voting records and more often than not agreed with Justice White, both when he voted to uphold the death penalty and when he joined with a majority of that Court to reverse and remand such cases for resentencing or a new trial. Of the 59 capital punishment cases that Justice White has reviewed, he voted with the majority of that Court 51 times--41 times to uphold the death penalty and 10 times to reverse for serious legal error. 
   As best I can determine, in only six of these 59 cases did Justice White dissent from the imposition of a death penalty, and in only three did he do so with a dissent that was not joined by other members of the court. That is hardly the record that the Senate was told about Monday and Tuesday of the first week in October, when it was told that Justice White was an anti-death penalty judge, someone who was ``procriminal and activist with a slant toward criminals,'' someone with ``a serious bias against a willingness to impose the death penalty,'' someone who seeks ``at every turn'' to provide opportunities for the guilty to ``escape punishment,'' and someone ``with a tremendous bent toward criminal activity.'' 
   The opposition to Justice White presented a distorted view by concentrating on two lone dissents out of 59 capital punishment cases. Making matters worse, the legal issues involved in those cases were not even discussed. Instead, the opposition was concentrated on the gruesome facts of the crimes. 
   I believe it was another member of the Missouri Supreme Court, one of those appointed by a Republican governor of Missouri, who wrote in his own sole dissent in a gruesome case of kidnaping, rape, and murder of a teenage girl:  
   Occasionally, the heinousness of a crime, the seeming certainty of the same result if the case is remanded and the delay occasioned by a second remand tempt one to wink at procedural defects. Nevertheless, the cornerstone of any civilized system of justice is that the rules are applied evenly to everyone no matter how despicable the crime.--State v. Nunley, 923 S.W.2d 911, 927 (Mo. 1996) (Holstein, J., dissenting).  
   Indeed, in his dissent in State v. Johnson, Justice White makes a similar point when he notes:  
   This is a very hard case. If Mr. Johnson was in control of his faculties when he went on this murderous rampage, then he assuredly deserves the death sentence he was given. But the question of what Mr. Johnson's mental status was on that night is not susceptible of easy answers. ..... This is an excellent example of why hard cases make bad law. While I share the majority's horror at this carnage, I cannot uphold this as an acceptable standard of representation for a defendant accused of capital murder.--State v. Johnson, 968 S.W.2d 123, 138 (Mo. 1998).  
   Although you would never know the legal issue involved in this case from the discussion before the Senate, the appellate decision did not turn on the grizzly facts or abhorrence of the crimes, but difficult legal questions concerning the standard by which an appellate court should evaluate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Justice White sought to apply the standard set by the United States Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), and reiterated in Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419 (1995). Thus, the dispute between Justice White and the majority was whether an appellant may succeed if he shows that there was a ``reasonable probability'' of a different result, or whether he is required to show that the counsel's unprofessional conduct was outcome-determinative and thus the ``most likely'' reason why his defense was unsuccessful. Indeed, the case turns on an issue similar to that being currently considered by the United States Supreme Court this term. Far from creating a ``new ground'' for appeal or urging a ``lower legal standard'' of review, Justice White's dissent sought to apply what he understood to be the current legal standard to the gruesome facts of a difficult case. 
   Likewise troubling was the use by those who opposed the nomination of Justice White's dissent in the Kinder case, a 1996 decision. State v. Kinder, 942 S.W.2d 313 (Mo. 1996). That case also arose from brutal crimes, which were, or course, detailed for the Senate. What is troubling is the characterization of the legal issue on appeal by Justice White's detractors. Justice White did not say that the case was ``contaminated by racial bias'' because the trial judge ``had indicated that he opposed affirmative action and had switched parties based on that.'' The dissent did not turn on the political affiliation of the judge or his opposition to affirmative action. In fact, Justice White expressly stated that the trial judge's position on affirmative action was ``irrelevant to the issue of bias.'' 
   Rather, the point of the dissent was that the majority opinion was changing the law of Missouri by reinterpreting state law precedent and restricting it in an artificially truncated way to avoid the recusal of the trial judge, which Missouri law at that time required. 
   The case led to long and complicated opinions by the majority and dissent. The opposition to Justice White chose to characterize the case as if the trial judge was accused of racial bias merely for not favoring affirmative action policies. In fact, the trial judge was facing an election and had issued a press release less than a week before the defendant's trial. The defendant was an indigent, unemployed African-American man. The judge's statement read, in pertinent part:  
   The truth is that I have noticed in recent years that the Democrat party places too much emphasis on representing minorities such as homosexuals, people who don't want to work, and people with a skin that's any color but white. . . . While minorities need to be represented, or [sic] course, I believe the time has come for us to place much more emphasis and concern on the hardworking taxpayers in this country.--Kinder, 942 S.W.2d at 321.  
   As Justice White's dissent correctly points out, the holding of the case rewrote Missouri Supreme Court precedent instead of following it. Without regard to the principles of stare decisis, following precedent, and avoiding judicial activism, the majority reversed Missouri law (without acknowledging that fact) to achieve a desired result. The majority opinion rests on the narrow proposition that only ``judicial statements'' that raise a doubt as to the judge's willingness to follow the law provide a basis for disqualification, and ``distinguished'' this case from controlling precedent because the evidence of racial bias was contained in what the majority characterized as a ``political statement.'' Justice Limbaugh, who had dissented from the earlier Missouri Supreme Court decision on which Justice White relied, wrote the majority opinion in Kinder, which stated:  
   To the extent the comments can be read to disparage minorities, there is little point in defending them, even as the political act they were intended to be. But they are a political act, not a judicial one, and as such, they do not necessarily have any bearing on the judge's in-court treatment of minorities.--Id. The majority opinion created a rule that consciously disregards political statements of a judge evidencing racial bias.  
   In his dissent, Justice White, quoting from the earlier Missouri Supreme Court decision, wrote: ```[F]undamental fairness requires that the trial judge be free of the appearance of prejudice against the defendant as an individual and against the racial group on which the defendant is a member.'' He noted that ``conduct suggesting racial bias `undermines the credibility of the judicial system and opens the integrity of the judicial system to question.''' Kinder, 942 S.W.2d at 341, citing State v. Smulls, 935 S.W.2d 9, 25-27 (Mo. 1986). 
   I believe that fairminded people who read and consider Justice White's dissent in Kinder will appreciate the strength of his legal reasoning. Certainly that was the reaction of Stuart Taylor, Jr. in his article in the October 16 National Journal and of Benjamin Wittes in his October 13 column in the Washington Post. Through the Kinder decision, the Missouri Supreme Court has created new law that provides very narrow restrictions on judges' conduct. Indeed, a Missouri criminal trial judge could now apparently lead a KKK rally one night and spout racial hatred, epithets and calls for racial conflict, and preside over the criminal trial of an African-American defendant the next morning--so long as he did not say anything offensive as a ``judicial statement'' in connection with the trial. 
   Fairness and credibility are important values for all government actions, and especially important to the guarantee of due process that makes our  justice system the best in the world. Those same qualities of fairness, credibility, and integrity are essential to the Senate confirmation process. 
   It is worth noting that many of the same critics of Justice White's opinion in the Kinder case adopt the opposite posture and a different standard when it comes to evaluating Judge Richard Paez, a nominee who has been held up without a vote for 44 months. Judge Paez is roundly criticized for a reference in a speech he gave in which he commented on the early stages of an initiative effort that later became Proposition 209 in California. Those who led the Republican fight against Justice White reverse themselves when it comes to opposing the Hispanic nominee from California and criticize him for much more circumspect comments predicting the likely reaction to that initiative in the Hispanic community. These critics would not only disqualify Judge Paez from hearing a case involving Proposition 209, but would disqualify him from confirmation as a federal appellate judge. 
   Justice White's detractors contend that they oppose ``judicial activism,'' which they define as a judge substituting his personal will for that of the legislature. However, in none of the cases on which they rely is a statute implicated. Instead, in each of these cases Justice White appears to be following controlling precedent. In the Kinder case, it is the majority that changed the law of Missouri. Likewise in the Johnson case, it was the majority that reached out to distinguish that case and alter the way in which the governing legal standard for review was to be applied. 
   Finally, the third case on which the opposition to Justice White relies, State v. Damask, 936 S.W.2d 565 (Mo. 1996), is not concerned with legislative action either. In this case, the Court upheld the constitutionality of law enforcement checkpoints without warrants or reasonable suspicion. The majority reached out to distinguish the case from governing precedent, changed the rules under which it viewed the governing facts, and challenged the factual basis on which the lower courts had based their conclusions. 
   In his dissent in Damask, Justice White relied on the authority of the United States Supreme Court in Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648 (1979). See also 
   Galberth v. U.S., 590 A.2d 990 (D.C. App. 1991). His ruling expressly recognizes the importance of combating drug trafficking and, relying on the record of the cases, concludes that the checkpoints were the types of discretionary investigatory stops forbidden by governing precedent. Justice White worried that these operations had not been approved by politically accountable public officials and that the courts should not substitute their judgment for law enforcement authorities and public officials who were responsible and accountable for designing such operations. See State v. Canton, 775 S.W.2d 352 (Mo. App. 1989); State v. Welch, 755 S.W.2d 624 (Mo. App. 1988); Note, ``The Constitutionality of Drug Enforcement Checkpoints in Missouri,'' 63 Mo. L. Rev. 263 (1998). I wonder how we all might feel if instead of seizing marijuana, the armed men in camouflage fatigues shining flashlights into the faces of motorists in an isolated area late at night were seizing firearms. 
   Another decision that has not been mentioned in the course of this debate on Justice White's nomination is the decision of the people of Missouri to retain Justice White as a member of their Supreme Court. Although initially appointed, pursuant to Missouri law Justice White went before the voters of Missouri in a retention election in 1996. I am informed that he received over 1.1 million votes and a favorable vote of 64.7 percent. 
   All of the cases on which the opposition to Justice White relied were decided before his hearing and before he was twice reported favorably by a bipartisan majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee in May 1998 and July 1999. Although Justice White was first nominated to the federal bench in 1997, the Judiciary Committee did not receive negative comments about him until quite recently. No law enforcement opposition of any kind was received by the Committee of the Senate in 1997 or 1998. 
   This year, Justice White was renominated with significant fanfare in January and major newspapers in the state reported on the status on the nomination. I began repeated calls for his consideration by February. The Committee finally proceeded to reconsider and report his nomination, again, in July 1999. Still, the Judiciary Committee received no opposition from Missouri law enforcement. 
   The first contact the Judiciary Committee received from Missouri law enforcement was a strong letter of support and endorsement from the Chief of Police of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department. I thank Colonel Henderson for contacting the Committee and sharing his views with us. I have recently read that the Missouri Police Chiefs Association, representing 465 members across the state, does not get involved in judicial nominations. I understand that policy because it is shared by many law enforcement organizations that I know. I also appreciate that when asked by a reporter recently, the president of the Missouri Police Chiefs Association described Justice White as ``an upright, fine individual'' and that he knew Justice White personally and really had ``a hard time seeing that he's against law enforcement'' and never thought of him as ``procriminal.'' 
   The Missouri State Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police has indicated on behalf of its 4,500 dedicated law enforcement officer members in Missouri, that they view Justice White's record as ``one of a jurist whose record on the death penalty has been far more supportive of the rights of victims than of the rights of criminals.'' They see his record as having voted to reverse the death penalty ``in far fewer instances than the other Justices on the Court'' and note that he ``also voted to affirm the death penalty in 41 cases.'' The Missouri Fraternal Order of Police expresses its regret for ``the needless injury which has been inflicted on the reputation of Justice White'' and concludes that ``our nation has been deprived of an individual who surely would have proven to be an asset to the Federal Judiciary.'' I thank President Thomas W. Mayer and all the FOP members in Missouri for speaking out on behalf of this fine judge and sharing their perspective with us. 
   I certainly understand and appreciate Sheriff Kenny Jones deciding to write to fellow sheriffs about this nomination. Sheriff Jones' wife was killed in the brutal rampage of James Johnson, from whose conviction and sentence Justice White dissented on legal grounds concerning the lack of competent representation the defendant received during the trial. All Senators give their respect and sympathy to Sheriff Jones and his family. 
   I also understand the petition sent by the Missouri Sheriffs Association to the Judiciary Committee as a result of Sheriff Jones' letter to other Missouri sheriffs. In early October, the Judiciary Committee received that petition along with a copy of Justice White's dissent in the Johnson case with a cover letter dated September 27. It is a statement of support for Sheriff Jones and shows remarkable restraint. The 63 Missouri county sheriffs and 9 others who signed the petition ``respectfully request that consideration be given to [Justice White's dissenting opinion in Johnson] as a factor in the appointment to fill this position of U.S. District Judge.'' 
   I want to assure the Missouri Sheriffs Association and all Senators that I took their concern seriously and reconsidered the dissent in that case to see whether I saw in it anything disqualifying or anything that would lead me to believe that Justice White would not support enforcement of the law. I respect them for having contacted us and for the way in which they did so. It is terribly hard to continue to honor those we have loved and lost by respecting the rule of law that guarantees constitutional rights to those accused, tried, and convicted of killing innocent members of our dedicated law enforcement community. 
   Whether the nomination of Justice White or consideration of the legal issues considered in his opinions ``sparked strong concerns'' among Missouri law enforcement officers, or whether controversy about this nomination was otherwise generated, I am not in position to know. I do know this: I respect and consider seriously the views of law enforcement officers. As a former State's Attorney and former  Vice President of the National District Attorneys Association, I hear often from local prosecutors, police and sheriffs, both in Vermont and around the country. I work closely with local law enforcement and national law enforcement organizations on a wide variety of issues. I know from my days in local law enforcement that there are often disagreements between police and prosecutors and with judges about cases. I 
   respect that difference and understand it. 
   With respect to the views expressed by law enforcement representatives on Justice Ronnie White's nomination, both for and against, I say the following: I have considered each of the letters produced during the course of the Senate debate and reconsidered the cases to which they refer. I respectfully disagree that those decisions present a basis to vote against the confirmation of Justice Ronnie White to the federal court. Far from presenting a pattern of ``procriminal jurisprudence'' or ``tremendous bent toward criminal activity,'' they are dissents well within the legal mainstream and well supported by precedent and legal authority. Further, if considered in the context of his body of work, achievements, and qualifications, they present no basis for voting against this highly qualified and widely respected nominee. I conclude, as did the Missouri State Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, that ``our nation has been deprived of an individual who surely would have proven to be an asset to the Federal Judiciary.'' 
   With all due respect, I do not believe that any constituency or interest group, even one as important as local law enforcement, is entitled to a Senate veto over a judicial nomination. Each Senator is elected to vote his or her conscience on these judicial appointments, not any special interest or party line. When Senators do not vote their conscience, they risk the debacle that we witnessed on October 5th, when a partisan political caucus vote resulted in a fine man and highly qualified nominee being rejected by all Republican Senators on a party line vote. 
   It is too late for the Senate to undo the harm done to Justice White. What the Senate can do now is to make sure that partisan error is not repeated. The Senate should ensure that other minority and women candidates receive a fair vote. We can start with the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, which have been held up far too long without Senate action. It is past time for the Senate to do the just thing, the honorable thing, and vote to confirm each of these highly qualified nominees. Let us start the healing process. Let us vote to confirm Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon before this session ends.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the most significant amendments that the Senate adopted this summer as part of the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill was the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. This legislation strengthens current law by making it easier for federal authorities to investigate and prosecute crimes based on race, color, religion, and national origin. It also focuses the attention and resources of the federal government on the problem of hate crimes committed against people because of their sexual orientation, gender, or disability. 
   I commend Senator KENNEDY for his leadership on this bill, and I am proud to have been an original cosponsor. Now is the time to pass this important legislation 
   Recent incidents of violent crimes motivated by hate and bigotry have shocked the American conscience and made it painfully clear that we as a nation still have serious work to do in protecting all Americans from these crimes and in ensuring equal rights for all our citizens. The answer to hate and bigotry must ultimately be found in increased respect and tolerance. But strengthening our Federal hate crimes legislation is a step in the right direction. 
   All Americans have the right to live, travel and gather where they choose. In the past we have responded as a nation to deter and to punish violent denials of civil rights. We have enacted federal laws to protect the civil rights of all of our citizens for more than 100 years. The Hate Crimes Prevention Act continues that great and honorable tradition. 
   Five months ago, Judy Shepard, the mother of hate crimes victim Matthew Shepard, called upon Congress to pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act without delay. Let me close by quoting her eloquent words:  
   Today, we have it within our power to send a very different message than the one received by the people who killed my son. It is time to stop living in denial and to address a real problem that is destroying families like mine, James Byrd Jr.'s, Billy Jack Gaither's and many others across America. ..... We need to decide what kind of nation we want to be. One that treats all people with dignity and respect, or one that allows some people and their family members to be marginalized.  
   There are still a few weeks left in this session; we should pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act this year.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think Mark Twain once referred to how nice it is to hear your eulogy while you are still alive. I do appreciate hearing from my friends, my distinguished colleague  from South Dakota, the closest friend I have ever had, the distinguished Democratic leader, and the kind words he had to say; my good friend from Mississippi, the distinguished majority leader; and, of course, my colleague who I have known for longer than anybody in this body, the distinguished Senator from Vermont, JIM JEFFORDS. 
   These comments mean a great deal. That Vice President GORE, presided at the time of the vote meant a lot to me. I will note that the Vice President said earlier today: Boy, that guy LEAHY must be awfully old. 
   I point out the Vice President and I have the same birthday, March 31--about 8 years apart. 
   I have served here with so many. I see my dear friend and aisle mate, the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, who has cast the most votes in history--over 15,000 votes, and my good friend, the President pro tempore, the distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina, STROM THURMOND, who has the second most votes ever cast in this body. 
   I think of the people with whom I have served during the 25 years I have served, people such as Scoop Jackson and Mike Mansfield, Jacob Javits, John Stennis, Hubert Humphrey, and Bob Dole. The two closest friends I had in my class were a Republican and a Democrat: Paul Laxalt and John Glenn; and so many others who I served with including two colleagues from Vermont, Bob Stafford and JIM JEFFORDS. 
   How fortunate I am to serve with the men and women of this body; every one of whom is a close friend--those such as the distinguished Senator from Utah with whom I work on the Judiciary Committee; those with whom I work on the Appropriations Committee, the chairman of our subcommittee, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, and the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska, the chairman of the committee--he and Senator BYRD have taught me so much as I have served on that committee--those with whom I serve on Agriculture, my good friend, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, DICK LUGAR, and others. There are so many of you. 
   When I came here the country was very much at risk and the Senate was in good bipartisan shape. Today the country is doing very well, and we sometimes break down too much along partisan lines. I think this is unfortunate. Those of us who have served here a long time know it does not have to be that way. We know the country is better when we work together. I think of traveling with my friend from Mississippi, the distinguished senior Senator from Mississippi, THAD COCHRAN, when we went to our home States. We find, even though we are of different philosophies, there are so many things in common, so we can work together. 
   I hope we can do more and more of that. If I may say to all my friends, nothing I can ever do in life will give me greater pleasure or humble me more than serving in this body. There are only 100 of us who might be here at any given time to represent a great nation of a quarter of a billion people. Think of the responsibility that is for all of us. These are the finest men and women, in both parties, I have ever known. 
   When Marcelle and I came to this city, we didn't knew how long we were going to be here. I was the junior-most Member of this body, the junior-most Member--No. 99 in then a 99-Member Senate, because of a tie vote in New Hampshire. I sat way over in that corner. 
   I looked at Senators, people such as TED KENNEDY or Frank Church or Barry Goldwater, who would walk in here--people I knew from Time magazine covers or from the news--and suddenly realized, I am here. I remember that day in January when I stood up to cast my first vote and then quickly sat down. I also remember what Senator Mansfield, our leader, told me: Always keep your word, he said, and don't worry if you think you cast a vote wrong; the issue will come back. It does. I have found that is true after 10,000 votes. 
   So I think now I have been here long enough that this week I will finally do something I have been putting off for 25 years. I will carve my name in my desk. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator GRASSLEY, Senator TORRICELLI, Senator KOHL, and Senator SCHUMER in introducing the Multi-District Jurisdiction Act of 1999. Our bipartisan legislation is needed by Federal judges across the country to restore their power to promote the fair and efficient administration of justice in multi-district litigation. 
   Current law authorizes the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation to transfer related cases, pending in multiple Federal judicial districts, to a single district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. This makes good sense because transfers by the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation are based on centralizing those cases to serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and to promote efficient judicial management. 
   For nearly 30 years, many transferee judges, following circuit and district court case law, retained these multi-district cases for trial because the transferee judge and the parties were already familiar with each other and the facts of the case through the pretrial proceedings. The Supreme Court in Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U.S. 26 (1998), however, found that this well-established practice was not authorized by the general venue provisions in the United States Code. Following the Lexecon ruling, the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation must now remand each transferred case to its original district at the conclusion of the pretrial proceedings, unless the case is already settled or otherwise terminated. This new process is costly, inefficient and time consuming. 
   The Multi-District Jurisdiction Act of 1999 seeks to restore the power of transferee judges to resolve multi-district cases as expeditiously and fairly as possible. Our bipartisan bill amends section 1407 of title 28 of the United States Code to allow a transferee judge to retain cases for trial or transfer those cases to another judicial district for trial in the interests of justice and for the convenience of parties and witnesses. The legislation provides transferee judges the flexibility they need to administer justice quickly and efficiently. Indeed, our legislation is supported by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the Judicial Conference of the United States and the Department of Justice. 
   In addition, we have included a section in our bill to ensure fairness during the determination of compensatory damages by adding the presumption that the case will be remanded to the transferor court for this phase of the trial. Specifically, this provision provides that to the extent a case is tried outside of the transferor forum, it would be solely for the purpose of a consolidated trial on liability, and if appropriate, punitive damages, and that the case must be remanded to the transferor court for the purposes of trial on compensatory damages, unless the court to which the action has been transferred for trial purposes also finds, for the convenience of the parties and witnesses and in the interests of justice, that the action should be retained for the determination of compensatory damages. This section is identical to a bipartisan amendment proposed by Representative BERMAN and accepted by the House Judiciary Committee during its consideration of similar legislation earlier this year. 
   Multi-district litigation generally involves some of the most complex fact-specific cases, which affect the lives of citizens across the nation. For example, multi-district litigation entails such national legal matters as asbestos, silicone gel breast implants, diet drugs like fen-phen, hemophiliac blood products, Norplant contraceptives and all major airplane crashes. In fact, as of February 1999, approximately 140 transferee judges were supervising about 160 groups of multi-district cases, with each group composed of hundreds, or even thousands, of cases in various stages of trial development. 
   But the efficient case management of these multi-district cases is a risk after the Lexecon ruling. Judge John F. Nangle, Chairman of the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation, recently testified before Congress that: ``Since Lexecon, significant problems have arisen that have hindered the sensible conduct of multi-district litigation. Transferee judges throughout the United States have voiced their concern to me about the urgent need to enact this legislation.'' 
   Mr. President, Congress should listen to the concerned voices of our Federal Judiciary and swiftly approve the Multi-District Jurisdiction Act of 1999 to improve judicial efficiency in our Federal courts.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the senior Senator from Ohio in introducing the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act. Our bipartisan legislation builds on the successful passage into law of the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998, which Senator DEWINE and I sponsored in the last Congress. Our bill also complements S. 249, the Missing, Exploited and Runaway Children Protection Act, which Senator HATCH and I worked together to steer to final passage just last month. 
   Unfortunately, the number of abused or neglected children in this country nearly doubled between 1986 and 1993. Each day there are 9,000 reports of child abuse in America and more than three million cases annually of abused or neglected children. In my home state of Vermont, 2,309 children were reported to child protective services for child abuse or neglect investigations in 1997, the last year data is available. After investigation, 1,041 of these reports found substantiated cases of child maltreatment in Vermont. 
   Each child behind these statistics is an American tragedy.  
   But we can help. The Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act provides these abused or neglected children with the Federal assistance that they deserve. And our legislation can make a real difference in the lives of our nation's children without any additional cost to taxpayers. 
   Our bipartisan legislation will make a difference by giving State and local officials the flexibility to use existing Department of Justice grant programs to prevent child abuse and neglect, investigate child abuse and neglect crimes and protect children who have suffered from abuse and neglect. The bill does this by making three changes to current law. 
   First, the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act amends the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998 to make grant dollars available specifically to enhance the capability of criminal history information to agencies and workers for child welfare, child abuse and adoption purposes. Congress has authorized $250 million annually for grants under the Crime Identification Technology Act. 
   Second, the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act amends the Byrne Grant Program to permit funds to be used for enforcing child abuse and neglect laws, including laws protecting against child sexual abuse, and promoting programs designed to prevent child abuse and neglect. Congress has traditionally funded the Byrne Grant Program at about $500 million a year. 
   Third, the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act doubles the available funds, from $10 million to $20 million, for grants to each State for child abuse treatment and prevention from the Crime Victims Fund. This fund is financed through the collection of criminal fines, penalties and other assessments against persons convicted of crimes against the United States. In the 1998 fiscal year, the Crime Victims Fund held $363 million. To ensure that other crime victim programs support by the Fund are not reduced, the expansion of the child abuse treatment and prevention earmark applies only when the Fund exceeds $363 million in a fiscal year. This year, the Crime Victims Fund is expected to collect more than $1 billion due in part to large anti-trust penalties. 
   Despite the tireless efforts of concerned Vermonters, including the many dedicated workers and volunteers at Prevent Child Abuse in Vermont and the Vermont Department of Social and Rehabilitative Services, Vermont is below the national average for its ability to provide services to abused or neglected children. In 1997, 411 children found to be abused or neglected received no services, about 40 percent of investigated cases. Nationally, about 25 percent of all abused or neglected children received no services. Our legislation provides more resources to help Vermonters and other Americans provide services to all abused or neglected children. 
   I thank the many advocates who support our bill and the companion legislation introduced by Representatives PRYCE and STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES, H.R. 764, which passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 425-2 on October 5, 1999. These advocates include the diverse National Child Abuse Coalition: ACTION for Child Protection; Alliance for Children and Families; American Academy of Pediatrics; American Bar Association; American Dental Association; American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children; American Prosecutors Research Institute; American Psychological Association; Association of Junior Leagues International; Boy Scouts of America; Child Welfare League of America; Childhelp USA; Children's Defense Fund; General Federation of Women's Club; National Alliance of Children's Trust and Prevention Funds; National Association of Child Advocates; National Association of Counsel for Children; National Association of Social Workers; National Children's Alliance; National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse; National Council of Jewish Women; National Court Appointed Special Advocates Association; National Education Association; National Exchange Club Foundation for Prevention of Child Abuse; National Network for Youth; National PTA; Parents Anonymous; and Parents United. In addition, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and Prevent Child Abuse America have endorsed our bill and its House counterpart. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act for the sake of our nation's children.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the most significant amendments that the Senate adopted as part of the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill is the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. This legislation amends the federal hate crimes statute to make it easier for federal law enforcement officials to investigate and prosecute cases of racial and religious violence. It also focuses the attention and resources of the Federal Government on the problem of hate crimes committed against people because of their sexual orientation, gender, or disability. I commend Senator KENNEDY for his leadership on this bill, and I am proud to have been an original cosponsor. 
   It is time to pass this important legislation. It has been over a year since the fatal beating of Matthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyoming, and the dragging death of James Byrd in Jaspar, Texas--brutal attacks that stunned the Nation. 
   Since those incidents, we have seen other acts of violence motivated by hate and bigotry, including the horrific incident two months ago in Los Angeles, when a gunman burst into a Jewish community center and opened fire on a room full of young children. When the gunman surrendered, he said that his rampage had been motivated by his hatred of Jews. The month before, a murderous string of drive-by shootings in Illinois and Indiana left two people dead and nine wounded. Again, the motivation was racial and religious hate. 
   These are sensational crimes, the ones that focus public attention. But there also is a toll we are paying each year in other hate crimes that find less notoriety, but with no less suffering for the victims and their families. 
   All Americans have the right to live, travel and gather where they choose. In the past we have responded as a nation to deter and to punish violent denials of civil rights. We have enacted federal laws to protect the civil rights of all of our citizens for more than 100 years. The Hate Crimes Prevention Act continues that great and honorable tradition. 
   When the Senate passed the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill  last month, there seemed to be general agreement about the need to strengthen our national hate crimes laws. Both the Hate Crimes Prevention Act and a more limited hate crimes bill sponsored by Senator HATCH were included in the managers' amendment by unanimous consent. These bills complement and do not conflict with each other, and Senator KENNEDY and I have been working hard to address Senator HATCH's concerns about our legislation. 
   I had hoped that a consensus provision would be worked out in time for us to report as part of this appropriations bill, and I am disappointed that we have been unable to meet this deadline. 
   Five months ago, Matthew Shepard's mother testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee and called upon Congress to pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act without delay. Let me echo her eloquent words:  
   Today, we have it within our power to send a very different message than the one received by the people who killed my son. It is time to stop living in denial and to address a real problem that is destroying families like mine, James Byrd Jr.'s, Billy Jack Gaither's and many others across America. ..... We need to decide what kind of nation we want to be. One that treats all people with dignity and respect, or one that allows some people and their family members to be marginalized.  
   There are still a few weeks left in this session; we should pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act this year.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this Chamber is where 50 years ago this month, in October 1949, the Senate confirmed President Truman's nomination of William Henry Hastie to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the first Senate confirmation of an African-American to our federal district courts and courts of appeal. Indeed, today is the 50th anniversary of that historic event. This Senate is where some 30 years ago the Senate confirmed President Johnson's nomination of Thurgood Marshall to the United States Supreme Court. And this is where last week, the Senate wrongfully rejected President Clinton's nomination of Justice Ronnie White. That vote made me doubt seriously whether this Senate, serving at the end of a half century of progress, would have voted to confirm Judge Hastie or Justice Marshall. 
   For the first time in almost 50 years a nominee to a Federal district court was defeated by the United States Senate. There was no Senate debate that day on the nomination. There was no open discussion--just that which took place behind the closed doors of the Republican caucus lunch that led to the party line vote. On October 5, 1999, the Senate Republicans voted in lockstep to reject the nomination of Justice Ronnie White to the Federal court in Missouri. 
   For many months I had been calling for a fair vote on the nomination, which had been delayed for 27 months. Instead, the country witnessed a partisan vote and a party line vote as the 54 Republican members of the Senate present that day all voted against confirming this highly qualified African-American jurist to the Federal bench. 
   Tuesday of last week the Republican Senate caucus blocked confirmation of Justice Ronnie White. It is too late for the Senate to undo the harm done by that caucus vote, although I would hope that some who voted based on inaccurate characterizations of Justice White and his record would apologize to him. What the Senate can do and must do now is to make sure that partisan error is not repeated. The Senate should ensure that other minority and women candidates receive a fair vote. We can start with the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, which have been held up far too long without Senate action. It is past time for the Senate to do the just thing, the honorable thing, and vote to confirm each of these highly qualified nominees. 
   Likewise, we should be moving forward to consider the nomination of Judge Julio Fuentes to the Third Circuit. His nomination has already been pending for over seven months. He should get a hearing and prompt consideration. He should be accorded a fair up or down vote on his nomination before the Senate adjourns this year. 
   The bipartisan Task Force on Judicial Selection of Citizens for Independent Courts recently recommended that the Senate complete its consideration of judicial nominations within 60 days. The Senate has already exceeded that time with respect to the nomination of Judge Ann Williams to the Seventh Circuit. When confirmed, she will be the first African-American to serve on that court. We should proceed on that nomination without further delay. 
   Likewise, the Senate should be moving forward to consider the 
   nomination of Judge James Wynn, Jr. to the Fourth Circuit. When confirmed, Judge  Wynn will be the first African-American to serve on the Fourth Circuit and will fill a judicial emergency vacancy. Fifty years has passed since the confirmation of Judge Hastie to the Third Circuit and still there has never been an African-American on the Fourth Circuit. The nomination of Judge James A. Beaty, Jr., was previously sent to us by President Clinton in 1995. That nomination was never considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee or the Senate and was returned to President Clinton without action at the end of 1998. It is time for the Senate to act on a qualified African-American nominee to the Fourth Circuit. 
   In addition, early next year the Senate should act favorably on the nominations of Kathleen McCree Lewis to the Sixth Circuit and Enrique Moreno to the Fifth Circuit. Mr. Moreno succeeded to the nomination of Jorge Rangel on which the Senate refused to act last Congress. These are both well qualified nominees who will add to the capabilities and diversity of those courts. In fact, the Chief Judge of the Fifth Circuit has this month declared that a judicial emergency exists on that court, caused by the number of judicial vacancies, lack of Senate action on pending nominations, and overwhelming workload. 
   I have noted the unfortunate pattern that the Republican Senate has established by delaying consideration of too many women and minority nominees. The recent Republican caucus vote against Justice Ronnie White is the most egregious example, but the treatment of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon show that it is, unfortunately, not an isolated example. 
   Filling these vacancies with qualified nominees is the concern of all Americans. The Senate should treat minority and women nominees fairly and proceed to consider them with the same speed and deference that it shows other nominees. Let us start the healing process. Let us vote to confirm Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon before this month ends; Judge Julio Fuentes before the Senate adjourns in November; and Judge Ann Williams, Judge James Wynn, Kathleen McCree Lewis, and Enrique Moreno in the first weeks of next year.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator FITZGERALD in cosponsoring the Electronic Benefit Interoperability and Portability Act of 1999. 
   The Food Stamp Program has been critical to diminishing hunger and improving nutrition and health throughout our country. As the country's largest source of food aid, approximately 18 million people--half of which are children--receive food stamp benefits every month. In my home State of Vermont, more than 20,000 households depend on food stamps to help feed their families. 
   In an effort to strengthen and streamline the Food Stamp Program, three years ago Congress mandated that every State switch to an Electronic Benefits Transfer system for distributing food stamp benefits. Operating like ATM or credit card machines at cash registers, EBT streamlines food stamps by eliminating the cumbersome paper system. 
   The implementation of the EBT system was left up to the States, and nearly 40 States currently have switched to this new system. EBT has already demonstrated itself to be a more efficient system for distributing food stamp benefits, and it promises to help reduce food stamp fraud. 
   However, three years into the implementation of EBT, a problem has arisen--some State EBT systems do not match up with neighboring State EBT systems, leaving residents of border communities unable to utilize their food stamp benefits across State lines. This Federal benefit program has always been recognized and redeemable in every State, irrespective of where the actual food stamps were issued. 
   For some of our more rural States, the inability to access food stamp benefits across State lines could mean the difference between traveling a few miles to a grocery store in the next State to traveling an hour or more to the closest grocery store in one's home State. Clearly, this creates quite a burden. 
   The bill which we are introducing today would correct this oversight by requiring the U.S. Department of Agriculture to adopt a national EBT standard, and requiring that all States be EBT interoperable by 2002. 
   Vermont Commissioner of Social Welfare Jane Kitchel has voiced her support for this bill, as has the New England Convenience Store Association. 
   Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator FITZGERALD for all of his work on this issue. I believe that this bill will help make the Food Stamp Program more streamlined and efficient, and I am proud to cosponsor this legislation.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I know a number of Members are waiting to speak. 
   The Governors and legislators in the six New England States had five goals in mind when they enacted the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact into law in each of their States. 
   They wanted to assure fresh, local supplies of milk to consumers. In fact, they wanted to do it at lower prices than found in most other parts of the Nation. They wanted to keep dairy farmers in business, they wanted to protect New England's rural environment, and they wanted to do this without burdening Federal taxpayers. 
   It turned out the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact was a stirring success on every one of these points. But it also had an added benefit. It increased interstate trade into the region as neighboring farmers took advantage of the compact. Not only did prices come down, but the number of farmers going out of business has declined throughout New England for the first time in many years. We find there are still some who favor having Federal bureaucrats run this farm program, at a cost to the taxpayers, instead of the States themselves, with no cost to the taxpayers. 
   Because it has been so successful, half the Governors in the Nation, half the State legislatures in the Nation, asked that the Congress allow their States to set their own dairy policies, within certain limits, through interstate compacts that, again, cost taxpayers nothing. The dairy compact legislation passed in these States overwhelmingly. 
   Perhaps most significant, and I mention this because we have heard those from Minnesota and Wisconsin attack this, what they do not tell us is that the retail milk prices in New England not only average lower than the rest of the Nation, but they are much lower than the milk prices in Minnesota and Wisconsin. So those in these parts of the country who are attacking the Northeast Dairy Compact say they are concerned about consumers and ignore the fact that consumers pay a lot more in their States than they do in New England. 
   One has to ask, Why does anybody oppose the Dairy Compact? GAO and OMB report that consumer prices are lower and farm income is higher than the average for the rest of the country, without increased cost to the taxpayers. Why would anybody oppose it? 
   One of the things I learned long ago is to follow the money, and there is one group making a whole lot of money on this issue. They are the huge milk manufacturers, such as Suiza, or Kraft which is owned by Philip Morris, or other processors represented by the International Dairy Foods Association. They oppose the compact not because they care for the consumers, not because they care for the farmers, but because they care for their own huge, bloated profits. 
   Indeed, they sent around corporate front organizations to speak for them. One was the Public Voice for Food and Health Policy. When it finally became clear that Public Voice was going around fronting for these organizations, and that their policies were determined not by what was best for everybody but by corporate dollars, they finally went out of business. 
   I've talked about the close alliances between a lead executive who handled compact issues for Public Voice who negotiated a job to represent the huge processors. 
   I will give the press another lead on the next public interest group whose funding should be investigated, the Consumer Federation of America. One of their officers, formerly from Public Voice, has been going around Capitol Hill offices with lobbyists representing dairy processors. 
   One might ask why would Philip Morris want to use these organizations instead of going directly to the editorial boards of the New York Times or the Washington Post to bad mouth the compact? Why not have somebody who appears to be representing the consumers rather than Philip Morris coming in and talking about it? 
   The consumer representative, being paid by the big processors, could come in and say: Editorial board members, milk prices are higher for children in the School Lunch Program under this compact. 
   We ought to compare those prices. Let's compare the retail milk prices in New England against retail milk prices in the upper Midwest. A gallon of whole milk in Augusta, ME, was $2.47. 
   The price was up to 50 cents more in Minneapolis, MN, the area opponents used as an example of how to save money. 
   I think we ought to take a look at these issues because when we hear some of the big companies, such as Philip Morris and Kraft and Suiza, saying, well, it's not the money. But you know, of course, it is the money. When they say ``we are here because we're concerned about the consumers,'' you know--with their track record--that the consumer is the last thing on their mind. And when these processor groups say they want to protect the farmer ..... oh, Lordy, don't ever, ever believe that, because there is not a farmer in this country who would. 
   Lastly, if anybody tells you the dairy compact will cost you money, I point out, not only does it not cost taxpayers any money, but the cost of milk is much lower than in States without a compact. 
   Mr. President, the Governors and legislators in the six New England states had five goals in mind when they enacted the Compact into law in each of their states. 
   They wanted to assure fresh, local supplies of milk to consumers--at lower prices than found in most of the nation--they wanted to keep dairy farmers in business, they wanted to protect the New England's rural environment from sprawl and destructive development, and they wanted to do this without burdening federal taxpayers. 
   The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has delivered beyond the expectations of those Governors and state legislators. 
   The Compact provided an added benefit--it has also increased interstate trade into the region as neighboring farmers took advantage of the Compact. 
   This great idea--coming from those six New England states--has created a successful and enduring partnership between dairy farmers and consumers throughout New England. 
   Thanks to the Northeast Compact, the number of farmers going out of business has declined throughout New England--for the first time in many years. 
   It is unfortunate that most still favor federal bureaucrats running the farm programs--I think Congress should look at more zero-cost state-initiated programs rather than turning a deaf ear to the pleas of state legislators. 
   Indeed, half the Governors in the nation, and half the state legislatures in the nation, asked that the Congress allow their states to set their own dairy policies--within federally mandated limits--through interstate compacts that cost taxpayers nothing. 
   And the dairy compact legislation passed with overwhelming support in almost all these states. 
   One of the most difficult challenges posed by the New England Governors is that the Compact had to cost nothing--yet deliver a benefit to farmers. The Compact is scored by CBO as having no costs to the Federal treasury. 
   Major environmental groups have endorsed the Northeast Dairy Compact because they know it helps preserve farmland and prevent urban sprawl. Indeed, a New York Times and a National Geographic article that I mentioned yesterday discuss the importance of keeping dairy farmers in business from an environmental standpoint. 
   Perhaps most significantly, retail milk prices in New England average lower than the rest of the nation and much lower than milk prices in Minnesota and Wisconsin, according to GAO. 
   The question is: why does anyone in America oppose the dairy compact? Since GAO and OMB report that consumer prices are lower and farm income is higher than the average for the rest of the country, without increased costs to taxpayers, why does anyone oppose the Compact? 
   The answer is simple, huge milk manufacturers--such as Suiza, headquartered in Texas, Kraft which is owned by the tobacco giant Philip Morris, other processors represented by the International Dairy Foods Association--oppose the Compact. 
   Even the most junior investigative reporter could figure out the answer to my question with the above information. All anyone has to do is look up the donations made by these, and other, giant processors. All the negative news stories about the compact have their genesis in efforts by these giant processors and their front organizations. 
   I have explained the details of this on the Senate floor so scholars who want to know what really happened can check the public records and the lobby registration forms. 
   Indeed, one of the corporate front organizations--Public Voice for Food and Health Policy--apparently could not continue to exist when it was so obvious that their policies where determined by corporate dollars rather than good policy. 
   A simple glance at the list of corporations who funded and attended their functions could be easily researched by any reporter. It will demonstrate that sad and disturbing relationship--now ended as Public Voice had to close up shop because it lost its conscience. 
   I have detailed the close alliances between their lead executive who handled compact issues for them and the job he negotiated to represent the huge processors a couple of times on the Senate floor. 
   I will give the press another lead on the next public interest group whose funding should be investigated--the Consumer Federation of America. Indeed, one of their officers--formerly from Public Voice--is being taken around Capitol Hill offices by lobbyists representing processors. A glance at who funds their functions and efforts will be as instruction as investigations of Public Voice. 
   Why should Philip Morris or Kraft want to use these organizations instead of directly going to the editorial boards of the New York Times or the Washington Post to badmouth the compact? The question does not need me to provide the answer. 
   What would be the best attack--whether true or not--on the Compact that might swing public opinion? 
   It might be to simply allege that milk prices are higher for children in the school lunch program. Who would the editorial boards more likely listen to regarding school children: a public interest group or a tobacco company? 
   By the way, I would be happy to compare milk prices after the Compact was fully implemented. 
   I would be pleased to compare retail milk prices in New England against retail milk prices in the Upper Midwest.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues today in opposition to the Fiscal Year 2000 Agriculture Appropriations Conference bill. Usually, it's a testimony to someone's power when they can ``kill two birds with one stone.'' Well, amazingly the managers of this bill were able to kill three birds with one stone - - the Northeast Dairy Compact, drought relief and agricultural sanctions. 
   Unfortunately, the impact felt by small farmers in the Northeast will be meteoric. I have heard from many of my colleagues about the price drops their farmers have experienced this year. Well, dairy farmers witnessed a 40 percent price drop in one month. If it was not for the Northeast Dairy Compact, this drop could have crushed Vermont dairy farmers. 
   They have also suffered through one of the worst droughts this century. And how does this Conference bill respond? It doesn't. 
   Instead, the Conference Committee blocked Senator SPECTER from even raising his amendment to extend the Northeast Dairy Compact and denied any targeted disaster relief for farmers in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic who suffered through fifteen months of drought. 
   However, we are yet again sending disaster payments and price supports to the Midwest and Southeast. I guess the Conference committee decided to ignore the old adage that you should not hit someone when they are down. Why not continue to prop up grain prices so that when Vermont farmers have lost all their livestock feed to the drought they can pay even more for feed from other states? 
   When we passed the Freedom to Farm bill, one of the premises its success was based on was that farmers would also have the freedom to market. By expanding our markets overseas, our farmers would not have to depend on subsidies from the federal government. Yet, after the Senate overwhelmingly passed an amendment to update our sanctions policy and allow our farmers access to more markets, the Conference committee decided to continue with the old system of guaranteeing farmers the price they want through artificial means and expect taxpayers to go along with it. 
   Now, I am sure that many of these crops did suffer significant price or market losses and may deserve assistance. But, farmers in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic are just as worthy. In Vermont alone, we have witnessed over $40 million in drought damage. Without some assistance many of our farmers are not going to make it through the winter. In the last two years they have suffered through an ice storm, flooding, and two summers of drought. 
   What is so galling to me is that although Congress authorized $10.6 billion in disaster payments in Fiscal Year 1999, the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic have only received 2.5 percent of that assistance. Today, we will likely pass $8.7 billion in disaster assistance and our farmers will probably only receive 2 cents out of every dollar. 
   Adding salt to our wounds, the Conference Committee also saw fit to block any extension of the Northeast Dairy Compact. Our region developed and implemented a system to help our dairy farmers at no cost to the federal government. 
   I cannot understand how it made sense to the Conferees to stop a program that is supported by farmers and consumers alike because it does not increase retail price and does not cost the taxpayers money while continuing programs that do cost the taxpayers money. In fact, retail milk prices within the Compact region are lower on average than in the rest of the nation. 
   I could go on for hours about the ironies contained in this Conference bill. Although I am tempted to run through the virtues of Vermont dairy products like my colleague from Wisconsin did last week, I will let the ``Best Cheddar'' award won by Vermont's Cabot Creamery at the U.S. Championship Cheese Contest in Green Bay, Wisconsin speak for itself. 
   However, I do want to take just a few more minutes to reiterate the importance of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. Thanks to the Northeast Compact, the number of farmers going out of business has declined throughout New England--for the first time in many years. 
   If you are a proponent of states' rights, regional dairy compacts are the answer. Compacts are state-initiated, state-ratified and state-supported programs that assure a safe supply of milk for consumers. Half the Governors in the nation and half the state legislatures asked Congress to allow their states to set their own dairy policies--within federally mandated limits--through compacts. 
   When it was clear that federal policies were not working to keep dairy farmers in business, states took the matter into their own hands to insure that dairy farmers stay in business and to assure consumers fresh, local supplies of milk. It saddens me that Congress is now standing in their way. 
   The Northeast Compact has done exactly what it was established to do: stabilize fluctuating dairy prices, insure a fair price for dairy farmers, keep them in business, and protect consumers' supplies of fresh milk. Many of our friends in the South saw how the Compact provided a modest but crucial safety net for struggling farmers. They, too, want the same for their farmers, and their farmers deserve that same opportunity. 
   Unfortunately, opponents of dairy compacts--large and wealthy milk manufacturers, represented by groups such as the International Dairy Foods Association--have thrown millions of dollars into an all-out campaign to stop compacts. These processor groups are opposed to dairy compacts simply because they want milk as cheap as they can get it to boost their enormous profits to record levels, regardless of the impact on farmers. 
   Mr. President, it is time for Congress to go back to worrying about small farmers in this country. That is why this Conference bill is such a disappointment to so many of us. The triple whammy of blocking the Northeast Dairy Compact, providing no drought relief and closing the door to new markets will jeopardize the future of small farmers in my region.  
   These farmers do not usually come to Congress asking for help and they have rarely received it. Now, when they are facing one of their bleakest moments Congress has said ``no.'' I expected better.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is with regret, after 25 years in this Chamber, a Chamber I love so much, that I say it is a travesty the Senate is on the verge of rejecting the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. The idea of a treaty banning all nuclear tests has been around since President Dwight Eisenhower called for one more than 40 years ago when I was 19 years old. 
   Today, there is broad agreement around the world that a test ban treaty is necessary and, I point out to my colleagues, we have not conducted a nuclear test since President Bush signed legislation to establish a moratorium on nuclear testing in 1992. 
   Mr. President, 152 nations have signed this treaty. They are abiding by its terms, but if we vote against ratification, if we vote against advising and consenting, the Senate will abdicate our Nation's role as the world leader in support of nonproliferation. The 100 people in this body representing a quarter of a billion people will abdicate our Nation's responsibility to ourselves and the world. 
   I am bewildered at the arguments made by some of my colleagues because the United States, which enjoys an immense global nuclear advantage over all other countries, will only find that position eroded if a global ban on testing is not realized. 
   Treaty opponents make two main arguments: that it is unverifiable and that the safety and reliability of our own weapons will be endangered without testing. In my judgment, both arguments fail miserably. 
   As I said before, no treaty is 100% verifiable, and the fact is that any nation bent on developing a nuclear weapon can fashion a crude device, with or without this treaty. But without the explosive testing that this treaty prohibits, it will be extremely difficult to build nuclear weapons small enough to be mounted on delivery vehicles. 
   The critical question we should be asking is if this treaty will make it significantly harder for potential evaders to test nuclear weapons. The answer is a resounding yes. This treaty establishes a monitoring system that includes over 300 stations that will help locate the origin of a test. Last year, when India tested two nuclear devices simultaneously, the seismic waves that they created were recorded by 62 of these prototype stations. 
   Once a test has been detected, the treaty has a short-notice on-site inspection regime so questionable incidents can be resolved quickly. In short, the treaty makes it much more difficult for signatory nations to test nuclear weapons without alerting the international community and incurring their collective condemnation. 
   The argument that the CTBT will somehow undermine the safety and reliability of our own stockpile is likewise flawed. We have conducted over 1,000 nuclear tests during the last 54 years, the most of any country in the world. We have extensive knowledge of how to build and maintain nuclear weapons reliably. Moreover, the Clinton Administration is planning a 10 year, $45 billion Stockpile Stewardship Program that will develop unprecedented supercomputing simulations that will further ensure the continued reliability of our weapons. 
   I question whether we need to spend that much money, but I find it ironic that many of the voices who are questioning the technical merits of Stockpile Stewardship Program are the same people who want to spend tens of billions more on a National Missile Defense System that has shown modest technical progress, to say the least. 
   We have a treaty before us which will curb the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It should have been ratified years ago. I urge my colleagues to join me in setting aside short-term politics. Vote for the instruments of ratification. The Senate should be the conscience of our Nation, the conscience of the world. If we vote this down, it is not.

   Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Senator from Kansas. 
   Mr. President, I know time is limited, so I would ask the indulgence of the senior Senator from Mississippi and assume that the RECORD stretched on for hours for the praise I would put upon his shoulders. Actually, I do not say that as facetiously as it may sound. 
   I have served here for a lot of years. I know of no Senator who is a finer Senator, with more integrity or greater abilities than the senior Senator from Mississippi. On top of that, he is one of the closest friends I have in the Senate. I know he has driven mightily in this bill to include a lot of things necessary for parts of the country, staying within the caps. 
   My concern is one in the Northeast, that while we hear of talk about supplementals to help us later on--the administration or whoever saying, the check is in the mail--this does not help us. In my little State of Vermont, we have witnessed over $40 million just in drought damage. Most of our feed grains were lost this year. Without some assistance, many of our farmers are not going to make it through the winter. In the last 2 years, they have suffered through an ice storm where it dropped to 30 below zero. There has been flooding and two summers of drought. 
   Congress authorized $10.6 billion in disaster payments in fiscal year 1999. The Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic got 2.5 percent of that. Today or tomorrow we will likely pass $8.7 billion in disaster assistance. Our farmers will get about 2 cents out of every dollar. 
   According to Secretary Glickman, the drought resulted in a total of $1.5 to $2 billion in damages already this year. The recent rains did not alleviate that. Our farmers need additional funding now that is targeted for crop, feed, and livestock losses caused by the drought. We need drought funding for the crop loss disaster assistance program to help cover crop losses, livestock feed assistance to address feed shortages, the Emergency Conservation Program to restore failed water supplies. 
   Without funding targeted drought recovery, most of the $1.2 billion will likely go to the Southern States to recover from Hurricane Floyd. And they need that funding. I am not asking we take that funding away from them. I am asking we take care of their needs, but let's not neglect the needs of the Northeast and the mid-Atlantic States. 
   I wish we would vote against cloture. Then the President 
   would say, wait a minute, maybe we ought to put together a supplemental request for victims of Hurricane Floyd, so the $1.2 billion in the Agriculture appropriations bill could be used for drought relief. 
   We in the East, east coast Senators, Northeast Senators, have always been there to vote for disaster assistance for other parts of the country, even though it has not affected us: earthquake assistance for California, flood assistance for the Mississippi Valley, drought assistance in the Upper Plains. 
   When I became chairman of the Agriculture Committee, I brought the Agriculture Committee out to North and  South Dakota and elsewhere to emphasize why we needed drought relief, even though what we did was going to cost us in the Northeast. Drought relief for Kansas or any other place cost us in increased feed prices, in taxes. But we did it because it was the right thing to do. We have done it in cases of hurricane assistance for Texas, Louisiana, North and South Carolina, Florida, Georgia, and other States. All we would like is somebody to step back and say, wait a minute, why don't we get back to the administration and say, what are you going to request so this actually takes care of everyone. 
   Obviously, I was disappointed that we did not have extended the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. But my concern would be the same today, whether it was there or not, because of the drought issues. I am concerned that lifting the Cuban embargo for food and medicine that was passed by the Senate by 74 or 75 votes, the Ashcroft amendment, was not included. 
   I would like to take a moment to reiterate the importance of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact and my disappointment that its extension is not in this bill. The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has proven itself to be a successful and enduring partnership between dairy farmers and consumers throughout New England. Thanks to the Northeast Compact, the number of farmers going out of business has declined throughout New England--for the first time in many years. If you are a proponent of states' rights, regional dairy compacts are the answer. Compacts are state-initiated, state-ratified and state-supported programs that assure a safe supply of milk for consumers. 
   Indeed, half the Governors in the nation, and half the state legislatures in the nation, asked that the Congress allow their States to set their own dairy policies--within federally mandated limits--through interstate compacts. And the dairy compact passed with overwhelming support in these States--in Arkansas, for instance, the Compact passed the Senate with a vote of 33 to 0 and the House passed it with a vote of 91 to 0. In North Carolina, the Compact passed the Senate with a vote of 49 to 0 and passed the House with the overwhelming majority of 106 to 1. Clearly, there is tremendous support for dairy compacts in these states. 
   Since the Federal policies are not working to keep farmers in business, these states acted to make sure that dairy farmers stay in business so that consumers can be assured of fresh, local supplies milk. If you support interstate trade, the Northeast Dairy Compact has proven itself to be the answer. Once the Compact went into operation, the Office of Management and Budget reported an 8 percent increase in sales of milk into the compact region from New York and other neighboring States to take advantage of the higher prices. If you support a balanced budget, dairy compacts are the answer. The Northeast Compact does not cost taxpayers a single cent. 
   This is very different from the costliness of many farm programs--including many which are being funded through this appropriations bill. If you support farmland protection programs, dairy compacts are the answer. Major environmental groups have endorsed the Northeast Dairy Compact because they know it helps preserve farmland and prevent urban sprawl. In fact, the New Times reported on the importance of the Compact for the environment. In an article entitled ``Environmentalists Supporting Higher Milk Price for Farmers'' it was explained that keeping farmers on the land maintains the beauty of New England. 
   And if you are concerned about the impact of prices on consumers, regional dairy compacts are the answer. Retail milk prices within the compact region are lower on average than in the rest of the nation. I would be pleased to compare retail milk prices in New England against retail milk prices in the Upper Midwest.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at 12:02 AM this morning the six billionth person was born. It was a boy, in Sarajevo. 
   It took hundreds of thousands of years for the world's population to reach 1 billion, but it has taken less than 40 years for it to double from 3 to 6 billion people. This is a staggering number with implications that are impossible to fully grasp or predict. 
   What we do know, however, is that 95 percent of new births are occurring in developing countries that are least equipped to deal with the consequences. From sub-Saharan Africa to Asia, people's most basic needs continue to go unmet. 
   Of the 4.8 billion people in developing countries, it is estimated that nearly 60 percent lack basic sanitation. Almost a third do not have access to clean water. A quarter do not have adequate housing and a fifth--about 1 billion people--have no access to modern health services. 
   We also know that population pressures threaten every aspect of the Earth's environment. Severe water shortages, shrinking forests, soil degradation, air and water pollution and the daily loss of animal and plant life have changed the face of the planet and contributed to famine, social unrest and massive displacement of people. 
   This is not to minimize the progress that has been made in slowing population growth rates. Thanks in large part to the availability of modern contraceptives, the average number of births per woman has declined from 6 to 3. In addition, people today enjoy longer, healthier lives than ever before. Women have more opportunities and choices. Technology has enhanced access to medical care, education and employment. In every corner of the globe, we have seen the dramatic successes that have been achieved through vigorous, well-funded foreign assistance programs. 
   But the disparities between haves and have nots is growing. Given what we know about the inextricable link between population growth, poverty, political instability, lack of social justice and environmental degradation, it is astonishing to me that every year there are those in Congress who continue to oppose funding for international family planning. 
   It is inexplicable that even though the world's population has doubled since 1960, Members of Congress, especially in the House, vociferously oppose funding the United Nations Population Fund which promotes access to voluntary reproductive health services for women around the world. They do so because UNFPA has a small program in China, which supports women's health, modern contraceptives, and other voluntary family planning services. It makes absolutely no sense, since these are precisely the interventions that reduce reliance on abortion as a method of family planning. 
   And this year's Foreign Operation's bill contains only $385 million for the Agency for International Development's family planning programs, a $150 million cut from what it was just five years ago. 
   It is a travesty that so many people around the world want family planning services and still cannot get them. Time and again it has been proven that when these services are available the number of abortions declines, lives are saved and opportunities for women, children and families dramatically increase. 
   It is also shortsighted. The decisions we make today will determine how long it will be before another billion people occupy this planet and whether our children and grandchildren are born into a world of poverty and deprivation or a world of opportunity and prosperity. 
   Mr. President, today is a sobering reminder of the need for the United States to resume its leadership in support of international family planning. We have the ability to help improve the lives of billions of people both now and in the future.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I congratulate Col. John Sinclair on his Senate confirmation as the next United States Marshal for the District of Vermont. 
   As a 30-year veteran of the Vermont State Police, Col. Sinclair has served as a uniformed trooper at both the Colchester and Bethel Barracks, later joined the Fraud Unit and the Governor's security detail, and then was promoted to the post of Station Commander at the Brattleboro Barracks. He has also commanded both the Criminal Division and the Field Force. In 1996, he was appointed to his present position as director of the Vermont State Police, the department's highest-ranking uniformed post. 
   I have known Col. Sinclair for nearly 30 years, since the time when he was a new State trooper and I was Chittenden County's new State's attorney. We worked closely together on a number of investigations, trials, and law enforcement education programs. I have watched his career for the past three decades and consider him to be one of the finest police officers with whom I have ever worked. He is a police officer's police officer. He is a strong component of our law enforcement team in Vermont. 
   He has gained extensive experience with State, federal, and local law enforcement matters. It is fitting that his longstanding service to the people of Vermont culminate in this important law enforcement position. His practical experience, background and training qualify him to be Vermont's 34th United States Marshal. 
   Again, I congratulate Col. Sinclair and his wife, Barbara, who live in Charlotte, and their two sons, on receiving Senate confirmation as United States Marshal for the District of Vermont.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator MOYNIHAN and Senator JEFFORDS as a cosponsor of the Pension Reduction Disclosure Act of 1999. I believe this bill is a good first step to providing American workers with the information they deserve to know about changes to their pensions. President Clinton has endorsed our legislation and is ready to sign it into law. 
   As the controversy surrounding IBM's decision to convert its traditional pension plan to a cash balance plan taught many Vermonters, Congress needs to revise our laws to require greater disclosure of pension changes. When IBM first announced its pension switch, many Vermont IBMers told me that they did not have enough information to judge the new plan's impact on their pensions. They discovered that current Federal law does not even require an employer to explain to its employees how any future pension benefits will be reduced. This is not right. 
   Unfortunately, Vermont IBMers are not alone. At least 325 companies, with more than $330 billion in pension-defined benefit assets, have adopted cash-balance plans in recent years. This phenomenon is the biggest development in the pension world in years. But, as we all know now thanks to the tireless efforts of IBMers in Vermont and elsewhere, there is a dark side to this corporate trend: the fact that many experienced workers face deep cuts in their promised pensions when their company switches to a cash-balance plan. 
   The Pension Reduction Disclosure Act would require all employers, regardless of the size of their pension plan, to notify their employees of pension plan changes that would reduce the future benefit accrual rate at least 45 days in advance of the change. In addition, this legislation would require employers to explain any differences in future accrual rates between the old and new plan in a clear and meaningful fashion, by providing employees with detailed examples showing the difference between the old and new plans. 
   This bill complements the Pension Right to Know Act, which Senator MOYNIHAN and I introduced earlier in the year. Our earlier bill would require employers to provide employees with individualized comparisons of future benefits under the old and new plans 15 days prior to the conversion for pension plans covering 1000 or more employees. Our legislation today also complements the Older Workers Pension Protection Act, S. 1600, which Senator HARKIN, Senator JEFFORDS and I introduced last month to prevent the wear away of an employee's promised pension benefits after a cash balance plan conversion. 
   Now is the time for Congress to act to ensure that all employers fully disclose the negative effects of their pension plan changes. Employees have a right to know how their futures will be affected by a company's decision to change its pension plan.

   Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. We may well not use it. I am trying to protect time for some who may want to come and speak. 
   It has been a week since the conference committee on foreign operations completed its work. The House tried, during that week, to muscle the votes to pass it, and yesterday they did, by a three-vote margin. 
   As stated by some of the leadership in the House, the bill is part of a grand Republican strategy to force the President to either except a large cut in funding for foreign policy or veto the bill and then be blamed for cutting Social Security to pay for foreign policy, even though everybody knows that is not going to happen. I think the American people are more savvy than that. They know that foreign policy is the key responsibility of the Federal Government. It has been ever since the days of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin. 
   Today the world is far more complex, more dangerous, more independent than anybody could have assumed. They also know the President is not going to do anything to harm Social Security. 
   The House finally passed the conference report by three votes. The bill will pass here, with a third of the Senate voting against it. Then the President vetoes it. It is unfortunate we are here. 
   In that regard, let me say something about the distinguished senior Senator from Kentucky. I should warn him and alert him that I am going to praise him. That may bring about the Republican State committee initiating in Kentucky a recall petition, but that is the price of fame and glory. 
   The fact is, the distinguished senior Senator from Kentucky took an allocation, as chairman of this subcommittee, which by anybody's standards--his, mine or anybody else's--was too small. With that, he tried to fashion a bill that reflects the best interests of our country and the needs of our country and the great humanitarian nature of Americans. 
   He has done it extraordinarily well. He has bent over backward--I say this to all Democratic Members of the Senate as well as Republican Members--to accommodate the needs of Senators on both sides of the aisle. His chief of foreign policy, Robin Cleveland, and others have worked very closely with Senators on both sides of the aisle to try to accommodate all they could. Are there things not in here? Of course. You only have so much money. 
   There are things the Senator from Kentucky would like to increase in here, substantially. Without embarrassing him, I 
   won't go down the list, but he could think of a number of areas. Are there things the Senator from Vermont would want to see increased? Of course, there are, substantial areas. 
   We have seen, for example, the situation we now have in New York City where, after an outbreak of encephalitis, there is now a feeling that this disease came over transported by a bird. It is now infecting birds and humans in New York. As birds migrate south, it will affect others. Where did the disease come from? A different continent. It demonstrates that every disease is only an airplane trip away. 
   We have money in here to approach that problem, working with a number of people, Dr. Nils Daulaire and others, to try to help countries identify diseases when they occur in their country, help them eradicate them there, help them contain them--both for the humanitarian effort of helping this country get rid of the disease, but also one that protects all the rest of the world so the disease doesn't spread. Could we use a lot more money? Yes, we could. Ironically, we will end up spending hundreds of times more in this country, if we don't do this, just to help protect our own people within our own borders, than the fraction of that amount we would spend to stop the disease from occurring in the first place. That is one example. AIDS, the greatest calamity to hit the world since World War II, does not have ample funds. 
   It has extra money in here. I complimented him and the distinguished Senator from Kentucky for helping get that money in. Both of us believe and both of us have said repeatedly that the money in here falls short of what is needed to protect our interests around the world. 
   For years, we urged the administration to fight harder for the foreign operations budget. Let me say this as a criticism of the administration of my own party: Too often, the administration has done too little, too late to build the support in Congress. 
   At the same time, the Congress has failed to allocate to our subcommittee the funds we need. This bill is $800 million below the 1999 level and $1.9 billion below the President's request, which, frankly, was not an unreasonable request. It is substantially less than this Congress was willing to give President Ronald Reagan for foreign aid. At a time when President Reagan was expressing concerns about foreign aid, he was still spending far more than we have in here, in a world much smaller than it is today. 
   It may surprise Senators to know that the President's fiscal year 2000 budget request for foreign operations, which he didn't get, is about the same as the amount we appropriated a decade ago. It is far less if you count inflation and far, far less if you count the amount we actually came up with. 
   We have a lot of interests around the globe. The United States, a nation of a quarter of a billion people, has the preeminent economy and military might in the world. But our economy and military might, by itself, does not protect our interests totally and does not enable us to continue our interests into the next century. 
   It is absurd that at the threshold of the 21st century, we continue to nickel and dime our foreign policy spending. We spend less than 1 percent of the Federal budget on foreign policy. Yet we are a worldwide power. Companies in my little State of Vermont are involved in international trade. We are, on a per capita basis, about third or fourth in the country in exporting outside our borders. With the Internet, any company in Vermont, or Kentucky, or Arkansas, or Illinois, or anywhere else, which does business on the Internet, if they are selling something, they are going to get inquiries from Sri Lanka, from Japan, from Germany, from the Middle East. We are a worldwide, interconnected economy. 
   We are also a nation that is called upon almost as a 911 source to help put out regional battles, fights, and so on, where democracy has not taken hold, and we will spend tens of billions, even hundreds of billions, of dollars to do that. But we won't spend a tiny fraction of that amount of money in our foreign policy budget to try to help democracy take place in the first place, so we don't have to call out the marines. 
   Unfortunately, the majority in Congress refuses to face up to that. We continue to underfund these programs  and to underfund our diplomacy in the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill. 
   It is an isolationist, shortsighted approach that weakens our security, puts undue burdens on our Armed Forces, and does damage to future generations of Americans. We still have Members of Congress who call this foreign aid, and they even brag about cutting foreign aid. These are the same Members of Congress who say, ``I will never leave the shores of this Nation while I serve in Congress,'' as though this Nation exists just within its shores--a nation where every one our Fortune 500 companies do business around the world, every one of our States' economies is greatly affected by what kind of business we do around the world. Our students travel abroad; our citizens travel abroad. I don't know how many times we have people going to other countries saying, ``I am an American, I must have some rights.'' What do we do to help support those rights? 
   To say we don't need to be involved in foreign aid, especially when the United States spends far less of its budget than most other nations--actually less in dollars than some-- is simplistic, self-serving, and mostly inaccurate. These programs benefit all Americans. 
   We have a number of programs that are underfunded in this budget that create jobs in the United States. We create the greatest number of jobs in our economy in those jobs that affect our exports. To the extent that our foreign aid and foreign policy programs improve the economies of other countries, they improve our markets. But unlike the request the President has made for funding to support America's export community, the bill cuts those funds. 
   The President has requested funding to support national security programs, including to safeguard nuclear material in the former Soviet Union. If you want something to make you wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning, think of the inadequate controls over the nuclear material that is now stored in the former Soviet Union. Ask any American, ``Would you support something that would help us secure those nuclear materials?'' and they will say yes. This bill cuts those funds. 
   The President has asked for funds to build free markets, to strengthen democratic governments that support our policies, to 
   protect the global environment. I don't think anybody opposes these programs, but we are just not going to pay for them. Rather than funding them at a level commensurate with the requirements and needs of a superpower with the world's largest economy, some want to make political points. I disagree with that. I think that is dangerous. 
   I voted to report the bill from the committee. I did that mostly out of respect for the efforts of the chairman of the subcommittee. I voted for it on the floor, as most Senators did, to send it to conference. But I said at that time my vote was contingent upon additional funding being added in conference. It did not happen. 
   I don't support everything the President has asked for at all. I want to make that clear. Some things I would vote against. But there is much in this conference report I do support. I don't support a cut in funding. I think the long-term security costs to our economy and our security will be far greater. It is simply irresponsible. 
   Year after year, I have voted for foreign operations bills I thought were too low. I thought last year's bill was too low, and I said so at the time. I voted for it because I thought it was the best we could do and it would not do irreparable harm to our national security. But this bill is $800 million less than last year's. 
   We have written a balanced bill. I have talked about the provisions I support, such as funding to combat HIV/AIDS in Africa and other development assistance programs. It also includes some provisions I don't support, but we had a fair debate and vote on them. That is fine with me. 
   Funding for IDA, which makes low-cost loans to the poorest countries, was cut by $175 million. Funding for the U.N. agencies was cut. Funding for the Korea Energy program cut by $20 million. Funding for peacekeeping was cut. Funding for nonproliferation, antiterrorism, and other security programs was cut. The Peace Corps was cut. 
   The world's population is going to pass 6 billion people next week, yet this conference report provides $50 million less for international family planning than the amount passed by the Senate in July and $100 million less than we spent 10 years ago, when the population was much smaller. 
   It cuts funding for the Global Environment Facility by $157 million below last year's level and $108 million below the President's request. 
   I want to see a bill the President can sign. I say this to the administration and the leadership of the House and Senate: You have many Members on both sides of the aisle who want a good bill. But all of you are going to have to help us get the money so we can have a better bill.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have to say this with my colleagues present. When the full history of Senate treatment of the nomination of Justice Ronnie White is understood, when the switches and politics that drove the Republican side of the aisle are known, the people of Missouri and the people of the United States will have to judge whether the Senate was unfair to this fine man and whether their votes served the interests of justice and the Federal courts. 
   I am hoping--and every Senator will have to ask himself or herself this question--the United States has not reverted to a time in its history when there was a color test on nominations.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to congratulate Ray Fisher on his Senate confirmation. I will miss Ray and Nancy here in Washington, but know that the Ninth Circuit will greatly benefit from his service there. 
   Finally, I congratulate Ted Stewart on his confirmation and Senators HATCH and BENNETT, who have worked hard to get him confirmed expeditiously. I trust that Mr. Stewart will honor the commitments that he made to the Judiciary Committee to avoid even the appearance of impropriety on matters on which he has worked while in State government. 
   I said on the Senate floor last night that this body's recent treatment of women and minority judicial nominees is a badge of shame. I feel that we added to that shame with today's vote of Justice Ronnie White. 
   In their report entitled ``Justice Held Hostage,'' the bipartisan Task Force on Federal Judicial Selection from Citizens for Independent Courts, co-chaired by Mickey Edwards and Lloyd Cutler, substantiated through their independent analysis what I have been saying for some time: Women and minority judicial nominations are treated differently by this Senate and take longer, are less likely to be voted on and less likely to be confirmed. 
   Judge Richard Paez has been stalled for 44 months, and the nomination of Marsha Berzon has been pending for 20 months. Other nominees are confirmed in 2 months. 
   Anonymous Republican Senators continue their secret holds on the Paez and Berzon nominations. The Republican majority refuses to vote on those nominations. In fairness, after almost 2 years and almost 4 years, Marsha Berzon and Judge Richard Paez are entitled to a Senate vote on their nominations. Vote them up or vote them down, but vote. That is what I have been saying, that is what the Chief Justice challenged the Republican Senate to do back in January 1998. 
   I can assure you that there is no Democratic Senator with a hold on Judge Paez or Marsha Berzon. I can assure you that every Democratic Senator is willing to go forward with votes on Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon now, without delay. 
   Last Friday, Senator LOTT committed to trying to ``find a way'' to have these nominations considered by the Senate. I want to help him do that.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have a number of judges to discuss tonight: 
   There is Brian Theadore Stewart--I see the distinguished Senator from Utah on the floor, who I am sure will be speaking of him. 
   There is Justice Ronnie L. White--I see the distinguished Senator from Missouri, who will be speaking about him and has specific reserved time for that. 
   And there is the nomination of Raymond C. Fisher. 
   Utilizing some of the time reserved to me and the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will make sure that whatever amount of time the distinguished Senator from Utah wishes will be available to him. 
   I would like to start by mentioning how we got here. On Friday, the Democratic leader was able to get an agreement from the majority leader scheduling an up-or-down vote on Ray Fisher, Ted Stewart, and Ronnie White tomorrow afternoon, with some debate this evening. I thank the Democratic leader for his assistance in obtaining those agreements. I know that it was not easy to obtain a date certain for a vote on the Fisher nomination and I am especially grateful that at long last, after 27 months, the Senate will finally be voting on the White nomination. 
   I begin with the Fisher nomination. Raymond Fisher is a distinguished Californian. After being confirmed by the Senate in 1977, he has served as Associate Attorney General of the United States. He served on the Los Angeles Police Commission from 1995 to 1997. He chaired it from 1996 to 1997. In 1990, he was deputy general counsel for the Independent Commission on the Los Angeles Police Department, better known as the Christopher Commission, chaired by Warren Christopher. 
   He received his undergraduate degree in 1961 from the University of California at Santa Barbara; 
   And he received his law degree from Stanford Law School in 1966, where he was president of the Stanford Law Review. Following law school, he clerked for the Honorable J. Skelly Wright on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and for the Honorable William Brennan on the U.S. Supreme Court. In other words, a lawyer's lawyer. 
   For almost 30 years, he was a litigation attorney in private practice in Los Angeles at Tuttle & Taylor and then as the managing partner of the Los Angeles offices of Heller, Ehrman, White & McAuliffe. He is a highly respected member of the bar and a dedicated public servant. 
   He has the very strong support of both California Senators. He received a rating of well qualified--in other words, the highest rating--from the American Bar Association. He has the support of Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, the Los Angeles police department, the National Association of Police Organizations, and the Fraternal Order of Police. 
   He was nominated back on March 15, 1999. He had a hearing before the Judiciary Committee and in July he was promptly and favorably reported. I do not know why his nomination was not taken up immediately and confirmed before the August recess, but it is still here and will now receive consideration. The Senate should vote to confirm him, as I fully expect we will. 
   I note that the Senate has before it ready for final confirmation vote two other judge nominees to the same court, the Ninth Circuit, Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon. Also pending before the Judiciary Committee are the nominations of Ron Gould, first nominated in 1997; Barry Goode, first nominated in June 1998; and James Duffy to the Ninth Circuit. It is a Court of Appeals that remains one quarter vacant with 7 vacancies among its 28 authorized judges. 
   We should be voting up or down on the Paez and Berzon nominations today. I think we need to fulfill our duty not only to each of these outstanding nominees as a matter of conscience and decency on our part, but also for the tens of millions of people who are served by the Ninth Circuit. Unfortunately, as was brought out Friday, a few Republican Senators--anonymously--are still holding up action on these other important nominations. 
   To his credit, the majority leader has come to the floor and said he will try to find a way for the two nominations to be considered by the Senate. I know that if the majority leader wishes the nominees will come to a vote. The way is to call them to a fair up-or-down vote. We should find a way to do that as soon as possible.  
   I certainly have tried to work directly and explain what I have done on the floor in working with the majority leader on the nominations. I am happy to work with the Senators who are blocking them from going forward, but we do not know who they are. In fact, we had a policy announced at the beginning of this year that we would no longer use secret holds in the Senate. Unfortunately, Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon are still confronting a secret hold as their nominations are obstructed under a cloak of anonymity after 44 months and 20 months, respectively. That is wrong and unfair. 
   The distinguished Senators from California, Mrs. BOXER and Mrs. FEINSTEIN, have urged continuously over and over again on this floor, in committee, in caucuses, in individual conversations with Senators on both sides of the aisle, that the nominations of Berzon and Paez go forward. I see the distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER, on the floor. 
   I think I can state unequivocally for her, as for Senator FEINSTEIN, that no Democrat objects to Judge Paez going forward. No Democrat objects to Marsha Berzon going forward. If nobody is objecting on this side of the aisle to going forward, I strongly urge those who support--as many, many do--Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon's nominations, that they call each of the 55 Senators on the other side of the aisle and ask them: Are you objecting to them 
   going forward? Would you object to them going forward? Find out who is holding them up. They are entitled to a vote. 
   To continue this delay demeans the Senate. I have said that I have great respect for this institution and its traditions. Certainly after 25 years, my respect is undiminished. But in this case, I see the treatment of these nominations as part of a pattern of what has happened on judicial nominations for the last few years. If you are a minority or a woman, it takes longer to go through this Senate as a judicial nomination. That is a fact. It is not just me noting it, but impartial outside observers have reported in the last few weeks that a woman or a minority takes longer to be confirmed by the Senate as it is presently constituted. 
   The use of secret holds for an extended period is wrong and beneath the Senate. We can have 95 Senators for a nominee but 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 can stop that person--after 4 years with respect to Judge Paez; after 2 years with respect to Marsha Berzon. 
   Let us vote up or down. If Members do not want either one of them, vote against them; if Members want them, vote for them. But allow them to come to a vote. Do not hide behind anonymous holds. Do not allow this precedent to continue that we seem to have started that women and minorities take longer. 
   Judge Richard Paez is an outstanding jurist and a source of great pride and inspiration to Hispanics in California and around the country. He served as a local judge before being confirmed by the Senate to the federal bench several years ago and is currently a Federal District Court Judge. He has twice been reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee in connection with his nomination to the Court of Appeals and has spent a total of 9 months over the last 2 years on the Senate Executive Calendar awaiting the opportunity for a final confirmation vote. His nomination was first received by the Senate in January 1996, 44 months ago. 
   Marsha Berzon is one of the most qualified nominees I have seen in 25 years and the Republican Chairman of the Judiciary Committee has said the same thing. Her legal skills are outstanding, her practice and productivity have been extraordinary. Lawyers against whom she has litigated regard her as highly qualified for the bench. Nominated for a judgeship within the Circuit that saw this Senate hold up the nominations of other qualified women for months and years--people like Margaret Morrow, Ann Aiken, Margaret McKeown and Susan Oki Mollway--she was first nominated in January 1998, some 20 months ago. 
   The Atlanta Constitution noted recently:  
   Two U.S. appellate court nominees, Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, both of California, have been on hold for four years and 20 months respectively. When Democrats tried *.*.* to get their colleagues to vote on the pair at long last, the Republicans scuttled the maneuver. *.*.* This partisan stalling, this refusal to vote up or down on nominees, is unconscionable. It is not fair, It is not right, It is no way to run the federal judiciary. *.*.* This ideological obstructionism is so fierce that it strains our justice system and sets a terrible partisan example for years to come.  
   It is against this backdrop that I, again, ask the Senate to be fair to these judicial nominees and all nominees. For the last few years the Senate has allowed 1 or 2 or 3 secret holds to stop judicial nominations from even getting a vote. That is wrong. 
   The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court wrote in January last year:  
   Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. *.*.* The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.  
   At the time the Chief Justice issued this challenge, Judge Paez' nomination had already been pending for 24 months. The Senate received the Berzon nomination within days of the Chief Justice's report. That was almost 2 years ago and still the Senate stalls and refuses to vote. Let us follow the advice of the Chief Justice. Let the Republican leadership schedule up or down votes on the nominations of Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon so that the Senate can finally act on them. Let us be fair to all. 
   Recently, the Washington Post noted: ``[T]he Constitution does not make the Senate's role in the confirmation process optional, and the Senate ends up abdicating responsibility when the majority leader denies nominees a timely vote. All the nominees awaiting floor votes *.*.* should receive them immediately.'' 
   Democrats are living up to our responsibilities. The debate over the last couple of weeks has focused the Senate and the public on the unconscionable treatment by the Senate majority of selected nominees. The most prominent examples of that treatment are Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon. With respect to these nominations, the Senate is refusing to do its constitutional duty and vote. 
   The Florida Sun-Sentinel wrote recently: ``The `Big Stall' in the U.S. Senate continues, as senators work slower and slower each year in confirming badly needed federal judges........This worsening process is inexcusable, bordering on malfeasance in office, especially given the urgent need to fill vacancies on a badly undermanned federal bench........The stalling, in many cases, is nothing more than a partisan political dirty trick.'' 
   A recent report by the Task Force on Judicial Selection of Citizens for Independent Courts verifies that the time to confirm female nominees is now significantly longer than that to confirm male nominees--a difference that has defied logical explanation. The report recommends that ``the responsible officials address this matter to assure that candidates for judgeships are not treated differently based on their gender.'' Those responsible are not on this side of the aisle. I recall all too well the gauntlet that such outstanding woman nominees as Margaret Morrow, Ann Aiken, Margaret McKeown, Susan Oki Mollway, Sonia Sotumayor were forced to run. Now it is Marsha Berzon who is being delayed and obstructed, another outstanding woman judicial nominee held up, and held up anonymously because she will be confirmed if allowed a fair up or down vote. 
   I likewise recall all too well the way in which other qualified nominees were held up and defeated without a vote. The honor roll of outstanding minority nominees who have been defeated without a vote is already too long, including as it does Judge James A. Beaty, Jr., Jorge C. Rangel, Anabelle Rodriquez and Clarence Sundram. It should not be extended further. Senate Republicans have chosen to stall Hispanic, women and other minority nominees long enough. It is wrong and should end. 
   Nominees deserve to be treated with dignity and dispatch--not delayed for 2 and 3 and 4 years. I continue to urge the Republican Senate leadership to proceed to vote on the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon. There was never a justification for the Republican majority to deny these judicial nominees a fair up or down vote. There is no excuse for their continuing failure to do so.  
   I know the Senate will do the right thing and confirm Ray Fisher to the Ninth Circuit tomorrow and that he will be an outstanding judge. I will continue my efforts to bring to a vote the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon. 
   We also will get the opportunity tomorrow to vote on the nomination of Justice Ronnie White. As I reminded the Senate last Friday, he is an outstanding jurist and currently a member of the Missouri Supreme Court. We have now a judicial emergency vacancy on the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Missouri while his nomination has been held up for 27 months. 
   Ronnie White was nominated by President Clinton in June of 1997--not June of 1999 or 1998, but June of 1997. It took 11 months before the Senate would allow him to have a confirmation hearing. At that hearing, the senior Senator from Missouri, Mr. BOND, and Representative BILL CLAY, the dean of the State's congressional delegation, came forward with strong praise for the nominee. Senator BOND urged Members to act fairly on Judge White's nomination to the district court and noted Justice White's integrity, character, and qualifications, and concluded that he believes Justice White understands the role of a Federal judge is to interpret the law, not to make law. 
   Once considered at a hearing, Justice White's nomination was reported favorably on a 13-3 vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 21, 1998. Senators HATCH, THURMOND, GRASSLEY, SPECTER, KYL, and DEWINE were the Republican Members voting for him, along with all Democratic Members. 
   Even though he was voted out 13-3, the nomination was held on the Senate Executive Calendar without action until the Senate adjourned last year, and returned to the President after 16 months with no Senate action. A secret hold had done its work and cost this fine man and outstanding jurist an up-or-down vote. The President renominated him back in January of this year. We reported his nomination favorably a second time this year a few months ago. 
   Justice White deserves better than benign negligence. The people of Missouri deserve a fully qualified and staffed Federal bench. He has one of the finest records and experience of any lawyer to come before the Judiciary Committee in my 25 years there. He served in the Missouri Legislature, the Office of the City Council for the city of St. Louis, and as a judge in the Court of Appeals for the Eastern District of Missouri before his current service as the first African American ever to serve on the Missouri Supreme Court. 
   I believe he will be an invaluable asset. I am pleased we are finally having a discussion, even though 27 months is too long to wait, too long to wait for a floor vote, on this distinguished African American justice. Finally he will get the respect he should have from this body. 
   Acting to fill judicial vacancies is a constitutional duty that the Senate--and all of its Members--are obligated to fulfill. In its unprecedented slowdown in the handling of nominees since the 104th Congress, the Senate is shirking its duty. That is wrong and should end. 
   Let us show respect to the federal judiciary and to the American people to whom justice is being denied due to this unprecedented slowdown in the confirmation process. I am proud to support the nomination of Justice Ronnie White for United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri. I was delighted when last Friday, the Democratic leader was able to announce that we had finally been able to obtain Republican agreement to vote on this nomination. I thank the Democratic leader and all who have helped bring us to the vote tomorrow on the nomination of Justice White. It has been a long time coming. 
   Tomorrow the Senate will act on the nomination of Brian Theadore Stewart, who has not had to wait a long time with the others. I have said over the last few weeks that I do not begrudge Ted Stewart a Senate vote; rather, I believe that all the judicial nominations on the Senate Executive Calendar deserve a fair up or down vote. That includes Judge Richard Paez, who was first nominated 44 months ago and Marsha Berzon who was first nominated 20 months ago. 
   Tomorrow we will vote on the Stewart nomination but Senate Republicans still refuse to vote on these two other qualified nominees who have been pending far longer. 
   The Senate was able to consider and vote on the nomination of Robert Bork to the United States Supreme Court in 12 weeks, the Senate was able to consider and vote on the nomination of Justice Clarence Thomas in 14 weeks. It is now approximately 2 months from the Senate's receipt of the Stewart nomination, and we are now about to vote on his confirmation. I feel even more strongly that we should also be voting on the nomination of Judge Richard Paez, which has been pending almost 4 years, and that of Marsha Berzon, which has been pending almost 2 years. 
   Despite strong opposition from many quarters from Utah and around the country, from environmentalists and civil rights advocates alike, I did not oppose the Stewart nomination in Committee. I noted Mr. Stewart's commitment to examine his role in a number of environmental matters while in the State government and to recuse himself from hearing cases in those areas. In response to questions from Chairman HATCH and Senator FEINGOLD, Mr. Stewart committed to ``liberally interpret'' the recusal standards to ensure that those matters would be heard by a fair and impartial judge and to avoiding even the appearance of impropriety or possible conflicts of interest. 
   I cooperated in Chairman HATCH's efforts to expedite Committee consideration of the Stewart nomination with the expectation that these other nominees who have been held up so long, nominees like Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, were to be considered by the Senate and finally voted on, as well. The Chairman and I have both voted for Judge Paez each time he was considered by the Committee and we both voted for and support Marsha Berzon. 
   I have tried to work with the Chairman and with the Majority Leader on all these nominations. I would like to work with those Senators whom the Majority Leader is protecting from having to vote on the Paez and Berzon nominations, but I do not know who they are. Despite the policy against secret holds, there are apparently secret Senate holds against both Paez and Berzon. That is wrong and unfair. 
   As we prepare to vote on the nomination of Ted Stewart, the Senate should also be voting on the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon. The Stewart nomination has been pending barely 2 months, the Berzon nomination has been stalled for almost 2 years and the Paez nomination has set a new, all-time record, having now been pending for almost 4 years. The Paez nomination was referred to in the Los Angeles Times recently as the ``Cal Ripken of judicial confirmation battles.'' What is most shameful is that the Senate is obstructing an up-or-down vote on these nominations without debate, without accountability and under the cloak of anonymity. 
   Certainly no President has consulted more closely with Senators of the other party on judicial nominations, which has greatly expanded the time this Administration has taken to make nominations. The Senate should get about the business of voting on the confirmation of the scores of judicial nominations that have been delayed without justification for too long. We should start by voting up or down on the Paez and Berzon nominations without further delay. That is the fair thing to do. The Majority Leader committed last Friday to finding a way to bring these two nominations to a vote. It is time for those votes to be occur. 
   This summer, in his remarks to the American Bar Association, the President, again, urged us to action. We must redouble our efforts to work with the President to end the longstanding vacancies that plague the federal courts and disadvantage all Americans. That is our constitutional responsibility. I continue to urge the Republican Senate leadership to attend to these nominations without obstruction and proceed to vote on them with dispatch. The continuing refusal to vote on the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon demeans the Senate and all Americans.  
   It is my hope that the example we set here tonight and tomorrow will move the Senate into a new and more productive chapter of our efforts to consider judicial nominations. We are proceeding to vote on a judicial nominee that some Democratic Senators oppose in order to demonstrate our commitment to fairness for all. There was never a justification for the Republican majority to deny any judicial nominees a fair up or down vote. There is no excuse for their continuing failure to do so. 
   I will close with this. Let us move to a new and more productive chapter in our efforts to consider judicial nominations. Let us erase what has become a badge of shame for the Senate: You are a judicial nominee, and if you are a minority or a woman, no matter how good your qualifications are, you take much longer to go through this body than does a white male. That is a badge of shame on this great institution. Before we finish this year, we should erase it. We should say the Senate does not have a gender or a race or ethnicity qualification for judges. The Senate will vote on men nominees; vote them up or vote them down, but we will vote on them. We will not say if you are a woman or a minority you have to wait longer than anybody else because that is what the Senate has been doing and it is wrong. It is shameful. It is inexcusable. It demeans this great and wonderful institution. 
   Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.

   Mr. LEAHY. The numbers I have seen are that he has voted 17 times for reversal. Justice Covington, however, has voted 24 times for reversal in death penalty cases; Justice Holstein, 24 times; Justice Benton, 19 times; and Justice Price, 18 times. It would appear to me that at least Justices Covington, Holstein, Benton and Price, all on the Supreme Court, have voted many more times to reverse death sentences than Justice White has. Are these numbers similar to what the Senator from Missouri has?

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I say, with both the leaders on the floor, this is a matter that has had some discussion. I appreciate the discussions I have had with both my leader, the distinguished Democratic leader, and the majority leader of the Senate, the distinguished Senator from Mississippi. The distinguished senior Senator from Utah, Mr. HATCH, and I have also had lengthy discussions about this. 
   As I have stated before--I will not hold the floor here now because I know others are waiting to speak; I will speak on this later this afternoon--I do have a concern about the slow pace of nominations being confirmed, especially with those such as the Paez and Berzon nominations that have waiting years, not just weeks and months. We should be moving forward on those nominations, as well. 
   I have also received the assurance of the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee that we will expedite, as much as possible, the hearing schedule and the executive session schedule of the Committee and that we will get more nominations promptly to the Executive Calendar. 
   One thing I have learned after 25 years here is that in the last few days of any session we suddenly find a lot can be done--provided items are available on the calendar. While it is a time, I am sure, to which the two leaders look forward with great anticipation--and they have a chance to earn a higher place in Heaven because their patience will be strained but they will not allow the strain to break them--I hope we will have a number of judges who might then be available to start the December, if not the January, sessions of their courts. 
   I know that Bruce Cohen, counsel on the Democratic side, and Manus Cooney, Senator HATCH's chief counsel on the Republican side, have been working hard to make progress on these matters. 
   I think this is a good step forward. I think it is a positive thing. But I hope the leader will be able to use his persuasion on the Republican side for Berzon and Paez. I know there are those who will not vote for them, but allow them to have an up-or-down vote. 
   I can assure the Democrat leader and I can assure the majority leader that I have canvassed this side of the aisle and there is no objection on the Democratic side--none whatsoever--to going forward with Berzon and Paez. 
   I know some Senators have told me on the other side they will vote against them. I have a number of Senators on the other side who say they will vote for them. We ought to give them the courtesy of the vote. 
   I know that requires scheduling and work, but I urge that upon the leadership. I want the leaders to know there is no objection on this side.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I said Tuesday of last week that the series of votes the Senate took that day, in which we were unable to consider and vote on the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, was unprecedented. I expressed my concern that the Senate not go so far off the tracks of our precedents that we end up creating a problem, not just for this administration, but for any future administration.  
   Today, we at least break out of the impasse of last week, and move forward toward voting on all the judicial nominations before the Senate. Just so we understand where we are, I said last week that Democrats were prepared to vote on all of the judicial nominations pending on the Senate Executive Calendar. Today we provided additional evidence of our resolve to do so. We did that by agreeing to a debate and a confirmation vote on the nomination of Brian Theadore Stewart to the United States District Court for the District of Utah, as well as other nominees pending before the Senate. 
   Of course, the Senate has confirmed Victor Marrero and James Lorenz. I congratulate, incidentally, Senator SCHUMER and Senator FEINSTEIN and Senator BOXER, for the efforts they have made on behalf of those nominees. 
   I thank the Democratic leader for all his efforts in resolving this impasse, in securing a vote on the nomination of Ray Fisher, and, in particular, a vote on the nomination of Justice Ronnie White. Justice Ronnie White is eventually, finally--I emphasize finally--going to get an up-or-down vote next Tuesday. Also, Ray Fisher and Mr. Stewart will be voted on next Tuesday. 
   But our work is not complete. I look forward to working with the majority leader to fulfill the Senate's duty to vote on the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and of Marsha Berzon. These are nominations that have been pending for a very long time. 
   This debate is about fairness and the issue that remains is the issue of fairness. For too long, nominees--judicial nominees such as Judge Paez, Ms. Berzon and Justice Ronnie White of Missouri, and executive branch nominees like Bill Lann Lee, have been opposed in anonymity, through secret holds and delaying tactics--not by straight up-or-down votes where Senators can vote for them or vote against them. 
   They have been forced to run some kind of strange in-the-dark gauntlet of Senate confirmations. Those strong enough to work through that secret gauntlet and get reported to the floor are then being dealt the final death blow through a refusal of the Republican leadership to call them up for a vote. They should be called up for a fair vote. They may be defeated--the Republicans are in the majority; there are 55 Republican Senators; they could vote them down. But let them have a fair vote, up or down. Let all Senators have to stand up and vote aye or nay, and be responsible to their constituency to explain why they voted that way. Unfortunately, nominations are being killed through neglect and silence, not defeated by a majority vote. 
   So I ask, again, for the Senate to fulfill its responsibility to vote on all the judicial nominations on the calendar; vote for them or vote against them. We can vote them up or we can vote them down, but after 44 months or 27 months or 20 months, let us vote. 
   Judge Richard Paez has an extraordinary record. He was praised by Republicans and Democrats before our committee. He was nominated January 25--not January 25 of this year, 1999; not January 25 of 1998; not January 25 of 1997; but January 25 of 1996. He has been pending 44 months. Vote for him or vote against him, but do not put him in this kind of nomination limbo, which becomes a nomination hell. 
   Justice Ronnie White, an extraordinary jurist from Missouri, an outstanding African American jurist, he was nominated on June 26--not June 26 of 1999, not June 26 of 1998, but June 26 of 1997. After more than two years, this nomination remains pending. Vote up, vote down, but do not take such an insulting and arrogant and demeaning attitude on behalf of the Senate of not allowing this good jurist to come to a vote. 
   Marsha Berzon, again, nominated January 27, but not of this year, of last year. Her nomination has been pending for almost two years. Allow her to come to a vote. 
   I contrast this, even though we have a Democratic President and nominations are usually the prerogative of whoever the President is, of that party, with a nomination made on behalf of a Republican Senator who happens to be a dear friend of mine. That man was nominated on July 27 this year, barely two months ago. That nomination, the nomination of Brian Theadore Stewart, will be voted on next week. Good for him, I say. 
   He has been considered promptly and will be brought up for an up or down vote. There are some on this side of the aisle who oppose him and will vote against him. But every single Democrat, whether they are going to vote against him or for him, should allow him to be voted on and they will. That nomination has been pending 2 months. 
   Let us have the same fairness on the other side of the aisle for Marsha Berzon, after 20 months, Justice Ronnie White after 27 months, and Judge Richard Paez after 44 months, especially--and some people may wish I would not say this on the floor, but especially after the nonpartisan report which came out last week that confirmed what I have said on this floor many a time--especially for nominees who are women and minorities. I have observed before that if you are a minority or if you are a woman, this Senate, as presently constituted, will take far, far longer to vote on your confirmation than if you are a white male. That is a fact. That is fact, something that started becoming evident a few years ago and has now been confirmed in a nonpartisan report. 
   Let me repeat that. If you are a minority, if you are a woman, you will take longer to be confirmed than if you are a white male, by this Senate as presently constituted. And that is wrong. I advise Senators, I have checked on Judge Richard Paez, Justice Ronnie White, and Ms. Marsha Berzon, and nobody objects on the Democratic side of the aisle to them coming to a vote. We are prepared to vote at any time, any moment, any day. There are no holds on this side of the aisle. 
   I said last week I do not begrudge Ted Stewart a Senate vote. I do not. He is entitled to a vote. He went through the confirmation process. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted him out. It was not a unanimous vote, but he was voted out of the committee, and he is entitled to a vote. If Senators do not want to vote for him, vote against him. If Senators want to vote for him, vote for him. I intend to vote for him. I intend to give the benefit of the doubt both to the President and to the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee who recommended him. 
   But I also ask the same sense of fairness be shown to everybody else on the calendar. The Senate was able to consider and vote on the nomination of Robert Bork to the U.S. Supreme Court, as controversial as that was, in 12 weeks. The Senate was able to consider and vote on the nomination of Justice Clarence Thomas in 14 weeks. We ought to be voting on the nomination of Judge Richard Paez, which has been pending almost 4 years, and that of Marsha Berzon, which has been pending almost 2 years. Let us have a sense of fairness. Let us bring them up and let us remove this notoriety the Senate has received, the notoriety established and emphatically proven, that if you are a woman or a minority, you take longer to get confirmed, if you ever get confirmed at all. That is wrong. We should be colorblind; we should be gender blind. Most importantly, we should be fair. 
   I should note, in fairness to the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in committee he did vote for Judge Paez, Justice White, and Ms. Berzon and, of course, Ted Stewart, as did I. Now I work with both he and the majority leader to bring them to a final vote by the Senate. 
   I also want to work with those Senators who are opposed to bringing Judge Paez or Marsha Berzon to a vote. I read in the papers where we have done away with secret holds in the Senate, but apparently not for everybody. Apparently, there are still secret holds. 
   In February, the majority leader and Democratic leader sent a letter to all Senators talking about secret holds. They said then: ``members wishing to place a hold on any ..... executive calendar business shall notify the committee of jurisdiction of their concerns.'' I serve as the ranking member on the committee of jurisdiction for these nominations. I have not been told the name of any Senator at all who is holding them up. Yet they do not go 
   forward. 
   The letter from the two leaders goes on to state: ``Further, written notification should be provided to the respective Leader stating their intention regarding the *.*.* nomination.'' Senator  DASCHLE has received no such notification. In spite of what was supposed to be a Senate policy to do away with anonymous holds, we remain in the situation where I do not even know who is objecting to proceeding to a vote on the Paez and Berzon nominations, let alone why they are objecting. I have no ability to reason with them or address whatever their concerns are because I do not know their concerns. It is wrong and unfair to the nominees. 
   I do not deny each Senator his or her prerogative as a Member of this Senate. After 25 years here, I think I have demonstrated--and I certainly know in my heart--I have great respect for this institution and for its traditions, for all the men and women with whom I have served, the hundreds of men and women with whom I have served over the years in both parties. But this use of secret holds for extended periods to doom a nomination from ever being considered by the Senate is wrong, unfair, and beneath us. 
   Who is it who is afraid to vote on these nominations? Who is it who is hiding their opposition and obstructing these nominees? Can it be they are such a minority, they know that if it comes to a fair vote, these good men and women will be confirmed? 
   So rather than to allow a fair vote, they will keep it from coming to a vote. I would bet you that the same people who are holding these nominations back from a vote will go home on the Fourth of July and other holidays and give great speeches about the democracy of this country and how important democracy is and why we have to allow people to vote and express the will of the people--except in the Senate and, apparently, except if you are a minority or a woman. 
   If we can vote on the Stewart nomination within 4 weeks in session, we can vote on the Paez nomination within 4 years and the Berzon nomination within 2 years. Let us vote up or down. 
   Once more I say, look where we are: There is Stewart, pending 2 months; Marsha Berzon, pending 20 months; Justice Ronnie White of Missouri, pending 27 months; Judge Richard Paez, pending 44 months. I look at those green lines of this chart showing the time that each of these nominations has been pending and I wish they could each be the short sliver that represents the Stewart nomination. With a name like PATRICK LEAHY, I want to see green on St. Patrick's Day; I do not want to see the long green lines on this chart that represent delay and obstruction of votes on women and minority nominees. 
   Judge Richard Paez is an outstanding jurist, a source of great pride and inspiration to Hispanics in California and around the country. He served as a local judge before being confirmed to the Federal bench several years ago. He is currently a federal district court judge. He has twice been reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee, twice reported out for confirmation. He spent a total of 9 months over the last 2 years on the Senate Executive Calendar awaiting the opportunity for a final confirmation vote to the court of appeals. His nomination was first received 44 months ago, in January of 1996. 
   Justice Ronnie White, an outstanding member of the Missouri Supreme Court, has extensive experience in law and government. In fact, he is the first African American to serve on the Missouri Supreme Court. He has been twice reported favorably to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee. 
   He spent a total of 7 months on the floor calendar waiting the opportunity for a final confirmation vote. His nomination was first received by the Senate in June 1997--27 months ago. I am glad that finally, after all this time, the Democratic leader was able to announce a date for a vote on this longstanding nomination of this outstanding jurist. 
   As the St. Louis Post-Dispatch noted in an editorial last week:  
   Seven of the 10 judicial nominees who have been waiting the longest for confirmation are minorities or women. This is hardly a shock to those of us who have watched [Justice] White, an African-American, be ushered to the back of the bus.  
   The words of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. 
   Marsha Berzon has been one of the most qualified nominees I have seen in my 25 years. Her legal skills are outstanding. Her practice and productivity have been extraordinary. Lawyers against whom she has litigated regard her as highly qualified for the bench. Her opponents in litigation are praising her and asking for her to be confirmed. 
   She was long ago nominated for a judgeship within a circuit that saw this Senate hold up the nominations of other qualified women for months and years--people like Margaret Morrow, who was held up for so long; Ann Aiken, who was held up for so long; Margaret McKeown, who was held up for so long; Susan Oki Mollway, who was held up for so long. Marsha Berzon, too, has now been held up for 20 months. 
   The Atlanta Constitution, from Atlanta, GA, noted last Thursday:  
   Two U.S. appellate court nominees, Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon, both of California, have been on hold for four years and 20 months respectively. When Democrats tried Tuesday to get their colleagues to vote on the pair at long last, the Republicans scuttled the maneuver. The Paez case seems especially egregious. ..... This partisan stalling, this refusal to vote up or down on nominees, is unconscionable. It is not fair. It is not right. It is no way to run the federal judiciary. Chief Justice William Rehnquist is hardly a fan of [President] Clinton. Yet even he has been moved to decry Senate delaying tactics and the burdens that unfilled vacancies impose on the federal courts. Tuesday's deadlock bodes ill for judicial confirmations through the rest of [President] Clinton's term. This ideological obstructionism is so fierce that it strains our justice system and sets a terrible partisan example for years to come.  
   That is from the Atlanta Constitution. I share that concern. I have been on the floor of this Senate when we have had Republican Presidents with Republican nominations, saying that they deserve to be brought forward for a vote one way or the other, including a couple instances of nominees I intended to vote against. I still said they deserved a vote. And they got their vote. 
   In fact, I probably voted for 98 to 99 percent of President Ford's, President Reagan's, and President Bush's nominees--three Presidents with whom I have served. 
   What we are currently experiencing is unconscionable and unprecedented, these kinds of delays. I think we hurt the Senate when we do this. We will have Republican Presidents; we will have Democratic Presidents. We will have Republican-controlled Senates; and we will have Democratic-controlled Senates. I have served here twice with the Democrats in control; twice with the Republicans in control. The precedents we establish are important if we are to go into the next century as the kind of body the Senate should be. 
   We should be the conscience of the Nation. On some occasions we have been. But we tarnish the conscience of this great Nation if we establish the precedence of partisanship and rancor that go against all precedents and set the Senate on a course of meanness 
   and smallness. That is what we are doing with these nominations. We should establish, for future Senates, that we are above this kind of partisanship. 
   Nobody in this body owns a seat in the Senate. Every single person serving today will be gone someday. Every one of them will be replaced by others. As I said, in the relatively short time I have been here, hundreds of Senators have gone through this body. But every one of us are guided by what previous Senates have done. 
   Do not let us end this century and this millennium leaving, as guidance for the next century and the next millennium and the next Senate, partisanship that tears at the very fabric, not only of the Senate but of the independence of the Federal judiciary itself. So many judges, judges who are considered conservative, judges who are considered liberal, judges who have had a Republican background or a Democratic background, judges who have been appointed by Republican Presidents, judges who have been appointed by Democratic Presidents, have been united in saying: Stop this. Do not go on with this. Because you are tearing at the very core of our independent judiciary, the most independent judiciary on Earth, a judiciary whose very independence allows us to maintain a balanced country, a country that is the most powerful on Earth, but a country that is also the most free and the most respected democracy. And a main factor guaranteeing that freedom and that democracy is our independent judiciary.  
   So, against this backdrop, I, again, ask the Senate to be fair to these judicial nominees and all nominees. For the last few years the Senate has allowed one or two or three secret holds to stop judicial nominations, and that is not fair. 
   Let me tell you what the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court wrote, a man who is widely considered a conservative Republican, also a man who, as we saw when he presided over the Senate earlier this year, is a man of fairness, of integrity and of great learning. He wrote in January of last year:  
   Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. ..... The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.  
   I could not agree more with Chief Justice Rehnquist. We should follow his advice. Let the Republican leadership schedule up-or-down votes on the nominations of Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon so that the Senate can finally act on them. Let us be fair to all. 
   The response to the Senate action last week was condemnation of the Republican leadership's refusal to proceed to vote on the nominations of Judge Paez, Justice White, and Ms. Berzon. A Washington Post editorial characterized the conduct of the Republican majority as ``simply baffling'' and noted:  
   [T]he Constitution does not make the Senate's role in the confirmation process optional, and the Senate ends up abdicating responsibility when the majority leader denies nominees a timely vote. All the nominees awaiting floor votes, Mr. Stewart included, should receive them immediately.  
   The editorial speaks to the responsibility of the Senate, and it is right. 
   On our side of the aisle, we have lived up to the responsibility. Again, I tell all Senators, no matter how an individual Democratic Senator may vote on any one of the pending nominees, no Democratic Senator has a hold on any judicial nominee. We are all prepared to vote. 
   It is October 1, and the Senate has acted on only 19 of the 68 judicial nominations the President has sent us this year. We have only 4 weeks in which the Senate is scheduled to be in session for the rest of the year. By this time last year, the committee had held 10 confirmation hearings for judicial nominees and 43 judges had been confirmed. By comparison, this year there have been only 4 hearings and only 19 judges have been confirmed. We are at less than half the productivity of last year and miles behind the pace of 1994, when by this time we had held 21 hearings and the Senate had confirmed 73 judges. 
   The Florida Sun-Sentinel said last Monday:  
   The ``Big Stall'' in the U.S. Senate continues, as Senators work slower and slower each year in confirming badly needed federal judges. ..... This worsening process is inexcusable, bordering on malfeasance in office, especially given the urgent need to fill vacancies in a badly undermanned federal bench. ..... The stalling, in many cases, is nothing more than a partisan political dirty trick.  
   For the last several years, I have been urging the Judiciary Committee and the Senate to proceed to consider and confirm judicial nominees more promptly, without the months of delay that now accompany so many nominations. Moreover, in the last couple weeks, as I said earlier, independent studies have verified the basis for many of my concerns. 
   According to the report recently released by the Task Force on Judicial Selection of Citizens for Independent Courts, the time it has taken for the Senate to consider nominees has grown significantly, from an average of 83 days in 1993 and 1994 during the 103rd Congress, to over 200 days for the years 1997 and 1998 during the last Congress, the 105th. In fact, if we look at the average number of days from confirmation to nomination on an annual basis, we would see that the Senate has broken records for delay in each of the last 3 succeeding years, 1996, 1997, and 1998. In fact, in 1998, the average time for confirmation was over 230 days. 
   That independent report also verifies that the time to confirm women as nominees is now significantly longer than to confirm men as nominees. That is a difference that defies any logical explanation except one, and that one explanation does not shed credit on this great institution. They recommend that ``the responsible officials address this matter to assure that candidates for judgeships are not treated differently based on their gender''--because they know that today they are. 
   I recall too well the obstacle course that such outstanding women nominees as Margaret Morrow, Ann Aiken, Margaret McKeown, and Susan Oki Mollway were forced to run. Now it is Marsha Berzon who is being delayed and obstructed, another outstanding woman judicial nominee held up, and held up anonymously because everybody knows that if she had a fair up-or-down vote, she would be confirmed. 
   I am angered by this, quite frankly, Mr. President. I think how I would react if this was my daughter being held up like this, or the daughter of someone I knew. 
   The report of Citizens for Independent Courts recommends the Senate should eliminate the practice of allowing individual Members to place holds on a nominee. We ought to consider that. 
   This summer, Prof. Sheldon Goldman and Elliot Slotnick published their most recent analysis of the confirmation process in President Clinton's second term in Judicature magazine. They note the ``unprecedented delay at both the committee and floor stages of Senate consideration of Clinton judicial nominees'' and conclude:  
   It is impossible to escape the conclusion that the Republican leadership in the Senate is engaged in a protracted effort to delay decisionmaking on judicial appointments whether or not the appointee was, ultimately, confirmable.  
   In fact, I can think of a number of these people, having been held up month after month after month, who finally got a vote and ended up being confirmed overwhelmingly. Margaret Morrow is an example of that. She was held up for so long that it became a national disgrace that a woman so qualified, backed by both Republicans and Democrats in California, was held up apparently because she was a woman. And when finally the shame of it would not allow her to be held up any longer, she came to a vote on the floor and was confirmed overwhelmingly. 
   In spite of efforts last year in the aftermath of strong criticism from the Chief Justice of the United States, the vacancies facing the Federal judiciary remain at 63, with 17 on the horizon. The vacancies gap is not being closed. We have more Federal judicial vacancies extend longer and affecting more people. There will be more in the coming months. Judicial vacancies now stand at approximately 8 percent of the Federal judiciary. If you went to the number of judges recommended by the judicial conference, the vacancy rate would be over 15 percent and total over 135. 
   Nominees deserve to be treated with dignity and dispatch, not delayed for 2 and 3 years. We are talking about people going to the Federal judiciary, a third independent branch of Government. They are entitled to dignity and respect. They are not entitled automatically for us to vote aye, but they are entitled to a vote, aye or nay. 
   How do we go to other countries and say: You need an independent judiciary; you have to have a judiciary that people can trust; you have to treat it with respect; when we are not doing that in the Senate? 
   They deserve at least that. No nominee gets an automatic ``aye'' vote, but every nominee ought to be heard and at least voted on one way or the other. 
   One of our greatest protections as Americans is an independent judiciary, one the American people can respect and whose decisions they can respect. We have built in all kinds of counterweights: the district court, the courts of appeal, the Supreme Court. We have this to make sure that there is this independence and balance. Yet we seem to be putting a break on it. The Senate's actions undermine our independent judiciary by the way we mistreat judicial nominations and perpetuate unnecessary vacancies. 
   We are seeing outstanding nominees nitpicked and delayed to the point that good men and women are being deterred from seeking to serve as Federal judges. Some excellent lawyers are being asked to serve as Federal judges and they say: No, I do not want to go through that. Why should I? 
   In private practice, it is announced they are going to be nominated to be a  Federal judge. All their partners will come in and say: This is wonderful, congratulations. We are going to have a great party for you Friday. And when are you going to move out of that corner office, because we want to move in? We realize you cannot take on any new clients. We would be a little bit better off if you were out of the office now so that we do not have any conflicts of interest. 
   Then, for 2 or 3 years, they sit there, no income, no practice, neither fish nor foul. In a Senate that is constantly voting to say we are in favor of family values--as though anybody is against them--maybe we ought to also consider the families of nominees, who might want to plan, and who need to know where that nomination is headed without unnecessary delay. 
   I have been here with five Presidents--I respected and know them all--President Ford, President Reagan, President Carter, President Bush, and President Clinton. 
   I have been on the Judiciary Committee during that time. I know for a fact that no President, Republican or Democrat, has ever consulted more closely with Senators of the party opposite from his on judicial nominees. No other President has consulted as much with members of the other party as President Clinton has, and that has greatly expanded the time it takes to make these nominations. But he has done that. 
   Having done that, the Senate at least should go about the business of voting on confirmation for the scores of judicial nominations that have been delayed for too long without justification. 
   This summer, in his remarks to the American Bar Association, the President again urged us to action. He said:  
   We simply cannot afford to allow political considerations to keep our courts vacant and to keep justice waiting.  
   We must redouble our efforts to work with the President to end the longstanding vacancies that plague the Federal courts and disadvantage all Americans. That is our constitutional responsibility. 
   I continue to urge the Republican leadership to attend to these nominations without obstruction and proceed to vote on them with dispatch. I urge that they schedule a vote on Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon without further delay. Again, I note for the record that no Democratic Senator objects to them going forward for a vote--none. We are prepared to go forward with a vote on the shortest of notice at any time. So the continuing delays on both Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon, are on the Republican side. 
   I do appreciate what the distinguished Republican leader and the distinguished Democratic leader worked out today. And I appreciate the efforts of the distinguished senior Senator from Utah. It is my hope that the example the four of us have set today will move the Senate into a new productive chapter of our efforts to consider judicial nominations. 
   We took the action of initiating the calling up of a judicial nominee last week to demonstrate where we were. We have urged the taking up of a judicial nominee today whom some Democratic Senators oppose in order to demonstrate our commitment to fairness for all. 
   There is never a justification to deny any of these judicial nominees a fair up-or-down vote. There is no excuse for the failure to have a vote on Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, again, I make this heartfelt plea. I have made the same plea in private to the Republican leader, the Democratic leader, and others. I love the Senate for what it can and should do. I know that, like everybody else my time here is only as long as the voters and my health allow. I also know that someday I will be gone and somebody else from Vermont will fill this seat. 
   I look at the Senate as the conscience of this great Nation. It is a body moving by precedence, moving sometimes by what some would say is an overformalized ritual, but moving in a way that the country can respect and in which the best of the country can be reflected, a body that is built on precedence. 
   A famous Thomas Jefferson story spoke of the Senate as the saucer that allows cooling of passions, the Senate also allows us to step above partisan politics because of our 6-year terms. We have not done that with the judiciary. We have a duty to protect the Senate, but also, because of our unique role in the confirmation process, we have a duty to protect the integrity and independence of the Federal judiciary. We are failing both in our duties  as Senators and we are failing in our duty to the Federal court. 
   Let us all take a deep breath and think about that and go back to doing what we should--not for this President or any past incident, but for all Presidents, present and future, and for all Senates, present and future, and for the American people, and for the greatest Nation on Earth, present and future. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator WYDEN in support of this resolution to urge the United States to seek a global consensus supporting a moratorium on tariffs and discriminatory taxation of electronic commerce. I thank Senator WYDEN and Congressman COX for their leadership in keeping the Internet free of discriminatory taxes in the United States and around the world. 
   The Internet allows businesses to sell their goods all over the world in the blink of an eye. This unique power also presents a unique challenge. That challenge facing the United States and the world is developing tax policies to nurture this exciting new market. That is why I am pleased to cosponsor this resolution to urge the President to seek a global moratorium on discriminatory taxes and tariffs on electronic commerce. 
   The growth of electronic commerce is everywhere, including my home state of Vermont. Today hundreds of Vermont businesses are doing business on the Internet, ranging from the Vermont Teddy Bear Company to Al's Snowmobile Parts Warehouse to Ben & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream. These Vermont businesses are of all sizes and customer bases, from Main Street merchants to boutique entrepreneurs to a couple of ex-hippies who sell great ice cream. But what Vermont online sellers do have in common is the fact that Internet commerce lets them erase the geographic barriers that historically have limited our access to markets where our products can thrive. Cyberselling is paying off for Vermont and the rest of the United States. 
   As electronic commerce continues to grow, the United States must take the lead in fostering sound international tax policies. The United States was the incubator of the Internet, and the world closely watches the Internet policies that we debate and propose. Our leadership is critical to the continued growth of commerce on the Internet. Our resolution advances the leadership role of the United States by urging the administration to secure a global moratorium on discriminatory e-commerce taxes. 
   With more than 190 nations around the world able to levy discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce, we need this resolution to contribute to the stability necessary for electronic commerce to flourish. We are not asking for a tax-free zone on the Internet; if sales taxes and other taxes would apply to traditional sales and services, then those taxes would also apply to Internet sales under our resolution. But our resolution would urge a global ban on any taxes applied only to Internet sales in a discriminatory manner. Let's not allow the future of electronic commerce--with its great potential to expand the markets of Main Street businesses--to be crushed by the weight of multiple international taxation. 
   Today, there are more than 700,000 businesses selling their sales and services on the World Wide Web around the world. Estimates predict that the number of e-business Web sites will top 1 million by 2003. This explosion in Web growth has led to thousands of new and exciting opportunities for businesses from Main Street to Wall Street. 
   The International Internet Tax Freedom Resolution will help ensure that these businesses and many others will continue to reap the rewards of electronic commerce.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at-long last the Congress is approving and passing S. 249, the Missing, Exploited and Runaway Children Protection Act, which will reauthorize programs under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and will authorize funding for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. I have been working since 1996 to get this legislation reauthorized. For each of the past several months I have come to the floor to express my disappointment over how long it has taken to pass this noncontroversial legislation. 
   I had some minor concerns with the House amended version of S. 249, but as I said in my statement June 30 of this year, after receiving some clarification and assurances from Secretary Shalala on these concerns, I decided that the House amendments should not keep this important piece of legislation from passing. I am pleased that we could finally clear this bill on the other side of the aisle. 
   The Missing, Exploited and Runaway Children Protection Act of 1999 reauthorizes programs under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and authorizes funding for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Both programs are critical to our nation's youth and to our nation's well-being. 
   In addition to providing shelter for children in need, the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act ensures that these children and their families have access to important services, such as individual, family or group counseling, alcohol and drug counseling and a myriad of other resources available to help these young people and their families get back on track. As the National Network for Youth has stressed, the Act's programs ``provide critical assistance to youth in high-risk situations all over the country.'' 
   The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children provides extremely worthwhile and effective assistance to children and families facing crises across the U.S. and around the world. In 1998, the National Center helped law enforcement officers locate over 5,000 missing children. The National Center serves a critical role as a clearinghouse of resources and information for both family members and law enforcement officers. They have developed a network of hotels and restaurants which provide free services to parents in search of their children and have also developed extensive training programs. 
   I do want to thank the many advocates, who have worked with me over the years, for their tireless efforts to improve the bill. In particular, I must mention the members of the Vermont Coalition of runaway and Homeless Youth Programs and the National Network for Youth for their dedication throughout this process. 
   This bill, S. 249, should have been enacted last year. It should have been enacted when the Houses finally sent it back to us in May of this year. There was absolutely no reason to stall on this noncontroversial legislation. I am pleased that we were finally able to pass it so these important programs can continue to succeed.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity first to applaud Senator BOND and Senator MIKULSKI for the tremendous job they have done balancing the demands of some of our most important programs with a very limited budget. The Fiscal Year 2000 VA/HUD and Independent Agencies appropriations bill which they have crafted is a good bill and stands in stark contrast to the House passed bill which included some devastating cuts to a number of very important housing and community development programs. The Chairman and Ranking Member were very responsive to my requests and concerns with the bill as were their staffs. 
   I do remain concerned about funding for several HUD programs and I hope that there will be an opportunity in conference to revisit these accounts and provide some additional funding. In particular, the failure to fund incremental section 8 vouchers will cause a real hardship for the thousands of families across the country on wait lists for rental assistance. In Vermont alone the wait for Section 8 rental assistance can stretch for years and some lists have been closed completely because of  the extensive wait. The booming economy is great for business but not so good for low-income families who are finding themselves priced out of the housing market. More and more people in Vermont and throughout the country are paying more than 30 percent of their income for housing. Last year Congress authorized 100,000 vouchers for FY 2000. The Administration has included those vouchers in their budget request. We should include funding for those vouchers in the FY 2000 VA/HUD Appropriations bill. 
   I would also like to voice my concern for the funding provided for the Youthbuild program and for the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation. Youthbuild is a wonderful example of a program that is helping develop leadership skills in at-risk youth while providing much needed affordable housing. The program has been an unqualified success in Vermont where Youthbuild participants have constructed and rehabilitated affordable housing in Burlington's Enterprise Community. From weatherizing homes to building single and multi-family housing, Youthbuild Burlington has proven the value of this program in investing at-risk youth in their communities while building skills for the future, and meeting the critical need for quality affordable housing in Burlington. Earlier this year I joined 49 of my colleagues in a letter to Senator BOND and Senator MIKULSKI supporting a $75 million appropriation for the Youthbuild program. Unfortunately the bill we are considering includes only $42.5 million for this valuable program. The Department's ability to offer grants to new Youthbuild programs or provide additional support for existing programs would be greatly reduced by this funding level. I hope that we will be able to increase funding for Youthbuild in Conference. 
   The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (NRC) is another important HUD program which received a significant funding cut. This bill reduces funding for the NRC by a third. The NRC has been an invaluable partner in the drive to increase home ownership in Vermont and throughout the nation. Four homeownership centers in Vermont are currently implementing the Neighborworks model of ``full cycle lending'' which has made such a difference in bringing the opportunity of homeownership to lower income families in my state. Time after time, these homeownership centers have allowed families who would not otherwise have been considered by commercial lenders, to secure mortgages for affordable homes, and helped families who would otherwise have suffered foreclosure remain in their homes. The level of funding proposed in the Senate bill would prevent 12,000 families currently in the pipeline from receiving further assistance, and would result in 8,700 fewer families realizing the dream of homeownership and 80,000 families not receiving homebuyer or foreclosure prevention counseling. I hope that we can prevent those results by providing additional funding for this valuable program in conference. 
   Finally, I would like to once again express my support for the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) program. The Senate bill provides $80 million for this important program, $15 million below last year's level and $45 million below the President's request. The CDFI Fund is an economic development initiative that was adopted with overwhelming bi-partisan support several years ago. The program is an important investment tool for economically distressed communities. CDFI leverages private investment to stretch every Federal dollar. This program is working effectively in communities across the country, and I believe additional resources are needed to maximize the value of this important federal investment. 
   I look forward to working with Senator MIKULSKI and Senator BOND during conference to secure additional funding for these programs.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman in a colloquy. First, let me thank the Senator from Missouri for his diligence in balancing funding for the wide variety of programs within the VA-HUD Appropriations bill under very difficult budget constraints. Under these constraints, you were able to increase funding for the Environmental Programs and Management over Fiscal Year 1999. However, one very important organization in the Northeast was not funded this year. For more than a decade, this body has supported an organization called the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management or (NESCAUM) with a modest $300,000 line item. NESCAUM is a non-profit organization that provides technical assistance to the Northeast states and the nation on a host of important air quality issues. By providing recommendations for consistent regional action, NESCAUM helps both states and regulated industry avoid a costly patchwork of differing regulatory requirements. While I know that this is a very difficult year, I believe that NESCAUM provides a valuable service and is strongly supported by the Senators from our region. At a minimum, I believe the Environmental Protection Agency should be encouraged to allocate $300,000 from the Environmental Programs and Management account to NESCAUM.

   Mr. LEAHY. I understand.  
   Mr. President, I was on the floor last week when the majority leader brought up S. 625, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999, but then he immediately filed for cloture on the bill. I was rather surprised by the action, since, on behalf of the Democratic leader, I did not object to proceeding to the bankruptcy bill. Indeed, my side of the aisle was ready for a reasonable and fair debate on passing bankruptcy reform legislation. But when you file for cloture within seconds of bringing the bankruptcy reform bill up for debate on the Senate floor, that is not reasonable or fair. A cloture motion is for the express purpose to bring to a close debate but this was saying we will bring to close the debate before we even have the debate. It is as if we were in Alice in Wonderland. Cloture first, then debate. 
   Mr. President, every American agrees with the basic principle that debts should be repaid. The vast majority of Americans are able to meet their obligations. But, for those who fall on financial hard times, bankruptcy should be available in a fair and balanced way. 
   Our country's founders felt this principle was so important that it should be enshrined in the Constitution. 
   Article I, section 8 of the Constitution explicitly grants Congress power to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States. 
   We in Congress have a constitutional responsibility to oversee 
   our nation's bankruptcy laws. The Senate should now take that constitutional responsibility seriously. 
   Unfortunately, this premature cloture motion to cut off debate before it even started on this bill is not a serious effort. 
   If we are going to respect the fact we are dealing with a constitutional issue here we should not start off the debate by stopping the debate. We know there is a rise in bankruptcies and people are abusing the system. Fine, let's close any loopholes in the bankruptcy code. But there are some other issues we should look at. What about credit cards? Last year we had a very balanced reform bill which passed 97 to 1 in the Senate. We had consumer credit card reforms in that bipartisan bill. Now we do not any consumer credit card reforms in this bill before us today. Should we not have some debate on whether we should get those reforms back in this bill to add balance to any reform measure? 
   As the Department of Justice stated in its written views on this bill: The challenge posed by the unprecedented level of bankruptcy filings requires us to ask for greater responsibility from both debtors and creditors. Credit card companies must give consumers more and better information so that they can understand and better manage their debts. 
   The Administration has made it clear that for the President to sign bankruptcy reform legislation into law it must contain strong consumer credit disclosure and protection provisions. I wholeheartedly agree. 
   The credit card industry must shoulder some responsibility for the nationwide rise in personal bankruptcy filings. Last year, the credit card lenders sent out 3.4 billion solicitations. That is more than 12 credit card solicitations a year for every man, woman and child in America. 
   I have an example of one of these credit card solicitations. Let me show you what happens in some of these credit card solicitation. Here is one for a Titanium Visa card. It was passed out after the movie: ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.'' You get some kid coming out, he's handed this, it's ``titanium, baby.'' They will give one for you and one for Mini-me, I guess, at the movie theater. It calls its credit card ``titanium, baby.'' It has an introductory rate of only 2.9 percent. How could any 13-year-old coming out of that movie not want that great credit card? 
   Besides, it comes in three versions. Especially attractive to the 10-year-olds who might be getting one of these credit cards: ``Groovy Flowers,'' ``Shagadelie Swirls,'' and, of course, for their older siblings who might be 16 or 17, and more staid, you have ``Traditional.'' 
   The next chart shows the second page of this credit card solicitation. They are now called, I can't quite do it like Austin Powers, but they are ``smashing baby.'' But then look at the small print: ``2.9 percent introductory,'' you teenagers, you cannot do better. Of course that's available only for the 5 billing cycles. Then the interest rate goes to 10.99 percent. Getting awful close to 11 percent. However, that is not quite the full story. You have an annual interest rate for cash advances that is 19.99 percent. 
   We are now up to 20 percent. Oh, no, wait. There is another little insy-binsy-winsy-tiny print in this solicitation. That is, if you have two late payments during any 6-month period, whoops, you are up to 22.99 percent. 
   Can you imagine, as the kids get these Austin Powers credit card applications as they are walking out of the theaters for 2.9 percent, all of a sudden they are up to 22.99 percent? 
   It is not all bad, and I want to speak in favor of the credit card companies. Most people seeing this would figure they are really out to shaft you; they are taking advantage of you; they are being unfair to you; they are being usurious; they are being greedy; they are being mean; they are being sneaky; they are trying to loop these people in. I know most people say that about the credit card companies, but I want to be fair to them because if you apply for this, you get the chance to receive two free tickets to the movie, one medium popcorn, and two small drinks. 
   I hope Senators who thought, because these credit card companies were deceiving these teenagers into something to give them a 22.9-percent rate, those credit card companies were being mean feel badly about that. After all, you forgot about the medium popcorn and the two small drinks and the two free movie tickets. 
   There are billions of credit card solicitations like this sent to Americans every year, and that has increased the number of personal bankruptcies. If cloture is invoked, then the Senate will be prevented from adding any credit industry reforms to this bill because the amendments will not be germane. That is not a reasonable or fair. 
   Senator TORRICELLI and Senator GRASSLEY negotiated with the credit card industry to craft a managers' amendment that incorporates many of the credit industry reforms proposed by Senators SCHUMER, REED, DODD, SARBANES, and others. It is a bipartisan effort, and I commend them. I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment to add more balance to the bill. But we cannot even hear about this bipartisan effort if we invoke cloture. 
   Senator KENNEDY plans to offer an amendment to increase the minimum wage over the next 2 years from $5.15 to $6.15 an hour. I am proud to be a cosponsor of that amendment. Maybe if we had a decent minimum wage we would have a lot less bankruptcies. It is more than appropriate to help working men and woman earn a livable wage on a bill related to bankruptcy. 
   These minimum wage workers are some of the same Americans who are struggling to make a living everyday and might be forced into bankruptcy by a job loss, divorce or other unexpected economic event. More than 11 million workers will get a pay raise as a result of a $1 increase in the minimum wage. We should all agree to help millions of hard working American families live in dignity. 
   But the Senate would be prevented from considering any amendment to raise the minimum wage if cloture is invoked on this bill now--on the first day of debate on bankruptcy reform. That is not reasonable or fair. 
   As we move forward with reforms that are appropriate to eliminate abuses in the system, we need to remember the people who use the system, both the debtor and the creditor. We need to balance the interests of creditors with those of middle class 
   Americans who need the opportunity to resolve overwhelming financial burdens. 
   I welcome Senator TORRICELLI, the new Ranking Member of the Administrative Oversight and the Courts Subcommittee, to the challenges this matter presents. I know that he and his staff have been working hard and in good faith to improve this bill. 
   As the last Congress proved, there are many competing interests in the bankruptcy reform debate that make it difficult to enact a balanced and bipartisan bill into law. Unfortunately, Congress failed to meet that challenge last year after the Senate had crafted a bill that passed 97-1. 
   I look back to what Senator DURBIN did, with heroic efforts, last year in  crafting a bill that passed 97-1, and then it fell apart in a partisan conference. This is not a matter that should be partisan. Every one of our States has people who are facing bankruptcy. Every one of our States has the kind of shoddy practices shown here where we have these credit card applications passed out to kids coming out of a movie. They are almost designed to get them to go from this 2.9 percent interest to 23 percent interest as fast as they possibly can. 
   But if we are going to go into bankruptcy reform, let's do it right. I think we should. I worked hard in the Judiciary Committee on this bipartisan bill. Let's do it in a way that we look at all aspects of it, and let's ask some of the credit card companies and others if they are not doing as much to create the problem as anybody else. 
   I can give a lot of other examples. I could show you a member of my office whose 6-year-old son received a preapproved credit application for $50,000. All he had to do was sign it. I do not know about kids today, but when I was 6 years old, if I had a credit card with $50,000 worth of credit in my pocket, I could have thought of a lot of things I would have liked to have bought. 
   This may not be the spy that shagged us; it may well be the credit card companies that shagged the Senate. We ought to pay attention to the fact that when they are asking kids to pay 22.99 percent interest, there is more than one reason why we have bankruptcies in this country. 
   I am hopeful that this year Republicans and Democrats in the Senate can work together to pass and enact into law balanced legislation that corrects the abuses by both debtors and creditors in the bankruptcy system. 
   But this partisan attempt to prematurely cut off debate before we even started to consider this bill does not bode well for that effort. 
   I hope that once this cloture motion is defeated, the Senate will begin a reasonable and fair debate on bankruptcy reform legislation that reflects a balancing of rights between debtors and creditors. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I deeply regret that we have reached this point in connection with the nomination of Brian Theadore Stewart to the District Court for Utah. Please understand that Democrats are prepared to vote on this nomination, as we are on all of the judicial nominations pending on the Senate Executive Calendar. This impasse is caused not by Democrats' refusals to vote on that nomination but by Republican refusals to allow a vote on the nominations of Judge Paez or Ms. Berzon. If we can vote on the Stewart nomination in less than 2 months, we should be able to vote on the Paez nomination within 4 years and the Berzon nomination within 2 years. 
   This debate is about fairness. The Senate needs to be fair to all people in this country. For too long nominees--judicial nominees like Judge Paez, Ms. Berzon and Justice Ronnie White of Missouri, and Executive Branch nominees like Bill Lann Lee-- have been opposed in anonymity through secret holds and delaying tactics. They have been forced to run a gauntlet of Senate confirmation. Those strong enough to survive are being dealt the final death blow not by being defeating in a fair up or down vote on the nomination but through a refusal of the Republican leadership to call them up for a vote. These nomination are being killed through neglect and silence, not defeated by a majority vote. 
   Today we are not asking for any Senator's vote for any nomination. Instead, I am asking the Senate recognize that its responsibility is to vote on all the judicial nominations on the calendar. We can vote for them or against them, we can vote them up or vote them down, but after 44 months or 27 months or 20 months, after completing every step in what is a long, tortuous confirmation process, the nominations of Judge Richard Paez, Justice Ronnie White and Marsha Berzon are as entitled to a Senate vote as the nomination of Ted Stewart. 
   I do not begrudge Ted Stewart a Senate vote. Despite strong opposition from many quarters from Utah and around the country, from environmentalists and civil rights advocates alike, I did not oppose the Stewart nomination in Committee and I expect to vote for his final confirmation here on the floor of the United States Senate. I have been supportive of Chairman HATCH in his efforts to expedite Committee consideration of the Stewart nomination with the expectation that these other nominees who have been held up so long, nominees like Judge Richard Paez, Marsha Berzon and Justice White, were to be considered by the Senate and finally voted on, as well. The Chairman and I have both voted for Judge Paez and Justice White each time they were considered by the Committee and we both voted for and support Marsha Berzon. 
   I have tried to work with the Chairman and with the Majority Leader on all these nominations. I would like to work with those whom the Majority Leader is protecting from having to vote on the Paez and Berzon nominations, but I do not know who there are. In spite of what was supposed to be a Senate policy that did away with anonymous holds, we remain in a situation where I do not even know who is objecting to proceeding to schedule a vote on the Paez and Berzon nominations, let alone why they are objecting. In this setting I have no ability to reason with them or address whatever 
   their concerns are because I do not know their concerns. That is wrong and unfair to the nominees. 
   I do not deny to any Senator his or her prerogatives as a member of the Senate. I have great respect for this institutions and its traditions. Still, I must say that this use of anonymous holds for extended periods that doom a nomination from ever being considered by the United States Senate is wrong and unfair. 
   Again, I say that this debate is about fairness and about the Senate being fair to all nominees and to other Senators and to the American people. If we can vote on the Stewart nomination within 4 weeks in session, we can vote on the Paez nomination within 4 years and the Berzon nomination within 2 years. That is the point that the distinguished Democratic Leader was making by moving to proceed to consider those nominations this evening. The Republican majority has refused to debate those nominations and continues its steadfast refusal to vote on them after years of delay. 
   I do not want to see any judicial nomination held up without a vote, but the Republican leadership is not being fair to the other judicial nominees on the calendar. We ask only for a firm commitment that they will each get an up or down vote, too. The Republican Majority refuses to make even that commitment to a vote before the end of the session on these qualified nominees. 
   In my statement last week I detailed the path that each of these nominees has traveled to the Senate. All are now available for a vote on confirmation by the Senate. All should be accorded an up or down vote.  
   Judge Richard Paez is an outstanding jurist and a source of great pride and inspiration to Hispanics in California and around the country. He served as a local judge before being confirmed to the federal court bench several years ago and is currently a Federal District Court Judge. He has twice been reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee and has spent a total of 9 months over the last 2 years on the Senate Executive Calendar awaiting the opportunity for a final confirmation vote. His nomination was first received by the Senate in January 1996, 44 months ago. 
   Justice Ronnie White is an outstanding member of the Missouri Supreme Court and has extensive experience in law and government. He is the first African American to serve on the Missouri Supreme Court. He has also been twice reported favorably to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee and has spent a total of 7 months on the floor calendar awaiting the opportunity for a final confirmation vote. His nomination was first received by the Senate in June 1997, 27 months ago. 
   Marsha Berzon is one of the most qualified nominees I have seen in 25 years. Her legal skills are outstanding, her practice and productivity have been extraordinary. Lawyers against whom she has litigated regard her as highly qualified for the bench. Nominated for a judgeship within the Circuit that saw this Senate hold up the nominations of other qualified women for months and years--people like Margaret Morrow, Ann Aiken, Margaret McKeown and Susan Oki Mollway--she, too, is listed ahead of the Stewart nomination on the floor calendar. Ms. Berzon was first nominated in January 1998, 20 months ago, and a year and one-half before Mr. Stewart. 
   It is against this backdrop that we are asking the Senate to be fair to these judicial nominees and all nominees. I do not want to see votes delayed on any nominee. For the last few years the Senate has allowed one or two or three secret holds to stop judicial nominations from even getting a vote. That is wrong. 
   The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court wrote in January last year:  
   Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote....... The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.  
   Let us follow the advice of the Chief Justice. Let the Republican leadership schedule up or down votes on the nominations of Judge Paez, Justice White and Marsha Berzon so that we can vote them up or vote them down. And so that we can proceed on all the judicial nominations that our federal courts need to do their job of administering justice. Let us be fair to all.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from South Dakota, Mr. DASCHLE, stated the case very well this evening about the unprecedented sequence of three votes on judicial nominations. As I look at the Senate floor now, I have served in this body longer than anybody presently on the floor. In 25 years, I have not seen an instance where we have had such a series of votes. 
   We certainly have had times when Republicans have been in control of the Senate and times when Democrats have been in control of the Senate where nominees were sometimes voted down and sometimes were voted up, which is the way it should be. When the President is of a different party from the party controlling the Senate, that does not mean that the President's nominee, the man or woman he nominates for whatever position, automatically has to be voted against because one party controls the Senate and a different party is in the White House. 
   I look at two of my very distinguished, dear friends on the floor--the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Michigan--both of whom have voted many times for nominees of the President of the other party in a whole lot of areas, certainly within their expertise on armed services but also for ambassadors and judicial nominations. 
   I am sure that if the distinguished Senators sitting here were to go back and search their memories, they could think of a number of people for whom they voted who were confirmed and who were not the persons they would have nominated had they been President. They might have picked somebody else. They might have picked somebody with a different political  bent or ideology. But I think they have given the President of the United States the benefit of the doubt, and if the person is otherwise qualified, he or she gets the vote. 
   We have come to a difficult situation with judges. There continue to be a large number of vacancies, and there are a lot of nominees who are not being voted on. There are some that have waited for several years to be voted on. We talked about Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon who have been waiting for years to be voted on. We should either vote for or against them. 
   The distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee deserves great credit for having gotten these nominees through our committee, notwithstanding opposition from some members of his own party, and for having gotten them onto the floor and on the calendar. I compliment the distinguished senior Senator from Utah, Mr. HATCH, for what he has done. 
   I have worked closely with him to help him get matters out of that committee. There were some matters with which I disagreed and that I voted against. But he was chairman, and I thought he should have as much leeway as possible in setting the agenda. I made it possible through various procedural actions for him to get his legislation out of committee. 
   Tonight we had a situation born out of the frustration, possibly mistakes, and, unfortunately, some unnecessary partisanship--although not partisanship between the distinguished chairman of the committee and myself. I intend to vote for his recommended nominee for district judge from Utah, Mr. Stewart. I intend to vote for him as I did in the committee. 
   I also intend to vote for Marsha Berzon. I intend to vote for Judge Richard Paez, Justice Ronnie White, and, for that matter, for all of the other judicial nominees who are on the Executive Calendar. I intend to vote for every one of them. 
   I hope we will have a chance to vote on them, not just in committee where I have voted for each one of them, but on the floor of the Senate. That is what the Constitution speaks of in our advise and consent capacity. That is what these good and decent people have a right to expect. That is what our oath of office should compel Members to do--to vote for or against. I do not question the judgment or conscience of any man or woman in this Senate if they vote differently than I do, but vote. 
   We have just a very few people, a small handful of people stopping these nominees from coming to a vote. Basically, the Senate is saying we vote ``maybe"--not yes or no--we vote maybe. That is beneath Members as Senators. 
   We are privileged to serve in this body. There are a quarter of a billion people in this great country. There are only 100 men and women who get a chance to serve at any time to represent that quarter of a billion people in this Senate. It is the United States Senate. No one owns the seat. No one will be here forever. All will leave at some time. When we leave, we can only look back and say: What kind of service did we give? Did we put the country's interests first? Or did we put partisan interest first? Did we put integrity first, or did we play behind the scenes and do things that were wrong? 
   I hope my children will be able to look at their father's representation in this body as one of honor and integrity, as many of my friends on both sides of this aisle have done. 
   I hope what happened tonight was something we will not see repeated. I understand the distinguished majority leader in going forward with his motion. I understand and support the motion of the distinguished Democratic leader. 
   Now that this has happened, can it be like the little escape valve on a pressure cooker? The distinguished Presiding Officer and I are from a generation that remembers the old pressure cookers prior to the age of microwaves. Certainly, my wife and I as youngsters saw a pressure cooker now and then in the kitchen. Let us hope that maybe tonight's votes will act as a little valve and let the pressure off. 
   I do not want to infringe on the kindness of the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, two of the very best friends I have ever had in the Senate and two Senators whom I respect and like the most here. 
   Let me close with this: Maybe the pressure cooker has allowed its pressure to be released now. I suggest that the distinguished majority leader, the distinguished Democratic leader, the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. HATCH, and I now sit down and perhaps quietly, without the glare of publicity and the cameras, try to work out where we go from here. It may be necessary for the four of us to meet with the President. But let us find a way to tell these nominees they will get a vote one way or the other. 
   I am not asking anybody how they should or should not vote but allow nominees to have a vote. All the people being nominated are extremely highly qualified lawyers and judges. They have to put their lives on hold and the lives of their family on hold while they wait. They are neither fish nor fowl as a nominee. In private practice, all your partners come in and throw a big party and say it is wonderful, we are so proud of you, could you move out of the corner office because we want to take it now. And you cannot do anything while you wait and wait and wait. 
   Vote them up, vote them down. 
   Now that we have done this, let the cooler heads of the Senate prevail so the Senate can reassure the United States we are meeting our responsibility. Again, each Member is privileged to be here. There are only 100 Members, with all our failings and all our faults, to represent a quarter of a billion people. Let us represent that quarter of a billion people better on this issue. 
   The distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. HATCH, and I have a close personal relationship. We will continue to have that. We will continue to work together, but the Senate has to work with us.

   Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and on behalf of the Democratic leader, I must object to proceeding to the bill under those limitations which have not yet been cleared on this side of the aisle. I would be happy to work with the majority on that, but it has not been cleared, so I must object based on the limitations included in the request.

I tell the distinguished leader that on this side of the aisle, at least, we are willing to agree to a time certain to vote on all of them--right now. We will be glad to enter into a time agreement to vote on each and every one of them. Obviously, our concern is that they all be considered and we suggest that they be in the order in which they appear on the calendar.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while the distinguished majority leader is still on the floor, I note I, too, do not want to see the Senate go down a path where a minority of the Senate is determining a judge's fate on votes of 41. In fact, the distinguished majority leader is perhaps aware of the fact that during the Republican administrations I rarely ever voted against a nomination by either President Reagan or President Bush. There were a couple I did. 
   I also took the floor on occasion to oppose filibusters to hold them up and believe that we should have a vote up or down. Actually, I was one of those who made sure, on a couple controversial Republican judges, that we did. That meant 100 Senators voted on them, 100. 
   In this case, unfortunately, we have at least one judge who has been held for 3 years by one or two or three or four Senators, not 41 but less than a handful. All I am asking is that we give them the fairness of having the whole Senate vote on them. 
   Unfortunately, in the last couple years, women and minorities have been held up longer than anybody else on these Federal judgeships. They ought to be allowed a vote up or down. If Senators want to vote against them, then vote against them. If they want to vote for them, vote for them. But to have two or three people, quietly, in the back room, never be identified as being the ones holding them up, I think that is unfair to the judiciary, it is unfair to the nominees, and, frankly, it demeans the Senate. 
   Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have a number of highly-qualified nominees for judicial vacancies before the Senate and on the Executive Calendar. I want to be sure that the Senate treats them all fairly and accords each of them an opportunity for an up or down vote. I want to share with you a few of the cases that cry out for a Senate vote: 
   The first is Judge Richard Paez. He is a judicial nominee who has been awaiting consideration and confirmation by the Senate since January 1996--for over 3 and one-half years. The vacancy for which Judge Paez was nominated became a judicial emergency during the time his nomination has been pending without action by the Senate. His nomination was first received by the Senate almost 44 months ago and is still without a Senate vote. That is unconscionable. 
   Judge Paez has twice been reported favorably by the Senate Judiciary Committee to the Senate for final action. He is again on the Senate calendar. He was delayed 25 months before finally being accorded a confirmation hearing in February 1998. After being reported by the Judiciary Committee initially in March 1998, his nomination was held on the Senate Executive Calendar without action or explanation for over 7 months, for the remainder of the last Congress. 
   Judge Paez was renominated by the President again this year and his nomination was stalled without action before the Judiciary Committee until late July, when the Committee reported his nomination to the Senate for the second time. The Senate refused to consider the nomination before the August recess. I have repeatedly urged the Republican leadership to call this nomination up for consideration and a vote. The Republican leadership in the Senate has refused to schedule this nomination for an up or down vote. 
   Judge Paez has the strong support of both California Senators and a ``well-qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association. He has served as a municipal judge for 13 years and as a federal judge for four years. 
   In my view Judge Paez should be commended for the years he worked to provide legal services and access to our justice system for those without the financial resources otherwise to retain counsel. His work with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, the Western Center on Law and Poverty and California Rural Legal Assistance for nine years should be a source of praise and pride. 
   Judge Paez has had the strong support of California judges familiar with his work, such as Justice H. Walter Crosky, and support from an impressive array of law enforcement officials, including Gil Garcetti, the Los Angeles District Attorney; the late Sherman Block, then Los Angeles County Sheriff; the Los Angeles County Police Chiefs' Association; and the Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs. 
   The Hispanic National Bar Association, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, and many, many others have been seeking a vote on this nomination for what now amounts to years. 
   I want to commend the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his steadfast support of this nominee and Senator BOXER and Senator FEINSTEIN of California for their efforts on his behalf. 
   Last year the words of the Chief Justice of the United States were ringing in our ears with respect to the delays in Senate consideration of judicial nomination. He had written:  
   Some current nominees have been waiting considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. . . . The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.  
   Richard Paez's nomination to the Ninth Circuit had already been pending for 24 months when the Chief Justice issued that statement--and that was almost two years ago. The Chief Justice's words resound in connection with the nomination of Judge Paez. He has twice been reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee. It was been pending for almost 44 months. The court to which he was nominated has multiple vacancies. In fairness to Judge Paez and all the people served by the Ninth Circuit, the Senate should vote on this nomination. 
   Justice Ronnie White is another nominee who has been pending before the Senate without a vote for an exceedingly long time. In June I gave a Senate speech marking the 2-year anniversary of the nomination of this outstanding jurist to what is now a judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. He is currently a member of the Missouri Supreme Court. 
   He was nominated by President Clinton in June of 1997. It took 11 months before the Senate would even allow him to have a confirmation hearing. His nomination was then reported favorably on a 13 to 3 vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 21, 1998. Senators HATCH, THURMOND, GRASSLEY, SPECTER, KYL, and DEWINE were the Republican members of the Committee who voted for him along with the Democratic members. Senators ASHCROFT, ABRAHAM and SESSIONS voted against him. 
   Even though he had been voted out overwhelmingly, he sat on the calendar last year, and the nomination was returned to the President after 16 months with no action. 
   The President renominated him and on July 22 the Senate Judiciary Committee again reported the nomination favorably to the Senate, this time by a vote of two to one. 
   Justice White deserves better than benign neglect. The people of Missouri deserve a fully qualified and fully staffed Federal bench. 
   Justice White has one of the finest records--and the experience and standing--of any lawyer that has come before the Judiciary Committee. He has served in the Missouri legislature, the office of the city counselor for the City of St. Louis, and he was a judge in the Missouri Court of Appeals for the Eastern District of Missouri before his current service as the first African-American ever to serve on the Missouri Supreme Court. 
   Having been voted out of Committee twice, he has now been forced to wait  for more than two years for Senate action. This distinguished African-American at least deserves the respect of this Senate, and he should be allowed a vote, up or down. Senators can stand up and say they will vote for or against him, but let this man have his vote. Twenty-seven months after being nominated, the nomination remains pending before the Senate. I would certainly like to see Justice White be accorded an up or down vote. 
   I have been concerned for the last several years that it seems women and minority nominees are being delayed and not considered. I spoke to the Senate about this situation on May 22, June 22 and, again, on October 8 last year. Over the last couple of years the Senate has failed to act on the nominations of Judge James A. Beaty, Jr. to be the first African-American judge on the Fourth Circuit; Jorge C. Rangel to the Fifth Circuit; Clarence J. Sundram to the District Court for the Northern District of New York; Anabelle Rodriguez to the District Court in Puerto Rico; and many others. 
   In explaining why he chose to withdraw from consideration for renomination after waiting 15 months for Senate action, Jorge Rangel wrote to the President and explained:  
   Our judicial system depends on men and women of good will who agree to serve when asked to do so. But public service asks too much when those of us who answer the call to service are subjected to a confirmation process dominated by interminable delays and inaction. Patience has its virtues, but it also has its limits.  
   Last year the average for all nominees confirmed was over 230 days and 11 nominees confirmed last year took longer than 9 months: Judge William Fletcher's confirmation took 41 months--it became the longest-pending judicial nomination in the history of the United States; 
   Judge Hilda Tagle's confirmation took 32 months, Judge Susan Oki Mollway's confirmation took 30 months, Judge Ann Aiken's confirmation took 26 months, Judge Margaret McKeown's confirmation took 24 months, Judge Margaret Morrow's confirmation took 21 months, Judge Sonia Sotomayor's confirmation took 15 months, Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer's confirmation took 14 months, Judge Ivan Lemelle's confirmation took 14 months, Judge Dan Polster's confirmation took 12 months, and Judge Victoria Roberts' confirmation took 11 months. Of these 11, eight are women or minority nominees. Another was Professor Fletcher was held up, in large measure because of opposition to his mother, Judge Betty Fletcher. 
   In 1997, of the 36 nominations eventually confirmed, 9, fully one-quarter of all those confirmed, took more than 9 months before a final favorable Senate vote. 
   In 1996, the Republican Senate shattered the record for the average number of days from nomination to confirmation for judicial confirmation. The average rose to a record 183 days. In 1997, the average number of days from nomination to confirmation rose dramatically yet again, and that was during the first year of a presidential term. From initial nomination to confirmation, the average time it took for Senate action on the 36 judges confirmed in 1997 broke the 200-day barrier for the first time in our history. It was 212 days. 
   Unfortunately, that time is still growing and the average is still rising to the detriment of the administration of justice. Last year the Senate broke its dismal record. The average time from nomination to confirmation for the 65 judges confirmed in 1998 was over 230 days. 
   Acting to fill judicial vacancies is a constitutional duty that the Senate--and all of its members--are obligated to fulfill. In its unprecedented slowdown in the handling of nominees since the 104th Congress, the Senate is shirking its duty. That is wrong and should end. The Senate recesses with a sorry record of inaction on judicial nominations. 
   Another example of a longstanding nominee who is being denied a Senate vote is Marsha Berzon. Fully one-quarter of the active judgeships authorized for that Court remain vacant, as they have been for several years. The Judicial Conference recently requested that Ninth Circuit judgeships be increased in light of its workload by an additional five judges. That means that while Ms. Berzon's nomination has been pending, that Court has been forced to struggle through its extraordinary workload with 12 fewer judges than it needs. 
   Marsha Berzon is an outstanding nominee. By all accounts, she is an exceptional lawyer with extensive appellate experience, including a number of cases heard by the Supreme Court. She has the strong support of both California Senators and a well-qualified rating from the American Bar Association. 
   She was initially nominated in January 1998, almost 20 months ago. She participated in an extensive two-part confirmation hearing before the Committee back on July 30, 1998. Thereafter she received a number of sets of written questions from a number of Senators and responded in August of last year. A second round of written questions was sent and she responded by the middle of September of last year. Despite the efforts of Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator KENNEDY, Senator SPECTER and myself to have her considered by the Committee, she was not included on an agenda and not voted on during all of 1998. Her nomination was returned to the President without action by this Committee or the Senate last October. 
   This year the President renominated Ms. Berzon in January. She participated in her second confirmation hearing in June, was sent additional sets of written questions, responded and got and answered another round. I do not know why those questions were not asked last year. 
   Finally, on July 1 more than two months ago and before Mr. Stewart was even nominated, the Committee considered the nomination and agreed to report it to the Senate favorably. After more than a year and one-half the Senate should, at long last, vote on the nomination. Senators who find some reason to oppose this exceptionally qualified woman lawyer can vote against her if they choose, but she should be accorded an up or down vote. That is what I have been asking for and that is what fairness demands. 
   Unfortunately, the list goes on and on. In addition, there is the nomination of Timothy Dyk to the Federal Circuit. Tim Dyk was initially nominated in April 1998, and participated in a confirmation hearing last July. He was favorably reported to the Senate by a vote of 14 to 4 last September. His was one of the several judicial nominations not acted upon by the Senate last year before it adjourned. Instead, the Senate returned this nomination to the President without action. 
   The President proceeded to renominate Mr. Dyk in January 1999. Since then, his nomination, which had been favorably reported last year, has been in limbo. I raised his nomination at our first Committee meeting of the year in February and a number of times thereafter. Still, he is being held hostage in the Committee without action. 
   There are the nominations of Barry Goode to the Ninth Circuit, who was first nominated in June 1998 and is still patiently awaiting a confirmation hearing; of Julio Fuentes to the Third Circuit, has been pending three times longer than the Stewart nomination and is still awaiting his confirmation hearing; of Ray Fisher to the Ninth Circuit, who is an outstanding lawyer and public servant now Associate Attorney General of the United States Department of Justice and was reported by the Committee on a vote of 16 to 2 but remains held on the Senate Calendar. There are the nominations of Alston Johnson to the Fifth Circuit, James Duffy to the Ninth Circuit, and Elena Kagan to the D.C. Circuit, among others who were nominated before Mr. Stewart. There are the district court nominations of Legrome Davis and Lynette Norton in Pennsylvania, Virginia Phillips, James Lorenz, Dolly Gee and Frederic Woocher in California, Rich Leonard in North Carolina, Frank McCarthy in Oklahoma, Patricia Coan in Colorado, and William Joseph Haynes, Jr. in Tennessee, to name a few. 
   All together, there are more than 30 pending judicial nominations that were received by the Senate before it received the Stewart nomination and they need our attention, too. That is the point I am trying to make. I understand that nominations are not considered in lockstep order based on the date of receipt. I understand and respect the prerogatives of the majority  party and the Majority Leader. I appreciate the interest of the Chairman of the Committee in filling vacancies in his State and want to work with him. I ask only that the Senate be fair to these other nominees, as well. In my view, Ted Stewart is entitled to a vote on his nomination and should get it, but these other nominees should be accorded fair treatment, as well. Nominees like Judge Richard Paez, Justice Ronnie White, and Marsha Berzon should be voted on up or down by the Senate. We are asking and have been asking the Republican leadership to schedule votes on those nominations so that action on all the nominations can move forward. 
   Mr. EDWARDS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. LEAHY. If the distinguished majority leader will yield, the distinguished senior Senator from Utah and I have been in discussion within the last 2 or 3 minutes. We are trying to move this along and work it out. I understand the concerns the majority leader has. 
   As he knows, both the two times I have served here with the Democrats in the majority and the two times I have served with Republicans in the majority, I have always respected the majority leader's prerogatives in bringing things up. 
   My concern is not that this be a lockstep matter, but I say to my friend from Mississippi--and this is one of the things that concerns many people on this side of the aisle--there were 30 pending judicial nominations that were received by the Senate prior to the Stewart nomination coming, and they deserve our attention, too. 
   Obviously, I understand the special circumstances of the Stewart nomination. If we work out some of these other things, I expect to be voting for him. But there were 30 ahead of it, not all of which are on the calendar, but were received ahead of it and 6 in front of him on the Senate Executive Calendar. We have concern that they are  going to get consideration, that each of them will be accorded a Senate vote. People should be fair to them all. Some of them have been there for 2 or 3 years, some for a matter of months. What I am trying to do with the distinguished Senator from Utah is work out some kind of understanding where we have Senate votes on the nominations on the Executive Calendar, will have the hearings that are needed to move others along. I was hoping we could work out some kind of a package that the distinguished Republican leader and the distinguished Democratic leader could agree to today, but I don't think we can.

   Mr. LEAHY. With all due respect, the last few years the Senate has moved slower on judicial nominations than any time I think I can remember in my time here. I have attended more judiciary hearings, voted on more judicial nominations, than virtually anybody in this body, with the exception of the distinguished President pro tem, who tells me he may have been doing them in Thomas Jefferson's time. But for the rest of us, I have. I have never seen it go quite so slowly. In 1996, 1997 and again this year the Senate has been moving slowly with respect to a number of judicial nominees. 
   We are trying to work that out. Obviously, it is not going to get solved today. I do not want to get having to invoke cloture on judicial nominations. I think it is a bad precedent. That may be necessary.

   Mr. LEAHY. When you get there, you will be able to tell St. Peter that one of the trials you had on Earth was the senior Senator from Vermont, who is your friend, as you know. We have been friends for many years. 
   On the number of Federal judges, though, I do get letters from lawyers all over the country, and I believe even from the State of Mississippi, from their trial bar, in several cases where, having paid all kinds of taxes, they now have to hire arbitrators to hear the cases because the dockets are too full. I am hearing from Federal prosecutors all over this country this is a matter of some concern, that because of the speedy trial rules under the Constitution and practice, they are concerned about their cases. There aren't enough judges to try them. So there are some areas where we do have some serious problems. We know that the Chief Justice of the United States has criticized the lack of enough judges to do the work of the courts and the time it takes to get vacancies filled. 
   We have two judges we could voice vote right now--there would be no objection--James Lorenz and Victor Marrero, Calendar Nos. 213 and 214.

   Mr. LEAHY. The Republicans will probably be having a caucus, as we will be, in the normal course of business. Might I suggest to the leader that might be the thing to do. We would have an objection today, he can file the cloture today if he chooses, and still Senator HATCH and I will continue our discussions. He and the distinguished Democratic leader would continue theirs. I think there have been a number of times when the 4 of us, in 5 minutes off the floor, have accomplished more than we could in 5 hours on the floor. Then we can see where we are at that time. We may be in a situation where having prayed about it over the weekend and thought about it--and you have had the great feeling of being in Cleveland, and I didn't know there was a Cleveland, Mississippi.

   Mr. LEAHY. I have been in Mississippi a number of times. I have gone down with your distinguished colleague, Senator COCHRAN, in different hearings. I have always enjoyed it. I have always eaten too much, and I have always felt I understood what Southern hospitality means. I tried to reciprocate with his colleague on a visit to Vermont, and it dropped to 30 below zero. He didn't think it was very good reciprocation, so he came back in the summertime.

   Mr. LEAHY. Touching on another subject--and obviously the two leaders can determine what they want as far as the cloture point is concerned--on the timing on Mr. Stewart's nomination, in my experience and my judgment, I say to my friend from Mississippi that: If we had worked out an arrangement to vote on these judicial nominees on the calendar, the sort of thing we are talking about doing now, working out the amount of time to be taken on Stewart would be the least of our worries; it would be a relatively short time because it would be all part of the same package. 
   We could spend more time talking about how much time there will be on the floor than probably what there would be at that time. That is going to be the least of our problems. If we get some of these judges worked out and some idea of when other judges are coming up, that is going to be the easy thing to do.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it was 4 years ago that Nagwang Choephel, a Tibetan who studied ethnomusicology at Middlebury College in Vermont on a Fulbright Scholarship, was arrested in Tibet in 1995. 
   After imprisoning him incommunicado for 15 months, on December 26, 1996, Chinese officials sentenced Mr. Choephel to 18 years in prison on charges of espionage. 
   Four years have passed and despite high level discussions about this case between the administration and Chinese officials, resolutions passed in both the Senate and the House on Mr. Choephel's behalf, and a number of worldwide letter writing campaigns, he remains incarcerated in a remote corner of Tibet for a crime he did not commit. 
   The Chinese Government has never provided evidence to support their allegations that Mr. Choephel was sent by the Dalai Lama to gather intelligence and engage in separatist activities. 
   The State Department has no evidence that he participated in any illegal or political activity. 
   What is indisputable, however, is that Mr. Choephel traveled to Tibet with a donated video camera and recording equipment to document Tibetan music and dance--subjects he studied as a young man in India and as a Fulbright Scholar in Vermont. 
   The sixteen hours of footage that Mr. Choephel sent out of Tibet before his arrest affirm this fact. It simply shows the traditional dancing and singing that is an integral part of Tibet's rich cultural heritage. 
   I have spoken out many times about this tragic miscarriage of justice. 
   I have twice discussed my concerns with Chinese President Jiang, once in Beijing and again in Washington. I and other Members of Congress have written letter after letter to the Chinese Ambassador in Washington and other Chinese officials seeking information about Mr. Choephel's whereabouts and his well-being. I have tried to arrange meetings with Chinese authorities here, to no avail. 
   As we commemorate this sad anniversary, we know no more about Mr. Choephel's condition than we did 4 years ago. 
   His mother, who has repeatedly sought permission from the Chinese Government to visit her only child, has not given up. She continues her tireless campaign for his freedom on the streets of New Delhi. 
   I had hoped that Chinese authorities would have recognized by now the grave mistake they made in sentencing Mr. Choephel. International outrage over this case mounts with each additional year he spends in jail. 
   Congress, the administration, and the international community must continue to do whatever it can to ensure that next year at this time we are celebrating this young man's release, and the release of the many other political prisoners who are being unfairly detained in Tibet and China.

   Mr. LEAHY. I did not agree with the President's recent clemency decision, but I recognize that it is his decision to make. When I was State's Attorney for Chittenden County, I did not always agree when the Governor of Vermont exercised his clemency power, but I understood that it was his to exercise as he saw fit. There were many more numerous exercises of this constitutional power by the Republican and Democratic Presidents with whom I have served over the last 25 years--President Carter used this power over 560 times, President Reagan over 400 times and President Bush over 75 times-- and they have not always been matters with which I necessarily agreed. 
   Yesterday I cautioned against the extreme rhetoric of the version of the Lott-Coverdell resolution that was initially introduced. Through the course of the last week some of the misstatements of fact that were contained in that version of the resolution have been corrected and its most extreme and dangerous political rhetoric has been eliminated. 
   The resolution that the Senate will adopt today deletes much of the overreaching language of the President's congressional critics. I noted yesterday that to contend that the clemency grants showed a weakness of resolve against international terrorism was both wrong and might itself contribute to creating a dangerous atmosphere. 
   We ought to be careful when anyone, let alone the Senate and Congress of the United States, starts bandying about declarations that accuse the United States Government of making ``deplorable concessions to terrorists,'' ``undermining national security'' or ``emboldening domestic and international terrorists.'' Playing politics with this matter and accusing the President of ``undermining our national security'' or ``emboldening terrorists'' carries significant risks and was not right. I am glad that language has been eliminated from the text of the resolution. 
   Likewise, some of the factual inaccuracies in the initial draft were eliminated, including the assertion that the procedure used in these petitions was ``irregular'', and the inaccurate assertion that the Bureau of Prisons had audio recordings indicating that some of the 16 persons offered conditional clemency by the President had ``vowed to resume their violent activities upon release.'' There was no basis for that assertion, which was inaccurate and unfounded but nonetheless included in the original resolution. It has now been deleted. 
   Similarly, the substitute resolution eliminates the contention that the President's decision was ``making terrorism more likely and endangering'' Americans. 
   Most importantly for the resolution-- and this is after all only a congressional resolution that cannot change the clemency decisions by the President-- the original resolution proposed declaring that the President had ``made deplorable concessions to terrorists, undermined national security and emboldened domestic and international terrorists.'' All of that language has been deleted from the resolution. It was extreme and risky political rhetoric and should never have been included. 
   The American people can judge whether the time and energy being devoted by the Congress to this declaration is the best use of the these resources. Yesterday I challenged the  Senate to make time for votes on the many qualified nominees whom the Republican majority has stalled for the last several years. If the Senate has time to debate and vote on this resolution, it should have time to vote on the nomination of Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has been pending for over 3 1/2 years. If the Senate has time to debate and vote on this resolution, it should have time to vote on the nominations of Justice Ronnie White to be a federal judge in Missouri, Marsha Berzon to be a judge on the Ninth Circuit, Bill Lann Lee to head the Civil Rights Division and to act on the scores of other nominees pending before it. 
   The Senate has not completed work on 11 of the 13 appropriations bills that must be passed before October 1. The Republican Congress cannot find time for campaign finance reform or a real patients' bill of rights or raising the minimum wage or reforming Medicare or completing the juvenile crime bill conference. The American people will judge whether the Senate should be doing its job and attending to its constitutional duties of confirmations and legislation or whether its time should continue to be devoted to partisan politics and attacks on the Executive Branch.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Hispanic whose actions and fate I would like the Senate to focus on for action is Richard Paez. Richard Paez has never been convicted of a crime and is not associated with the FALN. He is not a petitioner seeking presidential clemency. Rather, he is a judicial nominee who has been awaiting consideration and confirmation by the Senate since January 1996--for over 3 1/2 years. 
   The vacancy for which Judge Paez was nominated became a judicial emergency during the time his nomination has been pending without action by the Senate. His nomination was first received by the Senate almost 44 months ago. 
   This nomination has now been held even longer than the unconscionable 41 months this Senate forced Judge William Fletcher to wait before confirming his nomination last October. 
   Judge Paez has twice been reported favorably by the Senate Judiciary Committee to the Senate for final action. He is again on the Senate calendar. He was initially delayed 25 months before finally being accorded a confirmation hearing in February 1998. After being reported by the Judiciary Committee in March 1998, his nomination was held on the Senate Executive Calendar without action for over 7 months, for the remainder of the last Congress. 
   Judge Paez was renominated by the President again this year and his nomination was stalled without action before the Judiciary Committee until late July, when we were able to have his nomination reported again. The Senate refused to consider the nomination before the August recess. I have repeatedly urged the Republican leadership to call this nomination up for consideration and a vote. If they make time on the Senate floor for debate and consideration of a Senate resolution commenting on the clemency grant, which is a power the constitution invested in the President without a congressional role, the Senate should find time to consider the nomination of this fine Hispanic judge. 
   Judge Paez has the strong support of both California Senators and a ``well-qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association. He has served as a municipal judge for 13 years and as a Federal judge for 4 years. 
   In my view Judge Paez should be commended for the years he worked to provide legal services and access to our justice system for those without the financial resources otherwise to retain counsel. His work with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, the Western Center on Law and Poverty and California Rural Legal Assistance for nine years should be a source of praise and pride. 
   Judge Paez has had the strong support of California judges familiar with his work, such as Justice H. Walter Crosky, and support from an impressive array of law enforcement officials, including Gil Garcetti, the Los Angeles District Attorney; the late Sherman Block, then Los Angeles County Sheriff; the Los Angeles County Police Chiefs' Association; and the Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs. 
   The Hispanic National Bar Association, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, and many, many others have been seeking a vote on this nomination for what now amounts to years. 
   I want to commend the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his steadfast support of this nominee and Senator BOXER and Senator FEINSTEIN of California for their efforts on his behalf. 
   Last year the words of the Chief Justice of the United States were ringing in our ears with respect to the delays in Senate consideration of judicial nomination. He had written: ``Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. . . . The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.'' Those words resonate with respect to the nomination of Judge Paez. 
   I trust the American people recognize who is playing politics with the issue of clemency. I disagreed with the President's decision, but it was his to make. He says that he granted clemency with conditions after study and based on a sense of proportion and justice. The calls for clemency in these cases came from Bishop Tutu, Coretta Scott King, other Nobel peace prize winters, a number of churches and religious groups. It has drawn praise in some circles and criticism in others. 
   I do not agree with the President, but I caution that the overreaching by Republican critics in the Congress on this is worrisome, as well. To contend that this shows a weakness of resolve against international terrorism is both wrong and may itself be creating a dangerous atmosphere. 
   We ought to be careful when anyone, let alone the Senate and Congress of the United States, start bandying about declarations that accuse the United States Government of making ``deplorable concessions to terrorists,'' ``undermining national security'' or  ``emboldening domestic and international terrorists.'' 
   Playing politics with this matter and accusing the President of ``undermining our national security'' or ``emboldening terrorists'' carries significant risks. Could a potential terrorist somewhere in the world believe this political rhetoric and be ```emboldened'' by it? This is risky business. I do not believe the short-term political gain to the other party is worth having the Senate endorse a resolution that might itself have precisely that effect. 
   The Senate cannot find time to vote on the nomination of Judge Richard Paez or that of Bill Lann Lee to head the Civil Rights Division or that of Justice Ronnie White to be a Federal judge in Missouri or any of the scores of other nominees pending before it. The Senate has not completed work on 11 of the 13 appropriations bills that must be passed before October 1. The Republican Congress cannot find time to consider campaign finance reform or pass a real patients' bill of rights or consider raising the minimum wage or reforming Medicare or complete the juvenile crime bill conference, but there is plenty of time for floor debate and on the President's decision to exercise his clemency power. The Senate has had three hearings on judicial nominations all year and the Republican Congress will have that many hearings on the clemency decision this week. 
   In closing, I ask: If the Senate has the time to debate and vote on this resolution, why does it not have time to vote on the nomination of Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit?

The Senate has not completed work on 11 of the 13 appropriations bills that must be passed before October 1. The Republican Congress cannot find time to consider campaign finance reform or pass a real patients' bill of rights or consider raising the minimum wage or reforming Medicare or complete the juvenile crime bill conference, but there is plenty of time for floor debate and on the President's decision to exercise his clemency power. The Senate has had three hearings on judicial nominations all year and the Republican Congress will have that many hearings on the clemency decision this week. 
   In closing, I ask: If the Senate has the time to debate and vote on this resolution, why does it not have time to vote on the nomination of Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit?

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the confirmation of Maryanne Trump Barry to the Third Circuit--and I predict that she will be confirmed--will bring to 15 the total number of federal judges considered by the Senate all year. 
   While I am appreciative of this opportunity to consider this nomination, I note that the Republican leadership has chosen to skip over the nominations of Marsha Berzon, Judge Richard Paez, and Ray Fisher to the Ninth Circuit. These nominations have all been on the Senate calender for as long or longer than that of Ms. Barry. The Republican leadership has, again, skipped over the nomination of Justice Ronnie White for the federal court in Missouri, as well. 
   All of these nominations could and should have been considered before the August recess. Indeed the nominations of Judge Paez and Justice White, should have been considered when they were first reported last year.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Department of Justice is releasing a report on the success of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System in keeping guns out of the hands of criminals. In its first seven months of operation, national background checks have stopped 100,000 felons, fugitives and other prohibited persons from getting guns from licensed firearms dealers. 
   Unfortunately, it doesn't extend to all of the people who sell guns. 
   There is a major gun show loophole. Congress has been unwilling to close that because of the opposition of the gun lobby, even though, incidentally, we passed a measure that did close that loophole several months ago in the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill. Even though we closed it, we have yet to move forward on the juvenile justice conference report. It had been hoped and I think the American people hoped that we would complete the juvenile justice bill prior to school opening. 
   I am hoping that we can complete it prior to Christmas vacation for schools, at the rate we have been going. 
   I talked to a lot of gun dealers at home who say they have to obey the law, they have to fill out the forms, they have to report whether somebody tries to buy a gun illegally, and they ask why they have to compete with those who can take their station wagon to a weekend flea market and sell guns out of the back of it. 
   This report is more concrete evidence that Congress should extend background checks to the sales of all firearms. 
   I want to commend the nation's mayors and police chiefs for coming to Washington today to demand action on the juvenile justice conference. 
   I hope the leadership in the Senate and the House will listen to what they said. I hope the majority will hear the call of our country's local officials and law enforcement officers to act now to pass a strong and effective juvenile justice conference report. 
   I am one of the conferees on the juvenile justice bill. I am ready to work with Republicans and Democrats to pass a strong and effective juvenile justice conference report. I suspect most Americans, Republicans or Democrats, would like to see that. So far we have only had one meeting to resolve our differences. Even though we passed the Hatch-Leahy bill months ago, we have had only one conference meeting. In fact, that one meeting was 24 hours before we recessed for the August recess, almost guaranteeing there would be no more meetings. 
   We haven't concluded our work. The fact is school started without Congress finishing its work, and I think that is wrong. We have overcome technical obstacles, we have overcome threatened filibusters, but now we find that everybody talks about how we should improve the juvenile justice system and everybody decries the easy availability of guns, but nobody wants to do anything about it. 
   We spent 2 weeks, as I said, on the floor in May. We considered almost 50 amendments to the Senate juvenile justice bill. We made many improvements on the bill. We passed it by a huge bipartisan majority. Now I am beginning to wonder whether we were able to pass it because there was a private agreement that the bill would go nowhere. 
   We need to do more to keep guns out of the hands of children who do not know how to use them or plan to use them to hurt others. Law enforcement officers in this country need our help. 
   I am concerned that we are going to lose the opportunity for a well-balanced juvenile justice bill--one that has strong support from the police, from the juvenile justice authorities, from those in the prevention community at all levels. We are going to lose this opportunity because one lobby is afraid there might be something in there they disagree with. 
   I come from a State that has virtually no gun laws. I also come from a State that because of its nature that has extremely little crime. But I am asked by Vermonters every day when I am home, they say: Why has this bill been delayed? Aren't you willing to stand up to a powerful lobby? My answer so far has been, no; the Congress has not. 
   Due to the delays in convening this conference and then its abrupt adjournment before completing its work, we knew before our August recess that the programs to enhance school safety and protect our children and families called for in this legislation would not be in place before school began. 
   The fact that American children are starting school without Congress finishing its work on this legislation is wrong. 
   We had to overcome technical obstacles and threatened filibusters to begin the juvenile justice conference. It is no secret that there are those in both bodies who would prefer no action and no conference to moving forward on the issues of juvenile violence and crime. Now that we have convened this conference, we should waste no more time to get down to business and finish our work promptly. 
   Those of us serving on the conference and many who are not on the conference have worked on versions of this legislation for several years now. We spent two weeks on the Senate floor in May considering almost 50 amendments to S. 254, the Senate juvenile justice bill, and making many improvements to the underlying bill. We worked hard in the Senate for a strong bipartisan juvenile justice bill, and we should take this opportunity to cut through our remaining partisan differences to make a difference in the lives of our children and families. 
   I appreciate that one of the most contentious issues in this conference is guns, even though sensible gun control proposals are just a small part of the comprehensive legislation we are considering. The question that the majority in Congress must answer is what are they willing to do to protect children from gun violence? 
   A report released two months ago on juvenile violence by the Justice Department concludes that, ``data ..... indicate that guns play a major role in juvenile violence.'' We need to do more to keep guns out of the hands of children who do not know how to use them or plan to use them to hurt others. 
   Law enforcement officers in this country need help in keeping guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. I am not talking about people who use guns for hunting or for sport, but about criminals and unsupervised children. 
   An editorial that appeared yesterday in the Rutland Daily Herald summed up the dilemma in this juvenile justice conference for the majority: 
   ``Republicans in Congress have tried to follow the line of the National Rifle Association. It will be interesting to see if they can hold that line when the Nation's crime fighters let them know that fighting crime also means fighting guns.'' 
   Every parent, teacher and student in this country was concerned this summer about school violence over the last two years and worried about when the next shooting may occur. 
   They only hope it does not happen at their school or involve their children. This is an unacceptable and intolerable situation. 
   We all recognize that there is no single cause and no single legislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our schools or in our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to do our part. We should seize this opportunity to act on balanced, effective juvenile justice legislation, and measures to keep guns out of the hands of children and away from criminals. 
   I hope we get to work soon and finish what we started in the juvenile justice conference. We are already tardy.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Republican leadership for allowing the Senate to consider and confirm two more outstanding judicial nominations today. Marsha Pechman and Adalberto Jose Jordan had confirmation hearings on July 13. They were favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee long before the August recess. 
   I regret that they were not confirmed at that time along with the other 11 judicial nominees on the Senate calendar who are still awaiting Senate action. With these confirmations today--and I predict they will be confirmed--the Senate will finally have confirmed more than a dozen judges this year. By comparison, last year at this time the Senate had confirmed 39 judges, not just 13; by this time in 1994, the Senate had confirmed 58 judges, not just 13. 
   In the past I have challenged the Senate to try to keep up with Sammy Sosa's home run pace. He has 58 home runs so far this year. We are behind not just his home run pace but the home run pace set by National League pitchers. 
   The Senate has ready for action the nominations of Marsha Berzon to the Ninth Circuit, Justice Ronnie White to the District Court in Missouri, and many other qualified nominees. 
   The current nomination delayed the longest is that of Judge Richard Paez. He has been held up for over 3 1/2 years, yet can anybody on this floor state with confidence that if he were allowed to have a rollcall vote, he would not be confirmed. The Judiciary Committee twice reported the nomination favorably. If we were honest and decent enough in the Senate to allow this man to come to a vote after 3 1/2 years, he would be confirmed. It is a scandal, a shame on the Senate that we do not confirm this nominee. 
   His treatment recalls the criticism the Chief Justice of the United States, William Rehnquist, has made of the Senate. He pointed out that after a period for review nominations should be voted up or voted down. He pointed out that too many nominations were being held up too long. The nomination of Judge Richard Paez is currently Exhibit A. 
   We are not doing our job. We are not being responsible. We are being dishonest, condescending, and arrogant toward the judiciary. It deserves better and the American people deserve better. 
   We have less than 8 weeks in which the Senate is scheduled to be in session the remainder of the year. We have our work cut out for us if we are to consider the 49 judicial nominations pending at the start of this week and others who are being nominated over the next few weeks. 
   In spite of our efforts last year in the aftermath of strong criticism from the Chief Justice of the United States, the vacancies facing the Federal judiciary are, again, approximately 70 and the vacancies gap is not being closed. We have more Federal judicial vacancies extending longer and affecting more people. Judicial vacancies now stands at over 8 percent of the Federal judiciary. If one considers the additional judges recommended by the Judicial Conference, the vacancies rate would be over 15 percent. 
   Nominees deserve to be treated with dignity and dispatch--not delayed for two and three years. We are seeing outstanding nominees nitpicked and delayed to the point that good women and men are being deterred from seeking to serve as federal judges. Nominees practicing law see their work put on hold while they await the outcome of their nominations. Their families cannot plan. 
   The President spoke about the vacancies crisis again last month. Certainly no President has consulted more closely with Senators of the other party on judicial nominations. The Senate should get about the business of voting on the confirmation of the scores of judicial nominations that have been delayed without justification for too long. We must redouble our efforts to work with the President to end the longstanding vacancies that plague the federal courts and disadvantage all Americans. That is our constitutional responsibility.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, so far, we have had one meeting of a conference to resolve differences in the Senate and House passed juvenile justice bills. I commented at that conference meeting, on August 5, 1999, about how unfortunate it was that the leadership in the Congress delayed action on the conference all summer. In fact, the conference met less than 24 hours before the Congress adjourned for its long August recess. 
   Unfortunately, we did not conclude our work but left this conference and important work on the juvenile justice legislation to languish for the last five weeks of the summer. 
   Due to the delays in convening this conference and then its abrupt adjournment before completing its work, we knew before our August recess that the programs to enhance school safety and protect our children and families called for in this legislation would not be in place before school began. 
   The fact that American children are starting school without Congress finishing its work on this legislation is wrong. 
   We had to overcome technical obstacles and threatened filibusters to begin the juvenile justice conference. It is no secret that there are those in both bodies who would prefer no action and no conference to moving forward on the issues of juvenile violence and crime. Now that we have convened this conference, we should waste no more time to get down to business and finish our work promptly. 
   We have seen the kind of swift conference action the Congress is capable of doing with the Y2K law that provides special legal protections to businesses. That Y2K bill was passed by the Senate almost a month after the HATCH-LEAHY juvenile justice bill, on June 16th, but was sent to conference, worked out, and sent to the President's desk within two short weeks. That bill is already law. The example set by the Y2K legislation shows that if we have the will, there is a way to get legislation done and done quickly. 
   Those of us serving on the conference and many who are not on the conference have worked on versions of this legislation for several years now. We spent two weeks on the Senate floor in May considering almost 50 amendments to S. 254, the Senate juvenile justice bill, and making many improvements to the underlying bill. We worked hard in the Senate for a strong bipartisan juvenile justice bill, and we should take this opportunity to cut through our remaining partisan differences to make a difference in the lives of our children and families.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Congress went on a tax cut binge in the 1980s and left the bill for our children. Now that we have surpluses, we have a chance and an obligation to pay off that debt. The last thing Congress should be doing right now is to put our strong economy at risk by passing a tax scheme as risky as the Republican plan. 
   Some of my fellow colleagues in Congress have gone off again on a binge of irresponsible tax cutting that puts our strong economy in jeopardy. Projections of budget surpluses in the future have gone straight to their heads--as if projected budget surpluses were like hard cider. It is time for my colleagues in the House and Senate to splash some cold budget reality on their faces and return to their economic senses. 
   A sound economy rests on a solid foundation of balanced revenue and spending policies. For the past seven years, the President and Congress have build this solid foundation by reducing the deficit and restraining spending. Just as we Vermonters restrained spending and put Vermont's state budget in the black, Yankee thrift was alive and well in Washington, as it is in Vermont. 
   President Clinton inherited a deficit of $290 billion in 1992 and his administration and Congress have steadily cut it down. For the first time since 1969, we now have a balanced budget. 
   I am proud to have voted for the 1993 deficit reduction package, which was a tough vote around here, and has brought the deficit down. I am also proud to have voted for the 1997 balanced budget and tax cut package--tax cuts that were fully paid for by offsetting spending cuts. These balanced policies have kept interest rates down and employment up. In fact, over the past seven years, this deficit reduction has produced $189 billion in interest savings on the national debt, or roughly $2,700 in savings for every American family. 
   Republicans and Democrats can rightfully claim their shares of the credit for getting the nation's fiscal house in order. The important thing is to keep our budget in balance well into the 21st century and keep our economy growing. 
   That dose of Yankee fiscal discipline has paid off for Vermonters. Since 1993: Vermont's unemployment rate has been cut in half, from 5.8% to 2.9%; 20,000 new jobs have been created; Vermonter's average income has increased 25 percent; crime in Vermont has dropped by 15 percent; and the stock market has soared by 300 percent. 
   Instead of keeping on this path of prosperity, the huge tax cut bill that Congress just passed veers from our successful fiscal discipline. It cuts taxes by $792 billion and pays for these sweeping cuts out of projected budget surpluses over the next 10 years. These surpluses are not real. They are just projections. What happens if we suffer a recession in three years or a depression seven years from now? These tax cuts are paid for by Monopoly money. 
   But fooling with our strong economy is not a game. Passing risky tax cuts based on wishful thinking will have real consequences for Vermonters. It is estimated that paying for these huge tax cuts would: force more than 13,000 Vermont veterans to lose health care benefits; prevent any Medicare reform and new prescription drug coverage for senior Vermonters; drop 3,699 Vermonters from the WIC program; close off 2,116 Vermont students from Pell grants to help make college more affordable; and serve 11,127 fewer school lunches to Vermont children. 
   Instead of this fiscal folly, I believe Congress should follow three basic principles to continue our strong economy and provide targeted tax relief.  First, we must continue to keep our fiscal house in order and pay down the national debt. The national public debt stands at $3.6 trillion--that is a lot of zeros. Like someone who had finally paid off his or her credit card balance but still has a home mortgage, the federal government has finally balanced its annual budget, but we still have a national debt to pay down. Indeed, the Federal government pays almost $1 billion in interest every working day on this national debt. 
   It makes a lot more sense to pay off the national debt as our first priority, because nothing would do more to keep the economy strong. Paying down our national debt will keep interest rates low. Consumers gain ground with lower mortgage costs, car payments, credit card charges with low interest rates. And small business owners can invest, expand and create jobs with low interest rates. 
   Alan Greenspan, head of the Federal Reserve, recently testified before Congress that: ``I would prefer that we keep the surplus in place and reduce the public debt.'' I agree with Mr. Greenspan and I believe most Vermonters do too. 
   Second, we should put aside some of the surplus in a rainy day fund for Medicare and Social Security reforms. Just as we set aside extra revenue in a rainy day fund in Vermont, Congress should do the same on a national level. We all know that Congress must reform Social Security and Medicare for the future costs of the baby boom generation. This rainy day fund should also permit Medicare to cover prescription drug coverage for our seniors. 
   One of the toughest and most important challenges that we face--right now--is to make sure that Social Security and Medicare will continue to be there for those who retire decades from now. The number of Social Security beneficiaries will rise by 37 percent from now until 2015, and Medicare runs into problems even earlier than that. Protecting Social Security and Medicare will not be easy, but these projected surpluses make it easier to keep both programs strong for future generations. 
   Third, tax cuts should be fair and targeted to help all Vermonters, not just the wealthy. According to a Treasury Department analysis, the Senate-passed tax plan provides 67 percent of its tax breaks to the wealthiest 20 percent of Americans--those making more than $81,000 a year--while the poorest 60 percent of families would reap only 12 percent of the Senate-passed tax cuts. That is not fair. 
   This conference report is even more tilted in favor of the wealthy. According to an analysis by the Citizens for Tax Justice, the top 10 percent of taxpayers would receive 69 percent of the benefits under this bill while the bottom 60 percent would receive only 7.5 percent of the benefits from the conference agreement. That means the average tax cut would be $138 for the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers while the top one percent of taxpayers would receive a tax break of $46,389. Again, that is not fair. 
   Tax cuts that are targeted-- such as eliminating the marriage tax penalty, permitting the self-employed a full tax deduction for their health insurance and estate tax relief for family farmers and small business owners--also don't break the bank. I supported a more responsible alternative package of $290 billion in targeted tax cuts that would still leave room in the budget for Congress to make key investments in veterans, education and crime-fighting programs. I believe this targeted approach is far more prudent than the Republican tax cut plan. 
   The enormous budget surplus that the Senate leadership claims is available to pay for nearly $800 billion in tax cuts is achieved only by unrealistic economic assumptions and deep cuts in programs that will never be attained. That is why I cosponsored an amendment filed by Senator ROCKEFELLER that assumes there will only be a $100 billion surplus over the next ten years. This projected surplus is consistent with estimates by the Concord Coalition, Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, former CBO director Robert Reischauer and the Citizens for Tax Justice. The Rockefeller-Reed-Leahy amendment is a prudent and fiscally responsible approach that balances tax relief with reducing our debt and maintaining obligations to existing programs such as NIH research, veterans health, Head Start and the environment. 
   I call upon President Clinton to follow through on his pledge to veto this irresponsible tax scheme. He should send Congress back to the drawing board to do it right. And the next time, Congress should apply a stout measure of Yankee thrift.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I stand here today, we are hours away from beginning a month long recess and we have yet to reauthorize a critically important piece of legislation that protects our nation's youth. It has been over two months since both the House and Senate have passed S. 249, The Missing, Exploited and Runaway Children Protection Act, and we have still not voted on final passage. 
   There is no good excuse for why the Senate has not passed and sent to the President this noncontroversial piece of legislation. I had some minor concerns with the House amended version of S. 249, but after receiving some clarification and assurances on these concerns, I decided that these House add-on could be dealt with at later time and should not keep this important piece of legislation from passing. I have cleared the differences on our side of the aisle, but I am afraid I cannot say the same for my colleagues on the other side who continue to hold up final passage of this bill. 
   The Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children Protection Act of 1999 reauthorizes programs under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and authorizes funding for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Both programs are critical to out nation's youth and to our nation's well-being. 
   In addition to providing shelter for children in need, the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act ensures that these children and their families have access to important services, such as individual, family or group counseling, alcohol and drug counseling and a myriad of other resources to help these young people and their families get back on track. As the National Network for Youth as stressed, the Act's programs ``provide critical assistance to youth in high-risk situations all over the country.'' 
   The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children provide extremely worthwhile and effective assistance to children and families facing crises across the U.S. and around the world. In 1998, the National Center helped law enforcement officers locate over 5,000 missing children. The National Center serves a critical role as a clearinghouse of resources and information for both family members and law enforcement officers. They have developed a network of hotels and restaurants which provides free services to parents in search of their children and have also developed extensive training programs.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, more than 3 years ago, I started raising serious concerns about the need to increase competition between cable and satellite TV providers and the need to allow satellite dish owners to receive local network stations. I felt then, and I feel now, that the best way to reduce the cable and satellite rate increases and to protect satellite dish owners is to have satellite television compete on a level playing field with cable. 
   I was thus very pleased when, finally, on May 20, the Senate passed a bill that I sponsored, without objection, which protects satellite dish owners and would offer them more television stations. I worked on this bill with the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, and several other Senators. 
   The bill would restore satellite TV service to those who lost it, and it would prevent thousands of additional cutoffs. 
   Also, over time, it would permit satellite carriers to offer many more stations to home satellite dish owners. Unfortunately, even though the Senate passed the bill on May 20, we have been unable to set up a Conference with the other chamber. On June 8, the Senate approved the list of Senators--the Conferees--to negotiate the final bill with the House of Representatives. 
   The August recess is about to start. Thousands of Vermonters, and I am one of them, will continue to get minimal TV service because this bill was not able to be presented to the President for signature. I want to assure Vermonters that I will continue to work to get this bill before the President. 
   I also have been meeting with satellite company officials representing companies that will be able to offer a whole range of local stations, movie channels, sports, weather, history, PBS, superstations, and the like, to Vermonters via satellite. I want to make sure that Vermonters will be offered the full range of TV service over satellite once we can negotiate the final bill. 
   I am in the same situation as many Vermonters. At my home in Middlesex, Vermont, I only receive one local network channel clearly with my rooftop antenna. 
   I was very worried three years ago that satellite dish owners would start losing their ability to receive distant network signals. Unfortunately, my fears have come to pass. Many other Members of Congress have also been concerned about this issue. 
   The Satellite Home Viewers Improvement Act, S. 247, which I sponsored with the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, the Chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator MCCAIN, the ranking member of our antitrust subcommittee, Senator KOHL, and the Majority Leader of the Senate, Senator LOTT, offered the way to promote head-to-head competition between cable and satellite providers--and lower rates and provide more services for consumers. 
   In November of 1997, we held a full Committee hearing on satellite issues. I agreed with Chairman HATCH to work together on a bill to try to avoid needless cutoffs of satellite TV service while, at the same time, working to protect the local affiliate broadcast system and increase competition. 
   In March of last year we introduced a bill but were unable to get it to the President for signature. That version was reported out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously on October 1, 1998. That bill, as with the bill I am trying to get to the President's desk this year, was also designed to permit local TV signals, as opposed to distant out-of-state network signals, to be offered to viewers via satellite; to increase competition between cable and satellite TV providers; to provide more PBS programming by also offering a national feed as well as local programming; and to reduce rates charged to consumers. 
   In the midst of all these legislative efforts, a federal district court judge in Florida found that PrimeTime 24 was offering distant CBS and Fox television signals to more than one million households in the U.S. in a manner inconsistent with its compulsory license that allows them to offer distant network signals. This development further complicated the situation. 
   Under a preliminary injunction, the satellite service of CBS and Fox networks was to be terminated on October  8, 1998 for thousands of households in Vermont and other states who had signed up after March 11, 1997, the date the action was filed. 
   I was pleased that we worked together in the Senate Judiciary Committee to avoid these immediate cutoffs of satellite TV service in Vermont and other states. The parties agreed to request an extension which was granted until February 28, 1999. This extension was also designed to give the FCC time to address this problem faced by satellite dish owners. 
   In December, I sent a comment to the FCC and criticized their proposals on how to define the ``white area''--the area not included in either the Grade A or Grade B signal intensity areas. My view was that the FCC proposal would cut off households from receiving distant signals based on ``unwarranted assumptions'' in a manner inconsistent with the law and the clear intent of the Congress. I complained about entire towns in Vermont which were to be inappropriately cut off when no one could receive signals over the air. 
   The Florida district court filed a final order which also required that households signed up for satellite service before March 11, 1997, be subject to termination of CBS and Fox distant signals on April 30, 1999, if they lived in areas where they are likely to receive a grade B intensity signal and are unable to get the local CBS or Fox affiliate to consent to receipt of the distant signal. 
   In the meantime, further Court and other developments have resulted in cutoffs of thousands of satellite dish owners. This situation is unacceptable, and I will continue to work to fix this problem.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is going on two years since I first submitted comments to the Federal Communications Commission regarding their proposed rules to preempt State and local governments in the placement and construction of telecommunications towers. Close to two years later, I am still working to ensure that the voice of States and local governments are heard in the continuing fight over telecommunications tower construction. 
   I am proud to be joined by Senators JEFFORDS, HUTCHISON, FEINGOLD, and MOYNIHAN in introducing legislation which will mandate that states and towns cannot be ignored in the spread of telecommunications towers. This bill recognizes that states and towns do have choices in this cellular age. 
   I became greatly alarmed two years ago, when the Federal Communications Commission proposed rules which would preempt State and local governments in the siting of telecommunications towers. This rule is still pending, and it has been by no means the only or final attempts to minimize the role of State and local governments in the clamor to erect telecommunications towers. 
   For instance, some may recall the ```E-911'' bill that was introduced last Congress which would have prohibited State and local governments from having any say over the placement or construction of telecommunications towers on federal lands. Keep in mind that federal courthouses and post offices are included in this category. 
   I continue to be very concerned that the rights of citizens are being jeopardized by the interests of telecommunications companies. 
   As I have said before, I do not want Vermont turned into a pincushion, with 200 foot towers indiscriminately sprouting up on every mountain and in every valley. 
   The state of Vermont must have a role in deciding where telecommunications towers are going to go. Vermont citizens and communities should be able to participate in the important decisions affecting their families and their future. 
   Twenty-nine years ago, Vermont enacted landmark legislation, known as Act 250, to carefully establish procedures to balance the interests of development with the interests of the environment, health and safety, resource conservation and the protection of Vermont's natural beauty. I do not want Act 250's legacy to be undermined by the interests of telecommunications companies. 
   Another factor that should remain at the forefront of this debate is the existence of alternative communication technologies. 
   For instance, some companies are working to offer phone service throughout the United States that is based on low-earth-orbit satellites. Over time, this will provide a satellite communications link from any place in the world, even where no tower-based system is available. Emergency communications--911 and disaster assistance--will be greatly aided with this development. 
   In addition, I have previously discussed how the towerless PCS-Over-Cable and PCS-Over-Fiber technology provides digital cellular phone service by using small antennas rather than large towers. These small antennas can be quickly attached to existing telephone poles, lamp posts or buildings and can provide quality wireless phone service without the use of towers. This technology is cheaper than most tower technology in part because the PCS-Over-Cable wireless provider does not have to purchase land to erect large towers. 
   Since there are viable and reasonable alternatives to providing wireless phone service through the use of towers, I think that towns should have some say in this matter. And I think that mayors, town officials and local citizens will agree with me. 
   Also, consider this: the Federal Aviation Administration presently has limited authority to regulated the siting of towers, and because of this, airport officials work with local governments in the siting of towers. Silencing local governments will have a direct effect on airline safety, according to the representatives of the airline industry that we have heard from. 
   In fact, in a comment letter responding to the FCC's 1997 proposed rule at preemption, the National Association of State Aviation Officials stated that preemption ``is contrary to the most fundamental principles of aviation safety *.*.* the proposed rule could result in the creation of hazards to aircraft and passengers at airports across the United States, as well as jeopardize safety on the ground.'' I cannot think of anyone who would want towers constructed irrespective of the negative and potentially dangerous impacts they may have on airplane flight and landing patterns. 
   There is also a growing concern about potential health hazards associated with using cellular telephones. Though there was a major push by the U.S. federal government to research effects of electric and magnetic fields on biological systems, as is evidenced by the five-year Electric and Magnetic Fields Research and Public Information Dissemination Program, there has been no similar effort to research potential health effects of radio frequency emissions associated with wireless communications and wireless broadcast facilities. This omission should no longer be overlooked. 
   As I have said before, I am for progress, but not for ill-considered, so-called progress at the expense of Vermont families, towns and homeowners. Vermont can protect its rural and natural beauty while still providing for the amazing opportunities offered by these technological advances. 
   I am proud to continue in my commitment to the preservation of State and local authority over the siting and construction of telecommunications towers. I ask unanimous consent that this legislation be printed the RECORD.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the accomplishments of Amy Burke Wright on the occasion of her departure from the Lake Champlain Housing Development Corporation, LCHDC. 
   For 22 years Amy has been working to provide affordable housing to low income and disabled families in Vermont, and she has done it in such a way as to build respect and self-esteem among those she has helped. Amy has been the lead developer for twenty-five housing developments in eleven Vermont communities. I don't know of a single one of those projects that fit the stereotype for ``low-income'' housing. More than once in attended the ground-breaking or ribbon cutting for one of the housing developments Amy has managed, I have wished I could live there. From her ground breaking work on the Thelma Maples and Flynn Avenue Co-ops in Burlington to the wonderful redevelopment of an old school at the Marshall Center in St. Albans, Amy has changed the face of affordable housing in Vermont. For that, I and the hundreds of people who have benefitted from her work, thank her. 
   And it is not just that Amy has brought affordable housing into the mainstream, it is how she has done it--  with a creativity and determination to go where no affordable housing provider has gone before. If a project utilizes an innovative approach to ownership, or an organization forms to address affordable housing in new and exciting ways, more likely than not, Amy was there. She established and directed the first congregate housing project in Vermont, was a founding member of the Burlington Community Land Trust, the first non-profit in the state to actively promote long term affordability and community control of housing, and is a member of the Board of Directors of Richmond Housing Inc. which recently sponsored the first project in Vermont to provide home office space to support resident economic development. And these examples only scratch the surface of her work. 
   During one event to celebrate the opening of yet another affordable housing project she had shepherded to completion, Amy gave me a wand for, she said, the magic I had done in bringing some federal financing to the project. For all that Amy has done to bring quality affordable housing within reach for countless Vermont families, she deserves a super hero cape.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is today passing the Hatch-Leahy substitute amendment to S. 1255, the ``Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act.'' Senator HATCH and I, and others, have worked hard to craft this legislation in a balanced fashion to protect trademark owners and consumers doing business online, and Internet users who want to participate in what the Supreme Court has described as ```a unique and wholly new medium of worldwide human communication.'' Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844 (1997). 
   On July 29, 1999, Senator HATCH and I, along with several other Senators, introduced S. 1461, the ``Domain Name Piracy Prevention Act of 1999.'' This bill then provided the text of the Hatch-Leahy substitute amendment that we offered to S. 1255 at the Judiciary Committee's executive business meeting the same day. The Committee unanimously reported the substitute amendment favorably to the Senate for consideration. This substitute amendment, with three additional refinements contained in a Hatch-Leahy clarifying amendment, is the legislation that the Senate considers today. 
   Trademarks are important tools of commerce.--The exclusive right to the use of a unique mark helps companies compete in the marketplace by distinguishing their goods and services from those of their competitors, and helps consumers identify the source of a product by linking it with a particular company. The use of trademarks by companies, and reliance on trademarks by consumers, will only become more important as the global marketplace becomes larger and more accessible with electronic commerce. The reason is simple: when a trademarked name is  used as a company's address in cyberspace, customers know where to go online to conduct business with that company. 
   The growth of electronic commerce is having a positive effect on the economies of small rural states like mine. A Vermont Internet Commerce report I commissioned earlier this year found that Vermont gained more than 1,000 new jobs as a result of Internet commerce, with the potential that Vermont could add more than 24,000 jobs over the next two years. For a small state like ours, this is very good news. 
   Along with the good news, this report identified a number of obstacles that stand in the way of Vermont reaching the full potential promised by Internet commerce. One obstacle is that ``merchants are anxious about not being able to control where their names and brands are being displayed.'' Another is the need to bolster consumers' confidence in online shopping. 
   Cybersquatters hurt electronic commerce.--Both merchant and consumer confidence in conducting business online are undermined by so-called ``cybersquatters'' or ``cyberpirates,'' who abuse the rights of trademark holders by purposely and maliciously registering as a domain name the trademarked name of another company to divert and confuse customers or to deny the company the ability to establish an easy-to-find online location. A recent report by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on the Internet domain name process has characterized cybersquatting as ``predatory and parasitical practices by a minority of domain registrants acting in bad faith'' to register famous or well-known marks of others--which can lead to consumer confusion or downright fraud. 
   Enforcing trademarks in cyberspace will promote global electronic commerce.--Enforcing trademark law in cyberspace can help bring consumer confidence to this new frontier. That is why I have long been concerned with protecting registered trademarks online. Indeed, when the Congress passed the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, I noted that: ``[A]lthough no one else has yet considered this application, it is my hope that this antidilution statute can help stem the use of deceptive Internet addresses taken by those who are choosing marks that are associated with the products and reputations of others.'' (CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, Dec. 29, 1995, page S19312) 
   In addition, last year I authored an amendment that was enacted as part of the Next Generation Internet Research Act authorizing the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to study the effects on trademark holders of adding new top-level domain names and requesting recommendations on inexpensive and expeditious procedures for resolving trademark disputes over the assignment of domain names. Both the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and WIPO are also making recommendations on these procedures. Adoption of a uniform trademark domain name dispute resolution policy will be of enormous benefit to American trademark owners. 
   The ``Domain Name Piracy Prevention Act,'' S. 1461, which formed the basis for the substitute amendment to S. 1255 that the Senate considers today, is not intended in any way to frustrate these global efforts already underway to develop inexpensive and expeditious procedures for resolving domain name disputes that avoid costly and time-consuming litigation in the court systems either here or abroad. In fact, the legislation expressly provides liability limitations for domain name registrars, registries or other domain name registration authorities when they take actions pursuant to a reasonable policy prohibiting the registration of domain names that are identical or confusingly similar to another's trademark or dilutive of a famous trademark. The ICANN and WIPO consideration of these issues will inform the development by domain name registrars and registries of such reasonable policies. 
   The Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995 has been used as I predicted to help stop misleading uses of trademarks as domain names. One court has described this exercise by saying that ``attempting to apply established trademark law in the fast-developing world of the Internet is somewhat like trying to board a moving bus .....'' Bensusan Restaurant Corp. v. King, 126 F.3d 25 (2d Cir. 1997). Nevertheless, the courts appear to be handling ``cybersquatting'' cases well. As University of Miami Law Professor Michael Froomkin noted in testimony submitted at the Judiciary Committee's hearing on this issue on July 22, 1999, ``[i]n every case involving a person 
   who registered large numbers of domains for resale, the cybersquatter has lost.'' 
   For example, courts have had little trouble dealing with a notorious cybersquatter, Dennis Toeppen from Illinois, who registered more than 100 trademarks--including ``yankee stadium.com,'' ``deltaairlines.com,'' and ``neiman-marcus.com''--as domain names for the purpose of eventually selling the names back to the companies owning the trademarks. The various courts reviewing his activities have unanimously determined that he violated the Federal Trademark Dilution Act. 
   Similarly, Wayne State University Law Professor Jessica Litman noted in testimony submitted at the Judiciary Committee's hearing that those businesses which ``have registered domain names that are confusingly similar to trademarks or personal names in order to use them for pornographic web sites ..... have without exception lost suits brought against them.'' 
   Enforcing or even modifying our trademark laws will be only part of the solution to cybersquatting. Up to now, people have been able to register any number of domain names in the popular ``.com'' domain with no money down and no money due for 60 days. Network Solutions Inc. (NSI), the dominant Internet registrar, announced just last month that it was changing this policy, and requiring payment of the registration fee up front. In doing so, the NSI admitted that it was making this change to curb cybersquatting. 
   In light of the developing case law, the ongoing efforts within WIPO and ICANN to build a consensus global mechanism for resolving online trademark disputes, and the implementation of domain name registration practices designed to discourage cybersquatting, the legislation we pass today is intended to build upon this progress and provide constructive guidance to trademark holders, domain name registrars and registries and Internet users registering domain names alike. 
   Commercial sites are not the only ones suffering at the hands of domain name pirates. Even the Congress is not immune: while cspan.org provides detailed coverage of the Senate and House, cspan.net is a pornographic site. Moreover, Senators and presidential hopefuls are finding that domain names like bush2000.org and hatch2000.org are being snatched up by cyber poachers intent on reselling these names for a tidy profit. While this legislation does not help politicians protect their names, it will help small and large businesses and consumers doing business online. 
   As introduced, S. 1255 was flawed.--I appreciate the efforts of Senators ABRAHAM, TORRICELLI, HATCH and MCCAIN to focus our attention on this important matter. As originally introduced, S. 1255 proposed to make it illegal to register or use any ``Internet domain name or identifier of an online location'' that could be confused with the trademark of another person or cause dilution of a ``famous trademark.'' Violations were punishable by both civil and criminal penalties. 
   I voiced concerns at a hearing before the Judiciary Committee that, in its original form, S. 1255 would have a number of unintended consequences that could hurt rather than promote electronic commerce, including the following specific problems: 
   The definition was overbroad.--As introduced, S. 1255 covered the use or registration of any ``identifier,'' which could cover not just second level domain names, but also e-mail addresses, screen names used in chat rooms, and even files accessible and readable on the Internet. As one witness pointed out, ``the definitions will make every fan a criminal.'' How? A file document about Batman, for example, that uses the trademark ``Batman'' in its name, which also identifies its online location, could land the writer in court under that bill. Cybersquatting is not about file names.  
   The original bill threatened hypertext linking.--The Web operates on hypertext linking, to facilitate jumping from one site to another. The original bill could have disrupted this practice by imposing liability on operators of sites with links to other sites with trademark names in the address. One could imagine a trademark owner not wanting to be associated with or linked with certain sites, and threatening suit under this proposal unless the link were eliminated or payments were made for allowing the linking. 
   The original bill would have criminalized dissent and protest sites.--A number of Web sites collect complaints about trademarked products or services, and use the trademarked names to identify themselves. For example, there are protest sites named ``boycott-cbs.com'' and ``www.PepsiBloodbath.com.'' While the speech contained on those sites is clearly constitutionally protected, as originally introduced, S. 1255 would have criminalized the use of the trademarked name to reach the site and made them difficult to search for and find online. 
   The original bill would have stifled legitimate warehousing of domain names.--The bill, as introduced, would have changed current law and made liable persons who merely register domain names similar to other trademarked names, whether or not they actually set up a site and used the name. The courts have recognized that companies may have legitimate reasons for registering domain names without using them and have declined to find trademark violations for mere registration of a trademarked name. For example, a company planning to acquire another company might register a domain name containing the target company's name in anticipation of the deal. The original bill would have made that company liable for trademark infringement. 
   For these and other reasons, Professor Litman concluded that, as introduced, the ``bill would in many ways be bad for electronic commerce, by making it hazardous to do business on the Internet without first retaining trademark counsel.'' Faced with the risk of criminal penalties, she stated that ``many start-up businesses may choose to abandon their goodwill and move to another Internet location, or even to fold, rather than risk liability.'' 
   The Hatch-Leahy Domain Name Piracy Prevention Act and substitute amendment to S. 1255 are a better solution.--S. 1461, the ``Domain Name Piracy Prevention Act,'' which Senators HATCH and I, and others, introduced and which provides the text of the substitute amendment to S. 1255, addresses the cybersquatting problem without jeopardizing other important online rights and interests. Along with the Hatch-Leahy clarifying amendment we consider today, this legislation would amend section 43 of the Trademark Act (15 U.S.C.  11125) 
   by adding a new section to make liable for actual or statutory damages any person, who with bad-faith intent to profit from the goodwill of another's trademark, without regard to the goods or services of the parties, registers, traffics in or uses a domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to a distinctive trademark or dilutive of a famous trademark. The fact that the domain name registrant did not compete with the trademark owner would not be a bar to recovery. 
   Uses of infringing domain names that support liability under the legislation are expressly limited to uses by the domain name registrant or the registrant's authorized licensee. This limitation makes clear that ``uses'' of domain names by persons other than the domain name registrant for purposes such as hypertext linking, directory publishing, or for search engines, are not covered by the prohibition. 
   Domain name piracy is a real problem. Whitehouse.com has probably gotten more traffic from people trying to find copies of the President's speeches than those interested in adult material. As I have noted, the issue has struck home for many in this body, with aspiring cyber-poachers seizing domain names like bush2000.org and trying to extort political candidates for their use. 
   While the problem is clear, narrowly defining the solution is trickier. The mere presence of a trademark is not enough. Legitimate conflicts may arise between companies offering different services or products under the same trademarked name, such as Juno lighting inc. and Juno online services over the juno.com domain name, or between companies and individuals who register a name or nickname as a domain name, such as the young boy nicknamed ``pokey'' whose domain name ``pokey.org'' was challenged by the toy manufacturer who owns the rights to the Gumby and Pokey toys. In other cases, you may have a site which uses a trademarked name to protest a group, company or issue, such as pepsibloodbath.com, or even to defend one's reputation, such as www.civil-action.com, which belongs not to the motion picture studio, but to W.R. Grace to rebut the unflattering portrait of the company as a polluter and child poisoner created by the movie. 
   There is a world of difference between these sorts of sites and those which use deceptive naming practices to draw attention to their site (e.g., whitehouse.com), or those who use domain names to misrepresent the goods or services they offer (e.g., dellmemory.com, which may be confused with the Dell computer company). 
   We must also recognize certain technological realities. For example, merely mentioning a trademark is not a problem. Posting a speech that mentions AOL on my web page and calling the page aol.html, confuses no one between my page and America Online's site. Likewise, we must recognize that while the Web is a key part of the Internet, it is not the only part. We simply do not want to pass legislation that may impose liability on Internet users with e-mail addresses, which may contain a trademarked name. Nor do we want to crack down on newsgroups that use trademarks descriptively, such as alt.comics.batman. 
   In short, it is important that we distinguish between the legitimate and illegitimate use of domain names, and this legislation does just that. Significant sections of this legislation include: 
   Definition.--Domain names are narrowly defined to mean alphanumeric designations registered with or assigned by domain name registrars or registries, or other domain name registration authority as part of an electronic address on the Internet. Since registrars only register second level domain names, this definition effectively excludes file names, screen names, and e-mail addresses and, under current registration practice, applies only to second level domain names. 
   Scienter Requirement.--Good faith, innocent or negligent uses of a domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to another's mark or dilutive of a famous mark are not covered by the legislation's prohibition. Thus, registering a domain name while unaware that the name is another's trademark would not be actionable. Nor would the use of a domain name that contains a trademark for purposes of protest, complaint, parody or commentary satisfy the requisite scienter requirement. Bad-faith intent to profit is required for a violation to occur. This requirement of bad-faith intent to profit is critical since, as Professor Litman pointed out in her testimony, our trademark laws permit multiple businesses to register the same trademark for different classes of products. Thus, she explains:  
   [a]lthough courts have been quick to impose liability for bad faith registration, they have been far more cautious in disputes involving a domain name registrant who has a legitimate claim to use a domain name and registered it in good faith. In a number of cases, courts have refused to impose liability where there is no significant likelihood that anyone will be misled, even if there is a significant possibility of trademark dilution.  
   The legislation outlines the following non-exclusive list of eight factors for courts to consider in determining whether such bad-faith intent to profit is proven: (i) the trademark rights of the domain name registrant in the domain name; (ii) whether the domain name is the legal name or nickname of the registrant; (iii) the prior use by the registrant of the domain name in connection with the bona fide offering of any goods or services; (iv) the registrant's legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the mark at the site under the domain name; (v) the registrant's intent to divert consumers from the mark's owner's online location in a manner that could harm the mark's  goodwill, either for commercial gain or with the intent to tarnish or disparage the mark, by creating a likelihood of confusion as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation or endorsement of the site; (vi) the registrant's offer to sell the domain name for substantial consideration without having or having an intent to use the domain name in the bona fide offering of goods or services; (vii) the registrant's intentional provision of material false and misleading contact information when applying for the registration of the domain name; and (viii) the registrant's registration of multiple domain names that are identical or similar to or dilutive of another's trademark. 
   Damages.--In civil actions against cybersquatters, the plaintiff is authorized to recover actual damages and profits, or may elect before final judgment to award of statutory damages of 
   not less than $1,000 and not more than $100,000 per domain name, as the court considers just. The court is directed to remit statutory damages in any case where the infringer reasonably believed that use of the domain name was a fair or otherwise lawful use. 
   In Rem Actions.--The bill would also permit an in rem civil action filed by a trademark owner in circumstances where the domain name violates the owner's rights in the trademark and the court finds that the owner demonstrated due diligence and was not able to find the domain name holder to bring an in personam civil action. The remedies of an in rem action are limited to a court order for forfeiture or cancellation of the domain name or the transfer of the domain name to the trademark owner. 
   Liability Limitations.--The bill would limit the liability for monetary damages of domain name registrars, registries or other domain name registration authorities for any action they take to refuse to register, remove from registration, transfer, temporarily disable or permanently cancel a domain name pursuant to a court order or in the implementation of reasonable policies prohibiting the registration of domain names that are identical or confusingly similar to another's trademark, or dilutive of a famous trademark. 
   Prevention of Reverse Domain Name Hijacking.--Reverse domain name hijacking is an effort by a trademark owner to take a domain name from a legitimate good faith domain name registrant. There have been some well-publicized cases of trademark owners demanding the take down of certain web sites set up by parents who have registered their children's names in the .org domain, such as two year old Veronica Sams's ``Little Veronica'' website and 12 year old Chris ``Pokey'' Van Allen's web page. 
   In order to protect the rights of domain name registrants in their domain names the legislation provides that registrants may recover damages, including costs and attorney's fees, incurred as a result of a knowing and material misrepresentation by a person that a domain name is identical or similar to, or dilutive of, a trademark. 
   In addition, a domain name registrant, whose domain name has been suspended, disabled or transferred, may sue upon notice to the mark owner, to establish that the registration or use of the domain name by the registrant is lawful. The court in such a suit is authorized to grant injunctive relief, including the reactivation of a domain name or the transfer or return of a domain name to the domain name registrant. 
   Cybersquatting is an important issue both for trademark holders and for the future of electronic commerce on the Internet. Any legislative solution to cybersquatting must tread carefully to ensure that authorized remedies do not impede or stifle the free flow of information on the Internet. In many ways, the United States has been the incubator of the World Wide Web, and the world closely watches whenever we venture into laws, customs or standards that affect the Internet. We must only do so with great care and caution. Fair use principles are just as critical in cyberspace as in any other intellectual property arena. I am pleased that Chairman HATCH and I, along with Senators ABRAHAM, TORRICELLI, and KOHL have worked together to find a legislative solution that respects these considerations.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I strongly support this Resolution, which seeks to hasten the return of Zachary Baumel, a United States citizen, and other Israeli soldiers missing in action. 
   My staff met with Mr. Baumel's mother, and she described a heart-wrenching account of over 17 years of trying to obtain information about her son, Zachary, who in 1982, while serving in the Israeli military, was captured after a tank battle with Syrian forces in Lebanon. He has not been heard from since, and the only evidence she has recovered is half of Mr. Baumel's dog tag which was delivered by Yasser Arafat to the Israeli Government. 
   According to the Department of State, the Palestinian Authority has provided information which could lead to locating and securing the return of Mr. Baumel. This contrasts with the total lack of cooperation from either Syrian or Lebanese authorities. The fact remains that Mr. Baumel's whereabouts remains a mystery. 
   I hope this Resolution gives some solace to the families of Mr. Baumel and the two other Israeli soldiers who are missing. Their disappearance is unquestionably a matter of deep concern to the Congress. It is unconscionable that these families have yet to be told of the fate of their loved ones. 
   The amendment I have offered, which modifies one provision in HR 1175 that is of particular interest to the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of which I am Ranking Member, has been approved by both the House and Senate sponsors of the bill and the family of Mr. Baumel, and is supported by the State Department. It was drafted in a sincere effort to make it more likely that this Resolution leads to the result that the families intend, and to preserve the role of the United States Government as an honest broker in the Middle East peace process.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment which helps dairy farmers across the country.  
   I think the least the Senate should do when debating a relief bill for farmers is to not reduce farm income. 
   The Department of Agriculture's milk marketing order--the so-called modified ``option 1-B''-- would reduce farm income by about a million dollars per day. That doesn't sound like farm aid to me. It sounds like a recipe for disaster. 
   Why should dairy farmers in Mississippi, North Carolina, Georgia, or California, for example, have their income cut by USDA rules when other farmers will get helped under this bill? I think dairy farmers are as deserving as other farmers. 
   Isn't it enough that the price of milk paid to dairy farmers dropped by almost 40 percent recently? Why should the Secretary be allowed to change current policy to punish dairy farmers even more by reducing their income? 
   Sixty-one Senators signed a letter to Secretary Glickman opposing the cuts in farm income that would result from implementing the so-called option 1-B. 
   Those sixty-one Senators pointed out that ``dairy farmers . . . are receiving essentially the same price for their milk that they received fifteen years ago while the cost of production has increased. Option 1-B would further reduce the price of milk received by farmers in almost all regions of the country, thereby reducing local supplies of fresh, fluid milk and increasing costs for consumers.'' 
   This amendment--the Lott amendment--mandates that current law be continued and that option 1-B be put on ice. 
   I must address some unfortunate misinformation that is being spread about the amendment. 
   We received a ``Dear Colleague'' letter from Senator FEINGOLD that incorrectly suggests that the Lott amendment would terminate the milk marketing order system. 
   That, of course, is not the case. Probably only a few Senators want to eliminate milk differentials and the marketing order system. The great majority of Senators, including myself, believe that this is not the time to terminate the milk order system. 
   The Lott amendment would not terminate that system and a letter from the General Counsel of USDA that is being used by opponents of the Lott amendment does not even make that point. 
   Indeed, the General Counsel says: ``the issue of whether the statutory language also prevents the Secretary from rescinding the order presents novel questions which will require further analysis.'' 
   But, we already know this amendment does not terminate the marketing order system since it is drafted the same way we drafted a similar extension of the milk marketing order system last year. 
   Section 738 of last year's appropriations bill provided a similar extension. No one at USDA argued that last year's extension terminated all milk marketing orders. 
   Indeed, Congress can pass laws that supercede rules issued by Departments. 
   Of course any drafting glitch could be fixed at Conference, but there is no glitch since we are simply extending current law, just like we did last year. 
   I want to address other misinformation that is being spread. Some have been saying that the amendment could mean higher prices for consumers. 
   I will compare milk prices in New England against the Upper Midwest any day of the week.

   Mr. LEAHY. The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin and his colleague discussed the National Farmers Union. I hope everybody reads the letter dated June 18, 1999, because it says:  
   ..... we support legislation to establish dairy compacts and amend the federal order system if those provisions are coupled with the legislation to establish the dairy support price of $12.50 per hundredweight.  
   Even though my distinguished colleagues from Wisconsin quote from the National Farmers Union as somebody we should be listening to, my colleagues specifically oppose what the National Farmers Union says they want. I would vote for that NFU proposal in a minisecond; I had hoped that since the NFU proposal benefits all dairy farmers that we could have worked together on this. But the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin opposes it. 
   There are a lot of quotes going around here. The National Grange strongly supports the Northeast Dairy Compact. They represent 300,000 members nationwide, and they say that ``regional dairy compacts offer the best opportunity to preserve family dairy farms.'' 
   If we are going to quote some of these organizations, let us be honest in what they say. They support the dairy compacts. These farm organizations strongly support it. A few processors and the Senators from Wisconsin do not.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, to reiterate, we have to wonder what is going on. I know the upper Midwest massively overproduces milk. We are simply asking to produce the milk we are going to consume in our area. They massively overproduce it. As the Minneapolis Star Tribune explained, Minnesota farmers want to sell ``reconstituted milk in Southern markets.'' They talk about drawing water out and shipping down some ``glop.'' I will let the reporter of debates figure out how to spell that. I don't know how. It sort of looks like it sounds. 
   All we want is fresh milk in our region. We are not trying to take over any other part of the country. We have something that we have proved works. It doesn't cost the taxpayers anything. It helps stabilize farm income. Consumers have a voice in it and like it in the area. All we are saying is let us make some determination in our own part of the world. We are talking about billions and billions of dollars in farm aid in this bill. The amendment that Senator JEFFORDS, Senator LOTT, and I, and others support says we don't want any Federal money; we want to set things the way we are now doing it, protecting our consumers and our farmers. 
   Mr. President, I know the Upper Midwest massively overproduces milk--  they overproduce far more than they can consume--and thus want to sell this milk in the South. 
   I have read the press reports about how they want to dehydrate milk--take the water out of milk--and then hydrate it by adding water in distant states. The Minneapolis Star Tribune explained that Minnesota farmers want to sell ``reconstituted milk in Southern markets.'' 
   The article from February 12, 1992, points out that ``technology exists for them to draw water from the milk in order to save shipping costs, then reconstitute it.'' 
   Regular milk needs refrigeration and weighs a lot and is thus expensive to ship. Also, only empty tanker trucks can come back since nothing else can be loaded into the milk containers. 
   But dehydrated milk can be shipped in boxes. 
   By taking the water out of milk, the Upper Midwest can supply the South with milk. 
   I realize that according to a St. Louis Post-Dispatch article in 1990 that Wisconsin farmers defended the taste of reconstituted milk. The article points out that Dan Hademan, of Wisconsin, ``says fluid milk should be treated the same nationwide, whether it is fresh whole milk or reconstituted milk.'' 
   That article notes ``Upper Midwest farmers say technological advances in making powdered milk and other concentrates has improved the taste and texture of reconstituted milk.'' 
   However, the House National Security Committee had a hearing on this reconstituted milk issue in 1997. I will quote from the hearing transcript:  
   ..... the Air Force on Okinawa decided that the reconstituted milk was not suitable for the military and as a quality of life decision they closed the milk plant and opted to have fluid milk transported in from the United States.  
   There was a great article in the Christian Science Monitor a few years ago that talks about the school lunch program. It mentions the first time that the author, as a first-grader, was given reconstituted milk. 
   He said: ``Now, I like milk....... But not this stuff. Not watery, gray, hot, reconstituted milk that tasted more like rusty pump than anything remotely connected with a cow. We wept. We gagged. We choked.'' 
   The second problem with the strategy of Wisconsin and Minnesota farmers selling their milk down South is what about ice storms or snow? What happens when flooding or tornado damage or other problems stop these trucks laden with milk? 
   Southern parents might not be able to buy milk at any price any time an ice storm hits the Upper Midwest if the South does not have fresh, local, supplies of fresh milk. Just remember the panic that affects Washington, D.C., when residents think we might get what is called in Vermont a ``dusting of snow.'' 
   Most Americans do not remember why Friday, March 5, 1999, is significant. But most dairy farmers will remember that date as long as they live. 
   On that date, the Department of Agriculture announced the largest cut in milk prices ever--a month-to-month drop of $6.00 per hundredweight. 
   This was the largest month-to-month drop in history--yet retail store milk prices remained high. Processors made huge windfall profits. And, while the milk prices received by farmers dropped by almost 40 percent the prices stores charged to consumers hardly dropped. 
   Imagine a month-to-month drop in other commodity prices of almost 40 percent. Imagine what that would do to your family farmers. 
   The only region in the country that enjoyed some modest protection against this huge drop in farm prices was New England--because of the Northeast Dairy Compact. 
   Half of the states have approved a similar system regarding dairy pricing. While a regional diary compact does not offer complete protection against huge and unexpected drops in the price of milk for farmers, it does provide a modest measure of relief. 
   It is a safety net that prevents farmers from hitting rock bottom.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand the parliamentary situation. But I want to strongly support the amendment of both Senator SPECTER and Senator SCHUMER. 
   The distinguished Senator from New York has been a tremendous advocate for his dairy farmers, and this amendment is critical to keeping them in business. Upstate New York, just as Vermont, needs a compact to keep their dairy industry alive. 
   The distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. SPECTER, has taken the lead on this issue for years for his dairy farmers in Pennsylvania. He recognizes that participating in our regional compact will increase farm income at a time when dairy farmers around the Nation are in dire straits. 
   I will continue to fight for them--for a Southern compact and for a Northeast compact. There will be other opportunities this year. I stand united with them. Congress should not stand in the way of the wishes of 25 Governors, 25 State senates, and 25 State assemblies, or house of representatives--especially when all they want is to provide a safety net for their dairy farmers without raiding the Federal Treasury. 
   We talk about billions of dollars in farm programs. We are asking everybody to embrace these compacts because they do not cost the taxpayers anything. 
   Napoleon said that ``sometimes the most trifling thing decides the fate of battle.'' In this case, the new rule changes of rule XVI coupled with bringing up the Senate Agriculture appropriations bill makes it difficult to extend the compact to the additional 19 States that already have approved compacts. Eventually it will be done. I will do everything possible to get it done. 
   The National Grange pointed out that ``regional dairy compacts offer the best opportunity to preserve family dairy farms.'' 
   The Grange goes on to support the Southern Dairy compact since a Southern Compact would ``provide dairy farmers in that region with a stable price structure for the milk they produce while assuring the region a viable supply of locally produced milk.'' 
   I support both the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. SPECTER, and the Senator from New York, Mr. SCHUMER, and appreciate all of the tremendous work they have done for the dairy farmers.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have lost track of how long it has been since the President nominated Ambassador Richard Holbrooke to be the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations. 
   What I do know is that in the intervening months we have fought a war in Kosovo that I supported, but which harmed our relations with Russia and China. 
   We have watched as tens of thousands of students demonstrated in the streets of Tehran; seen further signs that North Korea is preparing to test a long-range missile that could reach our shores; entered a new and hopeful period in the Middle East peace process; watched the Northern Ireland peace process reach a dead end once again; and seen India and Pakistan, armed with nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them, clash over Kashmir. All of this has occurred while Ambassador Holbrooke has been waiting to be confirmed. 
   So, Mr. President, it is possible for the United States to carry on without a UN ambassador. We have managed to do that. The world has not come to an end, although not a day has passed without a crisis that we have an interest in. But does anyone here think it is a sensible way for the world's only superpower to conduct itself? 
   Every day, we face threats to our security interests, our economic interest, that affect the health and welfare of the American people, and which require the intensive attention and intervention of skilled diplomats. Aside from the Secretary of State, there is no diplomatic position more important than our UN Ambassador. 
   Yet month after month after month, we have seen this nomination delayed by the Majority party. First it was due to allegations of financial irregularities, which Ambassador Holbrooke resolved months ago. Months had already been lost waiting for a hearing. 
   Then, shortly after the Majority Leader said the Senate would vote on his nomination, a hold was placed on it and more weeks have passed without a vote being scheduled--a vote that is certain to confirm Ambassador Holbrooke overwhelmingly. In fact, he would have been confirmed easily months ago, if the Senate had been permitted to vote. 
   This is the last week before the August recess. There is absolutely no justification whatsoever for delaying this further. There are no political points to be made here. On the contrary, we hurt ourselves each day that we are without a UN Ambassador. It is, frankly, ridiculous to be acting as if this position can remain vacant for month after month, without weakening our influence around the world. 
   So let us hope this is the week that Ambassador Holbrooke will be confirmed, and that he can get started on the difficult job that we, the American people and the President, need him to do.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as NATO soldiers struggle to keep the peace in Kosovo, war crimes investigators labor to identify and exhume bodies from hundreds of mass graves, and the costly effort to rebuild homes and communities gets underway, we are seeing a repeat of many of the challenges that confront any post-conflict society. 
   One I want to mention today is a threat that is hidden among the debris, killing and horribly injuring civilians and NATO peacekeepers indiscriminately as they work to rebuild what was destroyed in the war. 
   The threat is unexploded ordnance, and in Kosovo that means landmines left by the Serbs and the Kosovo Liberation Army, and cluster bombs dropped by NATO forces, mostly by American aircraft. 
   I have often spoken about the problem of landmines. There are tens of thousands of them scattered in the fields, forests, and roads of Kosovo. 
   Each one is designed to blow the legs off the unsuspecting person who triggers it. Usually it is a farmer, or child, or some other innocent person trying to rebuild a normal life. The United States is helping to clear the mines, but it is a tedious, costly, and dangerous job. 
   But even more than landmines, it is unexploded cluster bombs which pose the greatest danger to civilians and NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo. 
   Cluster bombs are a favorite antipersonnel weapon of the U.S. military, and hundreds of thousands of them were dropped by NATO planes over Kosovo. They cover wide areas, are designed to explode on impact, and they spread shrapnel in all directions. 
   People and lightly armored vehicles are the usual targets, but since cluster bombs are often dropped from high altitudes they often miss the target. 
   Not only do they too often miss the target, between 5 and 20 percent of cluster bombs do not explode on impact. According to the State Department, there may be as many as 11,000 of these deadly bomblets currently lying on Kosovo soil, waiting for someone, anyone, to walk or drive by and set them off. 
   Unlike landmines, their location cannot be accurately mapped. We do not know where they are. Like landmines, it is the victim who pulls the trigger. 
   The usual victims of these explosions, like landmines, are innocent civilians, not military targets. And they remain active for years. In Laos, where millions of United States cluster bombs were dropped during the Vietnam war a quarter century ago, people are still losing their lives, their limbs, and their eyesight from these weapons. 
   Cluster bombs do not discriminate. NATO peacekeepers are not immune. Children are not immune. Approximately 5 Kosovars each day are killed by unexploded ordnance, mostly U.S. cluster bombs. Over 170 people have died this way since the war ended. 
   Even though we have known about this problem for decades, little has been done to try to minimize the harm to civilians from cluster bombs. 
   Recently, to its credit, the Pentagon began studying this problem. There are two things that could and should be done immediately. 
   First, we need to significantly reduce or eliminate the problem of dud cluster bombs that remain active and dangerous. We have the technology to make landmines self-destruct or self-deactivate after a short period of time. 
   Why can't that same technology--usually a simple battery that runs out after a few hours--be applied to cluster bombs? It needs to be done. 
   Second, the Pentagon should revisit its rules of engagement for using cluster bombs. In Kosovo, NATO showered cluster bombs over densely populated areas. Was this militarily necessary or justified? Was it consistent with international law? 
   Since too often they miss the target, what limits should be imposed on where and when cluster bombs can be used so the innocent are not harmed? These questions need answers. 
   I am not the only one concerned about this. The same concerns have been conveyed to me by active duty and retired members of our Armed Forces. Just recently, the House Armed Services Committee included language in its report accompanying the fiscal year 2000 National Defense Appropriation Act, which directs the Secretary of Defense to establish a defense-wide program to develop affordable, reliable self-destruct fuses for munitions. 
   I see a real problem, and countless tragedies, resulting from the way these munitions are designed and used. We can do better. 
   There is always too much death and destruction in any military conflict. The lingering threat of landmines and unexploded bombs can be significantly reduced. If implemented, the changes I have suggested could save many innocent lives in the aftermath of war.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator HATCH, and others, today in introducing the ``Domain Name Piracy Prevention Act of 1999.'' We have worked hard to craft this legislation in a balanced fashion to protect trademark owners and consumers doing business online, and Internet users who want to participate in what the Supreme Court has described `` `a unique and wholly new medium of worldwide human communication.' '' Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844 (1997). 
   Trademarks are important tools of commerce. The exclusive right to the use of a unique mark helps companies compete in the marketplace by distinguishing their goods and services from those of their competitors, and helps consumers identify the source of a product by linking it with a particular company. The use of trademarks by companies, and reliance on trademarks by consumers, will only become more important as the global marketplace becomes larger and more accessible with electronic commerce. The reason is simple: when a trademark name is used as a company's address in cyberspace, customers know where to go online to conduct business with that company. 
   The growth of electronic commerce is having a positive effect on the economies of small rural states like mine. A Vermont Internet Commerce report I commissioned earlier this year found that Vermont gained more than 1,000 new jobs as a result of Internet commerce, with the potential that Vermont could add more than 24,000 jobs over the next two years. For a small state like ours, this is very good news. 
   Along with the good news, this report identified a number of obstacles that stand in the way of Vermont reaching the full potential promised by Internet commerce. One obstacle is that ``merchants are anxious about not being able to control where their names and brands are being displayed.'' Another is the need to bolster consumers' confidence in online shopping. 
   Cybersquatters hurt electronic commerce. Both merchant and consumer confidence in conducting business online are undermined by so-called ``cybersquatters'' or ``cyberpirates,''  who abuse the rights of trademark holders by purposely and maliciously registering as a domain, name the trademarked name of another company to divert and confuse customers or to deny the company the ability to establish an easy-to-find online location. A recent report by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on the Internet domain name process has characterized cybersquatting as ``predatory and parasitical practices by a minority of domain registrants acting in bad faith'' to register famous or well-known marks of others--which can lead to consumer confusion or downright fraud. 
   Enforcing trademarks in cyberspace will promote global electronic commerce. Enforcing trademark law in cyberspace can help bring consumer confidence to this new frontier. That is why I have long been concerned with protecting registered trademarks online. Indeed, when the Congress passed the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, I noted that:  
   [A]lthough no one else has yet considered this application, it is my hope that this antidilution statute can help stem the use of deceptive Internet addresses taken by those who are choosing marks that are associated with the products and reputations of others. (Congressional Record, Dec. 29, 1995, page S19312)  
   In addition, last year I authored an amendment that was enacted as part of the Next Generation Internet Research Act authorizing the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to study the effects on trademark holders of adding new top-level domain names and requesting recommendations on expensive and expeditious procedures for resolving trademark disputes over the assignment of domain names. Both the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (I-CANN) and WIPO are also making recommendations on these procedures. Adoption of a uniform trademark domain name dispute resolution policy will be of enormous benefit to American trademark owners. 
   The ``Domain Name Piracy Prevention Act of 1999,'' which we introduce today, is not intended in any way to frustrate these global efforts already underway to develop inexpensive and expeditious procedures for resolving domain name disputes that avoid costly and time-consuming litigation in the court systems either here or abroad. In fact, the bill expressly provides liability limitations for domain name registrars, registries or other domain name registration authorities when they take actions pursuant to a reasonable policy prohibiting the registration of domain names that are identical, confusingly similar to or dilutive of another's trademark. The I-CANN and WIPO consideration of these issues will inform the development by domain name registrars and registries of such reasonable policies. 
   The Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995 has been used as I predicted to help stop misleading uses of trademarks as domain names. One court has described this exercise by saying that ``attempting to apply established trademark law in the fast-developing world of the Internet is somewhat like trying to board a moving bus ..... ``Bensusan Restaurant Corp. v. King, 126 F.3d 25 (2d Cir. 1997). Nevertheless, the courts appear to be handling ``cybersquatting'' cases well. As University of Miami Law Professor Michael Froomkin noted in testimony submitted at the Judiciary Committee's hearing on this issue on July 22, 1999, ``[i]n every case involving a person who registered large numbers of domains for resale, the cybersquatter has lost.'' 
   For example, courts have had little trouble dealing with a notorious ``cybersquatter,'' Dennis Toeppen from Illinois, who registered more than 100 trademarks--including ``yankeestadium.com,'' ``deltaairlines.com,'' and ``neiman-marcus.com''--as domain names for the purpose of eventually selling the names back to the companies owning the trademarks. The various courts reviewing his activities have unanimously determined that he violated the Federal Trademark Dilution Act. 
   Similarly, Wayne State University Law Professor Jessica Litman noted in testimony submitted at the Judiciary Committees hearing that those businesses which `'have registered domain names 
   that are confusingly similar to trademarks or personal names in order to use them for pornographic web sites . . . have without exception lost suits brought against them.'' 
   Enforcing or even modifying our trademark laws will be only part of the solution to cybersquatting. Up to now, people have been able to register any number of domain names in the popular ``.com'' domain with no money down and no money due for 60 days. Network Solutions Inc. (NSI), the dominant Internet registrar, announced just last week that it was changing this policy, and requiring payment of the registration fee up front. In doing so, the NSI admitted that it was making this change to curb cybersquatting. 
   In light of the developing case law, the ongoing efforts within WIPO and ICANN to build a consensus global mechanism for resolving online trademark disputes, and the implementation of domain name registration practices designed to discourage cybersquatting, the legislation we introduce today is intended to build is intended to build upon this progress and provide constructive guidance to trademark holders, domain name registrars and registries and Internet users registering domain names alike. 
   Other Anti-cybersquatting Legislation Is Flawed. This is not the first bill to be introduced this session to address the problem of cybersquatting, and I appreciate the efforts of Senators ABRAHAM, TORICELLI, HATCH, and MCCAIN, to focus our attention on this important matter. They introduced S. 1255, the ``Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act,'' which proposed making it illegal to register or use any ``Internet domain name or identifier of an online location'' that could be confused with the trademark of another person or cause dilution of a ``famous trademark.'' Violations were punishable by both civil and criminal penalties. 
   I voiced concerns at a hearing before the Judiciary Committee last week that S. 1255 would have a number of unintended consequences that could hurt rather than promote electronic commerce, including the following specific problems: 
   The definition in S. 1255 is overbroad. S. 1255 covers the use or registration of any ``identifier,'' which could cover not just second level domain names, but also e-mail addresses, screen names used in chat rooms, and even files accessible and readable on the Internet. As one witness pointed out, `` the definitions will make every fan a criminal.'' How? A file document about Batman, for example, that uses the trademark ``Batman'' in its name, which also identifies its online location, could land the writer in court under that bill. Cybersquatting is not about file names.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we have another opportunity to proceed to conference on the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill. Or today we can be delayed, again, by those who prefer no action and no conference to moving forward on the issues of juvenile violence and crime. 
   I came to the floor this Monday and last Wednesday to demonstrate the seriousness with which Senate Democrats take the matters included in S. 254, the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill. 
   On Monday the majority leader was able to vitiate the cloture vote that had been scheduled and proceed to take up the House juvenile justice bill, H.R. 1501. He then offered amendment number 1344 to insert the text of S. 254, the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill that passed the Senate after two weeks of open debate and after significant improvements on May 20, by a strong bipartisan vote of 73-25. In so doing, he struck Title VII of the Senate bill, which contained the amendment on the import ban for high capacity ammunition clips. 
   It was this provision that the House used to justify its decision to return S. 254 to the Senate on the ground that it contains what they consider a ``revenue provision'' that did not originate in the House. This, too, is consistent with the unanimous consent request that I first propounded last Wednesday and that the Majority Leader sought last Thursday. 
   I trust that once we obtain cloture on substituting the Senate bill for the House text, which is standard practice before seeking a conference, that the Majority Leader will move to instruct the conferees to reinsert the language that has been omitted from the Senate text to cure the technical objection of the House. That, too, would be consistent with the unanimous consents previously sought. 
   We will then be in position to have the Senate request the long-delayed conference and appoint its conferees. 
   One week ago, I took the extraordinary step of propounding a unanimous consent request to move the Senate to a House-Senate conference. I talked to the Majority Leader and the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in advance of making the unanimous consent request. I noted the history of this measure and the need to move to conference expeditiously if we are to have these programs in place before school resumes in the fall in the course of my colloquy with the Majority Leader last week. 
   Two weeks ago, Republican leaders of the House and Senate were talking about appointing conferees by the end of that week. Instead, they took no action to move us toward a House-Senate conference but, instead, were moving us away from one. By propounding the unanimous consent last week, I was trying on behalf of congressional Democrats, to break the logjam. The unanimous consent would have cured the procedural technicality and would have resulted in the Senate requesting a conference and appointing conferees without further delay. 
   While I regret that Republican objection was made to my request last Wednesday, I thank the majority leader for the steps he is taking. Senate Democrats have been ready to go to conference. Unfortunately, objection from the other side of the aisle has extended the normal process from literally seconds into days and possibly weeks before we can conference this important matter. 
   Today, the Senate takes the second step outlined in my unanimous request, moving toward substituting the Senate bill for the text sent to us by the House. Senators can cooperate in taking the additional steps outlined in my consent request to get to a conference and the Senate could proceed to appoint its conferees and request a conference without further delay, even today. 
   Alternatively, Senators can exercise their procedural rights to obstruct each step of the way and require a series of cloture petitions and votes. I hope that in the interests of school safety and enacting the many worthwhile programs in the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, they will begin to cooperate. The delay is costing us valuable time to get this juvenile justice legislation enacted before school resumes this fall. 
   I spoke to the Senate before the July 4th recess about the need to press forward without delay on this bill. I regret that it is beginning to look like I will be repeating that speech again as we approach the August recess and maybe even into September. 
   I have contrasted the inaction on the juvenile justice bill with the swift movement on providing special legal protections to certain business interests. In just a few months, big business  successfully lobbied for the passage of legislation to protect themselves against any accountability for actions or losses their products may cause to consumers. This week the Senate is moving rather briskly on corporate welfare and other proposals. 
   Some on the other side of the aisle are dragging their feet and now actively obstructing the House and Senate from moving to appoint conferees on the juvenile justice bill that can make a difference in the lives of our children and families. New programs and protections for school children could be in place when school resumes this fall. The Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill is a firm and significant step in the right direction. The passage of this bill shows that when this body rolls up its sleeves and gets to work, we can make significant progress. But that progress will amount to naught if the House and Senate do not conference and proceed to final passage on a good bill. 
   Every parent, teacher and student in this country is concerned this summer about school violence over the last two years and worried about the situation they will confront this fall. Each one of us wants to do something to stop this violence. There is no single cause and no single legislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our schools or in our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to do our part. It is unfortunate that the Senate is not moving full speed ahead to seize this opportunity to act on balanced, effective juvenile justice legislation. 
   I want to be assured that after the hard work we all put into crafting a good juvenile justice bill, that we can go to a House-Senate conference that is fair, full, and productive. We have worked too hard in the Senate for a strong bipartisan juvenile justice bill to simply shrug our shoulders when a narrow minority in the Senate would rather we do nothing. I urge all Senators to work to make today the day that we finally can request the overdue House-Senate conference on the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the real treasures of my State of Vermont are the people who live and  work there. Recently, I had the pleasure of leading a trade mission to Ireland with a group of Vermont business owners seeking strategic business alliances to increase trade and tourism between our state and Ireland. One of the members of the delegation, Beth Kennett, traveled to Ireland with specific goals in mind--to increase tourism from Ireland to Vermont and to learn more about agri-tourism. 
   Beth Kennett is the president of Vermont Farms! as well as a co-owner, along with her husband Bob, of a dairy farm that also serves as a bed and breakfast. On the trip, Mrs. Kennett was hosted by representatives of the agri-tourism industry and visited several agri-tourism farms. She was very enthusiastic throughout her stay and commented later on the diversity of her experiences. She said that one day she found herself wearing Wellies and the next she was meeting the Lord and Lady of the Manor.

   The Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, S. 254, passed the Senate after 2 weeks of open debate and after significant improvements over two months ago, on May 20, by a strong bipartisan vote of 73-25. More than one month ago, on June 17, the House passed its version of juvenile justice legislation but chose not to take up the Senate bill and insert its language, as is standard practice to move Congress toward a conference and final passage of legislation. 
   Instead, what the House did was wait until last week to send the Senate a ``blue slip'' returning S. 254 to the Senate on the ground that it contains what they consider a ``revenue provision'' that did not originate in the House. The provision they point to is the amendment to S. 254 that would amend the federal criminal code to ban the import of high capacity ammunition clips. Whatever the merits of that particular provision--and I will simply say that I did not support it--it appeared to me that the House had resorted to a procedural technicality to avoid a conference on juvenile justice legislation. 
   Two weeks ago, Republican leaders of the House and Senate were talking about appointing conferees by the end of that week. Instead, they took no action to move us toward a House-Senate conference but, instead, were moving us away from one. By propounding the unanimous consent last week, I was trying on behalf of congressional Democrats, to break the logjam. The unanimous consent would have cured the procedural technicality and would have resulted in the Senate requesting a conference and appointing conferees without further delay. 
   While I regret that Republican objection was made to my request last Wednesday, I note that it was repropounded by the Majority Leader the next day. I thank the Majority Leader for that. Unfortunately, even then, objection was made and the process is being extended from literally seconds into days and possibly weeks before we can conference this important matter. 
   Today, the Senate takes the first step outlined in my unanimous request, proceeding to take up the House-passed bill. Senators can cooperate in taking the additional steps outlined in my consent request to get to a conference and the Senate could proceed to appoint its conferees and request a conference without further delay, today. Alternatively, Senators can exercise their procedural rights to obstruct each step of the way and require a series of cloture petitions and votes. I hope that in the interests of school safety and enacting the many worthwhile programs in the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, they will begin to cooperate. The delay is costing us valuable time to get this juvenile justice legislation enacted before school resumes this fall. This is just plain wrong. 
   I spoke to the Senate before the July 4th recess about the need to press forward without delay on this bill. I contrasted the inaction on the juvenile justice bill with the swift movement on providing special legal protections to certain business interests. In just a few months, big business successfully lobbied for the passage of legislation to protection themselves against any accountability for actions or losses their products may cause to consumers. By contrast, some are dragging their feet and now actively obstructing the House and Senate from moving to appoint conferees on the juvenile justice bill that can make a difference in the lives of our children and families. 
   New programs and protections for school children could be in place when school resumes this fall. All of us--whether we are parents, grandparents, teachers, or policy makers are puzzling over the causes of kids turning violent in our country. The root causes are likely multifaceted. Nevertheless, the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill is a firm and significant step in the right direction. The passage of this bill shows that when this body rolls up its sleeves and gets to work, we can make significant progress. But that progress will amount to naught if the House and Senate do not conference and proceed to final passage on a good bill. 
   Every parent, teacher and student in this country is concerned this summer about school violence over the last two years and worried about the situation they will confront this fall. Each one of us wants to do something to stop this violence. There is no single cause and no single legislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our schools or in our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to do our part. It is unfortunate that the Senate is not moving full speed ahead to seize this opportunity to act on balanced, effective juvenile justice legislation. 
   I want to be assured that after the hard work we all put into crafting a good juvenile justice bill, that we can go to a House-Senate conference that is  fair, full, and productive. We have worked too hard in the Senate for a strong bipartisan juvenile justice bill to simply shrug our shoulders when the House returns a juvenile justice bill rather than proceeding to a conference and a narrow minority in the Senate would rather we do nothing. I will be vigilant in working to maintain this bipartisanship and to press for action on this important legislation.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the most significant amendments adopted by the Senate in consideration  of the Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2000 is the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. I commend Senator KENNEDY for his leadership in this effort and on this bill, and I am proud to have been an original cosponsor. This legislation amends the federal hate crimes statute to make it easier for federal law enforcement officials to investigate and prosecute cases of racial and religious violence. It also focuses the attention and resources of the federal government on the problem of hate crimes committed against people because of their sexual preference, gender, or disability. 
   Violent crime motivated by prejudice demands attention from all of us. It is not a new problem, but recent incidents of hate crimes have shocked the American conscience. Just this month, an adherent of a white supremacist group killed two people and wounded nine others in a shooting rampage in Illinois and Indiana that was apparently motivated by racial and religious hate. Billy Jack Gaither, 39, was beaten to death in Alabama because he was gay. Matthew Sheppard, 21, was left to die on a fence in Wyoming because he was gay. James Byrd, Jr., 49, a father of three, was dragged to his death behind a pickup truck in Texas because he was black. These are sensational crimes, the ones that focus public attention. But there also is a toll we are paying each year in other hate crimes that find less notoriety, but with no less suffering for the victims and their families. 
   It remains painfully clear that we as a nation still have serious work to do in protecting all Americans from these crimes and in ensuring equal rights for all our citizens. The answer to hate and bigotry must ultimately be found in increased respect and tolerance. But strengthening our federal hate crimes legislation is a step in the right direction. Bigotry and hatred are corrosive elements in any society, but especially in a country as diverse and open as ours. We need to make clear that a bigoted attack on one or some of us diminishes each of us, and it diminishes our nation. As a nation, we must say loudly and clearly that we will defend ourselves against such violence. 
   All Americans have the right to live, travel and gather where they choose. In the past we have responded as a nation to deter and to punish violent denials of civil rights. We have enacted federal laws to protect the civil rights of all of our citizens for more than 100 years. This continues that great and honorable tradition. 
   Several of us come to this issue with backgrounds in local law enforcement. We support local law enforcement and work for initiatives that assist law enforcement. It is in this vein as well that I support the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which has received strong bipartisan support from state and local law enforcement organizations across the country. 
   The bill has been materially improved since its introduction on March 16th. At that time, I questioned whether the bill was sufficiently respectful of state and local law enforcement interests and cautioned against federalizing prohibitions that may already exist at the state and local level. The Senate-passed bill includes a new certification requirement, which provides that the Federal government may only step in where the State has not assumed jurisdiction, the State has requested that the federal government assume jurisdiction, or the State's actions are likely to leave unvindicated the Federal interest in eradicating bias-motivated violence. I am satisfied that this provision will ensure that the Hate Crimes Prevention Act operates as intended, strengthening Federal jurisdiction over hate crimes as a back-up, but not a substitute, for state and local law enforcement. 
   The Hate Crimes Prevention Act gives us a formidable tool for combating acts of violence motivated by race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or disability. I urge its speedy passage into law.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate has agreed to my amendment to restore funding for the United States Sentencing Commission. I am pleased that Senator KENNEDY joined me as a cosponsor of this amendment in support of the Commission. 
   Our amendment to S. 1217 transfers $5 million from the Bureau of Prisons account to the U.S. Sentencing Commission account. As a result, the Commission will be funded at $9,743,000 for FY 2000 instead of the current level of only $4,743,000. This new funding is an increase of $300,000 compared to the Commission's FY 1999 appropriation of $9,487,000 but still substantially below the President's request of $10,800,000 for the Commission. 
   I understand the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Subcommittee reduced funding for the Commission in part because of their frustration over the vacancy of all seven Commission members since October 31, 1998. I share that frustration, but I am happy to report that the President announced last month his intent to nominate seven highly-qualified individuals to serve as Members of  the Commission--Judge Diana E. Murphy, Judge Ruben Castillo, Judge Sterling Johnson, Jr., Judge Joe Kendall, Professor Michael O'Neill, Judge William K. Sessions, III, and Mr. John R. Steer. I am proud to note that Judge Sessions is a Vermonter and dear friend. 
   The Senate should act promptly to consider and confirm the nominees to the U.S. Sentencing Commission. This Commission has been struggling without a full slate of commissioners for more than a year. We should not only put the Sentencing Commission back into business but we should restore full funding so the Commission is able to fulfill its statutory mandate. 
   The Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations bill had significantly cut funding for the U.S. Sentencing Commission. In reducing funding for this important commission, the Appropriations Subcommittee stated in its report that ``the carriage of justice has continued unabated in the absence of commissioners.'' However, that is in direct contradiction to what the Chief Justice of the United States recently stated in his year-end report for the federal judiciary. He stated, ``the fact that no appointments have been made to fill any one of these seven vacancies is paralyzing a critical component of the federal criminal justice system.'' 
   The Sentencing Commission is such a critical component of the federal criminal justice system because it establishes and maintains mandatory sentencing guidelines for over 51,000 criminal cases sentenced in the federal courts each year. The Commission's most critical responsibility today is to adjust the guidelines to implement the important crime legislation we enact every year. Let me emphasize this point: when we enact legislation that calls for increased criminal penalties, it is the Commission's job to make sure that convicted defendants suffer the impact. With no Commissioners since last year, the Commission has been unable to do this job, nor will it next year without new Commissioners and sufficient funding. 
   Let me give you a few examples of increased penalties we enacted that, to this day, have not caused even one convicted defendant to stay in jail even one more day. Last year, in the Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act, we required increased penalties for heinous sex abuse against our nation's young. To date, not one sexual predator has been imprisoned for even one day longer. Why? Because the Commission cannot do its job. Nor will it next year without new commissioners and sufficient funding. 
   Last year, we also passed legislation that required increased penalties for fraudulent telemarketers who prey upon another vulnerable segment of our population, the elderly. Although the outgoing Commission did enact some temporary measures, they are scheduled to expire this Fall. If they do, fraudulent telemarketers, once again, will escape the intended consequences of our legislation. Why? Because the Commission cannot do its job. Nor will it next year without new Commissioners and sufficient funding. 
   Last Congress, we also passed legislation that required increased penalties for copyright and trademark offenses to protect affected industries from the rampant piracy that threatens job creation and continued economic growth. Once again, not one convicted offender has suffered any increased punishment. Why? Because the Commission cannot do its job. Nor will it next year without new Commissioners and sufficient funding. 
   So long as the Commission cannot do its job, convicted defendants will also escape the impact of criminal laws we have enacted to combat other serious crimes: methamphetamine trafficking, firearms, phone cloning, and identity theft, just to name a few. 
   Recently, the Senate approved the juvenile justice legislation, S. 254, that would require the Sentencing Commission to develop comprehensive guidelines for juvenile offenders, so that we can stem the rising tide of juvenile crime. How can the Commission accomplish this vital and historic undertaking without Commissioners and sufficient funding? 
   We face other unintended, and potentially very costly, consequences of not getting the Commission fully operational soon. I understand that defendants across the country are beginning to mount challenges to the legality of the guidelines in the absence of Commissioners. Regardless of the merits, one can only imagine the paralyzing effects on the criminal justice system if 51,000 defendants start raising this issue. There are better ways to spend limited judicial and prosecutorial resources in fighting crime and enforcing the law than in defending against these claims. 
   Even in the absence of Commissioners, we should ensure that the Commission is fully funded so that the staff of the Commission may continue to perform its important work. The Commission has an ongoing statutory obligation to amend the sentencing guidelines as necessary to respond to enacted crime legislation, court decisions, and other developments coming to its attention. While the Commission cannot vote to promulgate amendments to the guidelines without commissioners, even in their absence it is essential that Commission staff systematically continue to prepare all supporting material necessary so that incoming commissioners may act to implement the will of Congress in short order. 
   Apart from the policy decision-making that only Commissioners may perform, the Commission has numerous routine statutory obligations on which Commission staff typically take the lead even when there is a complete slate of Commissioners. The Commission has an ongoing statutory obligation to receive--and federal judges have a corresponding statutory obligation to send--a report from the sentencing court with respect to every sentence imposed under the guidelines, to analyze and share the data in those reports, and use that data to improve the guideline system. Commission staff analyze and enter into our comprehensive database over 50,000 of such cases and extract more than 260 pieces of information from each case annually. Next year, more than 50,000 cases that contain valuable information regarding sentencing practices, offenders, and deterrence will go without analysis if the Commission is not sufficiently funded for fiscal year 2000. 
   The Commission also has an ongoing statutory obligation to serve as the lead instrumentality for training newly appointed judges and probation officers, as well as prosecuting and defense attorneys, regarding application of the sentencing guidelines and related sentencing issues. Similarly, the Commission has an ongoing responsibility to provide needed continuing education for all those who use the sentencing guidelines to ensure that they are sufficiently informed of recent amendments to the guidelines and significant court decisions. Commission staff served as lead trainers to more than 2,500 individuals at 47 training programs across the country in fiscal year 1998. Next year, this need for training will go unmet if the Commission is not sufficiently funded for fiscal year 2000. 
   The Commission also has an ongoing statutory obligation to serve as a clearinghouse of information on sentencing-related topics and to stay current on advancements in the knowledge of human behavior and the degree to which the guidelines are achieving the purposes of sentencing such as deterrence and rehabilitation. Ongoing research on important topics such as federal sentencing for crimes involving firearms, associations between federal appellate decisions and offender race, trends in sentences and offender characteristics in drug trafficking cases, and differing sentencing practices of federal immigration offenders by judicial district will not be completed if the Commission is not sufficiently funded for fiscal year 2000. 
   Finally, I would like to emphasize what the Chief Justice said. If we are going to have guidelines and require federal judges to impose guideline sentences, the Sentencing Commission must be empowered to do its work. And that means it needs both Commissioners and sufficient funding to fulfill its critical role in the federal criminal justice system. 
   I appreciate the support of my colleagues to restore funding for the U.S. Sentencing Commission for the next fiscal year.

I notified the distinguished majority leader that I would be doing this earlier, and a day ago I also notified the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I do it not in expectation the unanimous consent request will be agreed to but to, I hope, move this ball down the field. 
   So my request is this: I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 1501, the House juvenile justice bill; that all after the enacting clause be stricken, and that the text of S. 254, as passed by the Senate, minus the provision added by Senator FEINSTEIN's amendment No. 343, as modified, be inserted in lieu thereof; the bill be passed, as amended; the Senate insist on its amendment and request a conference with the House; that the conferees be instructed to include in the conference report the provision added by Senator 
   FEINSTEIN's amendment No. 343 to S. 254; and that the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the explanation of the distinguished majority leader. He and I had discussed this earlier. I anticipated both the objection and the explanation. 
   I fully concur that such a unanimous consent request would normally be made by the leadership, but it is also the reason I notified both the distinguished majority leader and the distinguished Democratic leader that I would do this. I had expressed my concern, actually, before the Fourth of July recess, how the Congress is able to move legislation and move it quickly if the right interests want it. I compared the priority being put on two separate pieces of legislation, S. 254, the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, and H.R. 775, the Y2K Act, to show how this works. 
   The Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, S. 254, passed the Senate after 2 weeks of open debate, after significant improvements, on May 20. That was a vote, as I recall, of 73-25, a bipartisan vote. On June 17, the House passed its version of this legislation but chose not to take up the Senate bill and insert its language, as is standard practice. Nor has the Republican leadership in the House made any effort over the past month to seek a House-Senate conference or to appoint House conferees. 
   Instead, what the other body did was send the Senate a blue slip, returning S. 254 to the Senate on the ground it contained a revenue provision that must originate in the House. The provision they point to is the amendment to S. 254 that would amend the Federal Criminal Code to ban the import of high-capacity ammunition clips. Whatever the merits are of that particular provision, the majority thought that did have merit. I voted against it. But it appears to me that no matter which side one is on, the House resorted to a procedural technicality to avoid a conference on juvenile justice legislation. 
   The amendment is in the final bill which a majority of us, three-quarters of us, voted for. The Senate has so far taken no steps to proceed to conference on the juvenile justice bill or to appoint conferees. This delay costs valuable time to get the juvenile justice legislation enacted before school resumes this fall. 
   I appreciate the words of the distinguished majority leader that we will try to move quickly to it, but I mention this as a contrast to the pace of action on the juvenile justice bill when we look at the Y2K Act. That legislation provided special legal protections to businesses. After earlier action in the House on H.R. 775, the Y2K liability limitations bill, the bill passed the Senate on June 15, almost 1 month after we passed the juvenile justice bill. On June 16, the next day, the Senate asked for a House-Senate conference and appointed its conferees. The House agreed to the conference and appointed its own conferees. The legislation immediately went to conference. The conference met that same day, on June 24. After a weekend break for extensive negotiations with the administration, the conference report was filed on June 29. The bill was taken up, passed before the Fourth of July recess, and the President signed it yesterday. 
   Now, this took care of the potential liability of a lot of businesses under Y2K, some found it at the expense of American consumers, but whichever way it was, it become law very quickly. 
   The juvenile justice bill can make a difference in the lives of our children and families. That should be our No. 1 priority, so that we get the conference, conclude it, and so that new programs and protections for schoolchildren can be in place when school resumes this fall, and not wait until this fall to do it. A lot of the programs in here are designed to be available to schools when they come in.

   Mr. LEAHY. The distinguished senior Senator from Illinois raises a valid point. This bill is designed, very substantive parts of it, for programs that we in the Senate debated and I think the American public are in support of and thought should be in place before our children go back to school this fall. This prompt action is what parents have talked to me about it, what school administrators have talked to me about it--that they need to have it in place before the schoolchildren go back this fall. They want to pass into law the things we learned from Columbine and other school tragedies. 
   That means we have a very short window, I think about 3 weeks, to finish this before the August recess. We have a very short window. If we don't finish this before the August recess and get it on the President's desk, I don't know how these programs will be in place. 
   Frankly, a lot has changed since my children were young enough to be in those classes. It may have been growing then, but the demand is paramount today. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely right. If we don't do it now, we are not going to get it done on time.

I recall the Senator from New York and I, when he served in the other body, on a major crime bill, sitting there until 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning, breaking for 45 minutes while we grabbed some breakfast, and going right back in around the clock again.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on the juvenile justice bill, the reason why I have encouraged the leadership to move as quickly as they are able to--and I say, in regard to what the distinguished Senator from Mississippi said earlier, I also know if he were to make the same request I made, he could face an objection. What I am urging is that we find a way to move forward because to have the full impact in the United States of our juvenile justice bill, which passed by a 3-to-1 margin in the Senate, we have to get it on the President's desk in its final form before the August recess so there is some chance of moving before school goes back in this fall. All of us, whether we are parents, grandparents, teachers, or policymakers, have been puzzling over the causes of children turning violent in our country. 
   Certainly all of us in our lifetimes have seen random acts of violence somewhere in the country. I don't think any of us have seen the severity or the number, almost a regularity, of violence we are seeing today. The root causes are likely multifaceted, and we know that. But the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill is a firm and significant step in the right direction. Passage of this bill shows when the Senate rolls up its sleeves and gets to work, we can make significant progress. But that progress amounts to naught if the House and Senate do not conference and proceed to final passage on a good bill. 
   Once conferees are appointed, there will be another point in the legislative process where we will have to roll up our sleeves to work out differences between the House- and Senate-passed legislation. 
   Every parent in this country is concerned this summer about school violence over the last 2 years. They are worried about the situation they are going to confront this fall. Each of us wants to do something to stop that violence. There is no single cause and there is no single legislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our schools or on our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to at least start to do something, to do our part. Now, it is unfortunate we are not moving full speed ahead to seize this opportunity to act on balanced, effective juvenile justice legislation. 
   We should not repeat the delays that happened in the last Congress on the juvenile justice legislation. In the 105th Congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported juvenile justice legislation in July 1997, but then it was left to languish for over a year until the very end of that Congress. In fact, serious efforts to make improvements to this bill did not even occur until the last weeks of that Congress, when it was too late and we ran out of time.  
   The experience of the last Congress causes me to be wary of this delay in action on this legislation this year. I want to be assured that after the hard work so many Senators put into crafting a juvenile justice bill, that we go to a House-Senate conference that is fair, full, and productive. We have worked too hard in the Senate for a strong, bipartisan juvenile justice bill to simply shrug our shoulders when the House returns a juvenile justice bill rather than proceeding to a conference. I will be vigilant in working to maintain this bipartisanship and to press for action on this important legislation. 
   To this end, I circulated yesterday to the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee the unanimous consent request that I made. It lays out a simple road map for us to proceed to a juvenile justice conference before the August recess and before the new school year begins. I understand the unanimous consent request cannot be accepted tonight, but if we could accept this, or a form of it, this is what it would do: 
   We would take up the House juvenile justice bill, H.R. 1501; we would substitute the Hatch-Leahy bill, S. 254, amended to eliminate the provision banning the import of high-capacity ammunition clips; pass the bill as amended; request a conference with the House; instruct the conferees to include in the conference report the eliminated provision on high-capacity ammunition clips--put it back in, because parliamentarily it would be allowed--and we would authorize the Chair to appoint conferees. 
   The fact that the House returned the Senate juvenile justice bill to us is not an insurmountable obstacle to get to conference on this important issue. This unanimous consent--or a form of it--would lay out a simple procedure for us to get to conference promptly, and the majority has the power to say: We agree, let's go to conference. 
   We know only too well that when it is something that has the commercial interests of Y2K liability protection, we can go over what seem to be insurmountable obstacles and enact legislation into law. 
   There is no commercial interest. There is certainly far more. It is the safety of our children. It is allowing our children to have a youth. It is allowing our children to go to school, as we did, in safety. It is allowing our children to learn, to be young people, and not to be forced to grow up in violence. 
   It is a gift we could give to the children of America. It is something we could do before they go back to school. It is something we should do.

   Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from California is correct. We have moved very quickly on it. I hope we do not run into the situation that happened last year. We spent a lot of time on the juvenile justice bill, and then it languished and languished after coming out of committee. It sat so long that by the time we got to it, the time of the session ran out. In fact, the end of the Congress ran out. 
   Here we are not right at the end of a Congress, but we are facing a school year, and we should begin. 
   I promised the distinguished senior Senator from New Hampshire that I would wrap up. I believe I have wrapped up.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today in communities all around the country and here at the United States Capitol, Asian Pacific Americans are leading all Americans in a demonstration of our commitment to one America, equal opportunity and equal justice under law by urging the Senate to vote on the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to head the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice. I hear the call of the Congressional Asian Pacific Caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus for prompt Senate consideration and a vote on this highly-qualified nominee and dedicated public servant. I commend the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans and their Chair Daphne Kwok, the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association and the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium for their leadership in connection with this matter and their commitment to fundamental fairness. 
   Today is the second anniversary of the initial nomination of Bill Lann Lee to the office of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. I repeat today what I have said before: It is past time to do the right thing, the honorable thing, and report this qualified nominee to the Senate so that the Senate may fulfill its constitutional duty under the advice and consent clause and vote on this nomination without further delay. Two years is too long to wait for Senate action on this important nomination. 
   Yesterday, I was privileged to attend a meeting with the President of the United States in the East Room of the White House in which he issued a challenge to the lawyers of our country to rededicate themselves to help build one America and realize the American dream of equality for all under the law. What kind of message is the Senate sending when it refuses to act on the nomination of this outstanding Asian Pacific American? 
   After Bill Lann Lee graduated from Yale and then Columbia Law School he could have spent his career in the comfort and affluence of any one of the nation's top law firms. He chose, instead, to spend his career on the front lines, helping to open the doors of opportunity to those who struggle in our society. His is an American story. The son of immigrants whose success can be celebrated by all Americans. 
   In my view, Bill Lann Lee should be commended for the years he worked to provide legal services and access to our justice system for those without the financial resources otherwise to retain counsel. His work should be a source of pride and a basis for praise. His career should be a model for those who take up the challenge that the President enunciated yesterday to lawyers across this country. I say that Bill Lann Lee represented the best of the legal profession while serving those without means. 
   It appears that some on the Republican side want to hold the Lee nomination as a partisan trophy--to kill it through obstruction and delay rather than allowing the Senate to vote up or down on the nomination. This effort started with a letter from the former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, to the Republican Majority Leader of the Senate in 1997. Over the ensuing weekend progress toward confirmation of this nomination ground to a halt. Speaker Gingrich is gone but the disastrous consequence of his unjustified opposition to this nomination lingers. It is past time to put past injustice to rest. As speaker after speaker reiterated today across the country, it is time for the Senate to vote on the nomination of Bill Lann Lee. 
   Bill Lann Lee's skills, his experience, the compelling personal journey that he and his family have traveled, his commitment to full opportunity for all Americans--these qualities appeal to the best in us. Let us affirm the best in us. Let the Senate vote on the confirmation of this good man. We need Bill Lann Lee's proven problem-solving abilities in these difficult times with apparent hate crimes on the rise 
   across the country. He is spearheading efforts against hate crimes, against modern slavery and for equal justice for all Americans. 
   If the Senate is allowed to decide, I believe he will be confirmed and will move this country forward to a time when discrimination will subside and affirmative action is no longer needed; a time when each child-- girl or boy, black or white, rich or poor, urban or rural, regardless of national or ethnic origin and regardless of sexual orientation or disability--shall have a fair and equal opportunity to live the American dream. 
   Earlier this year Congress voted to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Mrs. Rosa Parks. I heard Mrs. Parks, Reverend Jackson and the President each take the occasion to remind us that the struggle for equality is not over. 
   I will ask the Judiciary Committee again tomorrow, in the spirit of fairness, that the Committee recognize the 18-month stewardship of the Civil Rights Division of Bill Lann Lee, his qualifications, and his quiet dignity and strength and send his nomination to the full Senate so that the United States Senate may, at long last, vote on that nomination and, I hope, confirm this fine American to full rank as the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. 
   When confirmed Bill Lann Lee will be the first Asian Pacific American to be appointed to head the Civil Rights Division in its storied history and the highest ranking Federal Executive officer of Asian Pacific American heritage in our 200-year history. 
   I have previously brought to all Senators' attention a June letter from the Assistant Attorneys General for Civil Rights from the Eisenhower through Bush Administrations in support of this outstanding nominee: Harold Tyler, Burke Marshall, Stephen J. Pollak, J. Stanley Pottinger, Drew Days and John R. Dunne note in their letter:  
   Over the past eighteen months, Mr. Lee has shown that he honors the Civil Rights Division's mission to safeguard equal justice for all. He has enforced the nation's civil rights laws fairly and effectively. He has demonstrated that he can and will meet the demands of the position with distinction and thus merits the Senate's confidence.  
   Civil Rights is about human dignity and opportunity. Bill Lann Lee ought to have an up or down confirmation vote on the Senate floor. The Senate should fulfill its constitutional duty under the advice and consent clause and vote on this nomination. Twenty-four months and three sessions of Congress is too long for this nomination to have to wait. He should no longer be forced to ride in the back on the nominations bus but be given the fair vote that he deserves. 
   I have often referred to the Senate as acting at its best when it serves as the conscience of the nation. I call on the Judiciary Committee and the Senate to bring this nomination to the floor for an up or down vote without obstruction or further delay so that the Senate may vote and we may confirm a dedicated public servant to lead the Civil Rights Division into the next century. Racial discrimination, and harmful discrimination in all its forms, remain among the most vexing unsolved problems of our society. Let the Senate move forward from the ceremonial commemorations earlier this year by doing what is right and voting on the nomination of Bill Lann Lee.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am voting in support of Senate Joint Resolution 27 which would disapprove normal trade relations treatment to products produced in the People's Republic of China. I do so not because I do not want to see normal trade relations with China. Rather, it is because I do not believe the Chinese Government deserves this treatment until it ceases its brutal repression of Tibetans and others who support democracy. 
   But there is a more specific concern I have about the fate of one individual, which has caused me to support this Resolution. 
   For over 3 years people from around the world and all walks of life have sought the release of and information about Mr. Ngawang Choephel, a Tibetan who studied ethnomusicology at Middlebury College in Vermont on a Fulbright Scholarship. On December 26, 1996, after detaining him incommunicado for months, Chinese authorities sentenced Mr. Choephel to 18 years in prison for espionage. His crime? Making a documentary film about Tibetan music and dance. 
   Since his arrest, Mr. Choephel's mother, Ms. Sonam Dekyi, has been actively seeking his release, as well as permission from the Chinese Government to travel to Tibet to visit her son. Although Ms. Dekyi has tried repeatedly to obtain a visa from the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi and written to the Chinese Prison Administration's Direct General about her request, Chinese authorities falsely deny knowledge of her request. 
   United States officials have raised Mr. Choephel with the Chinese Government at the highest levels. I have twice discussed my concerns with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, once in Beijing and again in Washington. I asked him to personally review Mr. Choephel's case. I and other Members of Congress have written many letters to Chinese officials on Mr. Choephel's and his mother's behalf. I have tried to discuss his case with Chinese authorities here in Washington, DC, as has my staff. What has been the response? Deliberate and utter disregard of my inquiries. 
   Mr. President, until the Chinese Government provides satisfactory answers to my questions about Mr. Choephel's whereabouts, his health, the reasons for his incarceration and the evidence against him, and permits his mother to visit him as she is entitled to, I cannot in good conscience vote for normal trade relations with China.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are coming to the close of a vital debate, and I do not use that word casually. The issues we are voting on in some cases have life and death consequences for the people we were elected to represent. 
   The individual rights spelled out in our Patients' Bill of Rights are clear, and they are specific. They are strong, and they would work. They have been painstakingly drafted and redrafted and then further refined for more than a year. 
   They have the support of hundreds of medical and consumer organizations whose millions of members work directly in this field. They would achieve for patients the very rights that our constituents have repeatedly signaled that they want and need and deserve in this age of managed health care. 
   We have offered the Patients' Bill of Rights, point by point, reform by reform. In response, senators on the Republican side of the aisle have cobbled together weak or illusory copies of these reforms, offered them in place of the real thing, and hoped that nobody outside this Chamber would notice the differences. 
   We have seen this happen with access to emergency case, with a woman's access to an OB/GYN and with a patient's access to specialists. 
   This flurry of amendments, mixing genuine rights for patients and the phantom versions from the other side, has obscurred some of these issues in a cloud of political dust. Tonight, with the final votes of this debate, that cloud will be lifted. Senators will decide whether they will stand with patients and their doctors, or with the insurance companies. 
   Senators will decide whether 161 million Americans can enjoy the protections of the Patients' Bill of Rights, or whether 113 million Americans will be left in the waiting room. 
   There are many key differences between the Patients' Bill of Rights and the fall-back plan that Republican leaders have come up with. But the most important differences are that our bill would cover everyone, our bill lets doctors make the medical decisions, and our plan holds plans accountable to take away incentives to minimize critical health care decisions that can hurt or kill people. 
   Just this morning, we have heard the Republicans attempt to justify why it is okay to protect HMO's from accountability for their decisions that lead to injury or death. Polls show that the public overwhelmingly supports the key elements of our Patients' Bill of Rights. Americans--the people that Democrats and Republicans alike say we are trying to protect--want the protections the Democratic plan offers. 
   I have heard from many Vermonters on their experiences with managed care. Each of these moving stories makes you ask: What if it was me, or someone I knew? 
   When I was home in Vermont last week, I picked up the Burlington Free Press and, beside a guest column he had written, was met with the friendly face of an old friend, Dr. Charles Houston. He and I go way back to my days as a prosecutor in Burlington when he was a prominent physician doing remarkable things in the Vermont medical community. He has been a beacon of good advice to me throughout my time in the Senate. He is an indispensable Vermonter. 
   Dr. Houston's commentary depicted the devastating and tragic experience  he and his wife had with their managed care company that ultimately led to his wife's death. 
   My wife is a registered nurse, so I get a dose of the practical reality of these problems across the breakfast table, as well as from the accounts I get from Vermonters. It is these personal accounts, like this one from Charlie, that bring home the need for a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent that Dr. Charles Houston's article be entered into the RECORD. 
   Mr. President, the question today is this: Will the Senate pass a bill that protects everyone--161 million Americans who get their health care through a managed care program--or just a fraction of those families, the 48 million who are in employer self-funded plans? Will we continue to hear and read stories from the people in our states who have no protections? Will we continue to hear accounts like the tragic one of Charlie Houston's wife? I hope not. 
   The President has indicated that he would veto a so-called Patients' Bill of Rights if all we send him is one containing the weak Republican provisions. 
   Maybe then we can rescue those millions of Americans the Senate today has stranded in the waiting room without a real patients' Bill of Rights.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week marks the 25th Anniversary of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. I had hoped as part of celebrating the silver anniversary of the passage of this landmark legislation that the Congress would be sending to President Clinton for signature, S. 249, the Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children Protection Act. This legislation reauthorizes programs under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act as well as authorizes funding for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Both programs are critical to our nation's youth and to our nation's well-being. 
   Unfortunately, the bill is still being held up for no good reason. I have been working since 1996 to enact this legislation. Last Congress and again this Congress, we have been able to clear the passage of this important legislation on the Democratic side of the aisle. 
   I had hoped that by the end of this week my colleagues on the other side of the aisle could be persuaded to let this legislation pass the Senate and President Clinton sign it into law. The many grassroots supporters of this legislation and I remain frustrated. 
   If we do not pass this legislation soon, I fear it will again, as it was last Congress, be caught up in a more contentious debate on juvenile crime. 
   I had hoped that we had been able to move away from using this noncontroversial legislation to try to pass unreasonable juvenile justice legislation. Last Congress, the Majority was roundly criticized for its tactic, which the New York Times labeled a ``stealth assault on juvenile justice.'' That procedural gimmick cost us valuable time to get this legislation enacted. 
   This year, it appeared that such procedural ambushes had been avoided in the Senate and minimized in the House. In late May, the Senate had a full and fair debate on a juvenile justice bill. After significant improvements through amendments, the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill passed the Senate on May 20, 1999 by a strong bipartisan vote. The House finally considered juvenile crime legislation in June, although the Republican leadership has steadfastly blocked a House-Senate conference on the Hatch-Leahy bill. 
   Separately, in April of this year the Senate passed S. 249, the Missing, Exploited and Runaway Children Protection Act of 1999. In May, the House passed S.249 with an amendment. As I explained in a floor statement on June 30, I was hopeful that the Senate would immediately take up and pass the amended version of S.249 and worked to do that. I consulted with the Department of Health and Human Services about certain concerns I had with the House amendment and was reassured that Vermont would not be adversely affected by it. I noted my disagreement with other aspects of the House action and ways to deal with those without holding final passage of S.249 hostage. I regret to report, however, that this important legislation has been in Senate limbo since late May. 
   The guts of the legislation remain the Leahy-Hatch substitute language to S.249 that was reported by the Judiciary Committee and which passed the Senate in April. We were careful to recognize the important work of these programs in Vermont, as well as the many other programs and staff across the U.S. that are working effectively with runaway and homeless youth and their families. The House-inserted amendments do nothing to change the special care we took in the Senate to craft the main components of this legislation. 
   The Leahy-Hatch substitute language preserves current law governing the minimum grants available for small States for the Basic Center grants and also preserves the current confidentiality and records protections for runaway and homeless youth. 
   In addition, our substitute amendment reauthorizes the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act Rural Demonstration Projects. This program provides targeted assistance to States with rural juvenile populations. Programs serving runaway and homeless youth have found that those in rural areas are particularly difficult to reach and serve effectively. 
   Under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, every year each State is awarded a Basic Center grant for housing and crisis services for runaway and homeless children and their families. The funding is based on its juvenile population, with a minimum grant of $100,000 currently awarded to smaller States, such as Vermont. Effective community-based programs around the country can also apply directly for the funding available for the Transitional Living Program and the Sexual Abuse Prevention/Street Outreach grants. The Transitional Living Program grants are used to provide longer term housing to homeless teens age 16 to 21, and to help these teenagers become more self-sufficient. The Sexual Abuse Prevention/Street Outreach Program also targets teens who have engaged in or are at risk of engaging in high risk behaviors while living on the street. 
   The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act does more than shelter these children in need. As the National Network for Youth has stressed, the Act's programs ``provide critical assistance to youth in high-risk situations all over the country.'' This Act also ensures that these children and their families have access to important services, such as individual, family or group counseling, alcohol and drug counseling and a myriad of other resources to help these young people and their families get back on track. 
   Runaway and Homeless Youth Services in Vermont show positive results. For those who do not think rural areas have significant numbers of runaway youth, I note that in fiscal year 1998, the Vermont Coalition of Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs and Spectrum Youth & Family Services (``the Coalition''), reported that 81 percent of the 1,067 youths served by the Coalition programs were in a positive living situation at the close of service. They were reunited with their families, living with a friend or relative, or in another appropriate living situation. They were not in Department of Corrections or State Rehabilitative Services (SRS) custody. 
   Since 1992, the Coalition programs have seen a 175 percent increase in the numbers of youths served: The Coalition programs served 388 runaway and  homeless youths in 1992. This number increased to 1,067 in 1997. In 1998, 61 percent of the youths served were 15, 16 or 17 years old. 
   The Coalition programs are the ``who you gonna' call'' in cases of family crisis and runaway incidents. They are a critical part of Vermont's ability to respond pro-actively when youths and 
   families are in crisis, and to prevent the need for later, more costly services. 
   The Coalition average cost per client in fiscal year 1998 was $1,471. Each client has different needs which could mean a week of service, a month, or the entire year. The service could include housing, family counseling, or any of the array of services offered the Coalition programs. The average time a case was open in fiscal year 1998 was 54 days. 
   The relative costs of various services available to youths experiencing problems frequently associated with runaway and ``push-out'' incidents and other serious family conflict is dramatically higher. For fiscal year 1998, the costs for a bed in Vermont's Juvenile Detention system was over $69,000; a bed in a in-patient adolescent substance abuse treatment facility was over $54,000. 
   The Vermont Coalition programs provide early interventions that are more humane, and more cost effective. When one youth is diverted from entering state custody, the state of Vermont saves $19,761. If 102 young people, or 9 percent of the 1,067 youths served in fiscal year 1998, were diverted from entering SRS Custody, then Vermont saves over $2,000,000--four times the amount of dollars Vermont currently receives under the RHYA for service to runaway and homeless youths. 
   The Vermont Coalition and Spectrum Youth & Family Services should be applauded for their important work and I believe the best way to do that is to reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Act, so programs like these in Vermont have some greater financial security in the future. 
   I want to thank the many advocates who have worked with me over the years to improve the bill and, in particular, the dedicated members of the Vermont Coalition of Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs and the National Network for Youth for their suggestions and assistance. Without these dedicated public-spirited citizens these programs could not be successful. 
   The other important piece of S. 249 is authorizing the nation's resource center for child protection, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). This center spearheads national efforts to locate and recover missing children and raises public awareness about ways to prevent child abduction, molestation, and sexual exploitation. 
   Since 1984, when the center was established, it has handled more than 1.3 million calls through its national Hotline 1-800-THE-LOST; trained more than 151,755 police and other professionals; and published more than 17 million publications that are distributed free of charge. The center has worked with law enforcement on more than 65,173 missing child cases, resulting in the recovery of 46,031 children. 
   Since its creation, the center has helped 83 Vermont missing child cases and has helped resolve 82 of them. Nationwide, prior to 1990, the child recovery rate of the center was 62 percent. From 1990 through 1998, even with increasing caseloads, the recovery of children that are reported to the center has reached 91.8 percent. 
   Last year, the center launched a new CyberTipline. It allows Internet users to report such things as suspicious or illegal activity, including child pornography and online enticement of children for sexual exploitation. 
   Each month NCMEC brings chiefs and sheriffs together for special training. To date, the center has trained 728 of these law enforcement officials from all fifty states, including chiefs from Dover, Hartford, Brattleboro, and Winooski, Vermont and representatives from our State Police force. 
   The center also trains state and local police on crimes against children in cyberspace. Although this program has just begun, already 103 Unit Commanders from 34 states, including Vermont have been trained. In February of this year, Captain David Rich of the Hartford, Vermont Police Department attended this course. 
   The NCMEC trainers conducted a statewide infant abduction prevention seminar for the Vermont Chapter of the Association of the Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses, attended by 252 nurses and security staff, and conducted site audits at two Vermont hospitals. 
   I applaud the ongoing work of the Center and hope that the Senate will promptly pass this bill so that they can proceed with their important activities with fewer funding concerns. 
   Mr. President, S. 249, the Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children Protection Act, should be passed without further delay.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the recent events in Kosovo have been a graphic reminder that crimes against humanity did not end with the Second World War. Our treatment of those persecuted by the Nazis has long been regarded as a travesty. Blatant American anti-Semitism led to post-war immigration quotas that virtually shut out Jews coming from concentration camps while embracing German sympathizers. 
   In contrast to this country's dismal record in accepting Jewish refugees following the last world war, the United States has tried harder and done better in recent years to provide refuge to those persons fleeing homelands that have been ravaged by violence. For example, over the past five years, approximately 83,247 Bosnian refugees have been admitted to this country. During the latest hostilities in Kosovo, the Clinton Administration provided leadership to other nations by pledging  to take in as many as 20,000 Kosovar refugees. 
   Unfortunately, criminals who wielded machetes and guns against innocent civilians in countries like Haiti, Yugoslavia and Rwanda have been able to gain entry to the United States through the same doors that we have opened to deserving refugees. We need to lock that door to those war criminals who seek a safe haven in the United States. And to those war criminals who are already here, we should promptly show them the door out. 
   Our country has long provided the template and moral leadership for dealing with Nazi war criminals. The Justice Department has a specialized unit, the Offfice of Special Investigations (OSI), which was created to hunt down, prosecute and remove Nazi war criminals who had slipped into the United States among their victims under the Displaced Persons Act. Since the OSI's inception in 1979, 61 Nazi persecutors have been stripped of U.S. citizenship, 49 such individuals have been removed from the United States, and more than 150 have been denied entry. 
   OSI was created almost 35 years after the end of World War II and it remains authorized only to track Nazi war criminals. Little is being done about the new generation of international war criminals living among us, and these delays are costly. As any prosecutor--or, in my case, former prosecutor--knows instinctively, such delays make documentary and testimonial evidence more difficult to obtain. Stale cases are the hardest to make. 
   We should not repeat the mistake of waiting decades before tracking down war criminals and human rights abusers who have settled in this country. War criminals should find no sanctuary in loopholes in our current immigration policies and enforcement. No war criminal 
   should ever come to believe that he is going to find safe harbor in the United States. 
   Too often, once war criminals slip through the immigration nets, they remain in the United States, unpunished for their crimes. In Vermont, news reports indicate that a Bosnian-Muslim man suspected of participating in ethnic cleansing during the Serbian war now is in Burlington. He has been identified by many people, including his own relatives, as a member of a Serbian paramilitary group responsible for the torture, rape, and murder of countless innocent people. We see the possibility that refugees now may encounter their persecutors thousands of miles away from their homeland, walking the streets of America. 
   This is not an isolated occurrence. The center for Justice and Accountability, a San Francisco human rights group, has identified approximately sixty suspected human rights violators now living in the United States. We have unwittingly sheltered the oppressors along with the oppressed for too long. We should not let this situation continue. We waited too long after the last world war to focus prosecutorial resources and attention on Nazi war criminals who entered this country on false pretenses. We should not repeat that mistake for other aliens who engaged in human rights abuses before coming to the United States. We need to focus the attention of our law enforcement investigators to prosecute and deport those who have committed atrocities abroad and who now enjoy safe harbor in the United States. 
   Despite U.S. ratification of the United Nations' ``Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,'' current immigration law provides that those who participated in Nazi war crimes and genocide are inadmissible to and are removable from the United States, yet those who have committed the criminal act of torture are not. This leads to cases like that of Kelbessa Negewo, a member of the military dictatorship ruling Ethiopia in the 1970s, who has been found guilty of torture in a private civil action by an American court but who remains in the United States nonetheless because the Immigration and Naturalization Act does not provide explicit authority to investigate, denaturalize or remove him. The Leahy ``Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act'' would close this loophole and make those who commit torture abroad inadmissible to and deportable from our country. 
   The ``Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act,'' which I introduce today with Senator KOHL, would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to expand the grounds for inadmissibility and deportation to cover aliens who have engaged in acts of torture abroad. ``Torture'' is already defined in the Federal criminal code, 18 U.S.C. &#167;2340, in a law passed as part of the implementing legislation for the ``Convention Against Torture.'' Under this Convention, the United States has an affirmative duty to prosecute torturers within its boundaries regardless of their respective nationalities. 18 U.S.C. &#167;2340A (1994). 
   This legislation would also provide statutory authorization for OSI, which currently owes its existence to an Attorney General order, and would expand its jurisdiction to authorize investigations, prosecutions, and removal of any alien who participated in torture and genocide abroad--not just Nazis. The success of OSI is hunting Nazi war criminals demonstrates the effectiveness of centralized resources and expertise in these cases. OSI has worked, and it is time to update its mission. 
   The knowledge of the people, politics and pathologies of particular regimes engaged in genocide and human rights abuses is often necessary for effective prosecutions of these cases and may best be accomplished by the concentrated efforts of a single office, rather than in piecemeal litigation around the country or in offices that have more diverse missions. 
   Unquestionably, the need to bring Nazi war criminals to justice remains a matter of great importance. Funds would not be derived from the OSI's current mission. Additional resources are authorized in the bill for OSI's expanded duties. 
   I have for many years sought to advance the search for war criminals who have clandestinely immigrated to our country. In 1996, the moving testimony of esteemed individuals like Rabbi Marvin Hier (the dean and founder of the Simon Wisenthal Center) led me to work closely on the drafting of the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act. More recently, I helped to ensure that the OSI would be able to further its efforts in investigating and denaturalizing Nazi war criminals with a budget increase of two million dollars for 1999, and I am attempting to do the same for the Year 2000. 
   I have also supported a strong and effective War Crimes Tribunal--with the necessary funds and authority to fully apprehend and prosecute war criminals. Expanding the mission of OSI, combined with a vigorous War Crimes Tribunal, represents a full-scale, two-prong assault on war criminals, wherever they may hide. 
   We must honor and respect the unique experiences of those who were victims in the darkest moment in world history. The Anti-Defamation League has expressed its support for my bill. We may help honor the memories of the victims of the Holocaust by pursuing all war criminals who enter our country. By so doing, the United States can provide moral leadership and show that we will not tolerate perpetrators of genocide and torture, least of all here. 
   In sum, the Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act would: 
   Bar admission into the United States and authorize the deportation of aliens who have engaged in acts of torture abroad. 
   Provide statutory authorization for and expand the jurisdiction of the Office of Special Investigations (so-called ``Nazi war criminal hunters'') with the Department of Justice to investigate, prosecute and remove any alien who participated in torture and genocide abroad--not just Nazis; and 
   Authorize additional funding to ensure that OSI has adequate resources to fulfill its current mission of hunting Nazi war criminals.

   Mr. LEAHY. I thank my friend from Wyoming. 
   Mr. President, I know there are going to be more statements made afterward. We have just confirmed Robert Katzmann, of New York, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Second Circuit. This is to replace the very distinguished and former chief justice of the Second Circuit, Jon Newman, who has retired, or has taken senior status. I cannot say he is retired. I know how hard Judge Newman continues to work. I get reports from his former law clerk, Bruce Cohen, who is the chief counsel for the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee. 
   I note Judge Katzmann now for two reasons. First, of course, Vermont is in that circuit. But far more important, this is a man who was brought here at the strong urging and behest of the senior Senator from New York, my dear friend and one of the most distinguished Members of this body, Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN, really the intellectual giant of the Senate. 
   I first met now Judge Katzmann when Senator MOYNIHAN brought him to my office, and I was immediately impressed with him. This is the first circuit court judge to be confirmed this year. 
   Historians can determine what helped the most: the brilliance of persuasion of the distinguished Senator from New York or the brilliance of Judge Katzmann. I say that it was a symbiotic relationship that made the confirmation possible. I applaud my dear friend from across that great and beautiful Lake Champlain, my dear friend from New York, but I also commend Robert Katzmann. I thank my dear friend from Wyoming for allowing me to say this.

   Mr. LEAHY. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Secret Service Protective Privilege Act of 1999. This legislation is intended to ensure the ability of the United States Secret Service to fulfill its vital mission of protecting the life and safety of the President and other important persons. 
   Almost five months have passed since the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton were concluded, and the time has come for Congress to repair some of the damage that was done during that divisive episode. I refer to the misguided efforts of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr to compel Secret Service agents to answer questions about what may have observed or overheard while protecting the life of the President. 
   Few national interests are more compelling than protecting the life of the President of the United States. The Supreme Court has said that the nation has ``an overwhelming interest in protecting the safety of its Chief Executive and in allowing him to perform his duties without interference from threats of physical violence.'' [Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705, 707 (1969).] What's at stake is not merely the safety of one person. What's at stake is the ability of the Executive Branch to function in an effective and orderly fashion, and the capacity of the United States to respond to threats and crises. Think of the shock waves that rocked the world in November 1963 when President Kennedy was assassinated. The assassination of a President has international repercussions and threatens the security and future of the entire nation. 
   The threat to our national security and to our democracy extends beyond the life of the President to those in direct line of the Office of the President--the Vice President, the President-elect, and the Vice President elect. By Act of Congress, these officials are required to accept the protection of the Secret Service--they may not turn it down. This statutory mandate reflects the critical importance that Congress has attached to the physical safety of these officials. 
   Congress has also charged the Secret Service with responsibility for protecting visiting heads of foreign states and foreign governments. The assassination of a foreign head of state on American soil could be catastrophic from a foreign relations standpoint and could seriously threaten national security. 
   The Secret Service Protective Privilege Act of 1999 would enhance the Secret Service's ability to protect these officials, and the nation, from the risk of assassination. It would do this by facilitating the relationship of trust between these officials and their Secret Service protectors that is essential to the Service's protective strategy. 
   The Service uses a ``protective envelope'' method of protection. Agents and officers surround the protectee with an all-encompassing zone of protection on a 24-hour-a-day basis. In the face of danger, they will shield the protectee's body with their own bodies and move him to a secure location. 
   That is how the Secret Service averted a national tragedy on March 30, 1981, when John Hinckley attempted to assassinate President Reagan. Within seconds of the first shot being fired, Secret Service personnel had shielded the President's body and maneuvered him into the waiting limousine. One agent in particular, Agent Tim McCarthy, positioned his body to intercept a bullet intended for the President. If Agent McCarthy had been even a few feet farther from the President, history might have gone very differently. 
   For the Secret Service to maintain this sort of close, unremitting proximity to the President and other protectees, it must have their complete, unhesitating trust and confidence. Secret Service personnel must be able to remain at the President's side even during confidential and sensitive conversations, when they may overhear military secrets, diplomatic exchanges, and family and private matters. If our Presidents do not have complete trust in the Secret Service personnel who protect them, they could try to push away the Service's ``protective envelope'' or undermine it to the point where it could no longer be fully effective. 
   This is more than a theoretical possibility. Consider what former President Bush wrote last April, after hearing of the independent counsel's efforts to compel Secret Service testimony:  
   The bottom line is I hope that [Secret Service] agents will be exempted from testifying before the Grand Jury. What's at stake here it the protection of the life of the President and his family and the confidence and trust that a President must have in the [Secret Service]. 
   If a President feels that Secret Service agents can be called to testify about what they might have seen or heard then it is likely that the President will be uncomfortable having the agents near by. 
   I allowed the agents to have proximity first because they had my full confidence and secondly because I knew them to be totally discreet and honorable. . . . 
   . . . I can assure you that had I felt they would be compelled to testify as to what they had seen or heard, no matter what the subject, I would not have felt comfortable having them close in 
   . . . I feel very strongly that the [Secret Service] agents should not be made to appear in court to discuss that which they might or might not have seen or heard. 
   What's at stake here is the confidence of the President in the discretion of the [Secret Service]. If that confidence evaporates the agents, denied proximity, cannot properly protect the President.  
   As President Bush's letter makes plain, requiring Secret Service agents to betray the confidence of the people whose lives they protect could seriously jeopardize the ability of the Service to perform its crucial national security function. 
   The possibility that Secret Service personnel might be compelled to testify about their protectees could have a particularly devastating affect on the Service's ability to protect foreign dignitaries. The mere fact that this issue has surfaced is likely to make foreign governments less willing to accommodate Secret Service both with respect to the protection of the President and Vice President on foreign trips, and the protection of foreign heads of state traveling in the United States. 
   The recent court decisions, which refused to recognize a protective function privilege, could have a devastating impact upon the Secret Service's ability to provide effective protection. The courts ignored the voices of experience--former Presidents, Secret Service Directors, and others--who warned of the potentially deadly consequences. The courts disregarded the lessons of history. We cannot afford to be so cavalier; the stakes are just too high.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on July 1, 1999, just before last week's recess, the Senate passed four bills which Senator HATCH and I had joined in introducing and which the Judiciary Committee had unanimously reported on the same day as Senate passage. These four bills would reauthorize the Patent and Trademark Office, update the statutory damages available under the Copyright Act, make technical corrections to two new copyright laws enacted last year, and prevent trademark dilution. Each of these bills makes important improvements to our intellectual property laws, and I congratulate Senator HATCH for his leadership in moving these bills promptly through the Committee and the Senate. 
   Passage of these four bills is a good start, but we must not lose sight of the other copyright and patent issues requiring our attention before the end of this Congress. The Senate Judiciary Committee has a full slate of intellectual property matters to consider and I am pleased to work on a bipartisan basis with the chairman on an agenda to provide the creators and inventors of copyrighted and patented works with the protection they may need in our global economy, while at the same time providing libraries, educational institutions and other users with the clarity they need as to what constitutes a fair use of such works. 
   Among the other important intellectual property matters for us to consider are the following: 
   Distance education. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing in May on the Copyright Office's thorough and balanced report on copyright and digital distance education. We need to address the legislative recommendations outlined in that report to ensure that our laws permit the appropriate use of copyrighted works in valid distance learning activities. 
   Patent reform. A critical matter on the intellectual property agenda, important to the nation's economic future, is reform of our patent laws. I worked on a bipartisan basis in the last Congress to get the Omnibus Patent Act, S. 507, reported by the Judiciary Committee to the Senate by a vote of 17 to one, and then tried to have this bill considered and passed by the Senate. Unfortunately, the bill became stalled due to resistance by some in the majority. We should consider and pass this important legislation. 
   Madrid Protocol Implementation Act. I introduced this legislation, S. 671, to help American businesses, and especially small and medium-sized companies, protect their trademarks as they expand into international markets by conforming American trademark application procedures to the terms of the Protocol in anticipation of the U.S.'s eventual ratification of the treaty. Ratification by the United States of this treaty would help create a ``one stop'' international trademark registration process, which would be an enormous benefit for American businesses. 
   Database protection. I noted upon passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act last year that there was not enough time before the end of that Congress to give due consideration to the issue of database protection, and that I hoped the Senate Judiciary Committee would hold hearings and consider database protection legislation in this Congress, with a commitment to make more progress. I support legal protection against commercial misappropriation of collections of information, but am sensitive to the concerns raised by the Administration, the libraries, certain educational institutions, and the scientific community. This is a complex and important matter that I look forward to considering in this Congress. 
   Tampering with product identification codes. Product identification codes provide a means for manufacturers to track their goods, which can be important to protect consumers in cases of defective, tainted or harmful products and to implement product recalls. Defacing, removing or tampering with product identification codes can thwart these tracking efforts, with potential safety consequences for American consumers. We should examine the scope of, and legislative solutions to remedy, this problem. 
   Online trademark protection or ``cybersquatting.'' I have long been concerned with protection online of registered trademarks. Indeed, when the Congress passed the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, I noted that:  
   [A]lthough no one else has yet considered this application, it is my hope that this  antidilution statute can help stem the use of deceptive Internet addresses taken by those who are choosing marks that are associated with the products and reputations of others. (CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, December 29, 1995, page S19312).  
   Last year, my amendment authorizing a study by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences of the effects on trademark holders of adding new top-level domain names and requesting recommendations on related dispute resolution procedures, was enacted as part of the Next Generation Internet Research Act. We have not yet seen the results of that study, and I understand that the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (I-CANN) and World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) are considering mechanisms for resolving trademark and other disputes over assignments of domain names in an expeditious and inexpensive manner. 
   This is an important issue both for trademark holders and for the future of the global Internet. While I share the concerns of trademark holders over what WIPO has characterized as ``predatory and parasitical practices by a minority of domain registrants acting in bad faith'' to register famous or well-known marks of others--which can lead to consumer confusion or downright fraud--the Congress should tread carefully to ensure that any remedies do not impede or stifle the free flow of information on the Internet. I know that the Chairman shares 
   my concerns and that working together we can find legislative solutions which make sense. 
   As detailed below, the four intellectual property bills by the Senate will help foster the growth of America's creative industries.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this conference report on the Y2K liability protection bill is being roundly praised, but not universally. Not universally. And it should not be. This bill is worse than the bill the Senate passed only a few weeks ago. The conference report provides expanded legal protections, especially at the expense of consumers, and I believe it raises serious constitutional questions. I do not support it because it is an unjustified wish list for special interests that are or might become involved in Y2K litigation. 
   The conference report greatly expands the scope of the Senate-passed bill by amending this act to apply to a potential Y2K failure. In fact, section 4  of the bill was amended during the conference to apply to the act's legal restrictions for a potential Y2K failure that could occur or has allegedly caused harm or injury before January 1, 2003. Let me ask, what is a potential Y2K failure? Nobody knows. I tell you this, over the next 4 years almost every lawsuit involving any technology issue could trigger the bill's special legal protections under this sweeping definition. 
   Once again, the majority is manipulating a key phrase to suit the wants of a special interest. The business lobby has inserted its own expanded definition of a Y2K action to broaden the scope of this bill. A House conferee observed when this expanded definition was first proposed last Thursday that it was an expansive definition that had been expressly rejected during House Judiciary Committee proceedings. It certainly was not accepted here. Lo and behold, like the ``Lady of the Lake'' rising, we find this comes out of the ether during the conference. 
   Not really even during the conference. In fact, that may be one reason the conference was never called to meet for a second time to go over the proposed conference report or to even vote on these matters, because it was easier to have matters not considered by the House or the Senate or the conference or voted on, but those that came from somewhere--not from us. But there they are. 
   In fact, after the first truncated meeting was adjourned and a possible follow up meeting was postponed Tuesday morning, the conference was never called back into public session to debate the proposal or even permit amendments to be offered and voted on. I predicted at the first and only preliminary meeting of the conference that I would not be allowed an opportunity to improve the bill by adding balance and protecting consumers, or at least even get a vote on it. I am sorry to report that I was correct. In fact, the conference report was filed without any follow up meeting or votes by the conference committee. 
   That is an interesting way of doing things. If we have a lobby that does not want something, like the juvenile justice bill that passed--they do not want it because they lost on the gun issues--why, it comes to a screeching halt: We are studying it, we are reviewing it, we want to deliberate this, we need to have time for votes, we have to have a conference and go thoroughly into it. 
   We have another lobby that says we want this Y2K bill: We do not like the bill that passed the Senate, and the House did not do enough for us. Will you throw a bunch of stuff in, don't vote on it, don't talk about it, don't have any procedure, just toss it in, because this is what we want, and, oh, by the way, we want it right now, we need it in a hurry. 
   This vagueness of a potential Y2K failure will also add to more future litigation instead of curbing it. From a bill that is supposed to deter frivolous litigation, this new, vague definition will produce more lawsuits and may give special legal protection to many more companies than the Senate-passed bill. 
   These special legal protections include: 90-day waiting period to file a lawsuit, heightened pleading requirements, duty to anticipate and avoid Y2K damages, overriding implied warranties under State law, proportionate liability, and many others. All these special legal protections still apply to small business owners and consumers in this so-called compromise. In fact, the bill, as presently drafted, would preempt consumer protection laws of each of the 50 States. 
   I have to ask: Why does this bill create new protections for large corporations while taking away existing protections for ordinary citizens? Maybe they do not have as much influence at the conference. 
   Many consumers may not be aware of potential Y2K problems in the products they buy for personal, family, or household purposes. They just go to the store and buy it and expect it to work. They are going to find a real surprise if there is something in there that does not work. One thing that will not work is the usual remedies they expect out of the consumer protection laws. 
   This bill as presently drafted would preempt the consumer protection laws of each of the 50 states and restrict the legal rights of consumers who are harmed by Y2K computer failures. 
   Why is this bill creating new protections for large corporations while taking away existing protections for the ordinary citizen? We all know that individual consumers do not have the same knowledge or bargaining power in the marketplace as businesses with more resources. 
   Many consumers may not be aware of potential Y2K problems in the products that they buy for personal, family or household purposes. Consumers just go to the local store or neighborhood mall to buy a home computer or the latest software package. They expect their new purchase to work. What if it does not, due to a Y2K problem? 
   Then the average consumer should be able to use his or her home state's consumer protection laws to get a refund, replacement part or other justice. But not under this bill. 
   The conference report also greatly expands the jurisdiction of the federal courts to consider Y2K cases under its class action provisions--now throwing Y2K cases into Federal court if a plaintiff seeks an award of punitive damages. Again, this expansion of the Senate-passed bill is unjustified. 
   It could be legal malpractice for an attorney not to seek punitive damages at the beginning of a case, when the complaint is filed and before discovery of all the facts has commenced. This provision makes no sense and may cause great harm. 
   Chief Justice Rehnquist and the Judicial Conference soundly rejected this approach months ago. The Judicial Conference found that shifting Y2K cases from state courts ``holds the potential for overwhelming the federal courts, resulting in substantial costs and delays.'' I wonder who pays for that. I bet it is us. 
   In addition, the Judicial Conference concluded ``the proposed Y2K amendments are inconsistent with the objective of preserving the federal courts as tribunals of limited jurisdiction.'' 
   These views are shared by the state court judges, as reflected in the position of the Conference of Chief Justices. They note that these Y2K bills ``pose a direct challenge to the principles of federalism underlying our system of government.'' They describe these bills as ``radically'' altering the complementary role of the state and federal courts. The Chief Justices of our state courts remind us: ``The founding fathers created our federal system for a reason that Congress should be extremely reticent to overturn.'' 
   I thought the Administration had also rejected this approach. 
   Mr. President, I suspect that the sweeping federal procedural and substantive changes to state law in this conference report will not pass constitutional muster when challenged. The conference report does not create a federal cause of action for Y2K lawsuits. Instead, the bill forces federal rules and liability protections on state-based claims and procedures. This will result in the dismissal of claims that might otherwise succeed under state law and clearly usurps the ability of state legislatures to make and enforce the laws for their citizens. 
   The conference report is an arrogant dismissal of the basic constitutional principle of federalism. Given the Supreme Court's recent rulings on the power of the States in relation to the Congress under our Constitution, I predict the Supreme Court will strike down this new law as unconstitutional. 
   We in Congress should not be tramping on the rights of the States to set the legal procedures for their courts and define the legal rights for their citizens. 
   On May 1, 1999, Assistant Attorney General Eleanor Acheson outlined the Department of Justice's views on this legislation. The Department of Justice concluded that: ``Because the McCain-Wyden-Dodd proposal modifies tort and contract law so as to reduce the liability of potential Y2K defendants, it reduces the incentive for potential defendants to avert Y2K failures. In a similar fashion, we do not believe that modifying the rules of liability that apply to meritorious tort and contract actions will deter frivolous Y2K claims, which by definition will be filed regardless of the rules of liability. Instead, the modification in the McCain-Wyden-Dodd bill seem more likely to curtail legitimate Y2K lawsuits.''

   Mr. LEAHY. This conference report is telling the business community: Don't worry, be happy when it comes to Y2K remediation; don't worry about fixing the problem, don't worry about trying to protect the consumers, because the Senate and the House are going to protect you; all you have to worry about is yourself, not those who buy your products. 
   If they take that attitude using this bill as a shield, it only makes Y2K computer problems worse next year instead of fixing them this year. The best defense against any Y2K lawsuit is to be Y2K compliant in 1999, not waiting for a problem to happen and in the year 2000 say: Oh, wait a minute, they took care of us in the Congress; too bad, we're home free. 
   That is why I hosted a Y2K conference in Vermont to help small businesses prepare for 2000. That is why I taped a Y2K public service announcement in my home state. That is why I cosponsored Senator BOND and Senator KERRY's new law, the ``Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act,'' to create SBA loans for small businesses to eliminate their Y2K computer problems now. That is why I introduced, with Senator DODD as the lead cosponsor, the ``Small Business Y2K Compliance Act,'' S. 962, to offer new tax incentives for purchasing Y2K compliant hardware and software. 
   These real measures will avoid future Y2K lawsuits by encouraging Y2K compliance now. 
   Last year, I joined with Senator HATCH to pass into law a consensus bill known as ``The Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act.'' We worked on a bipartisan basis with Senator BENNETT, Senator DODD, the Administration, industry representatives and others to reach agreement on a bill to facilitate information sharing to encourage Y2K compliance. 
   The new law, enacted less than nine months ago, is working to encourage companies to work together and share Y2K solutions and test results. It promotes company-to-company information sharing while not limiting rights of consumers. That is the model we should use to enact balanced and narrow legislation to deter frivolous Y2K litigation while encouraging responsible Y2K compliance. 
   Unlike last year's Y2K information sharing law, this conference report is not narrow or balanced. Instead it is an justified wish list for special interests that are or might become involved in Y2K litigation. 
   The coming of the millennium should not be an excuse for cutting off the rights of those who will be harmed. It should not be an excuse for turning our States' civil justice system upside down. It should not be an excuse for immunizing those who recklessly disregard the coming problem to the detriment of American consumers.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Supreme Court ended its term last week with a trio of deeply disturbing decisions regarding the role of the States and Congress in our federal system. In Alden v. Maine, the Court made it impossible for State employees to enforce their rights under the Fair Labor Standards Act, which for decades has guaranteed public and private employees nationwide a fair minimum wage. 
   In College Savings Bank, the Court deprived private parties of the ability to enforce federal unfair competition law against the States. And in Florida Prepaid, the Court held that Congress can execute its constitutional mandate to protect patents as against States only if the Court is satisfied that there is a sufficient ``pattern of constitutional violations'' of patent rights by the States. The Court also made an unprecedented suggestion about how we must write legislation: that we must expressly invoke a constitutional provision before it will honor our authority to legislate. 
   These three decisions, all by the same bare majority, are disturbing on three fronts. First, they seem to be premised on obsolete notions of natural law, with no basis in the text of the Constitution, and they expressly depart from established constitutional precedent. Second, they will make it harder for ordinary Americans to enforce their federally-protected rights against States. Third, they will make it far more difficult for Congress to enforce uniform policies on matters of national concern. 
   Justice Souter has eloquently explained how the Court's decisions will harm individuals. Dissenting in the Alden case, Justice Souter pointed out that the majority's decision left Maine's employees with a federal right to get paid for overtime work, but no way to enforce it. This flies in the face of logic, precedent, and common sense. As every first-year law student knows, where there is a right, there must be a remedy. 
   The maintenance of State sovereignty is clearly a matter of great importance. For this reason, I have been critical of the increasing intrusion of federal regulation into areas traditionally reserved to the States. 
   In particular, I have expressed concern about the seemingly uncontrollable impulse to react to the latest headline-grabbing criminal caper with a new federal prohibition. This Congress has also extended the federalization of State laws to civil law matters traditionally the province of the States, as in the Y2K bill. But though I watch the federalization of the law with concern, I cannot agree with the Court's decisions, which privilege States' rights over those of both the individual citizen and the federal Government. It is one thing to say that Congress should forbear from interfering in areas that are adequately regulated by the States; it is quite another thing to say that Congress may not exercise its constitutionally-delegated authority even when the national interest so demands. 
   We on the Senate Judiciary Committee hear a good deal of rhetoric about judicial activism. Here we have the real thing. The Court's so-called conservatives, who routinely limit individual constitutional rights on the basis of supposed strict adherence to the constitutional text, have suddenly developed a natural law concept of State sovereignty that even they admit has no basis in the constitutional text. 
   These conservative activists have reached out to overrule solid legal precedent. Thirty-five years ago, in Parden v. Terminal Railway Company, the Court held that States may lose their immunity by engaging in ordinary commercial ventures. This makes a good deal of sense. 
   Why should States that choose to act outside their core sovereign powers and compete in the marketplace get an edge over their regulated private competitors? Certainly, nothing in the Constitution suggests that they should. By overruling Parden, the Court's ``conservatives'' abandoned all pretense of judicial restraint. 
   Let me turn now to the flip-side of the Court's new emphasis on States' rights. In strengthening the power of the States, the Court has weakened the power of Congress and the federal Government. 
   We should, I believe, pay particular attention to the Court's restrictive reading of Congress's authority to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment. 
   This amendment grants the Congress the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, federal constitutional rights. Last week, for the second time in as many years, the Court invalidated an Act of Congress because of the perceived deficiency of the legislative  record. The Court held, in effect, that Congress may not exercise its power pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment unless it justifies itself, in advance, to the satisfaction of the federal courts. This demonstrates a breathtaking lack of respect for a co-equal branch of Government. Congress is not an administrative agency, and it should not be required to dot every ``i'' and cross every ``t'' before taking action in the public interest. 
   The Court's ``no-deference'' approach could complicate a broad range of current legislative initiatives. I will note just two that are of critical importance to me: civil rights and intellectual property. 
   The Religious Liberty Protection Act, which was recently reported by the House Judiciary Committee, is an important congressional effort to protect religious liberty after the Court struck down our previous attempt in the 1997 City of Boerne case. To the extent that any new bill rests on our authority under the Fourteenth Amendment, we must now do the work of an administrative agency to develop an evidentiary record that will satisfy the Supreme Court. 
   The end-of-term decisions will also make it harder for Congress to design a uniform system that will apply throughout the nation to protect important intellectual property interests. Intellectual property rights are deeply rooted in the Constitution, which provides in Article I that ``The Congress shall have power ..... [t]o promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.'' I have worked hard over the years to provide the creators and inventors of copyrighted and patented works with the protection they may need in our global economy. 
   Yet, the Court's decisions will have far-reaching consequences about how these intellectual property rights may be protected against even egregious infringements and violations by the States. For example, in light of the Court's decisions, will Congress now have to write one law for private universities, libraries and educational institutions, while State-run institutions are free to do whatever they please. This is a matter that Chairman HATCH and I will have to examine closely in the Judiciary Committee as we consider a host of intellectual property matters ranging from distance education, database protection, cyberpiracy of domain names, and others. 
   The Court's new conception of federalism poses an interesting challenge to Congress. Over the coming years, we can expect a flurry of lawsuits aimed at testing the limits of last week's rulings and of this body's legislative authority. In fact, the Court has already agreed to decide next term whether States are immune from suits charging that they have violated the federal law against age discrimination and whether they may be sued for defrauding the federal government. 
   I have risen to discuss the Court's end-of-term decisions for two reasons. First, I agree with the four dissenting Justices that these decisions are an egregious case of judicial activism and a misapplication of the Constitution. The four dissenters expressed their belief that the Court's new direction will eventually be reversed. I hope this is so. In the interim, however, we need to determine what means remain to Congress to fulfill the promise of the Constitution, which guarantees national supremacy to federal law and to federally-protected rights. 
   At least three paths remain open to us. First, Congress can require States to waive their immunity from suit as a condition of receiving federal funds. Second, since the States are not immune from suit by the federal Government, Congress can empower federal authorities to collect damages on behalf of private citizens whose federal rights have been violated by States. Third, Congress can give more emphasis to preventative remedies, since nothing in the Court's decisions affects the ability of individuals to sue States for injunctive relief. 
   I urge all Senators to study the Court's decisions. We need to work together with a clear understanding of the Court's new constitutional order.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Computer Crime Enforcement Act. This legislation establishes a Department of Justice grant program to support state and local law enforcement officers and prosecutors to prevent, investigate and prosecute computer crime. I am pleased that Senator DEWINE, with whom I worked closely and successfully last year on the Crime Identification Technology Act, and Senator ROBB, who has long been a leader on law enforcement issues, support this bill as original cosponsors. 
   Computer crime is quickly emerging as one of today's top challenges for state and local law enforcement officials. A recent survey by the FBI and the Computer Security Institute found that 62% of information security professionals reported computer security breaches in the past year. These breaches in computer security resulted in financial losses of more than $120 million from fraud, theft of proprietary information, sabotage, computer viruses and stolen laptops. Computer crime has become a multi-billion dollar problem. 
   I am proud to report that the States, including my home state of Vermont, are reacting to the increase in computer crime by enacted tough computer crime control laws. For example, Vermont's new law makes certain acts against computers illegal, such as: accessing any computer system or data without permission; accessing a computer to commit fraud, remove, destroy or copy data or deny access to the data; damaging or interfering with the operation of the computer system or data; and stealing or destroying any computer data or system. These state laws establish a firm groundwork for electronic commerce, an increasingly important sector of the Vermont economy and of the nation's economy. Now all fifty states have enacted some type of computer crime statute. 
   Unfortunately, too many state and local law enforcement agencies are struggling to afford the high cost of enforcing their state computer crime statute. The Computer Crime Enforcement Act would provide a helping hand by authorizing a $25 million grant program to help the states receive Federal funding for improved education, training, enforcement and prosecution of computer crime. Our bill will help states take a byte out of computer crime. 
   Congress has recognized the importance of providing state and local law enforcement officers with the means necessary to prevent and combat cyber attacks and other computer crime through the FBI's Computer Analysis and Response Team (CART) Program and the National Infrastructure Protection Center. Our legislation would enhance that Federal role by providing each state with much-needed resources to join Federal law enforcement officials in collaborative efforts to fight computer crime. 
   In Vermont, for instance, only half a dozen law enforcement officers among the more than 900 officers in the state have been trained in investigating computer crimes and analyzing cyber evidence. As Detective Michael Schirling of the Chittenden Unit for Special Investigations recently observed in my home state: ``The bad guys are using computers at a rate that's exponentially greater than our ability to respond to the problem.'' Without the necessary educational training, technical support, and coordinated information, our law enforcement officials will be hamstrung in their efforts to crack down on computer crime. 
   Computers have ushered in a new age filled with unlimited potential for good. But the computer age has also ushered in new challenges for our state and local law enforcement officers. Let's provide our state and local partners in crime fighting with the resources that they need in the battle against computer crime. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Computer Crime Enforcement Act and its quick passage into law.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support S. 768, which was significantly improved during the Judiciary Committee mark up with a substitute amendment that I cosponsored with Senators SESSIONS and DEWINE. This important legislation will close a gap in Federal law that has existed for many years. S. 768 establishes authority for Federal jurisdiction over crimes committed by individuals accompanying our military overseas and court-marital jurisdiction over Department of Defense employees and contractors accompanying the Armed Forces on contingency missions outside the United States during times of war or national emergency declared by the President or the Congress. 
   Civilians accompanying the Armed Forces have been subject to court-martial jurisdiction when ``accompanying or serving with the armies of the United States in the field'' since the Revolutionary War. See McCune v. Kilpatrick, 53 F. Supp. 80, 84 (E.D. Va. 1943) It is only since the start of the cold war that American troops, accompanied by civilian dependents and employees, have been stationed overseas in peace time. Provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice provide for the court-martial of civilians accused of crimes while accompanying the armed forces in times of peace or war. The provisions allowing for peace time court-martial of civilians were found unconstitutional by a series of Supreme Court cases beginning with Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1 (1957). With foreign nations often not interested in prosecuting crimes against Americans, particularly when committed by an American, the result is a jurisdictional ``gap'' that allows some civilians to literally get away with murder. 
   A report by the Overseas Jurisdiction Advisory Committee submitted to Congress in 1997, cited cases in which host countries declined to prosecute serious crimes committed by civilians accompanying our Armed Forces. These cases involved the sexual molestation of dependent girls, the stabbing of a serviceman and drug trafficking to soldiers. The individuals who committed these crimes against service men and women or their dependents were not prosecuted in the host country and were free to return to the United States and continue their lives as if the incidents had never occurred. The victims of these awful crimes are left with no redress for the suffering they endured. 
   This inability to exercise Federal jurisdiction over individuals accompanying our armed forces overseas has caused problems. During the Vietnam War, Federal jurisdiction over civilians was not permissible since war was never declared by the Congress. Maj. Gen. George S. Prugh said, in his text on legal issues arising during the Vietnam war, that the inability to discipline civilians ``became a cause for major concern to the U.S. command.'' 
   More recently, Operation Desert Storm involved the deployment of 4,500 Department of Defense civilians and at least 3,000 contractor employees. Similarly large deployments of civilians have been repeated in contingency operations in Somalia, Haiti, Kuwait, and Rwanda. Although crime by civilians accompanying our armed forces in Operation Desert Storm was 
   rare, the Department of Defense did report that four of its civilian employees were involved insignificant criminal misconduct ranging from transportation of illegal firearms to larceny and receiving stolen property. One of these civilians was suspended without pay for 30 days while no action was taken on the remaining three. 
   Due to the lack of Federal jurisdiction over civilians in a foreign country, administrative remedies such as dismissal from the job, banishment from the base, suspension without pay, or returning the person to the United States are often the only remedies available to military authorities to deal with civilian offenders. The inadequacy of these remedies to address the criminal activity of civilians accompanying our Armed Forces overseas results in a lack of deterrence and an inequity due to the harsher sanctions imposed upon military personnel who committed the same crimes as civilians. 
   I expect the deployment of civilians in Kosovo and elsewhere will be relatively crime free, but regardless of the frequency of its use, the gap that allows individuals accompanying our military personnel overseas to go unpunished for heinous crimes must be closed. Our service men and women and those accompanying them deserve justice when they are victims of crime. That is why I introduced this provision as part of the Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act with other Democratic Members, both last year as S. 2484 and again on January 19 of this year, as S. 9. 
   I had some concerns with certain aspects of S. 768 that were not included in my version of this legislation, and I am pleased that we were able to address those concerns in the Sessions-Leahy-DeWine substitute. For example, the original bill would have extended court-martial jurisdiction over DOD employees and contractors accompanying our Armed Forces overseas. The Supreme Court in Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1 (1957), Kinsella v. Singleton, 361 U.S. 234 (1960) and Toth v. Quarles, 350 U.S. 11 (1955), has made clear that court-martial jurisdiction may not be constitutionally applied to crimes committed in peacetime by persons accompanying the armed forces overseas, or to crimes committed by a former member of the armed services. 
   The substitute makes clear that this extension of court-martial jurisdiction applies only in times when the armed forces are engaged in a ``contingency operation'' involving a war or national emergency declared by the Congress or the President. I believe this comports with the Supreme Court rulings on this issue and cures any constitutional infirmity with the original language. 
   In addition, the original bill would have deemed any delay in bringing a person before a magistrate due to transporting the person back to the United States from overseas as ``justifiable.'' I was concerned that this provision could end up excusing lengthy and unreasonable delays in getting a civilian, who was arrested overseas, before a U.S. Magistrate, and thereby raise yet other constitutional concerns. 
   The Sessions-Leahy-DeWine substitute cures that potential problem by removing the problematic provision and relying instead on rule 5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. This rule requires that an arrested person be brought before a magistrate to answer charges without unnecessary delays, and will apply to the removal of a civilian from overseas to answer charges in the United States. 
   Finally, S. 768 as introduced authorized the Department of Defense to determine which foreign officials constitute the appropriate authorities to whom an arrested civilian should be delivered. In my proposal for this legislation I required that DOD make this determination in consultation with the Department of State. I felt this would help avoid international faux pax. I am pleased that the Sessions-Leahy substitute adopted my approach to this issue and requires consultation with the Department of State. 
   I am glad the legislation which I and other Democratic Members of the Judiciary Committee originally introduced both last year and again on January 19 of this year, is finally being considered, and I urge its prompt passage.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Kentucky for his comments, and as always, when working on this piece of legislation with  him, it has been a pleasure, notwithstanding the lack of allocations we had. 
   I concur with the distinguished senior Senator from Kentucky that we should try to wrap this up at a time certain. I will join with him at the appropriate time in a unanimous consent request that all amendments be filed by noon today. The reason I mention that now is so that, on this side of the aisle, people are alerted we will be making a request of that nature. I think it can be done. 
   With the agreement entered into last night by the distinguished majority leader and the distinguished Democratic leader, there is an effort to move some of these bills forward so we can get on to the question of the Patients' Bill of Rights when we come back after the July 4 recess. I urge Senators who have amendments to come to the Chamber and offer them. 
   This bill was reported by the Appropriations Committee with actually no debate and no amendments. One of the reasons, unfortunately, for the lack of any debate is the amount of funds in this bill is so far below what is needed to adequately fund our foreign policy priorities that there is little point in debating it. 
   Even if Members want to make changes in the bill, there is no way to pay for it. Everything in it is already underfunded. The bill is $800 million below the 1999 level. It is $1.9 billion below the President's request. No one can accuse the President of failing to try to protect this country's global interests. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the Congress. Devoting less than 1 percent of the Federal budget to our foreign policy is not responsible. 
   What this means is we are unable to meet our commitments--our solemn commitments--to the international financial institutions. We did not provide any funds for the President's expanded threat reduction initiative, to dismantle Russian nuclear weapons, to protect fissile material, and pay for other nonproliferation and security programs. We spent hundreds of billions of dollars--literally trillions of dollars--to defend against the threat of the then-Soviet Union. 
   We are unwilling to spend a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of 1 percent of that same money now to dismantle some of those nuclear weapons and protect the material from them--material that can fall into the hands of people who do not have the kind of controls that were imposed at the time we were spending hundreds of billions of dollars to protect ourselves. It goes beyond penny-wise and pound-foolish; it goes into irresponsibility, especially in a nuclear age. I, frankly, cannot understand how we have gotten to this point. 
   We had to cut funding for many of the programs of special interest to Senators, i.e., the Peace Corps. Is there any foreign policy program in this country that we can point to with more pride than the Peace Corps? Yet we cut that. 
   With additional funds, we could do a great deal more to promote American exports in extremely competitive foreign markets. Other countries that do not begin to have the ability to export as we do are spending more money in trying to build up their foreign markets because they know that will create jobs, good-paying jobs, in their country. We step back and say we do not want to do this. 
   We can improve global health at a time when infectious diseases are our greatest threat after nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. There is no major infectious disease that is more than one or two plane rides away from our shores. And this isn't a case where we are showing some great humanitarian gesture to try to stop infectious disease in other continents; it protects us. Not only does it protect the people there, but ebola plague, a resistant strain of tuberculosis, and any other number of things can begin in one country and within hours be in a major airport in our country and then in our population. When it gets here, we will spend fortunes trying to get rid of it. We will not spend pennies in trying to stop it in the first place. 
   We should be doing more to protect the Earth's natural resources. They are under siege on every continent. Our health and our economy depend on a clean environment. Yet we spend a pittance as we see the environment continue to degrade, almost as though we think as Americans we can look at the borders of our great country and assume that we determine the environment for our people just within those borders. 
   The environment is determined by the rain forests of the world, by the ``desertization'' of large parts of the world, by chemical and other dumping in our oceans in other parts of the world. If we want to protect us--a quarter of a billion Americans--we ought to be concerned about what happens in other parts of the world. 
   Half the world is asking for help in building new democratic societies, but we have little to offer. For decades, again, we spent hundreds of billions of dollars--trillions of dollars--saying we were going to stand up for democracy, we were going to stand up against communism; we wanted democracy in the world. 
   Well, the Berlin Wall has come down. The Iron Curtain has rusted through. These countries are saying: Thank God America is there; they can help us form our democracy. And we say: When we thought you would be Communists, we could spend billions and billions and billions of dollars to contain you, but now that you want to be democratic, we don't really have even a tiny fraction of that amount to help you become democratic, to help you develop courts and a free press and a civil system, and 
   on and on. 
   We should double or triple our support for international peacekeeping, especially in places such as Sierra Leone where NATO cannot intervene but the atrocities are far worse. Daily we see it in Kosovo. We almost have this thought that if we do not turn on CNN and see atrocities, they are not occurring. I suggest that Senators read the Intelligence Digest, read the free press, when they do report them and think of these atrocities that we could help stop. 
   If we do not do anything in these areas, all the areas I have talked about, because we save some pennies today by not doing anything in these areas, we are saddling future generations of Americans with far greater costs, and as we go into the next century, we saddle future Americans with a more dangerous and unstable world, a world that is increasingly polarized between the very rich and the extraordinarily poor. 
   I have little doubt that the President would veto a foreign operations bill at this level. 
   Having said all that, Senator MCCONNELL and I did the best we could with the allocation we received. We have tried to allocate the funds we had in the most responsible way possible. 
   I thank the senior Senator from Kentucky for the bipartisan way he worked with me to put this bill together. It has become a tradition of the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Vermont to work together on these issues. I am grateful to him. I think what he has done serves the Senate well. I think it serves the American people well. 
   Obviously, if I were in Senator MCCONNELL's position, I might have done some things differently, just as he would look at some of the things I have asked to be put in this bill and are included and do them differently. But on the whole, we have worked together to write a balanced piece of legislation. In fact, the funds are so tight, the balance is so delicate, I cannot imagine how I might accept any amendments, Democrat or Republican, to cut or add funds in this bill. This is a Rubik's cube, a small Rubik's cube but a Rubik's cube nonetheless, we have tried to put together. 
   I think we Senators should thank the chairman and the ranking member of the full committee, the senior Senator from Alaska, Mr. STEVENS, and the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. BYRD, who did their best to give us a fair allocation within the limits they had to work with. 
   But if I might, before I yield the floor, mention a couple issues I am especially concerned about. One is the Global Environment Facility. It is one of the world's leading international environmental organizations. It funds projects to protect biodiversity, to prevent ocean pollution, to protect the ozone, and to prevent climate change. 
   Take a poll of the American people. Ask them how many are in favor of just those items. A resounding majority of the American people would be in  favor of protecting biodiversity, preventing ocean pollution, protecting the ozone, preventing climate change. For this endeavor, the administration requested $143 million for fiscal year 2000. That includes $35 million we owe already in prior year arrears. This bill contains just $25 million for arrears, and that is not acceptable. 
   Ask the American people if they have a justifiable concern about terrorism, and they will say yes. Those of us, the chairman and myself, who have access to the most current intelligence of our intelligence agencies know that the fear of terrorism is justifiable. The President requested $33 million for antiterrorism training programs. Under our allocation, we could only provide him $20 million. 
   The request also included $10 million for a new antiterrorism program to help developing countries strengthen their border control systems--again, because the terrorism that may show up in those developing countries is a plane ride away from our shores. Even though the President's antiterrorism initiative is a good one, we cannot include any funds for it. Not that we don't want to fund these programs; the money is not there to do it. 
   There are a lot of other programs I could mention that need additional funds. Hopefully, before this session is over, we may get a revised allocation that will allow us to go into some of these areas. But right now I think we should act on the bill to move the process forward. 
   Again, I salute the chairman and ranking member of the full committee, the distinguished Senators from Alaska and West Virginia, for pushing so hard to go forward. The fact that the distinguished senior Senator from Kentucky and I have the working relationship we do, I think, helped us move forward with this. We should go forward with the process. Hopefully the other body will start moving on theirs. I think we could complete action on this bill in a very few hours. Senators who have amendments should not delay to offer them. 
   As I said earlier, to preserve the delicate balance of this bill, I expect to be opposing amendments that do not have suitable offsets. 
   With that, I yield the floor. The Senator from Kentucky and I are now the humble servants of the Senate, ready to start the sausage grinder forward. Hopefully, we can end up with a product very quickly.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to reaffirm that protecting biodiversity is a key goal of our foreign policy. It is also to clarify language on page 23 of the Appropriations Committee report--Report 106-81, which incorrectly refers to fiscal year 1994. The year should have been 1995. 
   The United States, the birthplace of the global environmental movement, has led the way in supporting efforts to protect the incredible variety of plants and animals around the world. Yet because of shrinking budgets and changing priorities in Congress and at AID, our efforts to preserve the Earth's biodiversity have diminished. The consequences of this are profound, for ourselves and even more so for future generations. We cannot afford to neglect an area of environmental protection that so directly affects the lives of  American families and American industries. 
   AID's biodiversity activities include efforts to save species and ecosystems from extinction or degredation. Only 1.5 million of the estimated 10-50 million species have even been named and classified. Far fewer have been studied for their potential uses to humanity. Yet the destruction of natural habitats is leading to 100 extinctions every single day. AID also promotes genetic diversity. Genes that could have been lost to environmental destruction now improve and protect crops all over the world, and especially here in the United States. 
   In the United States, we reap the benefits of the world's biological diversity every day. Atmospheric pollution is reduced by tropical rainforests. Our cattle and crops are crossbred to improve their genetic traits. The pharmaceutical benefits alone are amazing. Diseases common in this country are cured with medicines that come from plants from around the world. The worldwide market for drugs derived from plants is $40 billion. Who knows what new species will be discovered, leading to medicines that will benefit tomorrow's sick? No one does, which is why we cannot let a newly discovered species containing a possible cure for cancer, or AIDS, or even the common cold, go the way of the dinosaurs. 
   AID has led the way worldwide in supporting biodiversity, by working effectively with U.S. and foreign nongovernmental organizations, and foreign governments. For example, the Philippines, with its coral reefs and tropical forests, is one of the most biodiverse places in the world. It is also one of the most threatened. But through effective 
   management, AID has helped place over 1.2 million acres of forest land under community stewardship and away from harm. AID has implemented similar projects elsewhere, working with governments to protect their own valuable resources. 
   Despite successes such as these, our biodiversity efforts are threatened. Since 1995, AID expenditures for biodiversity have decreased by nearly $50 million, a nearly 50 percent reduction in just four years. Much of this decline is due to the steady reduction in our foreign aid budget. But even from this shrinking pie, biodiversity gets a thinner and thinner slice every year. In 1995, biodiversity spending was 5.1% of development assistance expenditures. By 1996 it was down to 4%. Then in 1998, expenditures were reduced to only 3.3%. 
   These disproportionate cuts have devastating consequences. The Philippines project I just mentioned will completely run out of funding next year. In Madagascar, a country that AID made one of its top biodiversity priorities over a decade ago, AID cut its biodiversity funding by $900,000. In some ways Madagascar was lucky, because AID had originally planned to cut $1.5 million dollars. And this is a country that AID says is ``Africa's most important biodiversity priority.'' 
   Obviously, we have many other development assistance priorities--in public health, in education, in family planning, in justice reform, to name a few. But we need a more balanced approach. I have spoken out more times than I can count in support of more funding for foreign aid. Foreign aid not only helps promote American interests abroad, but also provides direct benefits here at home. But even given the shrinking funds we devote to foreign aid, we must ensure that funding to protect biodiversity does not continue to suffer disproportionate cuts. We should resume the proportion of development assistance funding for biodiversity to the proportion it received in 1995. That is what my amendment would do. 
   I also want to be very clear about what we mean by ``biodiversity.'' We mean ``activities designed to support the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity--biomasses, ecosystems, species, or genetic diverity--by identifying needs, by designing, implementing and monitoring conservation and management actions; through research and training; or through institutional strengthening, policy interventions and program development.'' This is consistent with AID's definition of these activities. 
   Finally, we need to ensure that AID's Office of Environment and Natural Resources receives strong support. This office performs a vital function in the design, implementation and evaluation of conservation activities. Yet funding for it has been cut steadily since 1995, from $25.6 million to $6.9 million in 1999. That it totally unacceptable, and it seriously undercuts AID's capacity to exert leadership in this area. 
   Mr. President, I want to commend AID for its leadership in this area. I also want to ensure that it continue's to exert that leadership. That requires adequate resources, and I intend to work with AID to balance the many competing development assistance programs to achieve that goal.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, many people, including myself, were deeply  disappointed by the World Bank's June 24th decision to approve a $160,000,000 loan to fund the controversial Western Poverty Reduction Project. 
   We recognize the strong views about this issue and I have agreed to accept this amendment, but with some reluctance. 
   The Western Poverty Reduction Project has drawn criticism from Members of Congress, the Clinton administration, other governments and international human rights and non-governmental organizations. A $40,000,000 component of this project which would fund the resettlement of some 58,000 poor Chinese farmers into an historically and culturally distinct Tibetan and Mongolian area is the primary source of concern. 
   The $9 million cut in IDA funds which would result from the Helms amendment is the United States contribution to this portion of the project. 
   I share Senator HELMS' concern that the project may put additional pressure on Tibetans and other ethnic minorities in the region who are already struggling to overcome economic and cultural marginalization under Chinese rule. 
   There are also serious questions about the project's impact on the environment. It is my understanding that the Bank did not follow its own procedures in considering the environmental impact of this loan. 
   The United States Executive Director at the Bank voted against the loan and I supported that vote. 
   While many of us are not happy with the June 24th decision, the fact is we voted on this loan just as we have on countless other loans over the years. We participated in the Board's democratic voting process, as established by the Bank's charter and agreed to by its shareholders, just as we always have. The United States was instrumental in establishing the Bank's voting rules. 
   What made this vote different, however, is that we lost. 
   With some 18 percent of the voting power on the Board, the overwhelming majority of the time the view of the United States prevails on the World Bank's Board and at other international financial institutions. We have become accustomed to getting our way. 
   However, in the rare instances when we do not, dismissing the process, reneging on our financial obligations and walking away from our responsibilities is not an appropriate response. This is what this amendment does. 
   By cutting our contribution to IDA, which provides critical assistance to the world's poorest countries, this amendment compromises the democratic procedures at the Bank and damages United States credibility. It also invites other shareholders to cut their contributions to the Bank whenever they do not get their way. Taken to its logical conclusion, the damage to the Bank's ability to carry out its mission would be immense. 
   We have see how we can influence this project by simply staying involved. United States intervention and persistent international pressure has already changed the way the Bank will proceed with this loan. 
   Under World Bank President James Wolfensohn's leadership, the Board made the highly unusual and commendable decision to delay disbursement of the $40,000,000 until the Bank's independent inspection panel conducts a thorough review and determines whether the project meets the Bank's environmental and resettlement standards. 
   In addition, the Chinese Government has pledged its support for the review and stated that the press and government officials will have access to the region. Concerns about whether the project area will be open to experts unaffiliated with the Bank or the Chinese Government still need to be addressed. 
   It is expected that the Western Poverty Reduction project will be completed in 2005. By approving this amendment today and reducing our contribution to IDA we forfeit our leverage to influence the project and ensure that the Bank's environmental and resettlement standards are met over the next six years. 
   Mr. President, the plight of the Tibetan people is a clear example of what occurs when the principles of democracy are consistently and blatantly violated. In an effort to support their struggle, this amendment also compromises those same principles. It will weaken the United States' ability to ensure that the rights of Tibetans and other ethnic minorities are protected as the Bank moves forward with the project.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have an adage: Where there is a will, there is a way. Often that seems to embody how legislation is passed by this Congress. Of course the question always is what is the will, and what is the way? We should look no further than the priority being put on two separate pieces of legislation: S. 254, the juvenile justice bill, and H.R. 775, the Y2K bill. If one looks at that, one sees how the will and the way work around here. 
   The Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, S. 254, passed the Senate after 2 weeks of open debate, after a number of votes, and after significant improvements on May 20. The Senate passed it by a strong bipartisan vote of 73-25. 
   On June 17, the other body passed its version of this legislation but chose not to take up the Senate bill and insert its language, which is the standard practice. Nor has the Republican leadership in the House made any effort to seek a House-Senate conference or appoint conferees. 
   When there are differences in legislation passed by each House, the normal order is for House and Senate conferees to work these differences out in conference, but we cannot do that unless they appoint conferees. 
   The majority in the other body is taking a break even before our July 4 recess. They are taking no steps to proceed to conference on the juvenile justice bill or toward the appointment of conferees. Indeed, despite statements by the Speaker of the House earlier this week, the House majority leader is now reported to be planning to delay the completion of this bill for months. This delay is costing us valuable time in getting this juvenile justice legislation enacted before school resumes this fall. This is just plain wrong. 
   Every parent in this country is concerned this summer about school violence over the last two years and worried about the situation they will confront this fall. Each one of us wants to do something to stop this violence. There is no single cause and no single legislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our schools or in our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to do our part. It is unfortunate that the majority is not moving full speed ahead to seize this opportunity to act on balanced, effective juvenile justice legislation. 
   We should not repeat the delays that happened in the last Congress on the juvenile justice legislation. In the 105th Congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported juvenile justice legislation in July 1997, but it was then left to languish for over a year until the very end of that Congress. In fact, serious efforts to make improvements to this bill did not even occur until the last weeks of that Congress, when it was too late and we ran out of time. 
   The experience of the last Congress causes me to be wary of this delay in action on the juvenile justice legislation this year. I want to be assured that a House-Senate conference on this legislation is fair, full, and productive. 
   At the end of the last Congress, the majority staged what appeared to be a procedural ambush to move a one-sided bill forward in a way that precluded full and open debate and amendment. I certainly hope that the current delay in action on this year's juvenile crime bill is not an attempt to concoct another procedure ambush. 
   We have worked hard in the Senate for a strong bipartisan juvenile justice bill. I will be vigilant in working to maintain this bipartisanship and to press for action on this important legislation. We know if we have the will, there is a way.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I say to my friend from New York, it is reasonable to move forward on it. These are issues the American people care about. They do care about the gun show loopholes on gun sales, certainly after the tragedy of Columbine. They do care about a number of the issues that are in the juvenile justice bill. The Senate reflected that by passing it 73-25. This is a 3-to-1 vote in the Senate. 
   I say to my friend from New York, when he served in the other body, he and I were on a number of conference committees together. We knew we would have major criminal justice bills come in one distinct form from the Senate and one distinct form from the House, but we moved quickly in the conferences, sometimes going all night long. 
   In fact, I can remember a couple that went all night long, 2 or 3 nights in a row, to complete our work because we knew we were dealing with criminal justice matters, matters about which the American people have great concern. But we did it. 
   So I say to my friend from New York, in answer to his question, that this is wrong. This is wrong that we are not moving forward to immediately conference the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill.

   Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from New York for his concern and his leadership on these matters. He was one of the leaders--in fact, oftentimes on the floor he was the leader--on these issues, including closing gun loopholes. I was looking forward to, and am looking forward to, his expertise and his work when we do get to conference. He and I are ready to go to conference. I am prepared to have him in there to help me in that conference, because these are major issues. 
   But at some time or another the American people expect us to vote one way or the other. Some Senators will vote against our position. Some House Members will vote against our position. Some will vote for it. I do not ascribe motives to them, but I say, that you either vote for or against something. You do not vote maybe. And the Congress is being forced to vote maybe. 
   This is a sharp contrast to the pace of action on the Y2K bill. The Y2K bill provides special legal protections to businesses. After earlier action in the House on H.R. 775, the Y2K liability limitations bill passed the Senate on June 15, 1999. That was about 1 month after the Senate passed the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill. 
   On June 16, the day after Senate action on the Y2K bill, the Senate asked for a House-Senate conference and appointed conferees. In fact, I am one of them. The House responded by agreeing to the conference and appointed its conferees a few days later, on June 24. Then we immediately went to conference. The conference met that same day, the same day the House appointed its conferees. 
   After a weekend break for extensive negotiations with the White House, the conference report on the Y2K liability limitations bill was filed yesterday, June 29. I expect the House and Senate will be taking up the conference report almost immediately, and the Y2K liability limitations bill will probably see final passage this week. 
   It is interesting that this is a business-lobbied-for issue and that thing zips through here; it zips through here at warp speed. I can almost see the legislative clerk saying: We want warp 5,  Scottie. And, by golly, we are going to have it. 
   I should also note, this Y2K liability limitations bill is industry's second bite at the apple to gain protections against liability to customers and consumers. If all goes as expected, in less than a year's time, big business will have successfully lobbied for the passage of two major pieces of legislation to protect themselves against any accountability for actions or losses their products may cause to consumers. 
   Last year, I joined with Senator HATCH to introduce and pass into law a consensus bill known as the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act. This legislation passed both the House and the Senate by unanimous consent on October 8, 1998. When we took this action, requested last year, we acted in good faith, we acted in recognition of the fears of industry, but we did it in a balanced way that continued to protect consumers and the rights of all Americans. The House and Senate accepted that unanimously, and the White House signed it. 
   Notwithstanding that bipartisan piece of legislation, notwithstanding the unanimity we sought, we see this year where business fears are being reconstituted for the basis of greater and greater demands for special legal protections for potential Y2K defendants. Special business interests have come back to Congress 
   with new demands, and there has been swift action. 
   But by contrast to this swift action to help business by limiting their potential liability in the Y2K bill at the expense of American consumers, in contrast to jumping immediately to do whatever the business lobby wanted, we find now that those who should be appointing conferees in the House are not doing that, they are dragging their feet on moving to appoint conferees on the juvenile justice bill. 
   The juvenile justice bill is not designed as a protection to businesses that may have made mistakes in the computers they sell to people. No. The juvenile justice bill is intended to make a difference in the lives of our children and our families. I guess children and families do not have the power and the lobbying clout that some of these major businesses do. I guess they do not have PACs. They do not give major contributions. They do not go to the big fundraisers. All they are, are families trying to raise their children and send them to school safely; so the House majority is not going to move rapidly on a juvenile justice bill. 
   As Senators, as House Members, as human beings, that should have been our No. 1 priority. We should have brought this to conference. We should have concluded it by now so that the new programs and protections for schoolchildren could be in place when school resumes this fall. At the rate we are going, we guarantee that children will be going back to school without the protections that three-quarters of the Members of the Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, voted for; we guarantee that the promise we held out here in the Senate to protect the children who have to go to school, to protect their families, to protect this country, the promise we held out to them is a hollow promise, because the House of Representatives, and their leadership, the Speaker and the majority leader, are saying: We're not going to get to this bill; we're not going to have conferees.

   Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right. The Senator from Massachusetts, of course, is one of those who was on the floor day after day, hour after hour, helping us craft this bill and getting it through. A former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he has been a leader on juvenile justice issues for the better part of four decades. We greatly appreciate all that he contributes each day and all that he contributed again this year to the Senate juvenile justice bill that we were able to pass with such a strong bipartisan majority. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts, from his experience--longer experience than I have had in this body--is aware that when we have had these major pieces of criminal justice or juvenile justice legislation or any major justice legislation, we have gone to conference and we have worked out the differences. 
   He also knows, as I do, if we refuse to do that, it, in effect, kills legislation--legislation that passed here in a bipartisan fashion. I share the concerns that the Senator from Massachusetts has.

   Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right. Unlike the Y2K bill and other things, where there is a rush to complete congressional action on it, this is something where it appears, especially in the other body, that the parents and the children of this country do not have a voice. No matter what other legislative issues are going on, the conference could have been meeting if the House had just proceeded to take the normal steps needed and appointed conferees. 
   The majority leader of the House of Representatives has said they are not going to appoint conferees, certainly not any time in the near future. We have been ready to go forward at any time, the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. But if there are not going to be conferees, this bill is in limbo. 
   So you had the hopes of the parents of this country, the hopes that the schoolchildren had following the passage by the Senate of a good juvenile justice bill, that maybe we are coming to grips on at least some aspects of juvenile violence. Those hopes are dashed because when the matter is finally taken up by the other body, they say: Wait a minute, we don't have to have any votes on this. 
   I am privileged to participate in legislative action on the floor of the Senate. We Senators ought to run the Senate, not a powerful lobby. I say the same to the other body. They ought to stand up and speak for their constituents and not become mouthpieces for a powerful lobby, but that is what has happened.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I totally concur with what the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts has said. He was a leader who worked with us to design the Senate-passed bill. 
   All of us, whether we are parents or grandparents or teachers or policymakers, we are puzzling over the causes of children turning violent in this country. We know that the root causes are likely multifaceted. We know there is no one cause. There is no one magic solution. 
   I believe the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill is a firm and significant step in the right direction. The passage of that bill showed that when Senators roll up their sleeves and get to work, we can make significant progress. And we did. Senators were on the floor, they were in conferences in the cloakroom and off the floor. We worked extremely hard to come together. We had some false steps at the beginning, but we finally came together when we passed a piece of legislation 73 to 25. 
   That took a lot of work. We had conservatives and liberals and moderates holding hands on a number of issues to make it work because we cared about the children of this country. That progress does not do any good if the House and Senate do not come together in a conference. 
   I yield for a question to my friend from California.

   Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from California is correct. She has described the bill very well, as she always does, and where we are in the legislative process. She has had both a distinguished career in the other body and here. She understands what has happened. 
   It was not an easy thing passing the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill here in the Senate. We had a very difficult time. It evolved. But interestingly enough--and I have been here 25 years--I have rarely seen an occasion where the American public became involved and more fully aware of what was happening. 
   I must say, initially, much of the news media did not even cover it. The American people became aware through C-SPAN and through all the discussions on the Internet and through the radio. And then, more and more, they realized what was happening and what was at stake. 
   I do not know how many people are aware of this discussion we are having right now. I will guarantee you that it will be on web sites and on the Internet, though, because the American public is concerned about this. 
   The Senator from California, the Senator from New Jersey, and others, will remember that as calls started coming into Senators' offices, the debate started shifting. This was one of those all too rare occasions where the American public went beyond having the debate interpreted for them and started watching what was actually happening in the debate and contributing and participating themselves. 
   The Hatch-Leahy legislation passed because the American people were paying attention and because they were concerned, and votes started changing, positions started changing. That is why this body came together by a 3-to-1 vote and passed the Hatch-Leahy legislation, a good piece of juvenile justice legislation, because the American people paid attention and knew something could be done. 
   Now it has been blocked in the other body. Why? Perhaps because that is the only way this legislation can be stopped--it won't be stopped by a vote in the Senate. Senators have said how they will vote. The only way it can be stopped is if the other body refuses to bring it up, and the way they refuse to bring it up is by refusing to appoint conferees.

I say to the Senator from New Jersey, apparently those forces, at least at this point, have succeeded in the other body, and that is why we are not having conferees appointed and proceeding to a prompt conference, because they know if there were a conference and if the public responds as it did during the debate on the Hatch-Leahy bill originally, that conference may pass out legislation that they might not like, especially as it relates to controlling gun violence. I think that is one of the reasons why we have not seen that.

   Mr. LEAHY. It will only come, I say to my friend from New Jersey, when we realize that our children and our families are far more precious to us than votes or campaign contributions. The Senator from Vermont was long ago clear on that point. My wife, my children--my family--are far more important to me than any votes, any office, any lobbyist, any pressure, any favors, any campaign contributions, or anything else. I think most families in this country feel the same way--that the family is the most precious thing possible to them. 
   In this body we passed legislation that might protect those families. We see the response on the other side of the Capitol of symbolism instead of substance, of speeches or feel-good solutions. We cast the tough votes here. The Senator from New Jersey made sure that we did. 
   On this issue especially, can we not stand up and say our families are more important, our children are more important, our grandchildren are more important, and all of that is more important than a powerful lobby?

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to express strong support for a peaceful process of self-determination in East Timor. 
   The Indonesian Government has a historic opportunity to resolve a conflict that has been the cause of suffering and instability for 23 years. 
   It has made a commitment to vote on August 21st on East Timor's future, and has recognized its responsibility to ensure that the vote is free and fair. 
   On May 5, when I introduced a similar resolution, I remarked on Indonesia's accomplishments in the past year: President Suharto relinquished power; the Indonesian Government endorsed a vote on autonomy; and the United Nations, Portugal and Indonesia signed agreed on the procedures for that vote. 
   There has been more progress in the past month. Democratic elections have  been held, the first members of an international observer mission and police force arrived in East Timor, and Nobel laureate Jose Romos Horta was invited to return to Jakarta for the first time in 24 years. 
   A year ago few people would have predicted that a settlement of East Timor's future would be in sight. However, there is deep concern that August 21st is quickly approaching, and the violence in East Timor will make a free and fair vote impossible. 
   In fact, the vote, initially scheduled for August 8th, was postponed by the United Nations until August 21st because of the violence. 
   Hundreds of civilians have been killed, injured, or disappeared in ongoing violence by anti-independence militias armed by members of the Indonesian military who want to sabotage the vote. 
   Human rights monitors and humanitarian organizations continue to face problems gaining access to the island, and members of the press have been threatened. 
   This amendment calls on the administration to immediately intensify its efforts to prevail upon the Indonesian Government to disarm and disband the anti-independence militias, grant full access to humanitarian organizations, and allow Timorese who have been living in exile to return home. 
   It directs the United State executive directors to international financial institutions to use their influence to encourage the Indonesian Government and military to create a stable and secure environment for the vote. 
   We should use all the resources at our disposal to convince the Indonesians to stop the violence. This is not only their responsibility, it is in their interests. If the Indonesian military succeeds in sabotaging the vote, Indonesia will face international condemnation. 
   On June 11th, I and other Members of Congress wrote to World Bank President James Wolfensohn about the need for the World Bank to use its leverage with the Indonesian Government. 
   Mr. President, the world community has recognized the urgency of this situation. An international monitoring and police presence throughout East Timor is critical to creating a secure environment. 
   The administration is already helping to pay the costs of the U.N. monitors and police, and they have made some progress in stemming the violence. 
   But far more needs to be done. It is time for the Indonesian Government and military to do their part--to act decisively to ensure that a free and fair vote can occur. 
   This amendment reinforces what others have said and what the Indonesian Government has already committed to do. It should be unanimously supported. 
   Mr. President, yesterday more than 100 anti-independence militiamen surrounded a newly opened United Nation's office in the East Timorese town of Maliana. Hurling rocks, the mob injured a diplomat from South Africa and at least a dozen Timorese who sought refuge inside the office. The U.N. building also sustained considerable damage. 
   In recent months I have spoken out about the escalating violence in East Timor on numerous occasions. I am offering an amendment today about the situation there. 
   The Indonesian Government and military have pledged to establish a safe and secure environment prior to the August 21st ballot on East Timor's political status. This alarming incident is a clear example that the Indonesian Government and military are not living up to their obligations. It is a clear example that their failure to act is having and will continue to have international consequences. 
   This latest attack suggests that despite the May 5th tripartite agreement, the presence of an international observer mission and police force and recent negotiations between the opposing factions about how to stem the violence, the situation is continuing to deteriorate. It could jeopardize the entire peace process. 
   The East Timorese have endured over 20 years of violence and repression. The international community has committed its resources to helping ensure that a free and fair ballot can be conducted. The United Nations has firmly stated that it has a job to do in East Timor and it will not be chased off by intimidation and harassment. 
   Mr. President, it is my hope that this violent attack will sound the alarm to the Indonesian government and military that they have an historic opportunity to finally establish peace in East Timor and that they must act immediately or it will be lost. 
   Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished senior Senator from Connecticut has stated the arguments so very well. Like he, I have traveled to Cuba. I visited Cuba 3 months ago with the distinguished senior Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. REED. 
   We were able to go there because we are U.S. Government officials. If we had been private citizens, as the distinguished Senator from Connecticut has said, we would have had some problems. 
   My friend from Connecticut mentioned the problems that my wife Marcelle faced when she went to Cuba. He and I have discussed that because of the absurdity of it. 
   My wife Marcelle has accompanied me on many foreign trips. We have gone abroad representing our country, at the request of the Senate, at the request of the President; and sometimes we have traveled on our own just to visit friends abroad. 
   So we did not think there was much of a difference that time. Our passports were in order. We were going to a Caribbean country, having traveled in that area often, so we didn't need any special shots or anything. 
   We were about to go. But a few days before we were to leave --this is what the Senator from Connecticut referenced--we received a call from the State Department saying they were not sure they could approve my wife's travel to Cuba. 
   I cannot speak for other Senators, but I suspect that most Senators would react the same way I did if they were told that a State Department bureaucrat had the authority to prevent their spouse or their children from traveling with them to a country with which we are not at war and which, according to the Defense Department, and practically every other American, poses no threat to our national security. 
   At first I thought it was a joke. They said no. My wife is not a Government official. She is not a journalist. They did not think she could go. She is, and has been, a practicing, registered nurse throughout her professional life. In the end, she was able to join me because an American nurses association asked her to report on an aspect of current health in Cuba, and she agreed to report back to them. 
   Actually she has visited, with me, other parts of the world where we have used the Leahy War Victims Fund or where we have gone to visit landmine victims or looked at health care. I have always relied on her knowledge and expertise and did on this trip. 
   But I thought, how many Senators realize that if they wanted to take their spouse or their children with them to Cuba, they could be prevented from doing so by U.S. authorities. They can take them anywhere else in the world, any other country that would allow them in, but here it is not that the other country would not allow them in. Our country is saying: We're not going to allow you to leave if that is where you're going. 
   The authors who put that law together knew the blanket prohibition on travel by American citizens would be unconstitutional, so they came up with a nifty way to avoid that problem while still having the same result. They said: Well, Americans could travel to Cuba; they just cannot spend any money there. 
   Think of it. You can go to Cuba but you can't stay anywhere if it is going to cost you money to stay; you can't eat anything if it is going to cost you money for the food; you can't take a cab, or anything, from the airport if it is going to cost you money. 
   Well, come on. Almost a decade has passed since the collapse of the former Soviet Union. But even before that Americans went there. Now they freely travel to Russia by the thousands every year, as they did before the collapse of the 
   Soviet Union. 
   Eight years have passed since the Russians cut their $3 billion subsidy a year to Cuba, and we now give hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Russia, even though that was our great enemy during the cold war. 
   Americans, as the Senator from Connecticut has said, can travel to North Korea. There are no restrictions on the right of Americans to travel there or to spend money there. 
   I ask a question of my colleagues: Which country poses a greater threat to the United States or world stability? North Korea or Cuba? I think the answer, especially if you watch the news at all, is North Korea, for it is in South Korea where we have tens of thousands of U.S. troops poised to defend it. 
   Americans can travel to Iran, a country that is in total, gross violation of all international law. They took over our embassy, held our diplomats hostage, broke every single possible international law there was--they still hold our property that they confiscated from us--but we can travel freely there; we can spend money there. 
   The same goes for Sudan. These are countries that are on our own terrorist list, but we can travel there. 
   Americans travel to China and Vietnam, countries that have had abysmal human rights records. We not only travel there, we actively promote American investment there. 
   So our Cuban policy is hypocritical, inconsistent, self-defeating, and contrary to our values--to give it the benefit of the doubt. We are a nation that prides itself on our tradition of encouraging the free flow of people and ideas. It is simply impossible to make a rational argument that Americans should be able to travel freely to North Korea or Iran but not to Cuba. You cannot make that argument. 
   I cannot believe that Members of Congress want the State Department or the Treasury Department deciding where their family members or constituents can travel, unless we are at war or there is a national emergency to justify it. But that is what is happening. 
   So because it is happening, it should not be surprising to anybody in this Chamber that the law is being violated by tens of thousands of Americans who are traveling to Cuba every year, and almost none of them are prosecuted. I kept running into people on the streets of Havana from the United States. I said: Do you have licenses or anything? No. We just came down. 
   I know people from my own State who drive an hour's drive away to Montreal and then fly to Cuba; people who go to the Hemingway Marina in their boats and then spend time in Cuba.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEAHY. And also promoting a complete disrespect for our laws because everybody knows they are not going to be prosecuted. It is a ridiculous thing. Why have this significant law on the books and then not prosecute it? Yet if it was being prosecuted, maybe we would hear more of a hue and cry to change it. 
   It is demeaning to the American people. It is damaging to the rule of law. We have been stuck with this absurd policy for years, even though almost everybody knows--and most say privately--that it makes absolutely no sense. It is beneath the dignity of a great country. 
   But I also say it not only helps strengthen Fidel Castro's grip on America, it has a huge advantage for our European competitors who are building relationships and establishing a base for future investment in a post-Castro Cuba. 
   When the Castro era ends is anybody's guess. I was a student in law school here in Washington shortly after the Bay of Pigs. I remember people talking: It will be any minute now--any minute now--Castro is out. 
   Well, I graduated in 1964, 35 years ago, and he is still there. President Castro is not a democratic leader; he is not going to become one. But maybe it is time we start pursuing a policy that is in our interest, not in a lobbyist's interest or somebody else's interest. 
   I should be clear about this amendment. It does not--I repeat and underscore  that--lift the U.S. embargo. It is narrowly worded so it does not do that. It permits travelers to go there but to carry only their personal belongings. We are not opening up a floodgate for imports to Cuba. 
   It limits the value of what Americans can bring home from Cuba to the current amount that we Government officials could bring back. That is $100. You are not going to start a huge trade in Cuban goods of whatever sort for $100, especially some of the more popular Cuban goods. 
   It reaffirms the President's authority to prohibit travel in times of war, armed hostilities, or if there is imminent danger to the health or safety of Americans. 
   Those who oppose this amendment, who want to prevent Americans from traveling to Cuba, will argue that spending dollars there helps prop up the Castro government. To some extent that is true, because the Cuban Government does run the economy. It also runs the schools, the hospitals, maintains roads. As is the U.S. Government, it is responsible for a full range of social services. Any money that goes into the Cuban economy supports the programs that support ordinary Cubans. 
   There is a black market in Cuba because no one can survive on their meager Government salary. So the income from tourism also fuels that informal sector and goes in the pockets of ordinary Cubans. 
   It is also worth mentioning that while the average Cuban cannot survive on his or her Government salary, you do not see the kind of abject poverty in Cuba that is so common elsewhere in Latin America. In Brazil, Panama, Mexico, or Peru, all countries we support openly, there are children searching through garbage in the street for scraps of food next to gleaming highrise hotels with limousines lined up outside. 
   In Cuba, with the exception of a tiny elite consisting of the President and his friends, everyone is poor. They do have access to some basics: A literacy rate of 95 percent; their life expectancy is about the same as that of Americans, even though the health system is focused on preventive care. 
   The point is that while there are obviously parts of the Cuban economy we would prefer not to support, as there is in North Korea, where we are sending aid, or China or Sudan or any country the government of which we disagree, much of the Cuban Government's budget benefits ordinary Cubans. So when opponents of this amendment argue that we cannot let Americans travel to Cuba because the money they spend there will prop up Castro, remember what they are not saying: The same dollars also help the Cuban people. 
   We are not going to weaken President Castro's grip on power by keeping Americans from traveling to Cuba. History has proven that. He is as firmly in control now as he was 40 years ago. So let us put a little sense into our relationship with Cuba. Let's have a little more faith in the power of ideas. 
   I would rather have U.S. citizens down there speaking about democracy than to have the only voice being the Government's voice speaking about our embargo. Let's have the courage to admit the cold war is over, but let's also get the State Department out of the business of telling our spouses and our children and our constituents where they can travel and spend their own money, especially in a tiny country where most people 
   are too poor to own an extra pair of shoes or clothes, a country that poses no security threat to us. 
   This amendment will do far more to win the hearts and minds of the Cuban people than the shortsighted approach of those who continue to pretend that nothing has changed since 1959. 
   I am not one who supports the nondemocratic actions of the Castro government. I have spoken very critically both here and in Cuba, of the trials and arrests of those who dared to speak out for a different government. But I was struck over and over again by Cubans of all walks of life basically saying, what are we afraid of? Do we deny our people, U.S. citizens, the ability to travel in other countries around the world? When I say no, we don't stop them from going to Iran, North Korea, China, Russia, Sudan, elsewhere, countries that are even on our terrorist list, but we do here, they shake their heads in disbelief--this in a country where, during the baseball game down there, when the United States flag was carried out on to the baseball field, the Cubans stood and cheered. We ought to think about that. 
   I yield the floor.

<DOCNO>106-leahy-vt-18-19990630</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let's be clear where we are. My friend from New Jersey speaks of the trial of the dissidents. Many who have spoken on the floor were critical of that. 
   I sat 10 feet across the table from Fidel Castro and strongly and harshly criticized the trial of the dissidents. I went to visit each of their families and strongly and harshly criticized that trial and spoke also on the floor. With my reputation on free speech issues, I would be the last person to yield to anybody on the question of criticism of those who try 
   cases against dissidents and those who spoke out against the Government. 
   I was very pleased to see our European allies speak out about it. But I note for the RECORD that while they spoke out on that, not one of those European allies that the Senator from New Jersey says now come over to our side--not one of those countries--has put limits on the travel of their people to Cuba as we have--not one. 
   The United States, the most powerful, wealthiest nation on Earth, limits its population in traveling only to this country. 
   The distinguished Senator from New Jersey said quite correctly that we limited travel of our people to China. It might not make much difference in what they did. I suspect it made some, but probably not much. I say that it probably wouldn't make any more difference in that Government than it does in the Government of Cuba. But we see a huge market there, so we are not going to do that anyway. 
   I suggest that during the cold war the fact was that we encouraged travel to places like the Soviet Union and China, and we got a diversity of views. Our thoughts and our views were heard more and more, not as much as we would like but more and more. 
   The Holy Father spoke out, as did most of us in this body, about the trial of the dissidents. But I point out that the Holy Father has never withdrawn his very strong criticism of the United States.

   One last thing: We indicted, and we are using our criminal justice system to try, Cuban spies, just as we have Russian spies, Chinese spies, Japanese spies, Israeli spies, and spies from even our NATO allies. We have done that. We have not broken our relationships with any one of those countries when we have done that, and some of the things some of those countries have done to us have been very serious crimes, indeed.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am encouraged that the Senate confirmed five of the judicial nominees from the 45 pending before us. I am glad that the District Courts in Mississippi, South Dakota, Texas, Connecticut, and California will soon have additional judicial resources. I only wish that were true for the 69 other vacancies around the country. 
   In particular, I look forward to the Committee finally approving the nomination of Marsha Berzon to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals this week and would ask the Majority Leader to take up that long-delayed nomination with the same expedition that is being. Fully one-quarter of the active judgeships authorized for that Court remain vacant, as they have been for several years. The Judicial Conference recently requested that Ninth Circuit judgeships be increased in light of its workload by an additional five judges. That means that while Ms. Berzon's nomination has been pending, and five other nominations are pending to the Ninth Circuit, that Court has been forced to struggle through its extraordinary workload with 12 fewer judges than it needs. 
   Marsha Berzon is an outstanding nominee. By all accounts, she is an exceptional lawyer with extensive appellate experience, including a number of cases heard by the Supreme Court. She has the strong support of both California Senators and a well-qualified rating from the American Bar Association. 
   She was initially nominated in January 1998, almost 17 months ago. She participated in an extensive two-part confirmation hearing before the Committee back on July 30, 1998. Thereafter she received a number of sets of written questions from a number of Senators and responded in August. A second round of written questions was sent and she responded by the middle of September. Despite the efforts of Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator KENNEDY, Senator SPECTER and myself to have her considered by the Committee, she was not included on an agenda and not voted on during all of 1998. Her nomination was returned to the President without action by this Committee or the Senate in late October. 
   This year the President renominated Ms. Berzon in January. She participated in her second confirmation hearing two weeks ago, was sent additional sets of written questions, responded and got and answered another question. I do not know why these questions were not asked last year. I do hope that the Committee will vote to report her nomination to the Senate on Thursday and that the Senate will finally, at long last, take the opportunity to confirm her to the federal bench. 
   The saga of this brilliant lawyer and good person is a long one, but it is not an isolated story. Hers is not even the longest pending nomination. That distinction belongs to Judge Richard Paez who was initially nominated in January 1996--over three and one half years ago--favorably reported by this Committee last year but not voted upon by the Senate. He was renominated in January, as well. His nomination is in limbo before the Senate Judiciary Committee, more than three years after this fine Hispanic judge was first nominated by the President. 
   In addition, there is the nomination of Justice Ronnie L. White to the federal court in Missouri, a nomination I spoke to the Senate about earlier this week. This past weekend marked the 2-year anniversary of the nomination of this outstanding jurist to what is now a judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Missouri. He is currently a member of the Missouri Supreme Court. 
   He was nominated by President Clinton in June of 1997, 2 years ago. It took 11 months before the Senate would even allow him to have a confirmation hearing. His nomination was then reported favorably on a 13 to 3 vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 21, 1998. Senators HATCH, THURMOND, GRASSLEY, SPECTER, KYL, and DEWINE were the Republican members of the Committee who voted for him along with the Democratic members. Senators ASHCROFT, ABRAHAM and SESSIONS voted against him.  
   Even though he had been voted out overwhelmingly, he sat on the calendar, and the nomination was returned to the President after 16 months with no action. 
   The President has again renominated him. I have called again upon the Senate Judiciary Committee to act on this qualified nomination. Justice White deserves better than benign neglect. The people in Missouri deserve a fully qualified and fully staffed Federal bench. 
   Justice White has one of the finest records--and the experience and standing--of any lawyer that has come before the Judiciary Committee. He has served in the 
   Missouri legislature, the office of the city counselor for the City of St. Louis, and he was a judge in the Missouri Court of Appeals for the Eastern District of Missouri before his current service as the first African American ever to serve on the Missouri Supreme Court. 
   Having been voted out of Committee by a 4-1 margin, having waited for 2 years, this distinguished African American at least deserves a vote, up or down. Senators can stand up and say they will vote for or against him, but let this man have his vote. 
   Twenty-four months after being nominated and after being renominated five months ago, the nomination remains pending without action before the Senate Judiciary Committee. People like Justice Ronnie L. White deserve to have their nominations treated with dignity and dispatch. Twenty-four months is far too long to have to wait for Senate action. 
   The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court wrote in his Year-End Report in 1997: ``Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under the 101 judges it confirmed in 1994.'' He went on to note: ``The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.'' 
   For the last several years I have been urging the Judiciary Committee and the Senate to proceed to consider and confirm judicial nominees more promptly and without the years of delay that now accompany so many nominations. I hope the Committee will not delay any longer in reporting the nomination of Justice Ronnie L. White to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri and that the Senate will finally act on the nomination of this fine African-American jurist. 
   In explaining why he chose to withdraw from consideration after waiting 15 months for Senate consideration, another minority nominee, Jorge Rangel, wrote to the President and explained: 
   ``Our judicial system depends on men and women of good will who agree to serve when asked to do so. But public service asks too much when those of us who answer the call to service are subjected to a confirmation process dominated by interminable delays and inaction. Patience has its virtues, but it also has its limits''. 
   Justice White has been exceedingly patient. He remains one of the 10 longest-pending judicial nominations before the Senate, along with Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon. 
   Acting to fill judicial vacancies is a constitutional duty that the Senate--and all of its members--are obligated to fulfill. In its unprecedented slowdown in the handling of nominees since the 104th Congress, the Senate is shirking its duty. That is wrong and should end. 
   As the Senate recesses for the Independence Day holiday, I am glad to see that the Senate is taking a few small steps toward responsible action by confirming five qualified District Court nominees. I will continue to work to see that the scores of remaining nominees be treated fairly.

   I compliment Robin Cleveland, who has worked so hard at trying to balance the competing interests of so many Senators on both sides of the aisle, as well as Billy Piper and Jennifer Chartrand; and on my side, the indefatigable Tim Rieser, a man who has not slept since it was announced we might go to this bill a month or so ago. He has, again, maintained the remarkable Rieser filing cabinet, which is primarily in his head, knowing all the ins and outs of this bill and handling it so well. 
   He was ably assisted by Cara Thanassi. Ms. Thanassi began a few years ago on our staff. She has grown enormously in talent and ability and was absolutely essential in this work. 
   In working with the Senator from Kentucky, we have tried to accommodate each other on issues, even though on some issues we obviously have a different philosophy. We have respected each other and accommodated each other and tried to make sure a bipartisan piece of legislation came through. I think the resulting vote today shows that bipartisanship on foreign policy was maintained. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I had planned to be giving a statement on final passage of the ``Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children Protection Act of 1999.'' Unfortunately, I cannot do this, because just as there was last year, there continues to be a hold up on passing this important legislation. We could and should have passed this legislation last year. We could and should pass this legislation today. 
   Last year we missed that opportunity when the Republican majority in both Houses of Congress played partisan games and tried to use this noncontroversial authorization bill as a vehicle to insist on conferencing a much-criticized Republican juvenile justice bill. That procedural gimmick cost us valuable time to get this legislation enacted. 
   The majority was roundly criticized. The Washington Post went so far as to call the Republican Majority's short-circuit conference tactic ``faintly absurd.'' The San Francisco Chronicle used even stronger terms, calling it ``sneaky maneuvering and Byzantine procedural moves.'' The Philadelphia Inquirer's reaction to this tactic was: ``Shame on the House. And shame on the Senate if it approves this bill as is, without debate.'' The New York Times labeled this maneuver a ``stealth assault on juvenile justice.'' 
   By contrast to last year, at least in the Senate, procedural ambushes on juvenile justice legislation have been eschewed and we were given the opportunity last month to have full and fair debate. After significant improvements through amendments, the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill passed the Senate on May 20, 1999 by a strong bipartisan vote. 
   Similarly, I am pleased that the Leahy-Hatch substitute to this bill, the Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children Protection Act of 1999, overwhelmingly passed the Senate on April 19. In late May, the House of Representatives followed suit. 
   The House, however, inserted new language, not included in the Senate-passed bill. This new language includes two studies and language regarding the ``consolidated review of applications" for grants under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. 
   The first study mandates the Secretary of HHS to examine the percent of runaways who leave home because of sexual abuse. The study is not funded and sets an unreasonable time frame. The second instructs the Secretary of Education to commission a $2.1 million study by the National Academy of Sciences on the antecedents of school violence in urban, suburban, and rural schools, including the incidents of school violence that occurred in Pearl, Mississippi; Paducah, Kentucky; Jonesboro, Arkansas; Springfield, Oregon; Edinboro, Pennsylvania; Fayetteville, Tennessee; Littleton, Colorado; and Conyers, Georgia. The study must include the impact of cultural influences and exposure to the media, video games, and the Internet. 
   It is my understanding that this school violence study was slipped into the legislation after the House committee reported the bill. In essence this bill seeks to mandate funding from the Department of Education, although this authorizing legislation, and sets an unreasonable time frame for a thoughtful study to be conducted. I do not support such efforts to bypass the consideration of the Appropriations Committees. 
   The juvenile violence study inserted into S. 249 also duplicates numerous studies in, S. 254, the Senate-passed juvenile justice bill. The studies in S. 254 include: 
   Study of Marketing Practices of Motion Picture, Recording, and Video/Personal Computer Game Industries. The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice are directed to study the extent of the entertainment industry's marketing of unsuitable materials to minors and the industry's enforcement of the current rating systems. 
   Study. This section instructs the Comptroller General to conduct a study on (1) the incidents of school-based violence; (2) impediments to combating school-based violence; (3) promising initiatives for addressing school-based violence; and (4) crisis preparedness of school personnel and law enforcement officials. 
   School Violence Research. This section instructs the Attorney General to establish a research center that will serve as a clearinghouse for school violence research at the National Center for Rural Law Enforcement in Little Rock, Arkansas. 
   National Commission on Character Development. This section creates a National Commission on Character Development to study and make recommendations with respect to the impact of cultural influences on developing and instilling character in America's youth. 
   Study of Marketing Practices of the Firearms Industry. This section directs the Federal Trade Commission and the Attorney General to conduct a study of the marketing practices of the firearms industry to determine the extent to which the firearms industry advertises its products to juveniles. 
   National Media Campaign Against Violence. This section creates a $25 million national media campaign targeted to parents and youth to reduce and prevent violence by young Americans. The campaign will be operated by the National Crime Prevention Council with the consultation of national, statewide or community-based youth organizations.  
   Behavioral and Social Science Research on Youth Violence. This section authorizes the National Institutes of Health, acting through the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, to conduct a comprehensive study on the causes and prevention of youth violence. 
   National Youth Violence Commission. This subtitle establishes a Commission composed of 16 members to conduct a comprehensive factual study of incidents of youth violence in order to determine the root causes of such violence by studying the involvement of teachers and school administrators, trends in family relationships, alienation of youth from the families and peer groups, availability of firearms to youth, impact of youth violence on youth, effects on youth of depictions of violence in the media, and the availability of information regarding the construction of weapons. The Commission will make recommendations to the President and Congress to address the causes of youth violence and reduce incidents of youth violence in the form of a report which shall be submitted no later than 1 year after the date on which the Commission first meets. 
   The youth violence study inserted into S. 249 by the House also duplicates ongoing efforts by President Clinton. In August 1998, the Departments of Justice and Education released ``Early Warning, Timely Response: A Guide to Safe Schools.'' This guide provides schools and communities with information on how to identify the early warning signs and take action steps to prevent and respond to school violence. Every school in the nation received a copy of the guide. 
   In October 1998 at the White House Conference the President released the first Annual Report on School Safety. The report includes an analysis of all existing national school crime data and an overview of state and local crime reporting; examples of schools and strategies that are successfully reducing school violence, drug use and class disruption; actions that parents can take locally to combat school crime; and resources available to schools and communities to help create safe, disciplined and drug-free schools. 
   On April 1, 1999, a new Safe Schools/Healthy Students Initiative was announced by Attorney General Janet Reno, Secretary of Education Richard Riley and Surgeon General David Satcher, M.D., to provide 50 communities with up to $3 million per year for three years to link existing and new services and activities into a comprehensive community-wide approach to violence prevention and healthy child development. It is based on evidence that a comprehensive, integrated community-wide approach is an effective way to promote healthy childhood development and address the problems of school violence and drug abuse. 
   On June 1, 1999 the President directed the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice to conduct a joint study of the marketing practices of entertainment industries to determine whether these industries are marketing to children violent and other material that is rated for adults. 
   There are many more studies and activities I could list, but I think my point has been made. 
   I regret that the House has again, as in the last Congress, has taken a clean bill and chosen to add extraneous matters. Rather than allow this tactic to delay passage of this already long-delayed and much-needed authorization for a number of worthwhile programs, I will not insist that the House amendment be stricken at this time. I will look to reconsider it in the course of the conference on the S. 254, the Hatch-Leahy juvenile crime legislation. 
   The other language inserted by the House that causes me concern is the ``consolidated review of grant application.'' In the Leahy-Hatch Senate bill we were careful to make clear the continuation of current law governing the minimum grants available for small States under Basic Center grants program. 
   My concern about the consolidation language, however, has been abated after I received assurances from Secretary Shalala that small States will in no way be disadvantaged from receiving funding at current levels or above. If small States, like Vermont, effectively compete for national competitive grants programs, that is to their additional benefit and will not reduce the small State minimums in important programs like the Basic Center grants program. 
   In order to address my concern, on May 26, I sent a letter to Secretary Shalala asking that the Department guarantee that the House bill, like the Senate bill, preserves the current funding mechanism under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. On June 7, through Secretary Shalala's Assistant Secretary for Legislation, Rich Tarplin, I received such assurance and with that, I am pleased to be working to expedite the enactment of this legislation. 
   I thank Secretary Shalala and Assistant Secretary Rich Tarplin for making explicit that small States like Vermont will not be disadvantaged by the language added by the House. In addition, I thank Barbara Clark, of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Legislation, for her tireless work over too many years to see through the reauthorization of these programs. I hope all of our efforts are rewarded with passage of S. 249 as soon as possible.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am also disappointed that the House chose to scale back the authorization of these program from five years as passed by the Senate to four years. 
   The bottom line, however, is that the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children have gone without authorization for too long. We should pass this legislation without further delay. 
   I have been able to clear this bill on my side of the aisle. Unfortunately, the Republicans have not been able to do the same and are, once again, holding up enactment of this legislation. The holdup on passage of this already long-delayed and much needed authorization for a number of worthwhile programs to provide assistance to at risk children and their families must be put to an end. 
   The Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children Protection Act of 1999 authorizes a variety of critical programs for our nation's most at risk children and youth--those who are missing or have been exploited and those who have run away or been forced from home or are homeless. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children provides extremely worthwhile and effective assistance to children and families facing crises across the U.S. and around the world. In 1998, the National Center helped law enforcement officers locate over 5,000 missing children. They also handled 132,357 telephone calls to their hotline, which included calls to report a missing child, to request information or assistance and to provide leads on missing or potentially exploited children. This figure includes 10,904 reported leads or sightings of missing children, an increase of 25 percent over such leads in 1997. 
   Since 1984, the National Center has helped investigate more than 80 cases involving Vermont children who have been reported missing. They have had extraordinary success in resolving these cases, some of which have taken several years and have involved out of state or international negotiations. I want to thank Ernie Allen and all of the dedicated employees and volunteers associated with the National Center for their help in these matters. 
   The National Center serves a critical role as a clearinghouse of resources and information for both family members and law enforcement officers. They have developed a network of hotels and restaurants which provides free services to parents in search of their children and have also developed extensive training programs. The National Center has trained 728 sheriffs and police chiefs from across the U.S. in recent years, including police chiefs from Dover, Hartford, Brattleboro and Winooski, Vermont, as well as members of the Vermont State Police. They have trained an additional 150,000 other officers in child sexual exploitation and the detection of missing children since 1984. 
   The National Center is also a leader in reducing the number of infant abductions by educating nurses, security staffs and hospitals. A seminar held in Vermont, trained 250 nurses and security personnel, should provide greater  peace of mind to new parents in my home State. 
   Most recently, they have expanded their role in combating the sexual exploitation of children by going on-line. Last year, they launched their ``CyberTipline'' which allows Internet users to report suspicious activities linked to the Internet, including child pornography and the potential enticement of children on-line. In the second half of 1998, they received over 4,000 leads from the CyberTipline which resulted in numerous arrests. I applaud the ongoing work of the Center and hope that we will promptly pass this bill so that they can proceed with their important activities with fewer funding concerns. 
   The National Center established an international division some time ago and has been working to fulfil the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Last year the National Center held a conference on international concerns with child abductions and international custody battles between separated parents from different countries. 
   The other important piece of this legislation is the reauthorization of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act which distributes funding to local community programs on the front lines assisting the approximately 1.3 million children and youth each year who are homeless or have left or been forced from their families for a variety of reasons. Those who provide services pursuant to these programs and those who are the beneficiaries of those services are far too important to be left hanging. In a Congress in which the budget and appropriations processes have given way to short-lived spending authority, they all deserve the reassurance of reauthorization and a commitment to funding. Only then will our State youth service bureaus and other shelter and service providers be able plan, design and implement the local programs necessary to make the goals of the Act a reality. 
   In 1974, Congress passed the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act as Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. The inclusion of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act in this legislation recognized that young people who were effectively homeless were in need of shelter, guidance and supervision, rather than punishment, and should be united with their families wherever possible. 
   Since 1974, the programs that make up the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act have evolved to meet the complex problems faced by our young people, their families and our communities. Over the last decade, as a nation, we have witnessed an increase in teen pregnancy rates, drug and alcohol abuse beginning as early as grade school, child physical and sexual abuse, and a soaring youth suicide rate. 
   Since 1989, the transitional living program has been part of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. This program, which was developed by my former colleague Senator Simon, has filled a gap in the needs of older youth to help them make the transition to independent living situations. 
   The majority of these program in Vermont are run by the Vermont Coalition of Runaway and Homeless Youth. The Vermont Coalition is a community-based network comprised of member programs that provide crisis response, emergency shelter, counseling, and other services to troubled youth throughout Vermont counties. 
   The programs we are seeking to reauthorize include those directed at young people who have had some kind of alcohol or other drug problem. The isolation in rural areas can lead to serious substance abuse problems. It is difficult to reach young people in rural areas and it is difficult for them to find the services they need. In Vermont, these drug abuse prevention programs provide essential outreach services. 
   Service providers are being challenged as never before with an increasingly complex set of problems affecting young people and their families. Now is not the time to abandon them. There is consensus among services providers that young people seeking services and their families are increasingly more troubled--as evidenced by reports of family violence, substance abuse and the effects of an array of economic pressures. These services may well be the key to breaking through the isolation of street youth, their mistrust of adults, and their reluctance to get involved with public or private providers. 
   The programs embodied in S. 249, the Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children Protection Act, are important and should not once again be held hostage to the controversial debate on juvenile crime.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support S. 768, which was significantly improved during the Judiciary Committee mark up with a substitute amendment that I cosponsored with Senators SESSIONS and DEWINE. This important legislation will close a gap in Federal law that has existed for many years. S. 768 establishes authority for Federal jurisdiction over crimes committed by individuals accompanying our military overseas and court-martial jurisdiction over Department of Defense employees and contractors accompanying the Armed Forces on contingency missions outside the United States during times of war or national emergency declared by the President or the Congress. 
   Civilians accompanying the Armed Forces have been subject to court-martial jurisdiction when ``accompanying or serving with the Armies of the United States in the field'' since the Revolutionary War. See McCune v. Kilpatrick, 53 F. Supp. 80, 84 (E.D. Va. 1943). It is only since the start of the Cold War that American troops, accompanied by civilian dependents and employees, have been stationed overseas in peace time. Provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice provide for the court-martial of civilians accused of crimes while accompanying the armed forces in times of peace or war. The provisions allowing for peace time court-martial of civilians were found unconstitutional by a series of Supreme Court cases beginning with Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1 (1957). With foreign nations often not interested in prosecuting crimes against Americans, particularly when committed by an American, the result is a jurisdictional ``gap'' that allows some civilians to literally get away with murder. 
   A report by the Overseas Jurisdiction Advisory Committee submitted to Congress in 1997, cited cases in which host countries declined to prosecute serious crimes committed by civilians accompanying our Armed Forces. These cases involved the sexual molestation of dependent girls, the stabbing of a serviceman and drug trafficking to soldiers. The individuals who committed these crimes against service men and women or their dependents were not prosecuted in the host country and were free to return to the United States and continue their lives as if the incidents had never occurred. The victims of these awful crimes are left with no redress for the suffering they endured. 
   This inability to exercise Federal jurisdiction over individuals accompanying our armed forces overseas has caused problems. During the Vietnam War, Federal jurisdiction over civilians was not permissible since war was never declared by the Congress. Major General George S. Prugh said, in his text on legal issues arising during the Vietnam War, that the inability to discipline civilians ``became a cause for major concern to the U.S. command.'' 
   More recently, Operation Desert Storm involved the deployment of 4,500 Department of Defense civilians and at least 3,000 contractor employees. Similarly large deployments of civilians have been repeated in contingency operations in Somalia, Haiti, Kuwait and Rwanda. Although crime by civilians accompanying our armed forces in Operation Desert Storm was 
   rare, the Department of Defense did report that four of its civilian employees were involved in significant criminal misconduct ranging from transportation of illegal firearms to larceny and receiving stolen property. One of these civilians was suspended without pay for 30 days while no action was taken on the remaining three. 
   Due to the lack of Federal jurisdiction over civilians in a foreign country, administrative remedies such as dismissal from the job, banishment from the base, suspension without pay, or returning the person to the United States are often the only remedies available to military authorities to deal with civilian offenders. The inadequacy of these remedies to address the criminal activity of civilians accompanying our Armed Forces overseas results in a lack of deterrence and an inequity due to the harsher sanctions imposed upon military personnel who committed the same crimes as civilians. 
   I expect the deployment of civilians in Kosovo and elsewhere will be relatively crime free, but regardless of the frequency of its use, the gap that allows individuals accompanying our military personnel overseas to go unpunished for heinous crimes must be closed. Our service men and women and those accompanying them deserve justice when they are victims of crime. That is why I introduced this provision as part of the Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act with other Democratic Members, both last year as S. 2484 and again on January 19 of this year, as S. 9. 
   I had some concerns with certain aspects of S. 768 that were not included in my version of this legislation, and I am pleased that we were able to address those concerns in the Sessions-Leahy-DeWine substitute. For example, the original bill would have extended court-martial jurisdiction over DOD employees and contractors accompanying our Armed Forces overseas. The Supreme Court in Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1 (1957), Kinsella v. Singleton, 361 U.S. 234 (1960) and Toth v. Quarles, 350 U.S. 11 (1955), has made clear that court-martial jurisdiction may not be constitutionally applied to crimes committed in peacetime by persons accompanying the armed forces overseas, or to crimes committed by a former member of the armed services. 
   The substitute makes clear that this extension of court-martial jurisdiction applies only in times when the armed forces are engaged in a ``contingency operation'' involving a war or national emergency declared by the Congress or  the President. I believe this comports with the Supreme Court rulings on this issue and cures any constitutional infirmity with the original language. 
   In addition, the original bill would have deemed any delay in bringing a person before a magistrate due to transporting the person back to the U.S. from overseas as ``justifiable.'' I was concerned that this provision could end up excusing lengthy and unreasonable delays in getting a civilian, who was arrested overseas, before a U.S. Magistrate, and thereby raise yet other constitutional concerns. 
   The Sessions-Leahy-DeWine substitute cures that potential problem by removing the problematic provision and relying instead on Rule 5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. This rule requires that an arrested person be brought before a magistrate to answer charges without unnecessary delays, and will apply to the removal of a civilian from overseas to answer charges in the United States. 
   Finally, S. 768 as introduced authorized the Department of Defense to determine which foreign officials constitute the appropriate authorities to whom an arrested civilian should be delivered. In my proposal for this legislation I required that DOD make this determination in consultation with the Department of State. I felt this would help avoid international faux pax. I am pleased that the Sessions-Leahy substitute adopted my approach to this issue and requires consultation with the Department of State. 
   I am glad the legislation which I and other Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee originally introduced both last year and again on January 19 of this year, is finally being considered, and I urge its prompt passage.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is interesting when you think of the debate we are in. Here we are as Americans in the richest and most powerful country the world has ever known. There is really no comparison to it. We have the most highly trained and capable health professionals of any nation. Our technology leads the way on the frontiers of medical science. People come from all over the world to train and to be educated in medical science. But at that same time, millions of American families in our Nation with its first-class medical expertise are subject to second-class treatment because of the policies and practices of our health insurance system. 
   I have to ask, is it really beyond the ability of this great Nation to ensure access and accountability to help these families? Of course it is not. Is this an important enough problem that solving it should be a high priority for this body, the Senate? Of course it is. 
   Although the President and many of the Senators have done their utmost for years to encourage the Congress to act, I am afraid that the Republican leadership long ago decided that protection for those Americans insured through private managed care plans was just not a priority for us--this despite the fact that we have had calls from nonpartisan groups from every corner of the Nation. The Republican leadership has refused to schedule a full and reasonable debate to consider the vote on the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Certainly from my experience in the Senate it is clear that the only step left is, of course, to bring the Patients' Bill of Rights directly to the floor. I believe we should keep it there until the Republicans, who are in the majority, agree that it merits the priority consideration that we--and I believe most of the American people, Republican and Democrat--strongly believe it does. 
   I applaud Senator KENNEDY, Senator DURBIN, and many others for leading this vigilance to save the Patients' Bill of Rights. I commend the distinguished Senate Democratic leader, Mr. DASCHLE, for continuing to insist on a reasonable time agreement as he attempts to negotiate with our friends on the other side of the aisle. 
   I urge our friends in the Republican Party to make the Patients' Bill of Rights a high priority. Let's get on with the debate, vote it up or vote it down, and then go on to the other matters, things such as the agriculture appropriations bill and other business before us. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights that we Democrats have presented reflects a fundamental expectation that Americans have about their health care. That expectation is that doctors--not insurance companies--should practice medicine. 
   To really sum up our Patients' Bill of Rights, we are saying that doctors--not insurance companies--should be the first decisionmakers in your health care. The rights that we believe Americans should have in dealing with health insurers are not vague theories; they are practical, sensible safeguards. You can hear it if you talk to anybody who has sought health care. You can hear it if you talk to anybody who provides health care. I hear it from my wife, who is a registered nurse. I hear it from her experiences on the medical-surgical floors in the hospitals she has worked in. 
   If you want to see how some of them would work in practice, come with me to Vermont. My state has already implemented a number of these protections for the Vermonters who are insured by managed care plans. I am proud Vermont has been recognized nationally for its innovation and achievements in protecting patients' rights. 
   I consistently hear from Vermonters who are thankful for the actions that the Vermont legislature has taken to ensure patients are protected. But I also hear from those who do not yet fall under these protections. 
   This Congress should waste not more time and instead make a commitment to the American people that we will fully debate the Patients' Bill of Rights. We must protect those Vermonters who are not covered under current state law. And we must act now to cover every other American who expects fair treatment from their managed care plan. 
   I am one of many in this body who firmly believe in the importance of this bill. I hope the leadership is listening and I hope they hear what we are saying. It is what Americans are saying. 
   As I stated at the beginning of this message, millions of American families in this Nation of first-class medical expertise are subject to second-class treatment because of the policies and practices of our health insurance system. 
   We have heard a lot of ``our bill has this,'' and ``their bill doesn't have that.'' Here are some of the facts. Our Patients' Bill of Rights will protect every patient covered by private managed care plans. And it offers protections that make sense, such as ensuring a patient has access to emergency room services in any situation that a ``prudent layperson'' would regard as an emergency, guaranteeing access to specialists for patients with special conditions, and making sure that children's special needs are met, including access to pediatric specialists when they need it. 
   Our Patients' Bill of Rights provides strong protections for women. It will provide women with direct access to their ob/gyn for preventive care. Through successful research, we have learned that regular screening can prevent breast cancer and cervical cancer in women of all ages. 
   We stress the importance of regular visits to ob/gyns to the women in our lives: our mothers, our wives, our daughters, and our sisters. But we make it difficult for these women to receive care by requiring referrals and putting other obstacles in the way of their care. Let us make sure women have the direct access they need and deserve. 
   Our bill also will give women time to recover when they have undergone surgery. We should let doctors and patients determine if a lengthier hospital stay is necessary, and our bill would let them decide. 
   Health plans must be held accountable for their actions, just as doctors and hospitals are today. Out Patients Bill of Rights provides a variety of ways to achieve this goal. 
   First, patients must be able to appeal decisions made by their health plans. In our bill, any decision to deny, delay or otherwise overrule doctor-prescribed treatments could be appealed. And our bill says these appeals must be addressed in a timely manner, especially when the life of a patient is threatened. Patients must have the opportunity to question managed care decisions and insurance companies must be held accountable, especially when they decide to overrule the decisions of a trained health care providers.  
   Our bill would require an external appeals process through an independent body with the ability and the authority to resolve disputes in a variety of instances. We know this is often a successful way of mediating labor disputes. Why can't it work for our patients, too? 
   Finally, the Patients' Bill of Rights would allow patients to hold health plans liable for their decisions. This is essential. How can we justify holding our physicians responsible for decisions that they are not really making? Doctors must account for the decisions they make. Why shouldn't health insurers be responsible for theirs? 
   Differences between patients and their managed care plans can readily be resolved without going to court. But that will not and should not always be the case. We must extend this consumer protection to patients. 
   Mr. President, let us make the Patients' Bill of Rights the high priority that our families want it to be on our agenda.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the question of nominations. We are approaching another Senate recess. We ought to act on judicial nominations, the longstanding vacancies in the Federal courts around this country. This is the fourth extended Senate recess this year. So far this year, the Senate has confirmed only two judicial nominees for the longstanding vacancies that plague the Federal courts. That is one judge per calendar quarter; it is one half a judge per Senate vacation. We should do better. 
   Let me focus on one: Justice Ronnie White. This past weekend marked the 2-year anniversary of the nomination of this outstanding jurist to what is now a judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Missouri. He is currently a member of the Missouri Supreme Court. 
   He was nominated by President Clinton in June of 1997, 2 years ago. It took 11 months before the Senate would even allow him to have a confirmation hearing. His nomination was then reported favorably on a 13-3 vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 21, 1998. Senators HATCH, THURMOND, GRASSLEY, SPECTER, KYL and DEWINE were the Republican members of the committee who voted for him along with the Democratic members. Senators ASHCROFT, ABRAHAM, and SESSIONS voted against him. 
   Even though he had been voted out overwhelmingly, he sat on the calendar, and the nomination was returned to the President after 16 months with no action. 
   The President has again renominated him. I call again upon the Senate Judiciary Committee to act on this qualified nomination. Justice White deserves better than benign neglect. The people in Missouri deserve a fully qualified and fully staffed Federal bench. 
   Justice White has one of the finest records--and the experience and standing--of any lawyer that has come before the Judiciary Committee. He has served in the Missouri legislature, the office of the city counselor for the City of St. Louis, and he was a judge in the Missouri Court of Appeals for the Eastern District of Missouri before his current service as the first African American ever to serve on the Missouri Supreme Court. 
   Having been voted out of Committee by a 4-1 margin, having waited for 2 years, this distinguished African American at least deserves the respect of this Senate, and he should be allowed a vote, up or down. Senators can stand up and say they will vote for or against him, but let this man have his vote. 
   The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court wrote in his Year-End Report in 1997: ``Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under the 101 judges it confirmed in 1994.'' He went on to note: ``The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.'' 
   For the last several years I have been urging the Judiciary Committee and the Senate to proceed to consider and confirm judicial nominees more promptly and without the years of delay that now accompany so many nominations. I hope the committee will not delay any longer in reporting the nomination of Justice Ronnie L. White to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri and that the Senate will finally act on the nomination of this fine African-American jurist. 
   I have been concerned for the last several years that it seems women and minority nominees are being delayed and not considered. I spoke to the Senate about this situation on May 22, June 22 and, again, on October 8 last year. Over the last couple of years the Senate has failed to act on the nominations of Judge James A. Beaty, Jr. to be the first African-American judge on the Fourth Circuit; Jorge C. Rangel to the Fifth Circuit; Clarence J. Sundram to the District Court for the Northern District of New York; Anabelle Rodriguez to the District Court in Puerto Rico; and many others. In explaining why he chose to withdraw from consideration after waiting 15 months for Senate consideration, Jorge Rangel wrote to the President and explained:  
   Our judicial system depends on men and women of good will who agree to serve when asked to do so. But public service asks too much when those of us who answer the call to service are subjected to a confirmation process dominated by interminable delays and inaction. Patience has its virtues, but it also has its limits.  
   Last year, Senator KENNEDY observed that women nominated to federal judgeships ``are being subjected to greater delays by Senate Republicans than men. So far in this Republican Congress, women nominated to our federal courts are four times--four times--more likely than men to be held up by the Republican Senate for more than a year.'' 
   Justice White remains one of the 10 longest-pending judicial nominations before the Senate, along with Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon. 
   I have noted that Justice White's nomination has already been pending for over two years. By contrast, I note that in the entire four years of the Bush Administration, when there was a Democratic majority in the Senate, only three nominations took as long as nine months from initial nomination to confirmation--that is three nominations taking as long as 270 days in four years. 
   Last year the average for all nominees confirmed was over 230 days and 11 nominees confirmed last year alone took longer than nine months: Judge William Fletcher's confirmation took 41 months--the longest-pending judicial nomination in the history of the United States; Judge Hilda Tagle's confirmation took 32 months, Judge Susan Oki Mollway's confirmation took 30 months, Judge Ann Aiken's confirmation took 26 months, Judge Margaret McKeown's confirmation took 24 months, Judge Margaret Morrow's confirmation took 21 months, Judge Sonia Sotomayor's confirmation took 15 months, Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer's confirmation took 14 months, Judge Dan Polster's confirmation took 12 months, and Judge Victoria Roberts' confirmation took 11 months. Of these 11, eight are women or minority nominees. Another was Professor Fletcher, held up, in large measure because of opposition to his mother, Judge Betty Fletcher. 
   In 1997, of the 36 nominations eventually confirmed, 10 took more than 9 months before a final favorably Senate vote and 9 of those 10 extended over a year to a year and one-half. Indeed, in the four years that the Republican majority has controlled the Senate, the nominees that are taking more than 9 months has grown almost tenfold from 3 nominations to almost 30 over the last four years. 
   In 1996, the Republican Senate shattered the record for the average number of days from nomination to confirmation for judicial confirmation. The average rose to a record 183 days. In 1997, the average number of days from nomination to confirmation rose dramatically yet again, and that was during the first year of a presidential term. From initial nomination to confirmation, the average time it took for Senate action on the 36 judges confirmed in 1997 broke the 200-day barrier  for the first time in our history. It was 212 days. 
   Unfortunately, that time is still growing and the average is still rising to the detriment of the administration of justice. Last year the Senate broke its dismal record. The average time from nomination to confirmation for the 65 judges confirmed in 1998 was over 230 days. 
   Acting to fill judicial vacancies is a constitutional duty that the Senate--and all of its members--are obligated to fulfill. In its unprecedented slowdown in the handling of nominees since the 104th Congress, the Senate is shirking its duty. That is wrong and should end. 
   As the Senate recesses for the Independence Day holiday, I hope Senators will reflect on this record and the need to maintain the independence of the judiciary by acting more promptly on the nominations of the many fine men and women pending before us. We have 45 nominations still pending, the Senate having only acted on only two all year. The courts are faced with 72 vacancies, many of extensive duration. The Senate recesses with a sorry record of inaction on judicial nominations.

   Mr. LEAHY. We represent, I believe, the two States with the lowest crime rates in the country. Our States are about the population of the District of Columbia. I expect either one of us could pick out a 2- or 3-day period last year or in this past calendar year in the District of Columbia where more murders occurred than our States put together for the year. 
   Without sounding like a poster child for the gun lobby or something else, I express one frustration, also watching what has happened in this recent tragic killing of a grandmother, when what appears to be, at least if the news accounts are accurate, people arguing over whose car bumped into whose car, and suddenly there is a gang on the street armed like the marines landing in Kosovo, and now with the nationwide spotlight on this crime, the police go into action and suddenly start confiscating guns. 
   I ask the Senator from North Dakota: Is it not his understanding, as it is mine, that the District of Columbia has virtually the toughest gun laws in the country? The carrying of these weapons or possession of them is a crime. Yet have you seen an awful lot of people go to prison for carrying these weapons, even though they are found with them all the time?

   Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield further, since he has already read that, if he will look at some of the numbers of unclosed cases, or the number of times when leads are not followed up, the number of complaints I have received in my office, and people making complaints to police departments that have never been followed up, witnesses never sought--we spend an awful lot more in law enforcement in this city than they do in the whole States of North Dakota and Vermont. There are a lot more people, a lot more officers available. I know many of them do excellent work, and they put their lives on the line, and some lose their lives. But I also know there are a lot of areas in this city where drug selling is out in the open and a matter of public knowledge, and where illegal possession of weapons is a matter of open knowledge, and nothing happens until the spotlight of one of these terrible tragedies occurs. 
   So I appreciate the Senator's comments.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment in support of a peaceful process of self-determination in East Timor. I am pleased that Senators FEINGOLD, REED, MCCONNELL, HARKIN, MOYNIHAN, CHAFEE, KOHL, JEFFORDS, KENNEDY, KERRY, FEINSTEIN, MURRAY, SCHUMER, BOXER, DURBIN, WELLSTONE, and WYDEN are cosponsoring this amendment. Many of them have worked hard on this issue for as long as they have been in the United States Senate. 
   I understand the amendment will be accepted. 
   Mr. President, today, the Indonesian Government has an historic opportunity to resolve a conflict that has been the cause of suffering and instability for 23 years. It has made a commitment to vote on August 21 or 22, on East Timor's future, and recognized its responsibility to ensure that the vote is free and fair. 
   On May 5th, when I introduced a similar resolution, I remarked on Indonesia's accomplishments in the past year: President Suharto relinquished power; the Indonesian Government endorsed a ballot on autonomy; and the United Nations, Portugal and Indonesia signed an agreement on the procedures for that vote. 
   There has been more progress in the past month. Democratic elections have been held and the first members of an international observer mission and police force arrived in East Timor. 
   The amendment that we are offering today recognizes many of the positive steps that have been taken. A year ago few people would have predicted that a settlement of East Timor's future would be in sight. 
   But it also expresses our deep concern that August 21st is quickly approaching, and current conditions in East Timor are far from conducive to holding a free and fair ballot. 
   Hundreds of civilians have been killed, injured or disappeared in ongoing violence by anti-independence militias armed by members of the Indonesian military for the purpose of sabotaging the vote. 
   The inclusion of anti-independence members in Indonesian forces responsible for establishing security in East Timor threatens the neutrality of the military and police, and violates the terms of the May 5th agreement. 
   International human rights monitors and humanitarian organizations continue to face problems gaining access to the island, and members of the press have been threatened. 
   This amendment calls on the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Treasury--acting through U.S. executive directors to international financial institutions--to immediately intensify their efforts to prevail upon the Indonesian Government to disarm and disband the anti-independence militias.  
   We should be prepared to use all the resources at our disposal, including our voice and vote at the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other international financial institutions, to convince the Indonesians to stop the violence. This is not only their responsibility, it is in their best interests. If the Indonesian military succeeds in sabotaging the vote, Indonesia will face international condemnation.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the international community has recognized the urgency of this situation. An international monitoring and police presence throughout East Timor is critical to creating a secure environment. 
   The Administration is shouldering its share of the costs of the UN monitors and police, and its members who arrived in East Timor several weeks ago already report some progress in stemming the violence. 
   But far more needs to be done. It is time for the Indonesian Government and military to do their part--to act decisively to ensure that a free and fair vote can occur. 
   This amendment reinforces what others have said and what the Indonesian Government has already committed to do. I thank the managers of the bill for accepting the amendment.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as thousands of Kosovar Albanians flood across the Macedonian and Albanian borders, we are getting the first reports of refugee landmine victims. Last week, two refugees were killed and another seriously injured as they hurried to return to their homes in Kosovo. 
   Just put this in perspective. Some 25 people have been injured or killed by mines in Kosovo since the refugees began returning. It is a senseless loss of life and it is tragic, but it is predictable. It is predictable because tens of thousands of landmines were left behind by Serb forces. Others were put there by the KLA. They litter fields, roads, and bridges, and they have even been left in houses. They have been left in booby traps. As sad as anything, there are mass graves marking the atrocities that have occurred there. And as family members go back to try to find out if their loved ones are in those graves, even some of the graves have been booby-trapped by landmines. 
   These landmines are the greatest threat to people on the ground, including NATO forces, and the number of innocent victims--children playing, farmers plowing their fields, women walking along the roads--will continue to rise. 
   It is one thing to conduct an air war with the latest laser-guided technology and, thankfully, there were no NATO casualties, but it is another thing to face an invisible enemy on the ground. In Bosnia, most U.S. casualties were from landmines. In Kosovo, too, mines are the invisible enemy. They can't distinguish between friend or foe, soldier or civilian, adult or child.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will close with this, as I have many other times. In the use of any weapons, there always will be questions as to who is right and who is wrong. But I have to think the use of landmines raises beyond a strategic question, raises the real moral question, and because the victims of landmines are so disproportionately civilian, we do get into moral questions. As the most powerful Nation on earth, and also the Nation most blessed with resources and advantages of any nation in history, I think we fail a moral duty if we don't do more to ban the use of antipersonnel landmines. 
   It is a child walking to school. It is a mother going to a stream to get water. It is a parent tilling what little fields they have. It is somebody trying to help out with medical care. It is a missionary. It is so many others--all on peaceful, proper pursuits of their lives. They are the ones who step on these landmines and are killed or maimed. The child who sees a shiny toy in the field and loses his arm and his face. It is the person who tries to save the child who steps on the mine itself. It is the refugee family trying to go back to the country that they were expelled from who are dying from them. We have to do more. 
   I wish there would be a day when there would never be another war. There will not be. We can't stop that. But we can take steps to stop the day that landmines will ever be used again. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in introducing four bills to reauthorize the Patent and Trademark Office, update the statutory damages available under the Copyright Act, make technical corrections to two new copyright laws enacted last year, and prevent trademark dilution. As the Chairman and I have already indicated in our June 11 joint statement, we hope that the Senate Judiciary Committee reports these bills promptly and that the Senate considers the bills without delay. 
   The introduction of these bills is a good start, but we must not lose sight of the other copyright and patent issues requiring our attention before the end of this Congress. The Senate Judiciary Committee has a full slate of intellectual property matters to consider and I am pleased to work on a bipartisan basis with the Chairman on an agenda to provide the creators and inventors of copyrighted and patented works with the protection they may need in our global economy, while at the same time providing libraries, educational institutions and other users with the clarity they need as to what constitutes a fair use of such works. 
   Among the other important intellectual property matters for us to consider are the following: 
   Distance Education. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing last month on the Copyright Office's thorough and balanced report on copyright and digital distance education. We need to address the legislative recommendations outlined in that report to ensure that our laws permit the appropriate use of copyrighted works in valid distance learning activities. 
   Patent Reform. A critical matter on the intellectual property agenda, important to the nation's economic future, is reform of our patent laws. I worked on a bipartisan basis in the last Congress to get the Omnibus Patent Act, S. 507, reported by the Judiciary Committee to the Senate by a vote of 177 to one, and then tried to have this bill considered and passed by the Senate. Unfortunately, the bill became stalled due to resistance by some in the majority. We should consider and pass this important legislation. 
   Madrid Protocol Implementation Act. I introduced this legislation, S. 671, to help American businesses, and especially small and medium-sized companies, protect their trademarks as they expand into international markets by conforming American trademark application procedures to the terms of the Protocol in anticipation of the U.S.'s eventual ratification of the treaty. Ratification by the United States of this treaty would help create a ``one stop'' international trademark registration process, which would be an enormous benefit for 
   American businesses. 
   Database Protection. I noted upon passage of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act last year that there was not enough time before the end of that Congress to give due consideration to the issue of database protection, and that I hoped the Senate Judiciary Committee would hold hearings and consider database protection legislation in this Congress, with a commitment to make more progress. I support legal protection against commercial misappropriation of collections of information, but am sensitive to the concerns raised by the Administration, the libraries, certain educational institutions, and the scientific community. This is a complex and important matter that I look forward to considering in this Congress. 
   Tampering with Product Identification Codes. Product identification codes provide a means for manufacturers to track their goods, which can be important to protect consumers in cases of defective, tainted or harmful products and to implement product recalls. Defacing, removing or tampering with product identification codes can thwart these tracking efforts, with potential safety consequences for American consumers. We should examine the scope of, and legislative solutions to remedy, this problem. 
   Online Trademark Protection or ``Cybersquatting.'' I have long been concerned with protection online of registered trademarks. Indeed, when the Congress passed the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, I noted that:  
   [A]lthough no one else has yet considered this application, it is my hope that this antidilution statute can help stem the use of deceptive Internet addresses taken by those who are choosing marks that are associated with the products and reputations of others. (CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, December 29, 1995, page S19312).  
   Last year, my amendment authorizing a study by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences of the effects on trademark holders of adding new top-level domain names and requesting recommendations on related dispute resolution procedures, was enacted as part of the Next Generation Internet Research Act. We have not yet seen the results of that study, and I understand that the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (I-CANN) and World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) are considering mechanisms for resolving trademark and other disputes over assignments of domain names in an expeditious and inexpensive manner. 
   This is an important issue both for trademark holders and for the future of the global Internet. While I share the concern of trademark holders over what WIPO has characterized as ``predatory and parasitical practices by a minority of domain registrants acting in bad faith'' to register famous or well-known marks of others--which can lead to consumer confusion or downright fraud--the Congress should tread carefully to ensure that any remedies do not impede or stifle the free flow of information on the Internet.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Vermont and the United States lost one of its most distinguished academics last winter. Leonard Rieser, a physicist, a professor, a dean, and chairman of the board of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, holder of so many titles that we couldn't repeat all of them, died at the same time his great gifts and talent were still expanding. 
   I knew Leonard and his wife, Rosemary, through their son, Tim Rieser. Tim has been the most extraordinary advisor to me for many years, and he holds the best attributes of his father: decency, a towering intellect, and a constant search for knowledge. 
   Leonard Rieser is a man who lived more in a decade than most people will live in a lifetime. He accomplished in a few years what others would be proud to have as their life's work. What is extraordinary is that he did it for decade after decade. 
   In Vermont and throughout the Nation, expressions of sorrow but also of admiration and gratitude for his life poured in. We have all benefited by his life. He leaves a great void, especially for his wife, his sons, Tim, Leonard, and Ken, his daughter, Abby, his grandchildren and all his friends.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to commend the distinguished senior Senator from Illinois for his statement. The Senator from Illinois represents one of the greatest States of our country, a significant and very large State, with millions of people, ranging from one of the best known, most dynamic cities not only in this country but in the world, and also with very small rural areas. I, in turn, represent a very small State, where the largest city is 40,000 people. We go down to a town of 40 people. But I couldn't help but think, while listening to the statement of my good friend from Illinois, about some of the letters he read. The names of the towns might be different, but we might have heard similar letters from Vermont. Sometimes the problems are compounded by the fact that we are a rural State. As he knows, in the rural areas of his great State the problems are even worse because of the distances they have to travel and the lack of choices they may have. I hope he will continue to speak because he speaks not just for the people of Illinois, but for the people of Vermont and everywhere else.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while we talk about the actions in the other body, it is fascinating to me what has happened in the dark of night. The members of the other body aren't controlling their destiny; it apparently was controlled by a powerful lobby in this country. For a while, the same thing happened in the U.S. Senate. I asked the question on the floor of the Senate: ``Who will run the Senate, the U.S. Senators or the powerful gun lobby?'' Finally, by the slimmest of margins, they answered the question and said that the U.S. Senate will represent the people of America. 
   I have watched how posturing and symbolism sometimes wins out over substance. Members of the other body are all sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States. They have taken the same oath that I and every Member of the Senate have taken. They flew in the face of the Constitution, a Supreme Court decision outlined in the Constitution, and said that we, the Members of the Congress, will say the 10 commandments shall be or may be put on schoolhouse walls. 
   Why did the House of Representatives do this and turn against the Constitution that they are sworn to uphold? Why? So that the students seeing it would be inspired to uphold the law. That's fascinating. We say that the other body will--the House of Representatives--will turn its back on the Constitution, and in so doing will encourage children who should look to them for leadership to uphold the laws of this country. It is an example that I cannot fathom. This is what they ought to do--work harder and make it possible for the parents of these children to spend more time with them, make it possible to have an educational system that can help teach the difference between right and wrong. Perhaps, if they are going to talk about the 10 commandments, they should remind the gun lobby of the fifth commandment: Thou shalt not kill.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on Wednesday of this week, I was fortunate to be present during the ceremony commemorating the presentation of the Congressional Gold Medal to Mrs. Rosa Parks. What an inspiring time. I heard Mrs. Parks, Reverend Jackson, and the President each take the occasion to remind us that the struggle for equality is not over. 
   I heard Jesse Norman, with that incomparable voice, sing to us both our National Anthem and really the anthem of the civil rights movement. Every one of us--black or white, old or young, man or woman, Republican or Democrat, were inspired by what we saw and heard. How could you not be inspired in the magnificent rotunda of the U.S. Capitol? 
   But then I went back to my office and I started asking myself, have we listened? I serve as the ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the committee still has pending before it, 
   waiting, the nomination of another who has dedicated his life's work to the rights of others. I asked the Judiciary Committee on Thursday, in the spirit of the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks, and in the tradition of Rosa Parks, that the committee recognize the quiet dignity and strength of Bill Lann Lee and send his nomination to the full Senate so that the U.S. Senate may, at long last, vote on that nomination and, I hope, confirm this fine American to full rank as the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. 
   Bill Lann Lee is the first Asian American to be nominated to head the Civil Rights Division in its 42-year history. He is currently serving as Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, as he has for almost 18 months. He has done an impressive job in enforcing our Nation's civil rights laws. Mr. Lee was originally nominated in July of 1997, almost exactly 2 years ago. Two years is too long to have to wait for a vote by the Senate on this nomination. I hope the Senate will be allowed the opportunity to vote on his nomination before the Fourth of July recess. 
   Six former Assistant Attorneys General for Civil Rights, from the Eisenhower administration through the Bush administration, wrote the Judiciary Committee in November of 1997 in support of this outstanding nominee: Harold Tyler, Burke Marshall, Stephen J. Pollak, J. Stanley Pottinger, Drew Days, and John R. Dunne. Nonetheless, the Senate did not vote, and Mr. Lee had to be renominated again in January of 1998 and, again, in March of 1999. 
   It is past time to do the right thing, the honorable thing, and report this qualified nominee to the Senate so the Senate may fulfill its constitutional duty under the advise and consent clause and vote on this nomination. In deference to the advise and consent power of the Senate, the President has not used his recess appointment power in connection with this nomination. 
   After consultation with the Senate in late 1997, the President chose to renominate Mr. Lee in January 1998. The Attorney General named him Acting Assistant Attorney General. When the Senate refused all last year to consider the nomination--not to vote him up or down, or not to even vote at all--the President sent that nomination to the Senate for a third time in a third succeeding year, in 1999. Now, no one can fairly contend that the Senate has not been respected. The President has gone the extra mile, and Mr. Lee has shown extraordinary patience during this extended period of Senate indifference to his nomination. 
   Acting Assistant Attorney General Lee is properly serving while his nomination remains pending. It is the responsibility of the Senate to vote on that nomination. I believe that in a fair and open vote on the merits of this nomination on the Senate floor, the Senate will embrace the opportunity to confirm this fine person, this dedicated public servant. They will confirm him. 
   If I am wrong, if the Senate were to disappoint me and all those who support this nomination, and if a majority of the Senate were to vote against the nomination, and then he could not continue to serve as Acting Assistant Attorney General--that is a mechanism Congress established by law, but it properly relies on a vote by the U.S. Senate. 
   Civil rights is about human dignity and opportunity. Bill Lann Lee's nomination ought to have the opportunity for an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. Twenty-three months and 3 sessions of Congress is too long for this nomination to have to wait. He should no longer be forced to ride in the ``back of the nominations bus,'' but be given the fair vote he deserves. 
   When Bill Lee appeared before our committee way back in 1997, he testified candidly about his views, his work and his values. He told us why he became a person who has dedicated his life to equal justice for all, specially when he talked about the treatment his parents received as immigrants. He told us how his parents faced prejudice almost every day here in this country. But Mr. Lee told us how, in spite of his father's personal treatment, the experience of prejudice he faced, the names he was called, and the slurs he had to  hear, his father, William Lee, remained a fierce American patriot and volunteered to serve in the U.S. Army Air Corps in World War II. 
   He never lost his belief in America. His father, William Lee, inspired his son, Bill, just as Bill Lann Lee now inspires his own children and countless others across the land. 
   This is what he told us:  
   My father is my hero, but I confess that I found it difficult for many years to appreciate his unflinching patriotism in the face of daily indignities. In my youth, I did not understand how he could remain so deeply grateful to a country where he and my mother faced so much intolerance. But I began to appreciate that the vision he had of being an American was a vision so compelling that he could set aside the momentary ugliness. He know that the basic American tenet of equality of opportunity is the bedrock of our society.  
   I know that Bill Lann Lee has remained true to all that his father taught him and I hope that the ``momentary ugliness'' of people opposing his nomination based on an ideological litmus test, and of people distorting his achievements and beliefs, and of some succumbing to narrow partisanship, will not be his reward for a career of good works. Such treatment drives good people from public service and distorts the role of the Senate. 
   Bill Lee's skills, his experience, the compelling personal journey that he and his family have traveled, his commitment to full opportunity for all Americans--these qualities appeal to the best in us. Let us affirm the best in us. Let us confirm--or at least allow the Senate to vote on the confirmation--of this good man. We need Bill Lee's proven problem-solving abilities in these difficult times. 
   If the Senate is allowed to decide, I believe Bill Lann Lee will be confirmed and will move this country forward to a time when discrimination will subside and affirmative action is no longer needed; a time when each child--girl or boy, black or white, rich or poor, urban or rural, regardless of national or ethnic origin and regardless of sexual orientation or disability--shall have a fair and equal opportunity to live the American dream. 
   I have often referred to the Senate as acting at its best when it serves as the conscience of the Nation. In my 25 years I have seen it do that. Again I speak to the conscience of this body. I call on the Judiciary Committee of the Senate to bring this nomination to the floor. Let the Senate have an up-or-down vote on Bill Lann Lee without obstruction, without further delays, so the Senate may vote. 
   If we do, I am convinced that a majority of this body will confirm a fine person to lead the Civil Rights Division into the next century. Racial discrimination and harmful discrimination in all its forms remains one of the most vexing, unsolved problems in all of our society. In a country so blessed as ours, so rich, so powerful, so wonderful, we still have this cancer of discrimination that shows up randomly throughout our society. Let's not perpetuate it here in the Senate. Let the Senate move forward from the ceremony commemorating the Congressional Gold Medal for Rosa Parks by doing what is right, by voting on the nomination of Bill Lann Lee. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce with Senators HATCH, BIDEN, DEWINE, and SCHUMER, a bill to provide railroad police officers the opportunity to attend the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Academy for law enforcement training in Quantico, Virginia. 
   The FBI is currently authorized to offer the superior training available at the FBI's National Academy only to law enforcement personnel employed by state or local units of government. Police officers employed by railroads are not allowed to attend this Academy despite the fact that they work closely in numerous cases with Federal law enforcement agencies as well as State and local law enforcement. Providing railroad police with the opportunity to obtain the training offered at Quantico would improve inter-agency cooperation and prepare them to deal with the ever increasing sophistication of criminals who conduct their illegal acts either using the railroad or directed at the railroad or its passengers. 
   Railroad police officers, unlike any other private police department, are commissioned under State law to enforce the laws of that State and any other State in which the railroad owns property. As a result of this broad law enforcement authority, railroad police officers are actively involved in numerous investigations and cases with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. 
   For example, Amtrak has a police officer assigned to the New York City Joint Task Force on Terrorism, which is made up of 140 members from such disparate agencies at the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service, the U.S. Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. This task force investigates domestic and foreign terrorist groups and responds to actual terrorist incidents in the Metropolitan New York area. 
   Whenever a railroad derailment or accident occurs, often railroad police are among the first on the scene. For example, when a 12-car Amtrak train derailed in Arizona in October 1995, railroad police joined the FBI at the site of the incident to determine whether the incident was the result of an intentional criminal act of sabotage. 
   Amtrak police officers have also assisted FBI agents in the investigation and interdiction of illegal drugs and weapons trafficking on transportation systems in the District of Columbia and elsewhere. In addition, using the railways is a popular means for illegal immigrants to gain entry to the United States. According to recent congressional testimony, in 1998 alone, 33,715 illegal aliens were found hiding on board Union Pacific railroad trains and subject to arrest by railroad police. 
   With thousand of passengers traveling on our railways each year, making sure that railroad police officers have available to them the highest level of training is in the national interest. The officers that protect railroad passengers deserve the same opportunity to receive training at Quantico that their counterparts employed by State and local governments enjoy. Railroad police officers who attend the FBI National Academy in Quantico for training would be required to pay their own room, board and transportation. 
   This legislation is supported by the FBI, the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the National Railroad Passenger Corporation.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have the pleasure of joining Senator JEFFORDS to rise in support of the renewable energy programs within the Energy and Water Appropriations bill. First, let me thank Senators DOMENICI and REID for their hard work to put together a balanced appropriations bill under very difficult budget constraints. I know both of these Senators support the renewable energy programs at Department of Energy and would have liked to come closer to the President's requested funding level. However, as with all the appropriations bills, this year has forced all of us to make difficult choices. 
   I am supporting the Jeffords amendment because I firmly believe that developing new solar and renewable energy sources is absolutely critical to reducing our reliance on imported fossil fuels and addressing climate change. Anyone who had the pleasure of spending some of this spring in the Northeast will tell you that although we all appreciated the glorious 85 degree days, it was unusual. After about a week, Vermonters really began to wonder about the strange weather. This is only a harbinger of things to come if we do not aggressively address the greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. 
   The solar and renewable energy programs will help our nation find alternative energy sources and help our states and industry start using them. We need to invest more funding to develop renewable energy technology and to bring this technology into the mainstream. Coming from Vermont, I have already seen how this technology can be used. During the nuclear freeze movement of the 1980s, Vermonters adopted a saying: ``As Vermont goes, so goes the nation.'' I hope that our state can provide similar leadership to set the nation on a path in the new millennium to promote the development and use of renewable energy. 
   From the Green Mountain Power wind farm in Searsburg to the McNeil biomass gasifier in Burlington, Vermont is developing and using renewable energy sources. These large projects are being looked at as models for how public-private partnerships can spur growth in our renewable energy sectors. Vermont is also leading the nation in developed small, community-based renewable energy projects. Many Vermont communities have shifted away from fossil energy sources to biomass, building small wood-fired systems. Biomass is now being used in Vermont schools, low-income housing projects, state office buildings and mills. 
   Vermont is also taking this technology overseas. I am proud to say that several Vermont renewable energy businesses have created niche markets for their technology all around the world. Just a few weeks ago, Prime Minister Tony Blair turned on the lights at a school that had just installed a small wind turbine built by a Vermont company. Another Vermont company has developed solar panels that are being used by individual homes in many developing countries where there is no central energy source. 
   When Vermont and the nation consider what the next millennium will look like the most important question to be asked is what do we want to pass on to the next generation? 
   I want my grandson to be able to hike through the Green Mountains and see the same majestic forests and mountain peaks as I did. I want him to be able to fish in Lake Champlain without having to worry about what heavy metals are in it. If my grandchildren are going to enjoy these experiences, our nation has to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and increase our use of renewable energy. The Jeffords amendment will ensure that the successes of the solar and renewable energy programs at Department of Energy are replicated to help our nation meet this goal.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President I would like to engage the Chairman in a colloquy. First, let me thank the Senator from New Mexico for his diligence in balancing funding for the wide variety of programs within the Energy and Water Appropriations bill under very difficult budget constraints. Under these constraints, you were able to fund the biomass programs at $72 million. However, one very important program to the Northeast has not been funded. The Northeast Regional Biomass Program has helped my State make significant steps to develop and market the use of wood as an energy source. It is now being used in Vermont schools, low-income housing projects, State office buildings and mills. Without support from the Northeast Regional Biomass Program, Vermont will not be able to build on these successes. Although funding is not included in the Senate bill for this program, the Department of Energy should be given the flexibility to continue support for some of these projects.

   Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chairman and look forward to working with him and the Department of Energy to support state efforts to expand the use of small biomass projects that promote the use of wood energy as a renewable resource. 
   Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman in a colloquy. As more and more states deregulate their own energy industries, environmentally preferable electric power is one of the markets developing first. One sector that has garnered specific questions about its impact on the environment is hydropower. Consumers need a credible means to determine which hydropower facilities are environmentally preferable. Mr. Chairman, you have partially addressed this situation already  by including funding within the Department of Energy's hydropower account to develop ``fish friendly'' turbines. I believe facilities that use this and other new technology should receive recognition for their efforts. Hydropower facilities that are operated to avoid and reduce their environmental impact should also receive recognition.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier I came to the floor to show what happens in an actual case today under the law. 
   In a case in Warren, MI, a man bought a $100,000 computer system and it was not Y2K compliant. He almost lost his business. However, he was able to follow the State laws we have today. He was able to use State law, enforce it, and save going into bankruptcy, save being out of business. 
   Under the law before the Senate today, instead, here is what would happen. Rather than a straight line of protection for that small businessperson, here is the way it goes: dead end, dead end, roadblock, roadblock, dead end, dead end, roadblock. 
   Now they say they have cured it. What did they do? They took off one of the roadblocks. 
   Look at this chart. The roads in Kosovo are easier to drive through than the roads on this so-called Y2K ``correction'' bill. 
   I wish we did what we did last year. We had a good Y2K bill. The information-sharing law, S. 96, was done in a truly bipartisan way. It passed virtually unanimously. It was signed into law. 
   Now we have a bill, instead of making efforts to bring all parties together to have a bill the President could sign, we have something we know the President will veto, and he will veto it because of these dead ends, because of these detours, because of these roadblocks, because the court door is slammed, and because it wipes out every single State law in this country--all 50. 
   Mr. President, a few months ago, I came to the Senate floor to take a look at what this Y2K liability bill will actually do in a real life situation. I had a similar chart with me at that time. 
   Since then, we have heard some of my colleagues praise the so-called compromise on the Y2K liability protection bill. I have adjusted my chart to take into account the changes made to S. 96. You can see that this new so-called compromise eliminated only one road block on the road to justice. The ``compromise'' dropped liability protection for officers and directors of corporations that have Y2K computer problems. All these other special legal protections are still in S. 96. 
   Let's take a closer look at my chart under the modified S. 96. The chart still illustrates the many detours, roadblocks and dead ends that this bill would impose on a innocent plaintiff in our state-based legal system. Let's take a real life example of a Y2K problem and see what would happen under the sweeping terms of this new bill. 
   A small business owner from Warren, Michigan, Mark Yarsike, testified this year before the Commerce and Judiciary Committees about his Y2K problems. In 1997, he brought a new computer cash register system for his small business, Produce Palace, that was not Y2K compliant. Naturally, he assumed his new cash register system would be Y2K compliant. But it was not. 
   His brand new high-tech cash register system, which cost almost $100,000, kept crashing. After more than 200 service calls, it was finally discovered that his computer cash register system kept breaking down because it could not read credit cards with an expiration date in the year 2000. A Y2K computer defect that would be covered under this so-called ``compromise'' bill. 
   At the top of this chart is how the state-based court system works today for Mark Yarsike. His business buys a new computerized cash register system and a Y2K defect crashes the system. He then asks the cash register company to fix the system. If Congress rejects current Y2K liability legislation, a small business owner has two options under traditional state law. 
   The cash register company agrees to solve the Y2K problem and the small  business owner has a quick and fair settlement. 
   If the company fails to fix the cash register system with the Y2K defect, then a small business owner has the option to have his day in court and proceed with a fair trial. That is what Mark Yarsike did. He was forced to buy a new computer cash register system from another company and sued the first company that sold him the non-Y2K compliant system. He was able to recoup his losses through a fair settlement. 
   Today's court system worked for him. 
   Now what happens to that same small business owner who brought a Y2K defective computer cash register system under the bill before us. Well, the current ``compromise'' bill overrides the 50 state laws and places new Federal detours, roadblocks, and dead ends from justice for that small business owner. Let's take another look at the chart. 
   If Congress enacts this Y2K liability protection legislation that overrides state law, the small business owner faces all these special legal protections on his road to justice. 
   The bill's sweeping legal restrictions include--90 day waiting period, preservation of unconscionable contracts' terms, heightened pleading requirements, new class action requirements, duty to anticipate and avoid Y2K damages, override of implied warranties under state law, caps on punitive damages, limits on joint and several liability, and bystander liability protection. All these special legal protections still apply to small business owners and consumers under this so-called ``compromise.'' 
   All these dead ends on the road to justice may force a small business owner, like Mark Yarsike, to file for bankruptcy or lay off employees. 
   The bill contains severe limits on recovery by capping punitive damages to 3 times the amount of compensatory damages or $250,000, whichever is less, for medium-sized and small businesses. The sponsors of this ``compromise'' have touted the fact that they struck the looser punitive damages cap for larger businesses that was in the bill. I agree that this is an improvement, but it comes with another troubling compromise. 
   The bill now defines small businesses as firms with fewer than 50 employees, instead of firms with fewer than 25 employees, which was the definition in the original bill. As a result, the absolute cap of $250,000 on punitive damages now applies to many more businesses without any justification. Never before in any product liability tort ``reform'' bill has a small business been defined so broadly. 
   An exception to this punitive damages cap has been added if a plaintiff can prove that the defendant intentionally defrauded the plaintiff. Of course, the plaintiff must prove this by a higher standard of proof than normal--by clear and convincing evidence. Even the legal standard to prove an exception is stacked against the plaintiff under this bill. 
   This exception will prove meaningless in the real world because no one will be able to meet this exception for proving the injury was specifically intended. How in the world is our small business owner going to prove that the cash register company intentionally tried to injury him by selling a Y2K defective cash register system? How in the world is our small business owner going to prove this specific intent by clear and convincing evidence? Get real. 
   As a result, the small business owner who is harmed by the Y2K defective cash register system may be forced into bankruptcy or lay off employees. 
   To the credit of the sponsors of this ``compromise,'' they have struck the last road block in the original bill--special liability protection to directors and officers of companies involved in Y2K disputes. I commend them for striking this section. Providing special Y2K liability protection to the key company decision makers would hinder Y2K remediation efforts. Instead, we want to encourage these key decision makers to be overseeing aggressive year 2000 compliance measures. 
   I hope special legal protections for corporate officers and directors does not resurface in the final bill after conference with the House. 
   A few of these detours, roadblocks and dead ends in this so-called ``compromise'' may be justified to prevent frivolous Y2K litigation. But certainly not all of them. 
   This bill makes seeking justice for the harm caused by a Y2K computer problem into a game of chutes and ladders--but there are only chutes for plaintiffs and no ladders. The defendant wins every time under the rigged rules of this game. 
   Unfortunately, this so-called compromise bill still overreaches again and again. It is not close to being balanced. 
   During Senate consideration of S. 96 last week, some of my colleagues and I offered amendments to add some balance to this bill. But the majority defeated every one. 
   Senator JOHN KERRY offered an alternative, which was endorsed by the White House. The President would sign Senator KERRY's bill tomorrow, but the majority voted it down. 
   I offered a consumer protection amendment to exclude ordinary consumers from the bill's legal detours, road blocks and dead ends. My amendment would have granted relief from the bill's broad Federal preemption for ordinary consumers to access their home state consumer protection laws. But the majority voted it down. 
   Senator EDWARDS offered two amendments to add balance to the bill. The first clarified the bill's economic loss section to ensure that recovery would be permitted only for claims allowed under applicable state or Federal law effective on January 1, 1999. The second excluded bad actors from the bill's special legal protections if they sold non-Y2K compliant products in 1999. But again the majority voted down these amendments. 
   Senator BOXER offered an amendment for computer manufacturers to offer free or at-cost fixes to small businesses and consumers who had purchased Y2K defective products as a requirement for these same computer manufacturers to be protected under S. 96. This amendment would have added real balance to the bill. But the majority voted it down. 
   The prospect of Y2K computer problems requires remedial efforts and increased compliance. But as last week's delay in voting on final passage of S. 96 made clear, this bill is not about promoting Y2K compliance; it is about sweeping liability protection and partisan politics. 
   I fear that all the special legal protections for Y2K problems in S. 96 will hinder serious Y2K remediation efforts in 1999. Instead of passing protections against future lawsuits, Congress should be encouraging Y2K remediation efforts during the last six months of 1999. We have to fix as many of these problems ahead of time as we can. Ultimately, the best business policy and the best defense against Y2K-based lawsuits is to be Y2K compliant. 
   That is why I hosted a Y2K conference in Vermont to help small businesses prepare for 2000. That is why I taped a Y2K public service announcement in my home state. That is why I cosponsored Senator BOND and Senator KERRY's new law, the ``Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act,'' to create SBA loans for small businesses to eliminate their Y2K computer problems now. That is why I introduced, with Senator DODD as the lead cosponsor, the ``Small Business Y2K Compliance Act,'' S. 962, to offer new tax incentives for purchasing Y2K compliant hardware and software. 
   These real measures will avoid future Y2K lawsuits by encouraging Y2K compliance now. 
   Last year, I joined with Senator HATCH to pass into law a consensus bill known as ``The Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act.'' We worked on a bipartisan basis with Senator BENNETT, Senator DODD, the Administration, industry representatives and others to reach agreement on a bill to facilitate information sharing to encourage Y2K compliance. 
   The new law, enacted less than nine months ago, is working to encourage companies to work together and share Y2K solutions and test results. It promotes company-to-company information sharing while not limiting rights of consumers. That is the model we should use to enact balanced and narrow legislation to deter frivolous Y2K litigation while encouraging responsible Y2K compliance.  
   Unlike last year's Y2K information sharing law, S. 96 is not narrow or balanced. Instead it is a wish list for special interests that are or might become involved in Y2K litigation. 
   This bill sends the wrong signal to the business community about its Y2K remediaton efforts. It is telling them; ``Don't worry, be happy.'' That will only make Y2K computer problems worse next year, instead of fixing them this year. 
   The coming of the millennium should not be an excuse for cutting off the rights of those who will be harmed, turning our States' civil justice system upside down, or immunizing those who recklessly disregard the coming problem to the detriment of American consumers. 
   I remain open to continuing to work with interested members of the Senate on bipartisan, consensus legislation that would protect consumers, deter frivolous Y2K lawsuits and encourage responsible Y2K compliance. S. 96 is not that bill. 
   The President will veto S. 96 in its present form, as he should. Then perhaps we can sit down with all interested parties and craft a truly balanced bill. 
   Those of us in Congress who have been active on technology-related issues have struggled mightily, and successfully, to act in a bipartisan way. It would be unfortunate, and it would be harmful to the technology industry, technology users and to all consumers, if that pattern is broken over this bill.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this bill as presently drafted would preempt the consumer protection laws of each of the 50 states and restrict the legal rights of consumers who are harmed by Y2K computer failures. 
   Why is this bill creating new protections for large corporations while taking away existing protections for the ordinary citizen? 
   We all know that individual consumers do not have the same knowledge or bargaining power in the marketplace as businesses with more resources. Many consumers may not be aware of potential Y2K problems in the products that they buy for personal, family or household purposes.  
   Consumers just go to the local store downtown or in the neighborhood mall to buy a home computer or the latest software package. They expect their new purchase to work. But what if it does not work because of a Y2K problem? 
   Then the average consumer should be able to use his or her home state's consumer protection laws to get a refund, replacement part or other justice. 
   The liability limits in S. 96 would protect companies whose acts or omissions result in harm to consumers' products or services--even if those companies manufactured or sold products that they knew would fail when the date changes to the Year 2000. 
   Is that fair? 
   Let me give you a real life example of how an ordinary person might be harmed by this bill. In 1999, Joe Consumer buys a computer program and on the package is the claim: ``This software is guaranteed to serve you well for years to come.'' But in the fine print in the shrink wrap that comes with the software is a disclaimer of all warranties, either express or implied. 
   Joe Consumer's software package, that he brought in 1999, is not Y2K compliant. He calls and writes the software company to get it fixed but all he gets in response is a form letter telling him to buy the latest upgrade. 
   Under this bill, Joe Consumer would have to wait 90 days for his day in court and might not have a remedy at all. 
   Joe Consumer would normally be able to pursue justice based on a failure of the implied warranty of marketability of the software because it was not Y2K compliant. Or he would normally be able to pursue justice under his state consumer protection laws. And he normally would be able to pursue justice with other consumers harmed by this Y2K defective software on a fairer and more efficient class-action basis. But not under S. 96. 
   This bill says that the written contract prevails, even if it limits or excludes warranties. Enforceable written contracts under this bill would include the fine-print, boiler-plate language that is standard in the packaging of computer hardware or software. 
   A consumer does not have any power to negotiate this fine print, boiler-plate, shrink-wrap. This shrink wrap is all one sided in favor of the computer manufacturer. In fact, in some cases, computer manufacturers even try to take away the right of a consumer to go to court in the fine print of their shrink wrap. In addition, this bill would override the Uniform Commercial Code and all state laws that protect consumers by making certain warranty disclaimers unenforceable. The consumer protections in the U.C.C. and state law protect individual consumers from having unfair terms imposed on them by manufacturers of products with far greater economic power. 
   But this bill makes all state consumer protection laws null and void against the fine print terms of any computer manufacturer's shrink wrap. Maybe we should rename this bill, the ``Y2K Shrink Wrap Protection Act.'' 
   Moreover, S. 96 would severely restrict the use of class actions by consumers even when common questions of fact and law predominate in their cases and the class action would be a fair and efficient method to resolving their dispute. The use of class actions in state courts permit consumers to band together to seek justice in ways that an individual could not afford to take on alone. These state laws were enacted to protect the average consumer. 
   But these basic consumer protections would be eliminated under this bill's Federal peremption provisions. 
   And no new Federal rights for consumers would replace these lost state consumer protections under this bill. That is not right. 
   My amendment uses the same consumer exclusion language in last year's Hatch-Leahy Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act. My amendment contains the same definition of consumer and consumer product that was in that consensus measure, which passed the full Senate by a unanimous vote and was signed into law about seven months ago. Our bill become law because it was balanced, in sharp contrast to S. 96 as currently drafted. 
   I would hope the full Senate could agree to this amendment since it uses the same language that we agreed to last year on the Y2K information sharing law. 
   Last year, when we passed Y2K legislation to encourage remediation efforts, we clearly let stand existing consumer protections under state law. This same policy should apply to the pending legislation, which currently proposes to limit a consumer's legal rights even in cases involving fraud or other intentional misbehavior by product manufacturers or sellers. 
   In fact, the precedent for using last year's Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act as a model for S. 96 have already been set. S. 96 includes an exclusion for governments acting in a regulatory, supervisory or enforcement capacity. The exact language in the bill was lifted from the Y2K information disclosure law of last year. I believe this government exception make sense, particularly for SEC enforcement actions, and improves the underlying bill. 
   Moreover, section 13(d) of S. 96 also explicitly provides that the protections for sharing information in our Y2K law shall apply to this bill. 
   If the protections for businesses from last year's Y2K information disclosure law are good enough for this bill, then the exclusion from last year's Y2K law for consumers should also be good enough for this bill. Last year's Y2K information disclosure law was a balanced measure in part because it protected consumers from its provisions. Adding the same consumer carve out by adopting my amendment would give balance to this one-sided bill.

   So colleagues will understand, in last year's Y2K bill which this Senate passed unanimously, which the President signed into law, we had basic consumer protections and business protections. In this bill, we bring forward business protections but we don't bring forward the consumer protections we passed last year. 
   Let's be consistent; let's make sure we give consumers at least as much protection as we give businesses. That is what I am asking for and all I am asking for in the Leahy amendment. I also say if it passes, it improves the chance of this actually being signed into law.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Federal Judgeship Act of 1999. I am pleased that Senators INOUYE, SARBANES, REID, ROBB, AKAKA, and SCHUMER are joining me as original cosponsors of this measure. 
   Our bill creates 69 new judgeships across the country to address the increased caseloads of the Federal judiciary. Specifically, our legislation would: create 7 additional permanent judgeships and 4 temporary judgeships for the U.S. Courts of Appeal; create 33 additional permanent judgeships and 25 temporary judgeships for the U.S. District Courts; and convert 10 existing temporary district judgeships to permanent positions. 
   This bill is based on the recommendations of the Judicial Conference of the United States, the nonpartisan policy-making arm of the judicial branch. Federal judges across the nation believe that the continuing heavy caseload of our courts of appeals and district courts merit these additional judges. Indeed, the Chief Justice of the United States in his 1998 year-end report of the U.S. Judiciary declared: ``The number of cases brought to federal courts is one of the most serious problems facing them today.'' 
   Chief Justice Rehnquist is right. The filings of cases in our Federal courts has reached record heights. For instance, criminal case filings in Federal courts rose 15 percent in 1998--nearly tripling the 5.2 percent increase in 1997. The number of criminal cases filed since 1991 increased 25 percent with the number of criminal defendants rising 21 percent. In fact, the filings of criminal cases and defendants reached their highest levels since the Prohibition Amendment was repealed in 1933. 
   Federal civil caseloads have similarity increased. For the past eight years, total civil case filings have increased 22 percent in our Federal courts. This increase includes jumps of 145 percent in personal injury product liability cases, 112 percent in civil rights filings, 71 percent in social security cases, 49 percent in copyright, patent and trademark filings, and 29 percent prisoner petitions from 1991 to 1998. 
   But despite these dramatic increases in case filings, Congress has failed to authorize new judgeships since 1990, thus endangering the administration of justice in our nation's Federal courts. 
   Historically, every six years Congress has reviewed the need for new judgeships. In 1984, Congress passed legislation to address the need for additional judgeships. Six years later, in 1990, Congress again fulfilled its constitutional responsibility and enacted the Federal Judgeship Act of 1990 because of a sharply increasing caseload, particularly for drug-related crimes. But in the last two Congresses, the Republican majority failed to follow this tradition. Two years ago the Judicial Conference requested an additional 55 judgeships to address the growing backlog. My legislation, based on the Judicial Conference's 1997 recommendations, S. 678, the Judicial Judgeship Act of 1997, languished in the Judicial Committee without action during both sessions of the last Congress. 
   It is now nine years since Congress last seriously reexamined the caseload of the federal judiciary and the need  for more federal judges. Congress ignores the needs of the Federal judiciary at the peril of the American people. Overworked judges and heavy caseloads slow down the judicial process and delay justice. In some cases, justice is in danger of being denied because witnesses and evidence are lost due to long delays in citizens having their day in court. 
   We have the greatest judicial system in the world, the envy of people around the globe who are struggling for freedom. It is the independence of our third, co-equal branch of government that gives it the ability to act fairly and impartially. It is our judiciary that has for so long protected our fundamental rights and freedoms and served as a necessary check on overreaching by the other two branches, those more susceptible to the gusts of the political winds of the moment. 
   We are fortunate to have dedicated women and men throughout the Federal Judiciary in this country who do a tremendous job under difficult circumstances. They are examples of the hard-working public servants that make up the federal government. They deserve our respect and our support. 
   Let us act now to ensure that justice is not delayed or denied for anyone. I urge the Senate to enact the Federal Judgeship Act of 1999 without further delay.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce a bill to increase funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program for Fiscal Year 2000. I look forward to working with Appropriate Committee members on this and other important matters through the appropriations process. 
   The Commodity Supplemental Food Program does exactly what its name suggests--it provides supplemental foods to states who distribute them to low-income postpartum, pregnant and breastfeeding women, infants, children up to age six, as well as senior citizens. 
   People participating in CSFP receive healthy packages of food including items such as infant formula juice, rice, pasta, and canned fruits and vegetables. 
   The Commodity Supplemental Food Program currently operates in twenty states and last year, more than 370,000 people participated in it every month. There still remains a great need to expand this program, as there is a waiting list of states--including my state of Vermont--who want to participate, but are not able to because of lack of funding. The bill I am introducing would fix this problem, by increasing the funding so that more women, children and seniors in need could participate. I look forward to working with the Vermont Congressional delegation on this matter. 
   The Commodity Supplemental Food Program has proven itself to be vitally important to senior citizens, as 243,000 of the 370,000 people who participate every month are seniors. There continues to be a great need for our seniors in Vermont, and in the rest of the nation. 
   This has been true for sometime, and still is the case. I successfully fought efforts a few years ago to terminate the Meals on Wheels Program. Ending that program would have been a disaster for our seniors. 
   According to an evaluation of the Elderly Nutrition Program of the Older Americans Act, approximately 67% to 88% of the participants are at moderate to high nutritional risk. It is further estimated that 40% of older adults have inappropriate intakes of three or more nutrients in their diets. And the results of nutritional programs on the health of seniors are amazing--for instance, it was estimated in a report that for every $1 spent on Senior Nutrition Programs, more than $3 is saved in hospital costs. 
   This Congress, I have taken a number of steps to address the nutritional problems facing our seniors, and have met with some success. In response to a budget request that I submitted last year, the Administration increased their funding request for the Elderly Nutrition Program by $10 million to $150 million for Fiscal year 2000. I will continue to work to see that the full $150 million is included in the final budget. 
   This past April I also cosponsored the Medicare Medical Nutrition Therapy Act, which provides for Medicare coverage of medical nutrition therapy services of registered dietitians and nutrition professionals. Medicare coverage of medical nutrition therapy would save money by reducing hospital admissions, shortening hospital stays, and decreasing complications. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this measure into law through the normal appropriations process for fiscal year 2000.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize Bob Clarke, who has served for nearly 15 years as President of Vermont Technical College in Randolph. Under Bob's leadership, VTC has seen its annual budget quadruple, its annual donations have increased twelve-fold, and VTC's standing in the community has grown immensely. 
   Bob brought to VTC a new perspective for technical education. He has established unique relationships between VTC and the high-tech community. Currently, Vermont Technical College is providing training to employees of companies such as IBM, BF Goodrich Aerospace, and Bell Atlantic. In addition, Bob has listened to the concerns of small businesses in the state. When Vermont faced a shortage of trained auto mechanics, he established a training program in automotive technology. His willingness to listen to the needs of the business community has resulted in increased opportunities for VTC students and alumni alike, and VTC has created a qualified pool of applicants to meet the growing needs of Vermont's high-tech industry. 
   Over the years, I have worked closely with Bob and VTC on issues including education, workforce retraining and business development. I have been most impressed with Bob's innovation in addressing the evolving needs of the business community. His work is truly inspiring and the results have been felt across the state. Bob has truly raised the bar for technical colleges around the country.

   Mr. LEAHY. I want to thank Senator JOHNSON for his leadership on this matter and for bringing this matter to my attention. Vermont does not have a copayment requirement for prisoners' health care so the problems that his Marshal had brought to his attention last year, were not matters that had arisen in Vermont. 
   I also want to thank those at the Department of Justice who have made suggestions to improve the proposals on this subject over the last couple of years. I am glad the I have been able to contribute constructively to that process of improvement over the past weeks and again today. 
   A most important part of this bill is its protection against prisoners being refused treatment based on an inability to pay. I am glad to see my suggestion that the protection of section 2(f) in this regard be included in section 3 of the bill, as well, be incorporated in the substitute amendment accepted by the Judiciary Committee and reported to the Senate. I thank the Department of Justice for having included this suggestion in its recent April 27 letter. 
   Today we make additional improvements to the bill to ensure that it can serve the purposes for which it is intended. In particular, I have suggested language to make clear that since the goal of the bill is to deter prisoners from seeking unnecessary health care, copayment requirements should not apply to prisoner health care visits initiated and approved by custodial staff, including staff referrals and staff-approved follow-up treatment for a chronic condition. In addition, the amendments I have suggested adds to those health care visits excluded from the copayment requirement visits for emergency services, perinatal care, diagnosis or treatment of contagious diseases, mental health care and substance abuse treatment. Like preventative care, all these types of health care for prisoners should be encouraged and not discouraged by a copayment requirement. It would be harmful to custodial staff and detrimental the long term interests of the public to create artificial barriers to these health care services. 
   Finally, I have suggested that we review this new program and its impact next year rather than delaying evaluation for the 2-year period initially provided by the bill. The bill constitutes a shift in federal corrections and custodial policy and it is appropriate that the impact of these changes be evaluated promptly and adjusted as need be. 
   I continue to be concerned that we are imposing an administrative burden on the Bureau of Prisons greatly in excess of any benefit the bill may achieve. I wonder about alternatives to cut down on unnecessary health care visits besides the imposition of fees, many of which may go uncollected. The contemplated $5 a visit fee for prisoners compensated at a rate as low as 11 cents an hour seems excessive, but that is how the BOP wishes to proceed. 
   I also fear that the effort will lead to extensive litigation to sort out what it means and how it is implemented. As we impose duties and limitations on correctional authorities, that is one of the consequences of such duties. 
   I will be interested to see whether funds end up being received by victims of crime either with respect to restitution orders or by the Victims of Crime Fund through the elaborate mechanisms created by this legislation. I hope that victims will benefit from its enactment as opposed to experiencing another false promise. In this regard, I wonder why there is no benefit to victims from the fees collected from federal prisoners held in nonfederal institutions. If our policy is to benefit victims, the ownership of the facility ought not deter that policy. Surely the copayment fee is not designed as payment for the health care treatment itself or even payment for the administrative overhead of the system. 
   Despite my concerns, this bill does have the support of the BOP and U.S. Marshals Service. Just as I facilitated the bill being reported from this Committee, today I am acting to allow the Senate to pass an improved version of the bill.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have been circulating drafts of bills designed to provide WIC benefits to military personnel and to certain civilian personnel, stationed overseas, for a few weeks. I know that Senator HARKIN and other Senators on both sides of the aisle have also been working on this matter as have members of the other body. 
   I have received valuable input regarding my drafts from Members, national organizations and even personnel stationed overseas and I appreciate all who have helped. This bill introduction does not mean that I am no longer seeking input. On the contrary, as I have always handled nutrition legislation, I want to work with all Members on this important legislation, which I hope can be unanimously passed. 
   Basically, the Strengthening Families in the Military Service Act mandates that the Secretary of Defense offer a program similar to the WIC program--the Supplemental Nutrition  Program for Women, Infants and Children--to military and associated civilian personnel stationed on bases overseas. If it makes sense to allow those stationed in the United States to participate in WIC, it makes sense to allow those stationed overseas to have the important nutritional benefits of that program. Why should families lose their benefits when they are moved overseas? 
   This bill provides that the Secretary of Defense will administer the program under rules similar to the WIC program administered by the Secretary of Agriculture within the United States. 
   WIC is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. In fact, just a few weeks ago, I joined Senators LUGAR and TORRICELLI, the National Association of WIC Directors' Executive Director Doug Greenaway, as well as others, in celebrating this accomplishment. 
   For 25 years the WIC program has provided nutritious foods to low-income pregnant, post-partum and breast-feeding women, infants, and children who are judged to be at a nutritional risk. 
   It has proven itself to be a great investment--for every dollar invested in the WIC program, an estimated $3 is saved in future medical expenses. WIC has helped to prevent low birth weight babies and associated risks such as developmental disabilities, birth defects, and other complications. Participation in the WIC program has also been linked to reductions in infant mortality. 
   This program has worked extremely well in Vermont, and throughout the nation. 
   However, despite the successes of this program, there continues to be an otherwise eligible population who cannot receive these benefits--women and children in military families stationed outside of the United States. 
   These are families who are serving our country, living miles from their homes on a military base in a foreign land, and whose nutritional health is at risk. If they were stationed within our borders, their diets would be supplemented by the WIC program, and they would receive vouchers or packages of healthy foods, such as fortified cereals and juices, high protein products, and other foods especially rich in needed minerals and vitamins. If they receive orders stationing them at a U.S. base located in another country, they lose this needed support. 
   I know that I am not alone in my desire to establish WIC benefits for our women and children of military families stationed overseas. I look forward to working with all members of Congress in making a program that benefits nutritionally at risk women, infants and children serving America from abroad. I know there are other approaches being considered and I want to work out a good solution. 
   I have been informed of situations where this nutrition assistance is desperately needed by military and civilian personnel overseas. I do not see how we can turn our backs on these Americans stationed abroad. I am willing to work with other ways of providing this assistance but I believe that my bill has advantages over other suggestions. First, this bill guarantees this assistance for the next three years and mandates a study to determine if improvements or other changes are needed. 
   This bill also disregards the value of in kind housing assistance in calculating eligibility which increases the number of women, infants and children that can participate and makes the program more similar to the program in the United States. The CBO has estimated that the average monthly food cost would be about $28 for each participant based on a Department of Defense estimate of the cost of an average WIC food package in military commissaries. Administration costs which include health and nutrition assessments are likely to be about $7 per month per participant, according to CBO. 
   I am advised that counting the value of in kind housing assistance as though it were cash assistance would reduce the cost of this program to $2 million per year and that 5,100 women and children would participate in an average month under such an approach. This will be an issue which I look forward to discussing with my colleagues.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to voice my support for S. 566, the Agricultural Trade Freedom Act, which was passed out of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry this morning on a 17-1 vote. I appreciate Senator LUGAR's strong leadership on these trade and international issues. 
   More than any other industry in America, agriculture is extremely dependent on international trade. In fact, almost one-third of our domestic agricultural production is sold outside of the United States. Clearly, a strong international market for agricultural commodities is therefore of utmost importance to our agriculture economy. 
   As those of us who herald from agricultural states know, the business of agriculture in America reaches far beyond farmers alone. There are many rural businesses, such as feed stores, machinery repair shops and veterinarians, who depend on a strong agricultural economy. And when we discuss international trade, there are many national businesses, such as agricultural exporters, which are greatly impacted by our trade policies. 
   Despite the importance of these international markets, agricultural commodities are occasionally eliminated from potential markets because of U.S. imposed unilateral economic sanctions against other countries. These economic sanctions are imposed for political, foreign policy reasons. Yet there is little to show that the inclusions of agricultural commodities in these sanctions actually have had the intended results. The question now emerging from this policy is who is actually hurt by the ban on exporting commercial agricultural commodities, and should it continue? 
   American farmers and exporters obviously face an immediate loss in trade when unilateral economic sanctions are imposed. Perhaps even more devastating, however, is the long-term loss of the market. Countries who need agricultural products do not wait for American sanctions to be lifted; they find alternative markets. This often leads to the permanent loss of a market for our agriculture industry, as new trading partnerships are established and maintained. 
   Our farmers, and the rural businesses and agriculture exporters associated with them, are consequently greatly hurt by this policy. The Agricultural Trade Freedom Act corrects this problem by exempting commercial agricultural products from U.S. unilateral economic sanctions. The exemption of commercial agricultural products is not absolute; the President can make the determination that these items are indeed a necessary part of the sanction for achieving the intended foreign policy goal. In this situation, the President would be required to report to Congress regarding the purposes of the sanctions and their likely economic impacts. 
   Recently, the administration lifted restrictions on the sale of food to Sudan, Iran and Libya--all countries whose governments we have serious disagreements with. It did so, and I am among those who supported that decision, because food, like medicines, should not be used as a tool of foreign policy. It is also self-defeating. While our farmers lost sales, foreign farmers made profits. 
   Unfortunately, the administration did not see fit to apply the same reasoning to Cuba. American farmers cannot sell food to Cuba, even though it is only 90 miles from our shores and there is a significant potential market there. This contradiction is beneath a great and powerful country, and Senator LUGAR's legislation would permit such sales. The administration should pay more attention to what is in our national interests, rather than to a tiny, vocal minority who are wedded to a policy that has hurt American farmers and the Cuban people. 
   The Agricultural Trade Freedom Act maintains the President's need for flexibility in foreign policy while simultaneously recognizing the impact that sanctions may have on the agricultural economy. This legislation is  supported by dozens of organizations including the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, the U.S. Dairy Export Council, the National Milk Producers Federation, and the National Farmers Union. 
   In closing, I would like to thank Senator LUGAR for his leadership on this issue. I was pleased to join with him, the ranking member, Senator HARKIN, the Democratic Leader, Senator DASCHLE, Senator CONRAD and others in this effort, and I look forward to working with them and all members of the Senate to see that this measure becomes law.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are living in a time of mega-mergers, and they are coming from all directions. Chrysler and Daimler-Benz automobile companies finalized their merger last year. In the computer world, AOL completed its purchase of Netscape just a few months ago. And in the largest corporate merger ever, Exxon Corporation announced its plan to acquire Mobil at a price tag of over $75 billion, thus creating the world's biggest private oil company, Exxon Mobil Corporation. 
   While these mega-mergers have cut a swath across a number of industries, the consolidations that continue to raise the most questions in my mind are those that involve incumbent monopolies. For example, the mergers among Regional Bell Operating Companies, which continue to have a virtual stranglehold on the local telephone loop, pose a great threat to healthy competition in the telecommunications industry. 
   Indeed, incumbent telephone companies still control more than 99% of the local residential telephone markets. 
   As I said last Congress, and it is still the case today, at my farm in Middlesex and at my home here in Virginia, I have only one choice for dial-tone and local telephone service. That ``choice'' is the Bell operating company or no service at all. 
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 passed with the promise of bringing competition to benefit American consumers. However, this promise has yet to materialize. 
   Since passage of the Telecommunications Act, Southwestern Bell has merged with PacTel into SBC Corporation, Bell Atlantic has merged into NYNEX, and AT&T has acquired IBM's Global Network, just to name a few. Just last week it was reported that U.S. West reached an agreement to merge with the telecommunications company Global Crossing.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on Friday May 14th, MATHCOUNTS held its national competition in Washington, D.C.--the culmination of local and State competitions involving 350,000 students. It gives me great pleasure to inform my colleagues that Alex Xue, a resident of Essex Junction, VT finished second in this competition and received a $6,000 college scholarship. 
   In a day and age where we are bombarded by reports of failing school systems and apathetic young people, I believe it is extremely important to recognize Alex's tremendous accomplishment. His success is a tribute not only to his own intelligence and hard work, but also to his family, his teachers and his school community. 
   In addition to meeting with Alex and his MATHCOUNTS teammates on the Senate steps prior to the competition, by coincidence, I was on Alex's flight back to Vermont on the Sunday following his competition. I had a chance to talk with Alex and compliment him on his tremendous achievement. He was holding the trophy he had received and when I admired it, although it was clear that he was happy with it, he was especially pleased with the college scholarship. I praised him as any Vermonter would, but I was impressed with his modesty and his pride in his family and school. This is a young man who will do remarkably well in life and we Vermonters should be proud that he is one of us.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I salute a longtime Vermont businesswoman, and a fixture on Burlington's Church Street Marketplace, Mrs. Lois Bodoky. 
   Lois is affectionately known in Burlington as the ``Hot Dog Lady'', for she recently celebrated the 25th anniversary of her business running a hot dog cart in downtown Burlington. 
   Lois went into the hot dog business not long after her hair salon was lost in a fire, and at the same time I was running my first campaign for U.S. Senator. Back then, Church Street was a typical Vermont downtown, and Lois operated her cart on the sidewalk as cars and buses passed on the street. Now, her cart is in a prime spot on Church Street Marketplace, which became a pedestrian mall in the early 1980's, and is one of Vermont's prime shopping areas. 
   Since Lois went into business, downtown Burlington has seen many changes, but the ``Hot Dog Lady's'' cart has remained a fixture, even in some of Vermont's coldest months. She is truly a Burlington institution and is most reliable to members of the downtown crowd who cannot let a lunch hour pass without a lunch from Lois.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, look where we are today--another high school shooting incident in Atlanta, four young people, at least in the initial news, injured, not killed. I talked about it with the Attorney General a few minutes ago. She had expressed her concern. I also commended her for her strong words of last week because I believe that helped move this bill forward. We are considering it during the eighth legislative day. We have not spent full days on this important bill. We will not be able to spend a full day. Notwithstanding that, we have made significant progress. 
   Today, we will also consider the long-delayed emergency supplemental appropriations bill to provide relief for victims of Hurricane Mitch, humanitarian aid in the Balkans, aid for farmers, and aid for the victims of natural disasters, as well as military and other appropriations. 
   In the time available to us today, I do hope we will be able to move to final passage on this bill. The bill has been much improved since its predecessor was introduced 2 years ago as S. 10. I detailed some of those improvements yesterday, and yesterday the Senate took a giant step forward with the adoption of the managers', the Hatch-Leahy amendment. Those modifications go a long way toward improving the bill. I predicted all week long that once we adopted Hatch-Leahy, we would have fewer than 10 amendments offered from the Democratic side. 
   As we begin this morning, I am sure of that. I am working with other Democratic Senators to see if the number of amendments can be reduced even further. Thanks to the hard work of Senator REID and others, the Democratic amendments have been pared down from 89 to a precious few left to be offered. They are still pending; they are still to be offered. I am hoping, though, that none will pose a stumbling block. 
   I know that in a little while the President of the United States will travel to Colorado for events in connection with remembering and honoring those who perished in Littleton, CO, recently as a result of school violence. I hope the visit from the President will help heal the wounds and ease the suffering. He is right to go to Colorado, just as he went to Oklahoma and has gone to the side of other Americans in other places where tragedy has struck over the last several years. I had hoped that perhaps the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and I could place a joint call to the President before he leaves Colorado this afternoon to tell him the Senate is doing its job, the Senate has completed its initial work on the juvenile crime bill, and the Senate is sending the bill to the House for its prompt consideration. I would like for the President to be able to share that news with the people of Colorado and the Nation 
   so that parents and youngsters everywhere can be reassured we are making progress in our work and that the Senate of the United States is acting as the conscience of the Nation. 
   There is one set of amendments that still threatens final passage of this bill. The Frist-Ashcroft amendment, which proposes modification of IDEA, is a matter of significant controversy and turmoil. Because that amendment threatens completion of the bill, I made a series of suggestions over the last couple of days in an effort to try to avoid that risk to the underlying measure. We need the cooperation of the Republican sponsors of that amendment if we are to complete our work on the juvenile bill today. 
   We are also working our way through a series of gun-related proposals to the bill. Last week, the Senate adopted a pattern of tabling Democratic amendments one day, and the next day it adopted pieces of those amendments if they were offered by Republicans. I suppose I should be glad to see our amendments finally get in one way or the other, but it is petty to say the amendments aren't worth anything if they are offered by Democrats, but they are wonderful if the same amendment is offered by a Republican. We have to do better. This should be a bipartisan bill. 
   Unquestionably, the Senate hit a real snag on this bill when it rejected, on a virtual party-line vote, the Lautenberg amendment. They didn't solve the first Craig amendment and Hatch-Craig II, seeking to reconstitute the ill-advised initial votes on the gun show issue. 
   Senator SCHUMER and I tried to point out problems with the Craig amendment, only to be told we were wrong last Wednesday night. In fact, we were told in fairly scathing terms how wrong we were. Of course, the next morning after the press looked at it, and after the Senate adopted the initial Craig amendment, it was clear to almost all throughout the country that mistakes had been made, the Senator from New York and I were correct, and matters needed to be fixed. So we saw another partial fix. 
   Today, we will see yet a third Republican amendment seeking to rectify what the Senate did when it rejected the Lautenberg amendment in favor of the Craig amendment last week. The Smith-Jeffords amendment is the most recent Republican amendment in that series of Republican amendments making corrections. As President Reagan said in another context, ``There you go again.'' Unfortunately, the Smith-Jeffords amendment closes only 2 of the 13 loopholes created by adoption of the Craig and the Hatch-Craig amendment. 
   The Smith-Jeffords amendment is baby steps toward background checks. That is what it is, baby steps toward background checks. It closes one loophole by requiring special licensees under Hatch-Craig to conduct background checks on firearm sales at gun shows. It closes the pawnshop loophole by repealing the Hatch-Craig amendment provision that allowed criminals to redeem guns at pawnshops without background checks--the same loophole adopted by the Senate last week. 
   The Smith-Jeffords amendment still leaves 11 loopholes that were created by adoption of the Craig and Hatch-Craig amendment of last week. The Smith-Jeffords amendment does not close the legal immunity loophole created by the Craig and Hatch-Craig amendments. Those amendments dismiss pending lawsuits against some gun dealers and perhaps even gun manufacturers. Giving gun dealers and manufacturers a get-out-of-jail-free card is wrong. 
   The Smith-Jeffords amendment does not close the loophole 
   that weakens all background checks at gun shows by giving law enforcement only 24 hours to complete the checks. Most gun shows take place on weekends when courthouses and record departments are closed. Law enforcement may well need the full 3 days to do the job right. 
   Now, at the rate of the Smith-Jeffords amendment on closing only 2 of the 13 gun show loopholes--the ones the Republicans voted for last week--by closing only 2 of the 13 gun show loopholes at a time, I believe the Republican majority will need to offer 6.5 more amendments to finally fix all the  problems in the amendments they adopted last week. The Senate does not have the luxury of time to follow the ``baby steps toward the background checks'' approach. 
   Fortunately, Senators LAUTENBERG and KERREY are offering the Senate another chance to right this matter by adoption of the modified version of the Lautenberg amendment this morning. The Lautenberg and Kerrey amendment closes all 13 gun show loopholes. I hope we will finally step past party labels and close all 13 loopholes. 
   If we hear that we have already voted on this matter, be careful. We did. It was tabled. But didn't we find after that more loopholes were opened up? We have to come back. Let's close the loopholes once and for all. After all, the Senator from New Jersey should be commended for offering the Senate a second chance to do the right thing. 
   We have had three amendments on the subject from the other side, first opening huge loopholes, and now--and I commend Senator SMITH for trying to close the same loopholes that he voted for last week. I hope that all Members will step back from the heat of the debate and vote on the merits of these proposals. They can be corrected today. The way to do that is to vote for the Lautenberg-Kerrey amendment and close all the loopholes--not the baby steps but the one giant step. 
   Let's not keep coming back, and let's not be in a position we seem to put ourselves in. We open up huge loopholes, the American public reacts with great unanimity against those loopholes, and then we come back and say let's close a few and wait and see what the reaction is. Let's do what the American people are saying: Close all the loopholes. 
   I retain the remainder of my time.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in 1996, I authored the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act to provide assistance to victims of terrorism and mass violence, wherever it occurred. This assistance is limited to victims who are citizens or employees of the United States who are injured or killed as a result of a terrorist act. 
   Unfortunately, that legislation is not doing the job as we intended. There are still too many victims of terrorism who are not getting the help they need and deserve--the help that Congress meant to give them in 1996. Among those left out in the cold are the families of those killed in the downing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988, and the victims of last year's embassy bombings in West Africa. 
   Section 3024 of the emergency appropriations bill will provide a limited but immediate response by providing much-needed assistance to the families of the Americans who were killed in the bombing of Pan Am 103. I am proud to have worked to get this emergency provision included in the conference report. 
   Currently, in cases involving terrorist acts occurring outside the United States, the Office of Victims of Crime (OVC) may only give supplemental grants to the States, for compensation of state residents. This formulation has not provided the intended help to victims of terrorism who reside overseas and do not have a clear State residence, even though they are U.S. citizens. It is of little assistance to the non-citizen victims employed by our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, who also deserve our support and assistance. And due to an overly restrictive interpretation of the 1996 law by the Department of Justice, it has not provided help to the victims of the Lockerbie bombing and other victims of terrorist acts that occurred before the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act went into effect. 
   The current law has led to slower implementation than I intended when emergency aid is desperately needed, and has not enabled OVC to provide emergency relief, crisis response or training and technical assistance for victim service providers, as I intended. 
   Accordingly, this week I offered an amendment to the juvenile justice bill, S. 254--which was accepted in the mangers' amendment--which would improve the law even further. It would ensure that OVC can provide efficient and effective assistance--and really make a difference--for Americans whose lives are torn apart by acts of terrorism and mass violence occurring outside the United States. 
   In the meantime, the trial in the Pan Am 103 case is getting under way, and the families of those victims need our help now. This is an urgent matter, and I am glad that we are addressing it in this emergency bill.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have to oppose this $1 million study of ``how the Federal Government and State and local governments, through their taxing power or otherwise'' helps support or subsidize the cost of producing ``violent, pornographic or other harmful materials.'' Even though this is just a study, I have serious concerns about researching the need for more taxing power. 
   Second, the juvenile crime bill already contains a package of amendments regarding the study of the motion picture industry. Third, the causes of teen violence are complex and difficult to handle with tax policy. Fourth, the amendment provides broad subpoena powers. 
   I appreciate that Senator BOND modified his amendment by taking out the study of how another tax, an excise tax, might be structured for ``violent, pornographic, or other harmful motion picture materials.'' What is considered harmful in Tulsa, may not be considered harmful in Niagara Falls, or Boise, or Key West. But in terms of the ``power to tax'' language still in the amendment it is not clear if the Federal Government, or towns or states, would tell movie producers what content they considered ``harmful'' or ``violent.'' Thus while the ``excise tax'' language was just taken out the study of the ``power to tax'' is still in the amendment. And that raises a lot of issues. 
   If this power to tax authority were used what would that mean? It is not at all clear how that would work. I do not see why we should spend $1 million to study the ``power to tax.'' There were major fights years ago about whether to censor the line in ``Gone with the Wind''--``Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.'' In many towns, that line could have been taxed under a ``power to tax'' if they had it then. Now, that line caused enormous numbers of debates and editorials. I suspect that could have gotten a whopping tax back then. Or Clark Gable could have just said: ``Frankly, my dear, I am really annoyed.'' 
   How would a new ``power to tax'' given to local, state or the Federal government work? The earlier ``excise tax'' idea that was recently dropped raised lots of questions also. I do not know what editing of movies local governments might have ended up doing. 
   Concerning the excise tax language, now dropped, I wondered would the local or the Federal government have imposed the tax before the movie was produced, after the movie was produced, or during the editing of the movie? Or, would the States or the Federal Government have told the producers ahead of time how much they would tax them on each scene? If they were to do it that way, could they take some scenes out or pay the extra tax, like a gas-guzzler tax? I understand there are a lot of violent battle scenes in the new Star Wars movie. That would have had a pretty big gross to tax. Fortunately, the ``excise tax'' language was taken out by the sponsor of the amendment, but the ``power to tax'' language remains.

   Mr. LEAHY. I say to my friend from California, what I also worry about is how you determine what it is. I heard one Senator on the floor speak of having more wholesome movies. I am all for that. There are a lot of movies that I consider absolutely classic. I like the ``Quiet Man'' with John Wayne. It was filmed near the part of Ireland from where my father's family came. But there is violence, fighting, drunkenness a little bit here and there. What do you determine it is? Does the market carry that? There are a lot of wholesome films that make it. 
   I see some things that might be considered wholesome. One very popular with children are Teletubbies, but yet we heard one leading conservative religious leader say that it should be taken off the air because he objected to one of the Teletubbies. 
   Maybe we have Teletubbies on one side and televangelists on the other. Somebody suggested in one cartoon: Teletubby Tinky Winky; Televangelist Dopey Wopey. But that is what I read in the paper. 
   Do we take that off or tax it? Maybe after the $1 million this amendment refers to we might have a better idea. I am not too sure I want even my own communities to determine what tax they will impose and the Federal Government determine what tax they will impose and then have censor boards all over the place determining this one we will tax a little itty-bitty, and this one we will tax biggie bitty-bit. 
   I point out, we do already have in the juvenile justice bill a package of amendments regarding the study of the motion picture industry, so that is going to be done anyway.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator from Utah for his kind remarks. We have worked very closely together on this. We have seen a bill go through a major evolution on the floor. Frankly, that is what the Senate should do in working its will through a bill. But I must say to my friend from Utah, I do not think that would have been possible if he and I had not been able to work together, if we had not been in constant contact, day by day, hour by hour and, perhaps to his regret at times, minute by minute. 
   I once said Senators are merely constitutional impediments to their staff--maybe I said it more than once. If we had not had superb staffs working on this, I do not know what we could have done. 
   We had Senators who came together, even though they normally seem politically far apart. The distinguished Senator from Alabama, Senator SESSIONS, an original cosponsor of this bill; the distinguished Senator from Delaware, Senator BIDEN; myself and Senator HATCH--coming together, bringing so many other Senators together. 
   One need only look at the major managers' package we passed. I say to my friend from Utah, I think when we introduced our managers' amendment that, as much as anything, broke the logjam and made passage of this bill possible. We tried to accommodate many Senators on both sides of the aisle who had legitimate matter of concern. In that process we came together to shape a bill. The managers' amendment agreement was more than just saying what is good for one Senator or another Senator. This is a juvenile justice bill and the managers' amendment helped shape the contours of that collective product. 
   As a parent, I think back to the time when my children were going to school. I thought what a happy and wonderful time in their life it was. I knew it was one place where they were safe. We did not have to worry about anything more than, did they study enough for their geometry test or history test or did they get their English assignment in on time? The worst injury you might worry about was if somebody in the playground was to slip and fall and bruise an arm or a leg. 
   Parents should not have to worry about their children going to school. But even today as we debated this--as we talked about Columbine, where the President and the First Lady were traveling today--we saw, again, on the TV, pictures of another school 
   shooting by another juvenile in Georgia, leaving children injured and being flown to a hospital. Every parent in this country is reminded, again, that often today our children are not safe, even when we send them off to a place where they should be. That is not the way it should be. 
   We have worked tirelessly on this bill. I think it is a better bill than when it began. The intentions were always the same: To make sure our juveniles are safe, our people are safe, that we choose the right course for juveniles when they do commit crimes. 
   The Senate has improved this bill. It is more comprehensive and more respectful of the core protections in the Federal juvenile legislation that served us well in past decades. It is more respectful of the primary role of the States in prosecuting these matters. We do recognize that no legislation is perfect, legislation alone is not enough to stop youth violence. 
   I hope parents, teachers, and juveniles themselves will stop and say: Can we not do better? Can we not have time together? Can we not love our children as we should? Can we not love each other as we should? Can we not look at some of the principles I knew so well when I was growing up, given to me by my parents, principles I hope my wife and I passed on to our children? 
   Can we not go to those basic principles and understand, even in a country of a quarter of a billion people, that we do not need the violence we see in this country? 
   It is not just a question of gun control. It is not just a question of more courts or more police. It is not just a question of more laws. But it is a question of, what do we want to be as a nation? We are blessed in this nation. We are the most powerful, wealthiest nation history has ever known. We live better than anybody ever could have imagined. We have so much going for us. Should not we stop and say, when it comes to our children, the most precious resource we have, that we must do all that we can to protect them and nurture them and teach them to be responsible? 
   Since we began consideration of this important legislation last week, we  have gotten both good news and bad news on the crime front. We got the good news at the beginning of this week when the FBI released the latest crime rate statistics showing a decline in serious crime for the seventh consecutive year. Preliminary reports indicate that the rate of serious violent and property crime in this country went down another 7 percent in 1998, with robbery down 11 percent, murders down 8 percent, car thefts down 10 percent, and declines in other crime categories as well. 
   But we are all acutely aware that we also got bad news today. Yet another school shooting by a juvenile--this time in Georgia--with children injured and being flown to hospitals. Every parent in this country is reminded again that our children are not safe, even when we send them off to a place where they should be. The only thing parents should have to worry about when they wave good-bye to their children in the morning is whether their child remembered his or her homework and lunch money. They should not have to worry about whether they will get shot. 
   The growing list of schoolyard shootings by children in Arkansas, Washington, Oregon, Tennessee, California, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, 
   Mississippi, last month in Littleton, Colorado, and today in Georgia, is simply unacceptable and intolerable. 
   Each one of us wants to do something to stop this violence. We have before us a bill that reflects hard work and committed effort on both sides of the aisle to address the juvenile crime problem. Senator HATCH and Senator SESSIONS have worked tirelessly for several years now to make a difference. While we have strongly disagreed in the past on the right approach to juvenile crime, I have always respected their good intentions. I am glad that this year we have continued the progress we made in the last Congress to find common ground on this important legislation. 
   In light of the significant improvements we have been able to make to the bill here on the Senate floor over the last eight days, the bill is a better, stronger and better balanced bill. It is more comprehensive and more respectful of the core protections in federal juvenile justice legislation that have served us so well over the last three decades. At the same time it is more respectful of the primary role of the states in prosecuting these matters. I greatly appreciate the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee adding me as a principal cosponsor of our bill. 
   I recognize, as we all do, that no legislation is perfect and that legislation alone is not enough to stop youth violence. We can pass an assortment of new laws and still turn on the news to find out that some child somewhere in the country has turned violent and turned on other children and teachers, with a gun or other weapon, with terrible results. 
   All of us--whether we are parents, grandparents, teachers, psychologists, or policy-makers--are puzzling over the causes of kids turning violent in our country. The root causes are likely multi-faceted. We can all point to inadequate parental involvement or supervision, over-crowded classrooms and over-sized schools that add to students' alienation, the easy accessibility of guns, the violence depicted on television, in movies and video games, or inappropriate content available on the Internet. There is no single cause and no single legislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our schools or in our streets. Nevertheless, this legislation is a firm and significant step in the right direction. 
   I have said before that a good proposal that works should get the support of all of us. Our first question should be whether a program or proposal will help our children effectively, not whether it is a Democratic or Republican proposal. The Managers' amendment and package of amendments that the Chairman and I were able to put together for adoption yesterday reflects that philosophy. It shows that when this body rolls up its sleeves and gets to work, we can make significant progress. I commend the Chairman for his leadership in this effort and I am glad we were able to work together constructively to improve this bill. 
   This bill, S. 254, started out as a much-improved bill from the one reported by the Judiciary Committee in the last Congress. In fact, as I looked through this bill I was pleasantly surprised to see that proposals that the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee specifically voted down in 1997 were incorporated at the outset into this bill. These are changes that I and other Democrats have 
   been urging on our Republican colleagues for the past few years, and that they have resisted until they quietly incorporated them into this bill. 
   Federalism. For example, I tried in July 1997 to amend S. 10 to protect the State's traditional prerogative in handling juvenile offenders and avoid the unnecessary federalization of juvenile crime that so concerns the Chief Justice and the Federal judiciary. Specifically, my 1997 amendment would have limited the federal trial as an adult of juveniles charged with nonviolent felonies to circumstances when the State is unwilling or unable to exercise jurisdiction. This amendment was defeated, with all the Republicans voting against it. 
   This bill, S. 254, contained a new provision designed to address these federalism concerns that would direct federal prosecutors to ``exercise a presumption in favor of referral'' of juvenile cases to the appropriate State or tribal authorities, where there is ``concurrent jurisdiction,'' unless the State declines jurisdiction and there is a substantial federal interest in the case. Yet, concerns remained that this bill would undermine a State's traditionally prerogative to handle juvenile offenders. 
   The changes we make to the underlying bill in the Hatch-Leahy Managers' amendment satisfy my concerns. For example, S. 254 as introduced would repeal the very first section of the Federal Criminal Code dealing with ``Correction of Youthful Offenders.'' This is the section that establishes a clear presumption that the States--not the federal government--should handle most juvenile offenders [18 U.S.C. section 5001]. While the original S. 254 would repeal that provision, the Managers' amendment retains it in slightly modified form. 
   In addition, the original S. 254 would require Federal prosecutors to refer most juvenile cases to the State in cases of ``concurrent jurisdiction ..... over both the offense and the juvenile.'' This language created a recipe for sharp lawyering. Federal prosecutors could avoid referral by simply claiming there was no ``concurrent'' jurisdiction over the ``offense'' due to linguistic or other differences between the federal and state crimes. Even if the juvenile's conduct violated both Federal and State law, any difference in how those criminal laws were written could be used to argue they were different offenses altogether. This was a huge loophole that could have allowed federal prosecutors to end-run the presumption of referral to the State. 
   We fix this in the Managers' Amendment, and clarify that whenever the federal government or the State have criminal laws that punish the same conduct and both have jurisdiction over the juvenile, federal prosecutors should refer the juvenile to the State in most instances. 
   Finally, I was concerned that, contrary to current law, a federal prosecutor's decision to proceed against a juvenile in federal court would not be subject to any judicial review. The Managers' Amendment would permit such judicial review, except in cases involving serious violent or serious drug offenses. 
   Federal Trial of Juveniles as Adults. Another area of concern has been the ease with which S. 254 would allow federal prosecutors to prosecute juveniles 14 years and older as adults for any felony. 
   While I have long favored simplifying and streamlining current federal procedures for trying juveniles, I believe that judicial review is an important check in the system, particularly when you are dealing with children. 
   This bill, S. 254, included a ``reverse waiver'' proposal allowing for judicial review of most cases in which a juvenile is charged as an adult in federal court. I had suggested a similar proposal in July 1997, when I tried to amend S. 10 before the Judiciary Committee to permit limited judicial review of a federal prosecutor's decision to try certain juveniles as adults. S. 10 granted sole, non-reviewable authority to federal prosecutors to try juveniles  as adults for any federal felony, removing federal judges from that decision altogether. My 1997 amendment would have granted federal judges authority in appropriate cases to review a prosecutor's decision and to handle the juvenile case in a delinquency proceeding rather than try the juvenile as an adult. 
   Only three States in the country granted prosecutors the extraordinary authority over juvenile cases that S. 10 proposed, including Florida. Earlier this year, we saw the consequences of that kind of authority, when a local prosecutor in that State charged as an adult a 15-year-old mildly retarded boy with no prior record who stole $2 from a school classmate to buy lunch. The local prosecutor charged him as an adult and locked him up in an adult jail for weeks before national press coverage forced a review of the charging decision in the case. 
   This was not the kind of incident I wanted happening on the federal level. Unfortunately, my proposal for a ``reverse waiver'' procedure providing judicial review of a prosecutor's decision was voted down in Committee, with no Republican on the Committee voting for it. 
   I was pleased that S. 254 contained a ``reverse waiver'' provision, despite the Committee's rejection of this proposal two years ago. Though made belated, this was a welcome change in the bill. The Managers' amendment makes important improvements to that provision. 
   First, S. 254 gives a juvenile defendant only 20 days to file a reverse waiver motion after the date of the juvenile's first appearance. This time is too short, and could lapse before the juvenile is indicted and is aware of the actual charges. The Managers' amendment extends the time to make a reverse waiver motion to 30 days, which begins at the time the juvenile defendant appears to answer an indictment. 
   Second, S. 254 requires the juvenile defendant to show by ``clear and convincing'' evidence that he or she should be tried as a juvenile rather than an adult. This is a very difficult standard to meet, particularly under strict time limits. Thus, the Managers' amendment changes this standard to a ``preponderance'' of the evidence. 
   Juvenile Records. As initially introduced, S. 254 would require juvenile criminal records for any federal offense, no matter how petty, to be sent to the FBI. This criminal record would haunt the juvenile as he grew into an adult, with no possibility of expungement from the FBI's database. 
   The Managers' amendment makes important changes to this record 
   requirement. The juvenile records sent to the FBI will be limited to acts that would be felonies if committed by an adult. In addition, under the Managers' amendment, a juvenile would be able after 5 years to petition the court to have the criminal record removed from the FBI database, if the juvenile can show by clear and convincing evidence that he or she is no longer a danger to the community. Expungement of records from the FBI's database does not apply to juveniles convicted of rape, murder or certain other serious felonies. 
   Increasing Witness Tampering Penalties. This bill, S. 254, also contains a provision to increase penalties for witness tampering that I first suggested and included in the ``Youth Violence, Crime and Drug Abuse Control Act of 1997,'' S. 15, which was introduced in the first weeks of the 105th Congress, at the end of the last Congress in the ``Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of 1998,'' S. 2484, and again in S. 9, the comprehensive package of crime proposals introduced with Senator DASCHLE at the beginning of this Congress. This provision would increase the penalty for using or threatening physical force against any person with intent to tamper with a witness, victim or informant from a maximum of ten to twenty years' imprisonment. In addition, the provision adds a conspiracy penalty for obstruction of justice offenses involving witnesses, victims and informants. 
   I have long been concerned about the undermining of our criminal justice system by criminal efforts to threaten or harm witnesses, victims and informants, to stop them from cooperating with and providing assistance to law enforcement. I tried to include this provision, along with several other law enforcement initiatives, by amendment to S. 10 during Committee mark-up on July 11, 1997, but this amendment was voted down by all the Republicans on the Committee. At the end of the mark-up, however, this witness tampering provision was quietly accepted to S. 10 and I am pleased that it is also included in S. 254. 
   Eligibility Requirements for Accountability Block Grant. This bill, S. 254, substantially relaxes the eligibility requirements for the new juvenile accountability block grant. By contrast, S. 10 in the last Congress would have required States to comply with a host of new federal mandates to qualify for the first cent of grant money, such as permitting juveniles 14 years and older to be prosecuted as adults for violent felonies, establishing graduated sanctions for juvenile offenders, implementing drug testing programs for juveniles upon arrest, and nine new juvenile record-keeping requirements. These record-keeping mandates would have required, for example, that States fingerprint and photograph juveniles arrested for any felony act and send those records to the FBI, plus make all juvenile delinquency records available to law enforcement agencies and to schools, including colleges and universities. We could find no State that would have qualified for this grant money without agreeing to change their laws in some fashion to satisfy the twelve new mandates. 
   In 1997, I tried to get the Judiciary Committee to relax the new juvenile record-keeping mandates under the accountability grant program during the mark-up of S. 10. My 1997 amendment would have 
   limited the record-keeping requirements to crimes of violence or felony acts committed by juveniles, rather than to all juvenile offenses no matter how petty. But my amendment was voted down on July 23, 1997, by the Republicans on the Committee. Finally, two years later, S. 254 reflects the criticism I and others Democrats on the Judiciary Committee leveled at the strict eligibility and record-keeping requirements in S. 10. 
   Indeed, the Senate decisively rejected this approach when it defeated an amendment by a Republican Senator that would have revived those straight-jacket eligibility requirements. Specifically, his amendment would have required States to try as adults juveniles 14 years or older who committed certain crimes. As I pointed out during floor debate on this amendment, only two States would have qualified for grant funds unless they agreed to change their laws. 
   Moreover, the current bill removes the record-keeping requirements altogether from the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant. Instead, S. 254 sets up an entirely new Juvenile Criminal History Block Grant, funded at $75 million per year. To qualify for a criminal history grant, States would have to promise within three years to keep fingerprint supported records of delinquency adjudications of juveniles who committed a felony act. No more photographs required. No more records of mere arrests required. No more dissemination of petty juvenile offense records to schools required. Instead, only juvenile delinquency adjudications for murder, armed robbery, rape or sexual molestation must be disseminated in the same manner as adult records; other juvenile delinquency adjudications records may only be used for criminal justice purposes. These limitations are welcome changes to the burdensome, over-broad record-keeping requirements in the prior version of the Republican juvenile crime bill. 
   The eligibility requirements for the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant now number only three, including that the State have in place a policy of drug testing for appropriate categories of juveniles upon arrest. 
   Core Protections for Children. Much of the debate over reforming our juvenile justice system has focused on how we treat juvenile offenders who are held in State custody. Republican efforts to roll back protections for children in custody failed in the last Congress. These protections were originally put in place when Congress enacted the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 to create a formula grant program for States to improve their juvenile justice systems. This Act addressed the horrific conditions in which children were being detained by State authorities in close proximity to adult inmates--conditions  that too often resulted in tragic assaults, rapes and suicides of children. 
   As the JJDPA has evolved, four core protections have been adopted--and are working--to protect children from adult inmates and to ensure development of alternative placements to adult jails. These four core protections for juvenile delinquents are: 
   Separation of juvenile offenders from adult inmates in custody (known as sight and sound separation); 
   Removal of juveniles from adult jails or lockups, with a 24-hour exception in rural areas and other exceptions for travel and weather related conditions; 
   Deinstitutionalizaton of status offenders; and to study and direct prevention efforts toward reducing the disproportionate confinement of minority youth in the juvenile justice system. 
   Over strong objection by most of the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee in the last Congress, S. 10 eliminated three of the four core protections and substantially weakened the ``sight and sound'' separation standard for juveniles in State custody. At the same time the Committee appeared to acknowledge the wisdom and necessity of such requirements when it adopted an amendment requiring separation of juveniles and adult inmates in Federal custody. 
   This bill, S. 254, as introduced was an improvement over S. 10 in its retention of modified versions of three out of the four core protections. Specifically, S. 254 included the sight and sound standard for juveniles in Federal custody reflected in a 1997 amendment to S. 10. The same standard is used to apply to juveniles delinquents in State custody. 
   Legitimate concerns were raised that the prohibition on physical contact in S. 254 would still allow supervised proximity between juveniles and adult inmates that is ``brief and incidental or accidental,'' since this could be interpreted to allow routine and regular--though brief--exposure of children to adult inmates. For example, guards could routinely escort children past open adult cells multiple times a day on their way to a dining area. 
   The Hatch-Leahy managers' Amendment makes significant progress on the ``sight and sound separation'' protection and the ``jail removal'' protection. Specifically, our Managers' amendment makes clear that when parents in rural areas give their consent to have their children detained in adult jails after an arrest, the parents may revoke their consent at any time. In addition, the judge who approves the juvenile's detention must determine it is in the best interests of the juvenile, and may review that detention--as the judge must periodically--in the presence of the juvenile. 
   The managers' amendment also clarifies that juvenile offenders in rural areas may be detained in an adult jail for up to 48 hours while awaiting a court appearance, but only when no alternative facilities are available and appropriate juvenile facilities are too far away to make the court appearance or travel is unsafe to undertake. 
   The Hatch-Leahy managers' amendment also significantly improves the sight and sound separation requirement for juvenile offenders in both Federal and State custody. The amendment incorporates the guidance in current regulations for keeping juveniles separated from adult prisoners. Specifically, the Managers' amendment would require separation of juveniles and adult inmates and excuse only ``brief and inadvertent or accidental'' proximity in non-residential areas, which may include dining, recreational, educational, vocational, health care, entry areas, and passageways. 
   I am pleased we were able to make this progress. I appreciate that a number of Members remain seriously concerned, as do I, about how S. 254 changes the disproportionate minority confinement protection in current law. This bill, S. 254, removes any reference to minorities and requires only that efforts be made to reduce over-representation of any segment of the population. I am disappointed that Senators WELLSTONE and KENNEDY's amendment to restore this protection did not succeed yesterday, but will continue to fight in conference to restore this protection. 
   Prevention. S. 254 includes a $200 million per year Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Challenge Grant to fund both primary prevention and intervention uses after juveniles have had contact with the juvenile justice system. I and a number of other members were concerned that in the competition for grant dollars, the primary prevention uses would lose out to intervention uses in crucial decisions on how this grant money would be spent. With the help of Senator KOHL, we have included in the Hatch-Leahy Managers' amendment a clear earmark that eighty percent of the money, or $160 million per year if the program is fully funded, is to be used for primary prevention uses and the other twenty percent is to be used for intervention uses. Together with the 25 percent earmark, or about $112 million per year if that program is fully funded, for primary prevention in the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant that was passed by the Senate in the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment, this bill now reflects a substantial amount of solid funding for primary prevention uses. 
   Prosecutors' Grants. I expressed some concern when the Senate passed the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment authorizing $50 million per year for prosecutors and different kinds of assistance to prosecutors to speed up prosecution of juvenile offenders. I pointed out that this amendment did not authorize any additional money for judges, public defenders, counselors, or corrections officers. The consequence would be to only exacerbate the backlog in juvenile justice systems rather than helping it. 
   The Managers' amendment fixes that by authorizing $50 million per year in grants to State juvenile court systems to be used for increased resources to State juvenile court judges, juvenile prosecutors, juvenile public defenders, and other juvenile court system personnel. 
   Sense of Senate. I mentioned before that S. 254 includes a Sense of the Senate resolution urging States to try juveniles 10 to 14 years old as adults for crimes, such as murder, that would carry the death penalty if committed by an adult--the resolution does not urge the death penalty for such children. While Vermont is probably one of the few States that expressly allows for the trial of juveniles 10 years and older as adults for certain crimes, I do not believe that this is a matter on which the Senate must or should opine. The Managers' amendment correctly deletes that Sense of the Senate from the bill. 
   State Advisory Groups. S. 254 incorporates changes I recommended to S. 10 in the last Congress to ensure the continued existence and role of State Advisory Groups, or SAGs, in the development of State plans for addressing juvenile crime and delinquency, and the use of grant funds under the JJDPA. As 
   originally introduced, S. 10 had abolished the role of SAGs. The Judiciary Committee in 1997 adopted my amendment to preserve SAGs and require representation from a broad range of juvenile justice experts from both the public and private sectors. 
   While, as introduced, S. 254 preserved SAGs, it eliminated the requirement in current law that gives SAGs the opportunity to review and comment on a grant award to allow these experts to provide input on how best to spend the money. In addition, while the bill authorizes the use of grant funds to support the SAG, the bill does require States to commit any funds to ensure these groups can function effectively. I am pleased that the Chairman and I were able to accept an amendment sponsored by Senators KERREY, ROBERTS, and others, to ensure appropriate funding of SAGs at the State level and to support their annual meetings. 
   Protecting Children From Guns. Significantly, we have amended this bill with important gun control measures that we all hope will help make this country safer for our children. The bill as now been amended: bans the transfer to and possession by juveniles of assault weapons and high capacity ammunition clips; increases criminal penalties for transfers of handguns, assault weapons, and high capacity ammunition clips to juveniles; bans prospective gun sales to juveniles with violent crime records; expands the youth crime gun interdiction initiative to up to 250 cities by 2003 for tracing of guns used in youth crime; and increases federal resources dedicated to enforcement of firearms laws by $50 million a year. These common-sense initiatives were first included in the  comprehensive Leahy law enforcement amendment that was tabled by the majority, but were later included in successful amendments sponsored by Republican Senators. No matter how these provisions were finally included in the bill, they will help keep guns out of hands of children and criminals, while protecting the rights of law abiding adults to use firearms. 
   In addition, through the efforts of Senators LAUTENBERG, SCHUMER, KERREY and others, we were able to require background checks for all firearm purchases at all gun shows. After three Republican amendments failed to close the gun show loophole in the Brady law, and, in fact, created many new loopholes in the law, we finally prevailed. With the help of Vice President GORE's tie-breaking vote, a majority in the U.S. Senate stood up to the gun lobby and did the right thing. This is real progress. Conclusion. 
   I said at the outset of the debate on this bill that I would like nothing better than to pass responsible and effective juvenile justice legislation. I want to pass juvenile justice legislation that will be helpful to the youngest citizens in this country--not harm them. I want to pass juvenile justice legislation that assists States and local governments in handling juvenile offenders--not impose a ``one-size-fits-all'' Washington solution on them. I want to prevent juveniles from committing crimes, and not just narrowly focus on punishing children. I want to keep children who may harm others away from guns. This bill would make important contributions in each of these areas, and I am pleased to support its passage. 
   I thank the Republican manager of this important measure for his work and dedication to this effort. I commend the Minority Leader and the Minority Whip for their assistance and attention to this debate. There would not be a juvenile justice bill without them. I thank Senator KENNEDY, Senator SCHUMER, Senator KOHL and all the Democratic Members of the Judiciary Committee for helping manage this effort. Senators BINGAMAN, ROBB, BOXER, WELLSTONE and LAUTENBERG should also be singled out for their consistent efforts to improve this bill. And I would like to thank the staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Republican and Democrat, including Manus Cooney, Sharon Prost, Rhett DeHart, Michael Kennedy and Anna Cabral from Chairman HATCH's staff and Bruce Cohen, Beryl Howell, Ed Pagano, Ed Barron, J.P. Dowd, Julie Katzman and Michael Carrasco from my own. In addition Michael Myers, Stephaine Robinson, Melody Barnes and Angela Williams from Senator KENNEDY's staff and Sheryl Walter, Jon Leibowitz, Brian Lee, Neil Quinter, David Hantman, Bob Schiff, Jennifer Leach and Glen Shor, Sander Lurie and Tony Orza were exceptional in staffing these matters. I thank them all for their dedication and public service. 
   I thank Senators on both side of the aisle who worked with us, but I want to congratulate the distinguished chairman and thank him for his help.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate is able to pass the Hatch-Leahy Satellite Home Viewers Improvements Act. This bill will provide viewers with more choices and will greatly increase competition regarding network and other video programming. 
   For some time, I have been concerned about the lack of competition with cable TV and escalating cable rates. This bill will allow satellite TV providers to compete directly with cable and will give consumers a choice. It also avoids needless cutoffs of satellite TV service and protects local TV affiliates. 
   The Judiciary Committee had a full committee hearing on these satellite issues on November 12, 1997, and Chairman HATCH and I agreed to work together on this bill. On March 5, 1998, the Hatch-Leahy bill, S. 1720, was introduced and was reported out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously on October 1, 1998. It permits local TV signals, as opposed to distant out-of-State networks signals, to be offered to viewers via satellite; increase competition between cable and satellite TV providers; and provide more PBS programming by also offering a national feed as well as local programming; and reduce rates charged to consumers. 
   We have been racing against the clock because court orders have required the cutoffs of distant CBS and Fox television signals to over a million households in the U.S. 
   Under a preliminary injunction, satellite service to thousands of households in Vermont and other states was to be terminated on October 8, 1998, for CBS and Fox distant network signals for households signed up after March 11, 1997, the date the action was filed. 
   This bill will allow satellite TV to operate just like cable TV with local channels, movies, local weather, sports, CNN, news, superstations, and the like. It allows for local TV stations to be received over satellite, permanently, and could reduce satellite rates. 
   It ends the cable subscriber 90-day waiting period for those wanting to switch from cable to satellite--which has been a needless barrier to competition. 
   The bill extends distant network service to allow for a phase-in to local-  into-local TV service and creates a national PBS feed, and also will offer the local PBS. 
   It also restores all lost distant stations, if the satellite provider is willing to restore service, and delays cutoffs of all other distant signals until December 31 of this year and only for a much smaller number of dish owners. 
   Ultimately, in 2002, the bill will impose ``must carry'' rules on satellite providers just like the ``must carry'' rules for cable TV which permits a phase-in of local-to-local service. 
   The chairman of the Antitrust Subcommittee, Senator DEWINE, and the ranking member, Senator KOHL, also worked hard on this issue. 
   It is absurd that home dish owners--whether they live in Vermont, Utah or California--have to watch network stations imported from distant states. 
   This committee has worked together to protect the local broadcast system and to provide the satellite industry with a way to compete with cable. 
   Cable TV now offers a full range of local programming as well as programming regarding sports, politics, national weather, education, and a range of movies. 
   Yet, cable rates keep increasing--I want satellite TV to directly compete with cable TV. The only way they can do that is to be able to offer local TV stations. 
   We heard testimony in 1997 and 1998 that the major reason consumers do not sign up for satellite service is that they cannot get local programming. I want satellite carriers to be able to offer the full range of local programming. 
   We should be encouraging this so-called ``local-into-local'' service. Local broadcast stations contribute to our sense of community. 
   We should be encouraging competition through local-into-local service. Instead, the current policy fosters confusion-into-more-confusion service and lots of litigation. 
   By striking a burdensome and flawed limitation on satellite providers, we will be prescribing fairness for dish owners and injecting some much-needed competition into the television market. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues at conference.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in 1981 the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) came into force. The United States was instrumental in drafting that Convention, including Protocol II which imposed modest limits on the use of landmines. The United States signed the CCW, but another 15 years elapsed before President Clinton forwarded it to the Senate for its advice and consent. The U.S. finally ratified it in 1995. 
   Protocol II, commonly known as the Mines Protocol, was, during those years, the only international agreement which explicitly dealt with the use of landmines, and it was routinely ignored--not by the United States military, but by many other countries. And throughout that period the United States and other mine producers sold and gave away tens of millions of mines to other governments and rebel groups who used them against civilian populations. Our mines can be found today, and we are paying millions of dollars annually to help remove them and assist the victims, in some thirty countries. 
   By the early 1990's, it was widely recognized that the Mines Protocol had utterly failed to protect civilians from landmines. In fact, during the previous decade, the number of civilian casualties from mines skyrocketed. 
   There were many reasons for the failure of the Mines Protocol, but certainly among them was that it was riddled with loopholes, and that its rules were difficult to verify and impossible to enforce. 
   In 1992, convinced that far stronger leadership was needed to solve the mine problem, I sponsored legislation to halt United States exports of anti-personnel mines. I did so because I felt it was wrong for the United States to contribute to the carnage caused by mines, and I believed that little would change unless the United States, by setting an example, encouraged others to act. And that is what happened. In a matter of two or three years, close to fifty governments stopped exporting mines. Today, there is a de facto global export ban in effect. Even governments  that produce mines and have refused to renounce their use, including Russia and China, have publicly said that they no longer export. 
   At the same time that I was sponsoring legislation in Congress, I was also aware that ten years had elapsed since the Mines Protocol had come into force and that any party could request the United Nations to sponsor a CCW review conference. I saw this as an opportunity to strengthen the Protocol and to consider banning anti-personnel mines altogether. Since the U.S. was not a party, I and others urged the French Government to request the conference. By the time the review conference opened in late 1995, the United States had ratified the CCW and was able to participate fully in the negotiations. 
   The negotiations were difficult. Despite efforts by myself, some governments, and non-governmental organizations to promote a total ban, the idea was hardly discussed. Instead, the basic premise of the original Protocol remained unchanged--that mines are legitimate weapons of war. To its credit, the Clinton Administration made some constructive proposals dealing with, for example, the detectability of mines, and the Amended Protocol reflects some of those proposals. It requires all anti-personnel mines to contain enough iron to be detectable, and to either contain self-destruct/self-deactivation devices or be placed in marked and monitored minefields. It applies to internal conflicts, and also contains limits on certain transfers of anti-personnel mines. 
   These are notable improvements, but the negotiators again failed to include effective verification or enforcement provisions. They also refused to include a U.S. proposal to apply the prohibition on non-detectable mines to anti-vehicle mines. 
   Despite these significant flaws, I supported the Amended Protocol and encouraged the Administration to forward it to the Senate for its advice and consent. Indeed, I suspect that had I not sponsored the first law anywhere to halt exports of anti-personnel mines, or urged the French Government to request a review conference, there would not be an Amended Protocol. 
   Last year, after the Foreign Relations Committee reported what I and others regarded as a fatally flawed Resolution of Ratification, I refused to consent to its adoption by unanimous consent. At that time I made clear that the issue was not the Amended Protocol itself, but a Resolution and Committee Report that contained language that was extraneous, inaccurate, and provocative. 
   Today we are again asked to give our consent, and this time I have, with some reluctance, agreed. I say with some reluctance, because if this Resolution and the accompanying Committee Report dealt only with the Amended Protocol there would be no disagreement. In fact, we could have adopted it six months ago. But while the Resolution and Report are far preferable to the versions we were presented last year, they also contain language that has nothing whatsoever to do with the Amended Protocol. That is because, Mr. President, a few members of the Foreign Relations Committee have tried to use this Resolution as a vehicle to attack the Ottawa Convention, governments and individuals like myself who support that Convention, and current United States policy. 
   After reaching a stalemate last year, Senator  BIDEN and I worked with Senator HELMS to resolve our differences. While there is still language in the Resolution which is extraneous and I disagree with, and in the report which is extraneous, factually inaccurate and objectionable, it has been pared down substantially. For that I thank Senator BIDEN and Senator HELMS and their staffs. They worked diligently to reach a result which, while not perfect, each of us can live with. 
   One of the reasons that I am consenting to this resolution is that the objectionable report language reflects the views of only some members of the Committee. In fact, much of it deals with issues which were never considered or debated by the Committee as a whole. Rather, it is based on the testimony of a handful of like-minded witnesses at a hearing that was attended by 
   Senator HELMS and only one other Member of the Committee, who was a cosponsor of my legislation to ban United States use of anti-personnel mines except in Korea. 
   In other words, to the extent that the Helms Report purports to lay down markers for future landmine policy, it is neither binding nor representative of the views of the Committee as a whole, and even less so of the United States Senate. 
   While there is no need to address every objectionable phrase in the Report, two issues require a response. 
   First, the Report states that it is the view of many members of the Committee that the United States should not agree to any prohibition on the use, production, stockpiling or transfer of short-duration anti-personnel mines. Yet the Committee never debated this issue and the views of its members, with the exception of Senator HELMS, were never publicly expressed. Furthermore, and most important, some 135 countries have signed the Ottawa Convention which bans the production, use, transfer and stockpiling of anti-personnel mines, and 77 have ratified. They include every member of NATO except the United States and Turkey, and every Western Hemisphere country except the United States and Cuba. They also include many countries that have produced, used and exported mines in the past. 
   To suggest that the United States should remain outside the Convention that is widely and increasingly seen as establishing a new international norm outlawing anti-personnel mines, is inconsistent with United States policy and the interests of the United States. The Administration, including the Pentagon, has stated repeatedly and unequivocally that it will sign the Ottawa Convention when it has suitable alternatives to these weapons, and that it is aggressively searching for such alternatives. 
   Moreover, 67 members of the Senate voted for my amendment to halt U.S. use of anti-personnel mines, for one year. And 60 Senators, both Republicans and Democrats, including every Senator who fought in combat, cosponsored legislation introduced by myself and Senator Hagel to ban U.S. use of anti-personnel mines except in Korea. 
   Second, the Report notes that the Administration hopes to negotiate a ban on exports of anti-personnel mines in the U.N. Conference on Disarmament. I believe such a strategy is fraught with problems. It is relevant here only insofar as the Helms Report states that many members of the Committee believes that in future negotiations on an export ban the Administration should differentiate between short and long-duration mines. 
   Perhaps those members are unaware that five years ago the United States and Britain proposed such an ``export control regime.'' It was rejected out of hand not only by many of our NATO allies, but by developing countries who already had stockpiled millions of long-duration mines and saw the U.S./UK proposal as an attempt to market their higher tech, higher priced mines. Any attempt by the United States to resurrect that failed approach would only further damage U.S. credibility on the mine issue. 
   I would also refer members to the Minority views in the Report, which ably address this issue. Finally, it is notable that Senator Helms voted twice for my amendment to halt exports of antipersonnel mines, as did the then Majority Leader Robert Dole. Those amendments passed overwhelmingly, and did not differentiate between short and long-duration mines. 
   Mr. President, the Amended Mines Protocol is a step forward. If adhered to it will help reduce the maiming and killing of civilians, and United States soldiers, by landmines. If its prohibition on non-detectable mines is applied to anti-vehicle mines, as the United States has proposed, that would be a significant advance. 
   But like its predecessor, the Amended Protocol has too many loopholes and can be easily violated. It is a far cry from what is needed to achieve the goal declared by President Clinton and adopted by the U.N. General Assembly of ridding the world of anti-personnel mines. I believe that can only occur--as was done with poison gas and as the Ottawa Convention would do--by stigmatizing these indiscriminate weapons. That will take far stronger United States leadership than we have seen thus far.

   If I could have the attention of the Senator from Utah for just a moment, I suspect what we would probably do at that time, when it is prepared, is to move to set aside other things so we could do that and go forward with it.

   Let me try to get a more specific answer. That does not answer the question of the Senator from Utah. As this debate starts--we are running some traplines now--I will try to get that answer for the Senator as quickly as I can.

   Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield, I would note that we had a list of over 90 amendments entered under a consent agreement last Friday. We have pared that back to about a dozen or less. So we are making significant progress. I think what we want to do is make sure as amendments are coming up, the few that are left, Senators are not blocked by objection, as the Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER, was yesterday, or Senator LAUTENBERG last Friday. 
   Now we can move on. We have gone from 90 down to about a dozen. The managers' package is making a lot of that possible. Again, I commend the Senator from Utah for his work on this, and we should continue. 
   But while the Senator from New Jersey is debating his 
   amendment, I will try to get a clearer answer for the Senator from Utah.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, again, I ask consent not to have my time come from anybody else. 
   We are making progress. As I said, we had 90 possible amendments entered as a consent agreement last Friday. We pared that back to a dozen or less. The distinguished Senator from Utah said over the weekend that it appeared they would need about seven from their side. They offered four. That leaves about three more. 
   I point out that sometimes this debate is wise. When the Craig amendment first came up, the Senator from New Jersey, the Senator from New York, Mr. SCHUMER, and I came on the floor and said there were some very serious problems with it, that part of the drafting was left out, that it did things different from what the Senator from Idaho, Mr. CRAIG, had said it did. We were told by the Senator from Idaho that we were flatout wrong, that there was no such thing. It was a good amendment. It was adopted, then, on virtually a party line vote. 
   The next day, as soon as the press had analyzed it, they found exactly what the Senator from New York and I had said was accurate, that what the Senator from Idaho said was not accurate. There was a great flapdoodle over it--that is from the early unpublished Jefferson's ``Manual on Parliamentary Procedure,'' I tell Mr. Dove, the Parliamentarian. 
   It comes back again now, redrafted. And then, after that, it was pointed out that there were other errors, and we were told again we were wrong. A third part of the draft is coming back. Frankly, Mr. President, sometimes the debate takes a little bit longer if amendments do not do what the sponsors say they do. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I never knew how much control I had over the schedule of debate, other than to find any time I step off the floor for a few minutes I can almost be guaranteed my friend from Utah will have a criticism of the way we are handling things over here. 
   So, while we are both on the floor, I tell him we have pared back to a dozen or fewer from the 90 possible amendments entered in the consent agreement last Friday. We have made significant progress. But also, because a number of Senators have pulled down amendments over here, amendments on our side, we have done it notwithstanding what we had to put up with when the Senator from New York and I were virtually ridiculed when we pointed out the flaws in the original Craig-Hatch gun legislation, something that took 2 days of voting and revoting as they drafted and redrafted and redrafted it, as the flaws became evident. 
   They do not want to have up-or-down votes; they want to table everything. We have not done that on one the other side came up with yesterday that would have walked all over our State legislatures. That was voted down. 
   The fact of the matter is, we are going to have a series of votes this afternoon. If Senators will work at it, we can finish this bill today. But I say, as I said before, it is the Senators who should set the schedule, it is the Senators who should set the debate, and not the gun lobbies.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, notwithstanding my friendship with the Senator from Alabama, I will oppose his amendment. 
   The amendment mandates that all Federal, State, or local governments and nongovernmental entities that receive any funds under this bill have to place a written disclaimer on all materials produced or distributed to the public. 
   The amendment also mandates the Attorney General report every six months to Congress on all public comments received based on these disclaimers, although it doesn't say how many hundreds of people may have to be hired to do this. 
   The amendment is unfortunate. We are trying to pass a serious and comprehensive bill to address juvenile crime. I 
   don't understand why the other side would be insisting on placing a one-paragraph disclaimer on all publications from any entity that receives funds under this bill. It would apply to any nonprofit organization that uses Federal support under this bill. 
   For example, suppose the Boys and Girls Clubs used it to set up an afterschool process. Do they have to put a disclaimer on it? Suppose they have a leaflet passed out saying: Come at 5:30 to play softball, but we want you to have this disclaimer, and if you have any comments about it, write to the Attorney General so the Attorney General can report to the Congress. 
   I can see it: I was called out at third base. I don't think I was out. What is the Attorney General going to do about this? 
   That is what this disclaimer asks for. 
   What about the Red Cross? Well, they gave me a lousy cookie when I came in to donate blood. I want to know what the Attorney General is going to do about it. 
   The amendment is also dangerous because it can siphon off funds that can be used to prevent juvenile crime and punish juvenile offenders. It places an unfunded mandate on Federal, State, and local governments. It takes resources away from real crime-fighting programs. Nobody knows how much it is going to cost State, Federal, and local governments and nonprofit organizations to comply with this disclaimer requirement. 
   How much does it cost the Department of Justice? I would like to know how much it is going to cost for the 6-month reporting requirements. Obviously, the Department of Justice should have people devoted to crime fighting and who will be there to tally reports. And it will not be fanciful to think of somebody who got called out at third base in a softball game put together by the Boys and Girls Clubs who thinks the Attorney General should look into it. 
   The Department of Justice already prints its name and address on all publications. Why a further unfunded mandate? 
   Unless we have questions and answers about how much it is going to cost and how much it is going to take away from real crime fighting, I would oppose it. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. LEAHY. I say to the Senator from Utah, we would be willing to speed up things and accept the amendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania, if the Senator from Pennsylvania wishes. If they are interested in speeding up the time, we can do that. Obviously, the Senator from Pennsylvania is entitled to a rollcall vote, but we can save ourselves 15 or 20 minutes if we just accept it.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there has been a good debate here by the Senators from Missouri, Iowa, Vermont, Tennessee, and others who have spoken about this. I know these are extremely important amendments, especially to the primary sponsors, and the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Missouri, and the others. 
   My perspective is that as ranking member and floor manager on this side of the bill, I look at a whole lot of amendments. At one time, we had a couple hundred amendments. We whittled those down. Dozens of Senators on both sides of the aisle have agreed to withhold their amendments. I spent the weekend talking with Senators, asking them to withhold their amendments. And they did. Others we were able to get in a managers' agreement, a managers' package, something I am still waiting to hear back on from the other side. I assume we will get that. Many Senators on both sides will see the bulk of their amendments in the managers' package. But at some point we have to go on. 
   I suggest, for whatever it is worth, whatever is done, whatever is passed, whether it is the amendment of the Senator from Missouri, or whether it is the amendment of the Senator from Iowa, this issue will be in conference. The Senator from Utah and the Senator from Vermont, as the two main conferees, will have to try to work out yet another overall compromise. We have had debate for almost 2 hours. We are beyond reasonable to ask that the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Iowa simply allow the Senate to accept both amendments by a voice vote. They will be in the bill. The practical effect of that, I might say, will not be any different if a vote were to be had on the floor because we still have an issue that will be resolved ultimately in conference. The one difference will be that we have had a debate that extended for almost 2 hours. The debate will then be completed and we could go on to other issues. 
   I would like to see us finish this bill tonight. I am not propounding this as a unanimous consent request, but I am suggesting it to the Senators. The Senator from Utah is not on the floor, and I don't wish to speak for him, but the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Vermont would find that agreeable.

   Mr. LEAHY. I am not doing this as a unanimous consent request. It is just an idea. The Senators have an absolute right, on both sides, to ask for a vote on their amendments. My concern is going forward, especially even if we have votes on them, the practical results will be much the same because we are still going to have to revisit it in the committee of conference. 
   We can finish this bill tonight. I just throw it out for what it is worth. I have been here 25 years and I know the Senator has a right to get a vote on his amendment. I am just trying to get to the practical result, which will, in the end, still be the same.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while the Senator is thinking over his offer, and he will yield without losing his right to the floor, during the few moments when the Senator from Utah was otherwise engaged on the Senate floor and I discussed this with him, I made a suggestion that we actually accept both the amendments--the amendment of the Senators from Tennessee and Missouri and the amendment that the Senator from Iowa would have--knowing that it goes to conference, where the distinguished Senator from Utah will be the Chair, I will be the ranking member from the Senate. This whole issue is going to have to be revisited in conference, anyway. I can guarantee from my experience that it will be different from the other body. 
   I suggest that as a possible way out. I have a couple of reasons for doing that: No. 1, with 25 years experience, it is a pragmatic way to do it; secondly, this is the juvenile justice bill. Earlier this afternoon, I was speaking about crimes against senior citizens. If we stay on this much longer, the juveniles we are talking about today will be senior citizens that we may want to protect tomorrow. 
   I would like to bring this to an end. We have an agreement. I think there will be time agreements on anything left. The distinguished Senator from Utah and I are going to very soon propose a package of managers' amendments that wipes out a lot of the deadwood and perhaps we could go forward. 
   I throw that suggestion out again. I know the Senator from Tennessee said he would not find that acceptable, and of course he, as any Senator, has an absolute right--the Senator from Missouri, as any other Member, has an absolute right to have a vote one way or the other on their amendment or in relation to it. 
   However, I ask the Senators that they might want to consider that.

We want to get through the bill, get a final vote one way or another and do it in such a way as to protect Senators on both sides of the aisle. He has a responsibility for his side of the aisle, and I have responsibility for my side of the aisle. I take that responsibility strongly. Senators have a right to be heard and a right to vote. But at some point, we have to wrap it up and vote.

   Mr. LEAHY. May I suggest this: Senators may have good, strong debates on this--and I yield to nobody in my admiration of the Senator from Iowa and what he has done. I have taken his lead on so many issues involving the disabled because he is a recognized national expert on this. 
   My suggestion, another possibility, is we set this matter aside and start voting on some of the things we have already 
   done. We finished debate, or all but the last couple of minutes of debate, on the Lautenberg amendment. Let's vote on that. Let's vote on something on the chairman's side of the aisle and maybe set it in such a way that those votes will come within a few minutes of each other. 
   During that time, Senators will be able to talk more. The Senator from Utah and I will be able to bring up the managers' amendment and then see if it is possible to have time agreements, but time agreements in such a way that Senators will know this amendment comes up at this time, this amendment comes up at another time, so there will be more focus. 
   I suggest that as a possibility. We also know that as much as we talk, oftentimes these things are worked out during a rollcall vote. That is one way we can do it.

I don't make that as a request, but I suggest that really as a way out of all of this without giving up anything.

I am not sure the managers' package would even need a rollcall vote. If that is the case, the first rollcall vote will be on the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey, and the next one would be--well, it would be whatever order the distinguished leader has spoken. Again, based on the experience I have had managing bills, I tend to agree with the distinguished majority leader. This might be a good way to get us moving. I also suggest that it protects the Senator from Iowa, the Senator from Missouri, and the Senator from Tennessee. But it moves us forward.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Chairman and I have been able to put together a managers' amendment and a package of amendments that improve S. 254 in a number of ways that should please Members from both sides of the aisle. We have accomplished this task by finding the middle ground, and the bill will be a better one for it. 
   I said last week during the Senate's consideration of this bill that we should not care whether a proposal comes from the Republican or Democratic side of the aisle. A good proposal that works should get the support of all of us. Our first question should be whether a program or proposal will help our children effectively, not whether it is a Democratic or Republican proposal. 
   This managers' amendment and package of amendments reflects that philosophy. It shows that when this body rolls up its sleeves and gets to work, we can make significant progress. I commend the Chairman for his leadership in this effort and I am glad we were able to work together constructively to improve this bill. 
   Many Members had good additions and modifications to make to this bill, and we have agreed to accept them in the managers' package of amendments. 
   In addition to the amendments included in the package, the chairman and I have worked together on a managers' amendment to address a number of my longstanding concerns with the underlying bill. Let me explain what those changes accomplish. 
   I noted my concern at the beginning of this debate that the State prerogative to handle juvenile offenders would be undermined by this bill. The changes we made to the underlying bill in the managers' amendment satisfies my concerns. For example, S. 254 as introduced would repeal the very first section of the Federal Criminal Code dealing with ``Correction of Youthful Offenders.'' This is the section that establishes a clear presumption that the States--not the federal government--should handle most juvenile offenders--18 U.S.C. section 5001. While the original S. 254 would repeal that provision, the managers' amendment retains it in slightly modified form. 
   In addition, the original S. 254 would require Federal prosecutors to refer most juvenile cases to the State in cases of ``concurrent jurisdiction ..... over both the offense and the juvenile.'' This language created a recipe for sharp lawyering. Federal prosecutors could avoid referral by simply claiming there was no ``concurrent'' jurisdiction over the ``offense'' due to linguistic or other differences between the federal and state crimes. Even if the juvenile's conduct violated both Federal and State law, any difference in how those criminal laws were written could be used to argue they were different offenses altogether. This was a huge loophole that could have allowed federal prosecutors to end-run the presumption of referral to the State. 
   We fix this in the managers' amendment, and clarify that whenever the federal government or the State have criminal laws that punish the same conduct and both have jurisdiction over the juvenile, federal prosecutors should refer the juvenile to the State in most instances. 
   Finally, I was concerned that, contrary to current law, a federal prosecutor's decision to proceed against a juvenile in federal court would not be subject to any judicial review. The managers' amendment would permit such judicial review, except in cases involving serious violent or serious drug offenses. 
   Another area of concern has been the ease with which S. 254 would allow federal prosecutors to prosecute juveniles 14 years and older as adults for any felony. 
   While I have long favored simplifying and streamlining current federal procedures for trying juveniles, I believe that judicial review is an important check in the system, particularly when you are dealing with children. S. 254 included a ``reverse waiver'' proposal allowing for judicial review of most cases in which a juvenile is charged as an adult in federal court. I had suggested a similar proposal last year. The managers' amendment makes important improvements to that provision. 
   First, S. 254 gives a juvenile defendant only 20 days to file a reverse waiver motion after the date of the juvenile's first appearance. This time is too short, and could lapse before the juvenile is indicted and is aware of the actual charges. The managers' amendment extends the time to make a reverse waiver motion to 30 days, which begins at the time the juvenile defendant appears to answer an indictment. 
   Second, S. 254 requires the juvenile defendant to show by ``clear and convincing'' evidence that he or she should be tried as a juvenile rather than an adult. This is a very difficult standard to meet, particularly under strict time limits. Thus, the managers' amendment changes this standard to a ``preponderance'' of the evidence. 
   As initially introduced, S. 254 would require juvenile criminal records for any federal offense, no matter how petty, to be sent to the FBI. This criminal record would haunt the juvenile as he grew into an adult, with no possibility of expungement from the FBI's database. 
   The managers' amendment makes important changes to this record requirement. The juvenile records sent to the FBI will be limited to acts that would be felonies if committed by an adult. In addition, under the managements' amendment, a juvenile would be able after 5 years to petition the court to have the criminal record removed from the FBI database, if the juvenile can show by clear and convincing evidence that he or she is no longer a danger to the community. Expungement of records from the FBI's database does not apply to juveniles convicted of rape, murder, or certain other serious felonies. 
   Much of the debate over reforming our juvenile justice system has focused on how we treat juvenile offenders who are held in State custody. The Federal government for years has required States, in order to qualify for certain grant funds, to provide certain core protections, including separating juveniles from adult inmates, keeping status offenders out of secure facilities, and focusing prevention efforts to reduce disproportionate confinement of minority youth. 
   In the last Congress, S. 10 either eliminated or gutted each of these core protections. The chairman and Senator SESSIONS significantly improved S. 254 in this regard, and I commend them for that. The managers' amendment continues to make progress on the ``sight and sound separation'' protection and the ``jail removal'' protection. 
   Specifically, the managers amendment would make clear that when parents in rural areas give their consent to have their children detained in adult jails after an arrest, the parents may revoke their consent at any time. In addition, the judge who approves the juvenile's detention must determine it is in the best interests of the juvenile, and may review that detention--as the judge must periodically--in the presence of the juvenile. 
   The managers' amendment also clarifies that juvenile offenders in rural areas may be detained in an adult jail for up to 48 hours while awaiting a court appearance, but only when no alternative facilities are available and  appropriate juvenile facilities are too far away to make the court appearance or travel is unsafe to undertake. 
   The managers' amendment contains a significant improvement in the sight and sound separation requirement for juvenile offenders in both Federal and State custody. S. 254 has been criticized for allowing ``brief and incidental'' proximity between juveniles and adult inmates. This amendment fixes that by incorporating the guidance in current regulations for keeping juveniles separated from adult prisoners. Specifically, the managers' amendment would require separation of juveniles and adult inmates and excuse only ``brief, inadvertent or accidental'' proximity in non-residential areas, which may include dining, recreational, educational, vocational, health care, entry areas, and passageways. 
   I am pleased we were able to make this progress. I appreciate that a number of Members remain concerned, as do I, about how S. 254 changes the disproportionate minority confinement protection in current law. This will be an important debate, and I continue to believe we should support an amendment intended to correct that part of S. 254.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this amendment prohibits any Federal agency, such as the Marines, Army, Navy, or Air Force, from granting permission to use Federal property or resources or cooperating if the motion picture or TV show to be produced ``glorifies or endorses wanton and gratuitous violence.'' If any portion of the movie uses any Federal property, the entire movie is subject to Federal scrutiny 
   Federal agencies, other than the military, would be given these new censorship powers, too. The Department of Agriculture could determine if it is on forest lands or rights of way of the Interior Department and otherwise. Could they have kept ``North By Northwest'' with Cary Grant off because the visitors center scene at Mount Rushmore was in it? What about ``Fargo''? What about the Presidio military base in San Francisco that was used as a setting for the Sean Connery movie, ``The Presidio''? This amendment is flawed. What glorifies violence is in the eye of the beholder. 
   Even movies, like legislation, have last-minute changes. Would you have to have a Department of Agriculture bureaucrat sitting there all the way through? Many scenes in the movie ``Top Gun'' would have had to be carefully monitored during production to  ensure they did not glorify violence. The naval base that was used was Miramar in California. 
   The fight in ``An Officer and a Gentleman'' also might be considered excessive by some. What about the gratuitous punch by Jimmy Stewart in ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington''? ``The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,'' uses the vast national forest lands in its filming, even though most of it was filmed in Mexico. Could part of it be knocked out? 
   There are only exceptions for news and public service announcements, but any movie that is a historical depiction of a war would be subject to agency bureaucrats deciding whether violence was gratuitous or glorifies violence. Sponsors may say: Let them go somewhere else and do their filming, let them go to private property or parklands or military bases. I think that is a shortsighted response. Some may want to use that property to be authentic. 
   I am concerned how this is going to work. Do we turn over our scripts? If you are a movie producer or maker, do you turn over the script to the Department of Agriculture, Department of the Interior, Department of Defense first and decide whether it is safe? We may not like all that we see from Hollywood. But I have no confidence in the decisions the agency censors make. I am perfectly capable of censoring what I see. I was perfectly capable, when my children were young, to censor what they saw. But I do not want an official, however well intentioned, in the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Defense or the Department of the Interior, to determine what I see. 
   I retain the remainder of my time.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are well aware of what the military does. The military will permit use--in fact, some suggest even will help underwrite, indirectly, the costs of a film if it makes the military look good. 
   The military has been known in the past to withdraw support, even classic films, if they suggest the military may have made a mistake anywhere--Vietnam or anywhere else. We have seen that kind of censorship. 
   I understand they are using military areas. I do not necessarily agree with it. I think they have been very sensitive with that, but then the military is used to censorship. They do it with the news. They did it during the gulf war. They did it during Vietnam. I suspect they are doing it now. 
   What I am concerned about, though, is when you talk about the vast forest land and somebody one day in the Department of Agriculture, who works on, I don't know, dairy price supports, and the next day is going to be the person to censor what goes in that movie, whether that forest can be the background or, if it is out west where the Department of the Interior controls so much land--I can think of movies, shoot 'em ups, with Ronald Reagan galloping by the sites in areas controlled by the Department of the Interior. It might have been declined because somebody did not like him. Maybe somebody who normally does fishing permits in the Department of the Interior will determine what movies will be made or what they like or do not like. 
   We open ourselves to a strange area. Those who are opposed to wanton violence should do as I do--don't go to those movies. Nothing votes better than your checkbook. If you do not want your children to go to them, do not let your children go to them. Stop the checkbook. That is the way to do it. 
   Do not put our Department of Agriculture and Department of the Interior and others into censorship. Do not let them make some of the mistakes the Department of Defense has made in the past in refusing permission for something because they are afraid it will show a general or a colonel or admiral  making a mistake, because we all know they never do. I can see them deciding it might be gratuitous violence to show--oh, I don't know--maybe when their bombs go astray and hit the Chinese Embassy. We know they never make a mistake like that, but they may say this is gratuitous violence, so they are not going to allow any help in making such a movie. 
   I retain the remainder of my time.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I can think of some ads I see on local TV at night that are not violent but I find of a personal nature offensive, some of which are filled with backgrounds of Government land. Should we start taking those out? 
   The fact is, we have a lot of Government sites. Do we stop a movie, for example, that is filmed with somebody driving down Pennsylvania Avenue because the Department of the Interior, the Justice Department, and other Government buildings are seen in the background? Do we make sure there is never any depiction of the Capitol? One of the most violent things was ``Independence Day'' when a model of the Capitol was blown up. There may have been exterior shots actually made of the Capitol prior to that time. Does that go out? 
   I suggest these because we are getting into a terribly subjective area, and we are asking people who are trained to do very good things for our Government, whether it is fishing permits, lands permits, or agricultural subsidies--they are not trained, nor should they be, in this Nation especially to be censors. 
   I know the time of the Senator from Kentucky has expired. I yield back all my remaining time.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the problem with this, of course, is that nobody, when they start out on a movie, knows exactly what form their movie is going to be in in the end. Basically what you are saying is somebody in the Department of Agriculture--for example, if you want to do something on the eastern forest or have eastern forest in the background--some bureaucrat in the Department of Agriculture has to determine, before you even start filming the movie, what the final edited copy of the movie will look like at the end before the decision can be made. That person at the Department of Agriculture might do dairy price supports one day and Block Buster Steven Spielberg movies the next day. 
   I understand what my friend from Kentucky wants to do. But the best way to censor violence in movies is don't go to violent movies. But don't ask somebody at the Department of the Interior who does fishing permits, for example, to determine whether a national forest can be used as a background somewhere in a movie that has not yet been made.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate has considered S. 254 for portions of five days. The first day we were prevented from offering any amendments until almost 3 p.m. in the afternoon. When I tried to offer a first Democratic amendment, the underlying amendment to which it was offered was withdrawn and we started all over. Finally, we were able to offer amendments alternating back and forth across the aisle. 
   Three amendments were debated and voted on Tuesday evening and my law  enforcement amendment was offered and left pending overnight. On Wednesday we continued to offer amendments on an alternating basis through the day and voted on four more amendments. 
   The Senate fell into a pattern of tabling amendments offered by Democrats only to see those amendments come back as Republican sponsored amendments that were then adopted. Thus, after rejecting the Leahy law enforcement amendment we saw an amendment offered by Senator ASHCROFT to add back several of its measures and had the McCain amendment on these same matters offered and withdrawn. 
   Unquestionably the Senate hit a real snag on this bill when it rejected, on a virtual party line vote, the Lautenberg amendment and we saw first the Craig amendment and then Hatch-Craig II seeking to reclaim ground on the gun show amendment. Senator SCHUMER and I tried to point out problems with the Craig amendment only to be told that we were wrong on Wednesday night and right the morning after the amendment was adopted. 
   On Wednesday the Senate had under consideration eight amendments through the day and voted on four of those. On Thursday the Senate voted on four more amendments and debated the Schumer Internet gun amendment and Hatch-Craig II on gun shows. 
   On Friday, despite the plans of many Senators to travel to the Balkans and others to be away on other business, we continued debating and voting. There were two additional votes and six additional amendments were offered for debate with votes to be scheduled this week. 
   It was also on Friday that the Majority Leader attempted to leave this juvenile crime bill and move off onto other matters. By my calculation, it was after the Senate had been permitted only the equivalent of three days on the juvenile crime bill spread over the course of four calendar days. If I recall correctly, the Senate spent almost that amount of time, a couple of years ago, renaming Reagan National Airport. 
   Indeed, the Majority Leader filed cloture on his motion to proceed to S. 96 immediately after moving to proceed back to that bill and abandon Senate efforts on the juvenile violence legislation. It is that vote that is now approaching. It is that vote that will determine whether we abandon our effort to craft a juvenile violence bill or not. I urge all Senators to stay the course and not abandon this effort. 
   Rather I would urge that we adopt the words of the Majority Leader from Friday when he said: ``Give it a reasonable time, give it full debate, have reasonable amendments, and then vote.'' 
   No one can seriously claim that Democrats are being dilatory or filibustering this bill. We have proceeded promptly from the moment the Majority Leader called it up for debate and proceeded to offer amendments from the earliest opportunity. I marvel at comments by the sponsors of the bill that it should have been passed with one day's consideration. 
   The fact is that the bill was not the product of Judiciary Committee action but was introduced by the Majority Leader and the Chairman and five other Republicans from the Judiciary Committee this January and placed directly on the Senate calendar. The sponsors objected to its being referred to the Judiciary Committee and thereby prevented it. 
   It has sat on the Senate Calendar since January, without hearings, without an opportunity to be considered by the Judiciary Committee, and without any opportunity for any Democrats to offer improvements or amendments to it. 
   It should not go unnoticed that in spite of the fact that they drafted the bill, so far Republican cosponsors of the bill have sponsored 10 of the 13 Republican-offered amendments to it--the bill's sponsors have sponsored 10 of the Republican amendments so far. It is disingenuous for Republicans to seek leave to revise, reedit and amend their own bill and deny Democrats a fair opportunity to help shape that legislation through the amendment process. How about a commensurate opportunity for others to offer amendments to that work product, too? 
   The Senate last week had 13 roll call votes on amendments, Senator HATCH accepted one and the Senate accepted one on a voice vote after a tabling motion failed. We have adopted seven amendments by roll call votes, including the two Craig amendments, and tabled five amendments by roll call votes. We were making progress on the bill and I was gratified to hear the encouraging words of the Majority Leader on Thursday. 
   By last Friday, we had whittled the 89 likely Democratic amendments down by almost half and we have continued working to reduce them. On Friday we reached agreement on a finite list of possible amendments of which there were over 40 reserved not for Democrats but for Republicans. 
   I have been working on a managers' package with Senator HATCH and believe that one should be ready to be accepted today that will go a long way toward reducing the remaining amendments on both sides and clearing the way to concluding Senate action on this measure. I hope that Senator HATCH will continue to work with me to offer that package without further delay. 
   After acceptance of that managers' amendment, I expect the remaining Democratic amendments will number less than a dozen, probably less than 10, and maybe less than that. Thus, if all the Democrats in the Senate could just have the opportunity to offer a number of amendments equal to the number of amendments offered so far by three of the original Republican sponsors of the bill, that would likely conclude Senate consideration of the bill and we could move to a vote on final passage. 
   From all that Senator HATCH has been saying since Sunday, after offering amendments on Friday and Monday, the Republican side has only another three amendments to offer. It would be a shame for the majority to pull the bill now. 
   In spite of the filing of the Republican motion to pull this bill and move back to the Y2K bill that was debated last month, Democrats have continued offering amendments, when permitted by the Republican majority. Unfortunately, Republican objection last Friday prevented Senator LAUTENBERG from offering his amendment in an effort to get a final vote on the language to be used in the context of gun show sales after Hatch-Craig II modified that language for a second time. I trust that there will be progress on that front today as we proceed and that other Democratic amendments will be allowed to be offered. 
   It is my understanding that the next two amendments to be offered should be Democratic amendments, since we concluded Monday's session with two Republican amendments in a row. 
   To date, after the filing of the cloture petition to end action on the juvenile violence bill and move off it and back to a debate on Y2K liability protection for certain businesses, there have been 13 amendments offered and now pending and awaiting Senate votes. As many amendments were offered on Friday and Monday as were voted upon on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. It is hard to see how anyone could say that we are not making progress and not making a strong good faith effort on this measure. 
   Let me put this debate in its proper context. In the last Congress, the Judiciary Committee considered S. 10, a juvenile crime bill, and the predecessor to this measure. When Senator HATCH refers to years of work on S. 254, he is referring to the work we did to improve S. 10 in the last Congress. The Judiciary Committee met on six separate occasions to consider 52 amendments to S. 10--40 amendments were adopted by unanimous consent and 12 amendments were considered by roll call votes. 
   As I have noted, the bill before us today, S. 254, was never considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The sponsors bypassed the Judiciary Committee. Democrats never had the chance in Committee to debate it, to offer amendments to S. 254 or to improve it. Is it any wonder that Democrats have amendments to this bill and would like an opportunity to be heard on the important subject of juvenile violence? Democrats' first opportunity to improve this bill is during this Senate floor debate. 
   Also recall that when Democrats were in the majority and Republicans in the minority in 1994, there was a rather full debate on crime legislation.  The Senate considered the 1994 crime bill for 12 days over three weeks, and considered 99 amendments to the 1994 crime bill. 
   Let us keep focused on the task of completing consideration of this juvenile violence bill without moving the Senate off onto other matters and abandoning this important effort. Does anyone really believe that the consideration of liability limited Y2K legislation is more important this month than completing Senate action on a juvenile violence bill? I urge a no vote on the Republican cloture motion and ask Republicans then to join with Democrats to continue to work to complete action on the juvenile violence bill. 
   We are improving the bill by means of this Senate debate. Senator HATCH and I are agreeing to include suggestions from Senators from both sides of the aisle in a managers' amendment that should be accepted today. We have made and are making excellent progress. The Senate should be allowed to complete its work on this important legislation. 
   We were pleased when the Majority Leader honored his commitment, made during the previous Senate debate on the Y2K bill, S. 96, to take up this measure as a vehicle for youth violence amendments. It would be ironic if we now abandoned that effort to return for a second time to the debate on Y2K legislation before being given an opportunity to complete action on this measure. The Senate should reject cloture on the motion to pull the juvenile violence bill and continue our important work on this measure. 
   Mr. President, we have not spent a great deal of time on the juvenile crime bill. I think we spent the same amount of time renaming the National Airport. We spent only a fraction of the time on the last crime bill when the Democrats controlled the Senate because of the time taken by the Republican side. There were 99 amendments on that crime bill, I point out. 
   The fact of the matter is that we can pass a good juvenile crime bill or we can give into a powerful lobby. 
   I have been a gun owner since I was 14. I trained my children in the use of guns. I come from the only State in the Union with no gun control laws, but I tell you right now my duty is first and foremost to the Senate, not to a gun lobby. I believe Senators should determine the schedule on this bill, not the gun lobbies. Senators should vote this bill up or vote it down, not have it withdrawn at the behest of any lobby, even one as powerful as the gun lobby. 
   We worked all weekend--all weekend--and we have removed most of the amendments pending. 
   I point out that so far the Republicans who cosponsored the bill, sponsored 10 of the 13 Republican amendments to this bill. We have taken longer to vote on at least one amendment to accommodate Senators who were out, some for a fundraiser, than we did on the debate on that amendment. 
   We reached on Friday an agreement on a finite list of possible amendments. We have a possible managers' package that could do this. We can finish this bill. I think if we want to do the actual work, we will get it done. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object--and my distinguished friend from Mississippi discussed this with me before during the vote--and as I have told my friend from Mississippi and my friend from Utah, we are continuing to work to whittle down the number of amendments certainly on our side. As I had assured my friend from Utah over the weekend, I and my staff have spent a lot of time talking to Democratic Members, and we have cut out a number of amendments. 
   I do want to see this bill completed. I do want a good juvenile justice bill. Also, I want to get us on to Y2K, as the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator DASCHLE, said he is in favor of the Y2K bill. He is in favor of going immediately, after juvenile justice, to the Y2K bill. 
   The distinguished majority leader is absolutely right in what he said about the supplemental. I suspect--I have not talked with Senator STEVENS and Senator BYRD--that is going to go fairly rapidly. 
   We are going to have our caucus luncheons. The distinguished Senator from North Carolina wishes to begin a series of justly-deserved tributes to the admiral. I ask the distinguished leader if he would withdraw for now the unanimous consent agreement, let us work during our caucus luncheons with other Members to try to get this up so we can accommodate both the Republican and Democratic side, get amendments voted up or down, and get the bill voted up or down.

   Mr. LEAHY. If the distinguished leader will yield further, I will be very brief. In my 25 years here, I have seen majority leaders, distinguished majority leaders, both Republican and Democrat, try to whittle down bills in time, and usually when they propose time agreements, the number of amendments has expanded. In this case, I say the good news for the distinguished Senator from Mississippi is, each time he has done this, actually the numbers have dwindled, and dwindle and dwindle. 
   I suggest that perhaps the distinguished Senator from Utah and I continue our efforts and report to our respective leaders after the caucus where we stand. 
   I see the distinguished Senator from Utah on the floor. I know that he wants the floor, and so I will yield.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know the distinguished Senator from Utah would not want to leave a wrong impression about what has happened, so perhaps I might flesh out his remarks just a tad. 
   One, it should be noted that every single Democratic Senator wants to see a juvenile justice bill passed. The comments about pulling the bill down have all come from the Republican side of the aisle, not from the Democratic side of the aisle. 
   As far as working on this, I am not sure to what the Senator is referring. I don't know when I have spent so much time on the phone, the computer and e-mails, and on a bill as I have this past weekend. Our staffs have worked late into the night. We were given a wish list from the Republican staff, as was appropriately done at the beginning of the weekend. We worked on that all weekend long, calling Senators all over the country on it. As of last night, we had cleared 40 amendments. That is progress. That is very significant progress. 
   Now, the distinguished Senator from Utah said on the talk shows this weekend that they need seven amendments on the Republican side. Four were introduced yesterday, but this morning there are suddenly 10. We have kind of floating numbers here. But the facts are such that we have been working and we have cleared a very large number of amendments that Senators never have to see. 
   The last crime bill took 12 days. There were 99 amendments. We walked through it, and we did it. I remember being on that committee of conference, and the distinguished Senator from Utah may recall that we were there until 3, 4, 5 o'clock in the morning. These were complex issues, but we got it done. The crime rate has been coming down for 6 years--something that I have not seen under any other administration before--Republican or Democrat. So we can get somewhere on this. 
   We have significant issues in here. Every single Member on this side of the aisle is committed to seeing a juvenile justice bill passed. We want to go on to debate and vote on Y2K. The majority leader is correct in saying the supplemental has to be passed. We are not trying to delay it. I assure my friend from Utah that an enormous amount of work was done this weekend, and it was done until very late last night. I think my last e-mail on this came through to me at about 12:30, 12:45 this morning. We are getting it done. 
   Now, the distinguished Senator from North Carolina has been sitting here patiently and wishes to speak about a lifetime friend, a man who deserves a great deal of honor and praise by this Senate from both sides. I think we would do the Senate well and the memory of the great man well by both of us holding this debate until after the caucus. I thank the distinguished Senator from North Carolina for his courtesy, which was doubly helpful this morning because I know this is a difficult time for him. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday, in the New York Times, William Safire had an essay called ``Cut the Apologies.'' I am shortly going to ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the RECORD. It perhaps says some things beyond what I might, but I am concerned. I have watched what has happened and the reactions of China to the accidental bombing of their Embassy in Belgrade. I hold no brief for the totally negligent--I might even say stupid--mistake made in the bombing of that Embassy. It is as inexcusable and unexplainable as the maps that brought about the death of the people in the cable car in northern Italy. 
   Having said that, however, for the Chinese, who will not allow any kind of demonstrations--and haven't since Tiananmen Square--criticizing their own government, to whip people into a frenzy and let them go and destroy much of our Embassy and the British Embassy in Beijing, and to say how shocked they are that this is going on, and that we have done that, demanding all kinds of apologies, frankly, is irresponsible and unimaginable. I can't accept it. I don't know how many people would. 
   If the Chinese think that by doing this somehow we are now going to jump in and let them join the WTO and everything else, that is a sad mistake. Their conduct is incomprehensible. We have apologized for bombing the Embassy, which we would expect somebody to do with a similar mistake damaging ours. This is a war going on, and things happen, as General Schwarzkopf said, in the fog of war. 
   China is not the one to lecture the world on free and open demonstrations. China is not the one to lecture us on how we should conduct our economy. China has a great deal to explain on everything from their attempt to steal our secrets, spying on our country, and human rights violations in their own country and their own repression.

I mention that not to in any way deter this from being agreed to, but I say to the distinguished Senator from Utah and the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, we will all be on the conference if this bill passes.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I cannot think of anything that a parent, a community, or a family would want to do more than to join in their expressions of grief if a disaster struck. 
   In my family, a disaster like Columbine--in fact, it is almost impossible to say how one would even get through it. I suspect we would gather as a family; we would gather with our community; we would go to our church. Expressions are made in schools, of course. 
   I do not question the concerns of the distinguished author of this amendment, which are heartfelt. I know him as a good and honest man. I worry, though, that we set a precedent involving our first amendment. 
   Our Constitution says everyone has equal access to the courts to assert constitutional rights. This amendment can be read to promote one constitutional viewpoint while depriving those who hold the opposing viewpoint of their day in court. 
   If this becomes law, those who complain of free exercise clause violations by public authorities that exclude religious observances from public spaces could do so with the benefit of additional fee-shifting, whereas those who make the opposite claim--that the establishment clause has been violated--will be disadvantaged. 
   The first amendment's religion clauses are meant to ensure that the Government is neutral in matters of religion. It says you can practice any religion you want or none if you want, but the Government will remain neutral, thus providing the diversity in this Nation of so many religions, a diversity which has greatly promoted our democracy. 
   This legislation, by offering the Attorney General's assistance to those who take one viewpoint, while depriving those who take the opposite viewpoint of normal civil rights law remedies, violates this most basic principle of neutrality. 
   The congressional finding paints with far too broad a brush. It could encompass a variety of activities that violate the first amendment. 
   While I joined in my own State in gatherings to express condolences to those of the tragedy, I have been in memorial services, I have been in churches and in synagogues where we have prayed for those who have been the victims of tragedies. We have done it knowing that was an appropriate place to do it. I have gathered with families in public gatherings where we have expressed, within the context we do in a public setting, our feelings, and that is appropriate. 
   As I said, I do not know how the people, not only Columbine but so many communities which have been visited with tragedy, can even get through the tragedy. I do not know how a parent in these tragedies again, without fear, can ever send their child off to school. 
   Let us not, in our unified intent within this body to show our sympathy, in any way diminish the protections of our first amendment. It is too important to all of us. 
   I have great respect for the sponsor of this amendment. I have great respect for his honesty and his feelings of sympathy. I have joined with other Senators on the floor of the Senate in expressing my sympathy. I worry this is overly broadly against the first amendment, and because of that, I have to oppose it. I am perfectly willing to yield back time.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when the predecessor to this bill was introduced in the last Congress, I raised a number of concerns about the bill. I am glad to see that this amendment is much improved from the Hatch-Feinstein gang bill in the last Congress. 
   This amendment also contains proposals that Senator DEWINE and I have worked on together. For example, this amendment contains new procedures for law enforcement to obtain clone pagers. These are pagers held by law enforcement that duplicate the numeric messages received by a drug dealer or other criminal. This is a useful tool for law enforcement and I have long worked to streamline the procedures for the FBI, the DEA and other law enforcement agencies to obtain legal authorization to use clone pagers. 
   For including this clone pager proposal in the amendment, along with the other improvements made by the sponsors, they should be commended. I know they worked hard on this amendment. 
   I remain concerned about some of the penalties in this amendment. The amendment calls for a new death penalty and new mandatory minimums that should be revised in conference.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the Senior Senator from West Virginia for his dedication to enforcing state liquor laws. But I must disagree with his approach. The Byrd amendment would permit the enforcement of state liquor laws in Federal court. This expansion of the jurisdiction of the Federal courts is not warranted and raises constitutional problems because one state may impose its laws on the citizens of another state under this amendment. 
   In the Judiciary Committee, we recently held a hearing on this issue of direct sales of alcohol products over the Internet and via mail order. In our hearing, several expert witnesses raised questions about a similar bill by Senator HATCH, S. 577. I would like to work with Senator BYRD, Senator HATCH and others on the Judiciary Committee to see if we can refine this legislation to make sure it will pass constitutional muster. I have my doubts about constitutionality of the language before us today and will have to vote against the Byrd amendment as currently drafted. 
   If the full Senate is to pass an amendment today on the interstate shipment of alcohol, I believe the amendment by Senator FEINSTEIN is a more targeted and sounder approach. 
   Her amendment would require clear labeling of alcoholic beverages shipped interstate and require the signature of an adult upon delivery of the alcoholic beverages. 
   The Feinstein amendment does not raise constitutional issues and is targeted at preventing any underage purchase of alcoholic beverages over the Internet or through other direct sales. 
   I will vote against the Byrd amendment and for the Feinstein amendment, because I believe that hers is constitutionally far more acceptable but also hits the problem far better.

   Mr. LEAHY. What this does, I tell Senators on my side of the aisle, is say we will have two votes tonight. They have to go out of the sequence, but then we go back to the sequence. It is my understanding, from the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, that  those will be the only two rollcall votes we will have tonight, and then we will be back on the sequence tomorrow, if I am correct.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have to oppose this. I have to oppose this, because, one, it would help only two States in the country, Kentucky and Mississippi. It conditions the juvenile accountability block grant in the bill to the other 48 States only if their legislatures did something that they have all refused to do. 
   We are telling these other States that their legislatures are totally irrelevant; they must change their law because we know better here. I really don't think that is the way to go. I come from a State that has probably the toughest juvenile laws in the country, but I am not going to tell my State how they must do. Frankly, Mr. President, I oppose the amendment. I hope the 48 States that would be cut out by this would listen to what the National Governors' Association said when they, Republicans and Democrats alike, urged the Senate not to go forward with this.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the reason the Governors of these States, all of them, wrote to the Democratic and Republican leaders in opposition to this is it would knock out the juvenile accountability block grant in the bill to 48 of the States--48 of the States. The only two that would get anything would be Kentucky and Mississippi. It would tell the other 48 States that their legislatures are irrelevant, their laws are irrelevant. We know better. That is true even in some States that have tougher laws than this would propose. 
   Because of that, I agree with the Governors, Republican and Democrat; we should not override our States this way. I oppose it.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of a Vermont business and civic leader who is retiring today. Kenneth J. Leenstra is leaving as the president of General Dynamics Armament Systems in Burlington, VT. Over the past 35 years, he held several management positions at General Electric, Lockheed-Martin, and most recently at General Dynamics. 
   Ken oversaw the Burlington plant through the defense drawdown after the end of the cold war. It was a difficult time for the workers, and for managers like Ken who struggled to keep his plant efficient while orders dwindled. Through it all, Ken was dedicated to developing solutions that met the needs of his customers, and on maintaining a commitment to quality that meant that Burlington-made products were second to none. His commitment to quality earned his business numerous awards that are widely recognized across the defense industry. 
   On behalf of his many friends in the Burlington area, I want to express my thanks to Ken and his family and wish him the very best as he embarks on his retirement.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, first, I commend the distinguished Presiding Officer for his usual fairness, something I have expressed before. I say to my good friend from Utah that nobody would ever accuse you of being uptight. I don't know where you ever got that idea. The Senator from Utah and I have worked very closely on this and will continue to do so. 
   But on this particular amendment, I do have some grave concerns. When it was first brought up, I said on this floor that there were serious problems with it, as did the Senator from New York. The proponents basically told us we didn't know what we were talking about, and it was rammed through on basically a party-line vote. 
   The next day they came back and said: Oh, by the way, you were right. We're really sorry about that. We want to do it over again. 
   Well, in my religion we believe in redemption, and I assume that is at least partial redemption. But it shows what can happen if they could get away with it. It was going to go through, but it was discovered. The objections that the Senators from New York and New Jersey and I raised were heard, and so they came back. 
   Now, at the eleventh hour, the last minute, they come out with another amendment which still does not close loopholes and does nothing to stop what I have raised on this floor for several days now; and that is the question of doing away with State courts and Federal courts--basically a court-stripping bill. 
   The Senator from Utah is right when he says there should be bipartisan concern on juvenile justice. And I believe there is. 
   But if he is worried about what is taking a lot of time--when we have all of these provisions, and when presented by Democrats they are all voted down on a party-line vote, and then the next day they are brought up in a Republican amendment and now they are OK--maybe we would do it a little bit quicker if we would vote on them irrespective of which side brought them up and be able to vote on them only once. 
   How much time do I have, Mr. President?

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think the distinguished majority leader is saying it is not a positive development. Of course it is. We have cut back very substantially on the number of amendments. On this side, we cut out two-thirds of our amendments. We have worked very closely. I have not had a single Senator on the Democratic side who failed to agree to a time agreement every time the distinguished majority managing Senator wanted it. They have agreed, in fact, to each and every single one. In fact, we have had Senators who brought up amendments who took less time to debate the amendments than some of the rollcalls have taken while we have waited to see who had to leave.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator could respond on that, he said there are 100 Senators, and they don't all have to put them in. 
   In 1994 we had the crime bill. It was on the floor for 12 days--over 3 weeks. There were 99 amendments. Maybe there was one Senator who did not have one. I mention that only because of what the Senator from Mississippi said. But there were 99 amendments, a great bulk of them coming from the other side. And in no way did the then Democrat majority seek to cut them down. It took 12 days--over 3 weeks. The predecessor to this is S. 10. The Judiciary Committee, under the distinguished leadership of the Senator from Utah, met in the summertime for over 6 weeks to work on 55 amendments.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wonder how this works. Does this mean if we have other amendments on either side that come up, just because somebody is not there to respond to it, does that mean this will now become the procedure to be followed? We will let the proponent speak, and then on Monday the opponents speak? 
   I ask that because we have to do something to move this on. It is frustrating to the Senator from Vermont, who has canceled all other plans today to be here into the evening, if necessary, to move forward on this bill, in keeping with what the majority leader said he wants done, if he suddenly finds he will be picking and choosing whether anybody can bring up an amendment 
   or not. 
   If Senators are serious about the amendments, they can come here and offer them. It is more of a question to the distinguished Senator from Utah: Is this going to be the practice, if another Senator brings up an amendment and there is not somebody on the other side, will that Senator bring it up and speak about it, and the other Senator comes back and responds on Monday?

Mr. President, 2 minutes ago the distinguished Senator from Utah had made the suggestion, another unanimous consent request, that Senators bring up things even if Senators were not available on the other side of an issue to speak, and that that Senator be given equal time on Monday or sometime prior to the vote. I might ask the Chair, is there such a unanimous consent pending? Am I perhaps stating it too broadly?

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. I note the Senator from New Jersey is within his rights to make such a request. The Senator from Utah is within his rights to object to it. 
   Mr. President, I note the distinguished majority leader was on the floor earlier, urging we move forward on this legislation, that we try to get as much done as possible today and Monday, a position both the distinguished Senator from Utah and I joined. I suspect the two of us have probably worked more hours than anybody else in this body to bring that about. But there are not an awful lot of Senators around here waiting to be heard. I urge the majority, they may well allow Senators like Senator LAUTENBERG or others who have amendments to bring them up, discuss them, have some debate on them, and then if there are those who wish to oppose those amendments, they would of course have an equal amount of time on Monday to do that. Otherwise, of course, the Senator from New Jersey can bring it up Monday. 
   But you cannot keep holding it off with the idea that maybe it will only come up at the time of the vote on Tuesday, because that would be, in effect, a debate cloture on the part of the Republican side that would say even if it was a serious matter they would only get 2.5 minutes of debate. 
   I know the distinguished senior Senator from Utah is a fair person. I think he would perhaps agree that 2.5 minutes debate is not quite enough on major amendments. I hope they will find in their heart to allow the distinguished senior Senator from New Jersey to bring up his amendment. Clearly, he is going to be allowed to bring it up sometime prior to the vote on it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. I just note two things. First is that even though the last amendment brought up by the Republican side is vehemently opposed by a Member on this side who could not be present, we made no objection to that, knowing he would have time to debate later on. Mr. President, we did this to try to comply with the request of the majority leader and the distinguished Senator from Utah, who said they wanted to move forward with this. We did it in good faith. Frankly, for one of the very few times in my 25 years in the Senate, I find my faith shaken because it is very obvious nobody intended to go forward; they just wanted to go right back to Y2K and block anything else. 
   If their side wants to bring up something even if our side is not here to debate it, that is fine. If our side wants something similar, that is not fine. It is like the Democratic amendments being voted down over here so a day or so later they can be brought up as Republican amendments and voted up over there. And in between we hear complaints about this is taking too long. 
   I will repeat what I have said before: Every single Democrat wants a juvenile justice bill with everything from the prevention of crime to education to helping our juveniles. I question whether the same thing can be said for the other side of the aisle. 
   The Senator from New Jersey had the floor. I yield back to him.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Hatch-Leahy amendment is a good one. I hope everybody will support it. I have talked for years about empowering users of the Internet to control and limit access to material they did not want to see and that could be found on line. This could be any type of material. Parents may not want their children buying things. There may be obscene material. It could be types of sites parents are against. 
   We also know there is a lot of amazing and wonderful material on the Internet. While I oppose efforts in Congress to regulate content of the Internet, I do want to make sure children can be protected, that parents have the ability to do that, and this gives them a chance to do it. 
   I have always believed the power to control what people see belongs to the  users and the parents, not the Government. The amendment the chairman and I offer requires large on-line service providers to offer their subscribers filtering software and systems to stop objectionable materials from reaching their computer screens. I am supportive of voluntary industry efforts to come together and provide Internet users with one-click-away information resources on how to protect children when they go on line. Senator CAMPBELL and I joined Vice President Gore at the White House last week to hear about this one-click-away amendment. Our amendment helps promote the use of filtering technologies. It is better than Government censorship. It is a fall-back provision, if the companies do not do it themselves.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, many of us served here with Jim Sasser, the very distinguished former chairman of the Budget Committee, now our Ambassador to China at a very difficult time. 
   We have seen the photographs of Ambassador Sasser under siege in the Chinese Embassy. I faxed him a note the other day, saying how proud I was, and I mentioned the comments of many Senators saying how proud they were, of his grace under fire and the fact that he would not leave the American Embassy that is under siege. When there were Embassy staff there, in the true and best tradition of the State Department and the Senate and the Marine Corps and everything else, he said he would stay until it was safe. So I faxed him this note. 
   This morning I got back this note from him, and I will read it for my colleagues. It is handwritten. It says:  
   Dear Pat: My sincere thanks for your wonderful note. Please tell all my former colleagues that Mary and I are well and safe. Things have stabilized after a turbulent few days. Last night I got a good night's sleep in a real bed. All the best, Jim.

   Mr. President, as I told the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, I will have to oppose the amendment because of an agreement I made with a number of the industry groups a couple of years ago. I believe that agreement is still appropriate today. It is an agreement that brought about a compromise between Senators and industry to try to work them out, as we have with a number of other things, in a cooperative way, whether it is with legislation or legislative fiat. It 
   involved a V-chip. I wanted to give the V-chip a fair chance to work in the marketplace, because I felt that technology was rapidly changing, and working in the marketplace might be a lot better than legislation that almost fixes technology where it is. I am enough of the old school that having made a commitment I am not going to go back on it. 
   The American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National PTA, the National Education Association, the Center for Media Education, the American Psychological Association, the National Association of Elementary School Principals, the Children's Defense Fund, and others agreed in writing on July 10, 1997, to allow the V-chip system to proceed unimpeded by new legislation so that we could see how it works. 
   Just last week, the Kaiser Family Foundation released a poll showing that 77 percent of parents said that if they had a V-chip in their home they would use the technology. With the rating system and the V-chip, each family can create their own individualized family viewing system. 
   I think that would work a lot better in protecting children than the amendment we are considering.

   Mr. LEAHY. I will be glad to put it in the RECORD. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD the letter of July 8, 1997, signed by Senators, MCCAIN, BURNS, LEAHY, Moseley-Braun, DASCHLE, Coats, HATCH, BOXER, LOTT, as well as the numerous names I mentioned, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Association of Elementary and School Principals, and others who signed. I will give copies to the distinguished Senator from North Dakota.

   Mr. LEAHY. Obviously, our signing such a letter does not bind the distinguished Senator from North Dakota nor the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, as he and I have discussed. I do feel having stated my commitment binds me. As the Senator from North Dakota knows, I have a reputation of once having given a commitment I never go back on it. I do not suggest that he or anybody else is bound by the agreement that we worked out to give the V-chip a chance. I am suggesting that I assume the Senators who did sign on to that would feel that way. 
   What we want to do is what I still want to do. I commend the Senators who worked on developing the V-chip, to allow families to create their own individualized family viewing system. I did this when my children were young by reading reviews and determining what they should or should not watch or read. 
   Now 50 percent of the new TVs will have the V-chip by July 1 of this year; 100 percent of the new TVs will have the V-chip by January of next year. That is why Senators HATCH, LOTT, DASCHLE, MCCAIN, and others signed this letter, so we can ensure that the industry has guidelines and ratings and TV manufacturers will install V-chips. By doing that we move the ball forward very quickly. The TV manufacturers, as they promised us, are getting the job done. 
   I want to live up to my signed commitment with the other Senators. I want to live up to the expectations of the AMA, the National PTA, the Children's Defense Fund, and the other groups I mentioned. TV parental guidelines and the V-chip give parents the tools to determine the programming children may watch. 
   In addition, Charles Ergen, the CEO of EchoStar, said this could have serious unintended impacts. Echo-Star gives parents who subscribe to satellite service a powerful tool. His V-chip not only allows parents to block out R-rated shows, but they can block out shows based on specific concerns about language, drug use, violence, graphic violence, sexuality, or other considerations they might have. 
   Under this amendment, even though they have done all that to cooperate with us, Echo-Star would be punished because they use national feeds and they transmit signals across time zones. They transmit not only into Kentucky or Vermont but in California, Oregon, Ohio, and everywhere in between. They go across the three time zones of this country. They provide the programming for multiple time zones at once on a national basis. I assume they probably do it in the time zones of Alaska and Hawaii, which goes even beyond the three in the Continental United States. 
   Under the longstanding law, satellite carriers cannot alter the signals they are given which are authorized under a compulsory license. Depending on how long the family time period is, it may be impossible for satellite carriers to comply because they are required to use a national feed from distant stations. For example, on the west coast, the time is earlier than the east coast, where a lot of the programming originates. With the uplink of station WOR in New York or WGN in Chicago, an hour later, they are going to be in noncompliance with this amendment on the west coast. 
   One option for them would be for satellite TV carriers to black out programming on the west coast or simply take the programming in the east coast and shift it to very late hours, extremely late hours for east coast viewers, which is the 
   allowed hour for west coast viewers. 
   Frankly, I think use of the V-chip allows parents to block out what they want and will work much better than blocking out entire time zones in the United States. 
   I want to also note that two-thirds of American households have no children under the age of 18. If this amendment were enacted, American television viewers of all ages would lose control over the programming available to them. I repeat, two-thirds of American households have no children under the age of 18. 
   There are, I believe, serious constitutional problems with this amendment. I get very concerned about the Federal Government or any Federal Government agency policing the content of TV programming. 
   For example, there would be a $25,000 fine for each day there is violent video programming. Is one gunshot in a show considered violent programming? What about two? What if it is a history show that shows the assassination of a President or a world leader? Is that violence? 
   I am reminded of the old joke of religious leaders of different faiths getting together and they wanted to start the meeting with a prayer, but they couldn't agree on a prayer so they had to cancel the conference. 
   I worry once again that we denigrate the role of parents, especially the amendment which considers parents almost irrelevant to the development of children. I have been blessed to be married for 37 years this year, and I have three wonderful children. My wife and I took a very serious interest in what movies they saw, what TV programs they watched, what books they read. We tried to guide them the right way. I like the idea that both my wife and I were making those decisions and not somebody else. Someone else might have different moral values, might have a different sense of what was appropriate and what is not appropriate. I really didn't want to turn it over to  the hands of a government agency--local, State, or Federal. I felt that was my responsibility, a responsibility that I considered one of the most important roles I had as a parent. 
   I also think if we let the government do it, let the government take over the parenting, then if something goes wrong, we blame them. It is harder to deal with issues such as bad parenting and lack of parental supervision if we can only blame ourselves, but that should be our responsibility as parents, first and foremost. It was the responsibility of my parents when I grew up in Vermont and the responsibility of my wife and I as our children grew up. 
   I don't know how the government steps into the shoes of parents by involving our government in the day-to-day regulation of the contents of television shows, movies, or other forms of speech. I recently visited a country which is one of the last of the countries with such restrictions. I prefer we make those choices. Parents should be able to use the V-chips offered by satellite TV providers and by TV manufacturers to block out programming they consider offensive for their children. 
   Anything any parents want to block out for their child, I don't care what it is--it could be C-SPAN, with me speaking now; if they can even get the children to watch it, they may want to block that out--that is fine; parents should have that right. 
   I want to remind everyone that the Supreme Court has noted:  
   Laws regulating speech for the protection of children have no limiting principle, and a well-intentioned law restricting protected speech on the basis of content is, nevertheless, state-sponsored censorship.  
   So, while I do not support this amendment, I do not want my comments to be interpreted as backing off at all in my pride in the work of Senator HOLLINGS and Senator DORGAN on these issues. They are concerned, and rightly so, about the content of some of the things we see. There are some things, even if they are shown late at night, I would not watch and I am 59 years old. I was a prosecutor for 9 years. I went to murder scenes. I saw some of the most violent conduct ever. I still have nightmares remembering some of those scenes. I do not want to see them replayed. 
   There are some, because of their offensive nature, I am not interested in. I do not want to see them, but I will make that decision. But for parents, for their help, we would not have the V-chip without the work of the Senator from South Carolina, the work he and his colleagues have done. It is not only work, it is agitation, I might say. I can almost repeat some of the speeches the Senator gave to push them that far forward. He gives new meaning to the term ``stentorian tones.'' They are stentorian tones in a clarion call, rarely heard anymore in these halls. 
   I consider myself privileged, over the years, not only to have had the Senator from South Carolina as a close personal friend--both he and his wife are very close personal friends of my wife and myself--he has been a mentor to me. So I commend him for what he has done. 
   I mention all this because he is not a newcomer to the debate. He has been a parent of this debate. I do not want anybody to lose sight that we all are in this together in this regard. If we have young children--mine are now grown, but I assume it would be the same attitude as towards grandchildren--there are things on television, just as there are in the movies, that we do not want our children to see. Most of us do not want to see them ourselves, but we certainly do not want the children to see them. I think the system we have set up is one that is working. I would love to see something done in a cooperative way. 
   It is moving rapidly forward. If that could be done without the hand of Government on it, it would make the Senator from Vermont far more comfortable. If they are unable to move forward, if they do not utilize the breathing spell they were given, that is one thing. But they seem to be moving forward during that breathing spell, and I would like to see that work without a heavy hand. 
   I yield the floor.

   A qualified civil liability action that is pending on the date of enactment of this subsection shall be dismissed immediately by the court.

   What concerns me, I tell my friend from Idaho, is that what this is saying, in this court-stripping part, this says my State of Vermont is being told, even if they have a case, a qualified civil liability action pending, it will be dismissed by this. We do not even know whether there are such cases pending around the country, but we are telling the 50 States of this country and their legislatures: If you have a case pending, tough, the Senate has just decided it for you. 
   I am wondering, for example, whether this is covering current city lawsuits that are based, in part, on gun show sales. Some cities have brought some lawsuits based on gun show sales. Are we throwing their suits out?

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let's go back and forth from each side, as the Senator from Utah suggested, without locking down the time. One of the reasons why we have a concern, I say to my friend from Utah, is that yesterday we were trying to rush some of these votes forward. I raised the problem with the distinguished Senator from Idaho. I said: I thought there was a whole part of the bill missing. Basically, my argument was dismissed. 
   Let's go on with the vote. 
   This afternoon, they say: Oh, by the way, this part you said was missing, yes, it was. Now we have added it back in. 
   I did not raise it nonchalantly. I thought it was serious. So I think that we ought to at least, if we have just gotten a hot piece of legislation still warm from the Xerox machine, get a chance to see it. It would be a lot easier to take a few minutes longer and make sure it is done correctly and we know what we are voting on than we go through as we did yesterday when the concerns that Senator SCHUMER and I raised were sort of dismissed, and now we find, yes, we were right, and we are back into the thing. 
   Let's make sure everybody understands where we are going. 
   I say to the Senator from Utah, maybe during the votes at 5 o'clock he and I might meet with interested parties to see if we can work times out.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will take this side's time. 
   I have listened to the debate and read the amendment. It is deja vu. It is very similar to the Leahy law enforcement amendment that the Republican majority voted down yesterday. The Leahy amendment, which was the Democratic consensus position on gun control, included the enhanced parental penalties for the transfer of handguns, assault weapons, and high-capacity ammunition clips to juveniles and the ban on the juvenile possession of handguns, assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition clips. This amendment has a couple of changes. It increases the exceptions for such transfers. 
   But if imitation is the highest form of flattery, then I guess I should be flattered where all the Democrats signed onto the one 
   amendment that was voted down by the Republicans yesterday. Of course, I am going to support this amendment, because it is so similar to the form of what we had yesterday. 
   I just wish it had adopted a couple of other consensus positions. I wish it included our gun ban for life for dangerous juvenile offenders. For the life of me, I cannot understand why the other side opposes my proposal, the Democrat proposal, that if you have a juvenile who is convicted of assault with a deadly weapon, is convicted of murder, or attempted murder, why that person should not be banned for life from owning a gun. 
   I wish it had the money that we put into mine that was dedicated just to Federal prosecution of the firearms violations. I wish it had the resources for firearm tracing that we put under the youth crime interdiction initiative. But perhaps when they look at the rest of my amendment that will be in the next Republican package. I hope it is. 
   To the extent that this primarily includes a number of the things that I had in my amendment yesterday, of course, I will be consistent enough to vote for it again this time. 
   Ralph Waldo Emerson once said: ``A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.'' There are no hobgoblins on the other side. They don't mind being inconsistent in voting for it today when they voted for it yesterday.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let's be realistic. 
   First, I yield to nobody in this body in my support of good strict law enforcement. I would like to see this bill wrapped up and voted up or voted down. There are different suggestions I made to the distinguished Senator from Utah that might do that. But what I would suggest is that we be serious on this. Unfortunately, on something that should be a nonpartisan issue--juvenile crime--there are some things that have delayed us unnecessarily. 
   Wednesday, Senate Republicans voted against a Democratic package, and then today voted for the exact same thing when it was introduced on the other side. 
   For example, the Leahy amendment, which proposed stiffer penalties for the transfers to or possession of handguns and assault weapons, or high-capacity ammunition clips to juveniles, was voted down by the Republicans yesterday, and voted up by the Republicans today. 
   Moreover, the Leahy amendment also proposed the ban of juvenile possession of handguns, assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition clips, which was again voted down by the Republicans yesterday, and voted up by the Republicans today.

The $50 million for more vigorous enforcement of gun laws, ``juvenile Brady,'' the lifetime ban on gun ownership by dangerous juvenile offenders, the youth crime gun initiative on gun tracing, increased number of cities eligible for grants under the YCG-II.

   I think, frankly, one way out of this--I just suggest it and I have suggested it to others--is that we debate the Craig-Hatch amendment, and the amendment of the distinguished Senator from New York, Mr. SCHUMER is going to have--we debate those as the Members want, set that vote for an early hour tomorrow morning, and when that debate is finished, let the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Vermont stay here and try to get through as many amendments either on the Republican or on the Democratic side that can be handled by voice vote, even if we have to stay here all night long to do that, so we then have a very clear shot of finishing. 
   It is one suggestion.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, as the leader knows, this is a resolution which I and others had suggested earlier this evening. The leaders know that the Senator from Utah and I have talked probably a dozen times every hour on this, trying to get it through. I have worked with the leadership staff and the whip on this side, our leader, and others, as Senator HATCH has with those on the Republican side, trying to get these numbers down. I tell my friend from Mississippi that we have knocked down the numbers considerably. The Senator from Utah and I will be here this evening to try to get it down more. It is a difficult bill. The last crime bill took 11 days. We have a number of things on which we are unified, and we have some things that are going to require votes because they do divide us. 
   But with good faith it can be done and should be done. 
   I support the unanimous consent request.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in many ways I feel that if the distinguished  Senator from Utah and I were unconstrained by Senators on either side, we could write a bill that would be very helpful. But I hope we do not get carried away with partisan rhetoric here. 
   The fact of the matter is that there have been a number of issues the Democratic side of the aisle has brought up that have been voted down by the Republican side--not unanimously, I might say; in fact, I can think of a couple where the distinguished Presiding Officer voted differently than the majority of his party--and then those parts were then put into a Republican bill. That is fine. I am not interested who takes credit; I am interested in stopping juvenile crime. 
   In fairness, let's point out, when we talk about what the administration might or might not have done, in the past 6 years, the rate of violent crime has come down at a faster and greater level than at any time in my lifetime. I am 59 years old. That means through Republican and Democratic administrations, the rate of violent crime has come down faster than ever before in the 6 years of this administration. The rate of juvenile crime has done the same. We have stopped thousands and thousands of gun sales to those with felony records. Let's stop saying who has done it or who has not done it. Let's do what is best for our children. We are parents. We are grandparents.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Amendment No. 329 more than any other we have seen so far cobbles together a number of proposals that have been around for a long time. Let me start with the NIH study, the $2 million study required by the amendment. 
   I am concerned that this amendment singles out only a few potential influences on teen behavior. A better approach, in my view, would be to study all factors--the role of parents and schools, the existence of counseling and guidance efforts, the alienation of young from their peers, and media influences, among other things. 
   The President has called on the Surgeon General to conduct just that type of review. Perhaps we should include the NIH and other experts in the Surgeon General study which is now underway. 
   In our rush to respond to very real tragedies, we should take care to study all the factors, and to seek solutions that won't trample the First Amendment. To artificially limit the NIH study to only media influences may not be proper scientific design. The role of parents must be considered. Bad parenting can have devastating effects on the behavior of children. Just ask the child in an alcoholic family, or in a family where there is spouse abuse, or worse. 
   I am also concerned about the two sets of antitrust exemptions being proposed in this amendment. 
   I have spent a good deal of effort over the past several years working to eliminate unjustified antitrust exemptions from the law. The baseball antitrust amendment comes to mind as one that the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and I worked on together for years until we finally succeeded last year. 
   Do we have the views of the Department of Justice Antitrust Division on either of these proposed antitrust exemptions? 
   Last time I examined this issue was when the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust clarified that it would not violate the antitrust laws of television stations to agree on guidelines and viewer advisories to reduce the negative impact of violence on television. That was 1994. It was not illegal now. So, I do not understand the need for antitrust exemptions. 
   My fear is that any such exemption might be abused and used to immunize anti-competitive conduct to the detriment of consumers viewers and other companies in and around the entertainment industries. 
   I note that one of the exemptions tries at least to protect against legalizing group boycotts. Whether that language succeeds, I cannot tell as I read it here on the floor. But I do know that the language applies to only one of the two exemptions and does not reach all anticompetitive conduct. 
   Does that create the implication that boycotts are an acceptable way to ``enforce'' rules or act anti-competitively? The language mandates enforcement but does not say how. 
   Senators BROWNBACK and HATCH had initially provided me with two very different amendments, and I assumed that the fight would have been over which amendment would win over the other--since they are inconsistent. 
   It never occurred to me that they would simply slap them together into one inconsistent mass which will be impossible to interpret. 
   The combined amendment that passed yesterday has major flaws. It defines the Internet in a way that could have major unintended effects on other laws. 
   It hugely denigrates the role of parents--essentially the amendment considers parents almost irrelevant to the development of children into young adults. It blames most of the social problems of children on television, movies and music--an easy target even in the face of falling national crime statistics. 
   Television programming and movie content is a tempting subject for demagoguery. It is much harder to deal with issues such as bad parenting and lack of parental supervision because then we can only blame ourselves. 
   Contrary to the findings in the amendment, there is no substitute for parental involvement in the raising of our children. 
   I am also very nervous about involving government in the day-to-day regulation of the content of television shows or movies and other forms of speech. I do not see how the government can step into the shoes of parents. 
   The Supreme Court has noted that ``laws regulating speech for the protection of children have no limiting principle, and a well-intentioned law restricting protected speech on the basis of content is, nevertheless, state-sponsored censorship.'' 
   Movies such as ``Saving Private Ryan'' or ``Schindler's List'' are violent. I admit it. But I do not think that such films should be discouraged because of any government enforced content standards. 
   If this amendment were voluntary we, of course, would not need to pass it since the entertainment industry leaders can already work together to develop guidelines, standards, ratings and label warnings. That is why I worked out a deal, and signed a dear colleague letter, with Senators HATCH, LOTT, DASCHLE, MCCAIN and others in July of 1997. 
   We agreed, based on clear guidance from the Justice Department, that entertainment industry leaders could meet to work out these guidelines and standards and that there would be no antitrust concerns. 
   Antitrust laws permit meeting to work out voluntary guidelines. 
   This slapped-together amendment goes way beyond that understanding. 
   Letters dated January 25, 1994, January 7, 1994, and November 29, 1993, from the Justice Department make it clear that industry leaders can work together to establish guidelines regarding violence in programming and movies. 
   One bedrock principle of our democratic government and one of the basic protections of freedoms to enjoy as Americans is the First Amendment's guarantee that the government will keep itself out of the regulation of speech. 
   When the Constitution says that ``Congress shall make no law *.*.* abridging the freedom of speech,'' I believe it means what it says. That provision ought to be respected until it is repealed which I hope never, never, happens. 
   For years there have been crusades against the content of books and movies but government enforcement is not the answer--where do you draw the line? 
   This goes back to the old joke about a conference of ministers of different faiths getting together and trying to start the meetings. They could never agree on the opening prayer so that had to cancel the conference. 
   I know that some have fond memories of the days of content regulation when only separate beds could be shown on shows like Dick Van Dyke. One of the findings fondly looks back at these standards stating from page 6 of the amendment that ``The portrayal of implied sexual acts must be essential to the plot and presented in a responsible and tasteful manner.'' What is ``essential to the plot'' and who decides that question? What is ``tasteful'' and should the government decide that? 
   National crime statistics show crime has declined in recent years. I know that Mayor Giuliani keeps talking about that reduction in crime. What does this drop in crime statistics mean in terms of this amendment? 
   Section 505 of the amendment allows for the ``enforcement'' of guidelines ``designed to ensure compliance'' with ratings and labeling systems. When you use words such as ``enforcement'' and ``designed to ensure compliance'' that does not sound voluntary to me. I hope that we take more time in conference to read this amendment and consider the possible problems posed by its language. 
   I know some want to permit government enforcement of vague standards on the content of TV shows and movies. No one will know what is allowed and what isn't allowed. That is chilling, it violates the Constitution, and it relegates the role of parents to mere observers.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my friend from Utah attacked the motion picture  theater industry yesterday for not enforcing their voluntary rating system. Though no system, voluntary or mandatory, can every be perfect, the fact is that the exhibition industry is doing an increasingly better job enforcing those movie ratings. 
   The National Association of Theater Owners, the industry trade association, and its members have made ratings enforcement a top priority. The association has developed a videotape training series on the ratings and their enforcement for theater managers and employees. 
   It has distributed hundreds of thousands of brochures through theaters to the public which explains the rating system. 
   It has published weekly bulletins to its members and newspapers on new ratings. 
   It has published educational articles for its members, and it has held industry-wide meetings twice a year in which code enforcement is emphasized. 
   Recently, the Motion Picture Association and the National Association of Theater Owners began developing slide presentations for display during intermissions about the ratings. 
   The motion picture theater industry may be the only industry in the country which voluntarily turns down millions of dollars in ticket sales to enforce a voluntary rating system. We should all encourage the industry to do more. But in our rush to judgement, let us remember to consider the facts.

   I think what was most amazing about her was not just her great talent, her ability to write, her extraordinary breadth of knowledge and interest, but to watch her, especially in the last few months, when ravaged by disease, she continued that same interest. She continued her work. 
   When you spoke with her or saw her, she never spoke about her own illness; she spoke of her interest in others. I have never once during her long illness heard her complain about her illness, but rather she would talk of others.

   Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, this amendment is intended to address the problem of youth violence with tough law enforcement initiatives at the Federal level, with assistance to State and local law enforcement, proven prevention programs for juvenile delinquency, and measures to keep guns out of the hands of children. 
   Many of the proposals in this amendment were part of a bill I introduced, along with Senator DASCHLE and other Democratic Members, last year in the Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of 1998. That was S. 2484. We have introduced it this year as S. 9. 
   These are carefully crafted proposals. They were not done as knee-jerk responses to the school shootings, or even the most bloody murders in Littleton. We talked with prosecutors and police officers and teachers and everybody else in putting these proposals together. The series of proposals in the amendment have been ready since last year, but this is our first opportunity to present them to the Senate for discussion and a vote. While these proposals predated the events at Columbine High School, it escapes nobody's notice that the events at the high school give them added urgency. 
   This amendment is part of the Democratic multipronged agenda for action that embraces tough and more aggressive law enforcement initiatives, plus those initiatives in our other amendments to help teachers, counselors, parents, and children with afterschool  programs, with effective and proven school safety strategies and, of course, treatment programs for high-risk youth. It faces the reality that we live in a different world, not like when I was going to school, or when most of us in this Chamber went to school. It is a complex world and you do not attack the problems of it on just one front; you have to attack them on many. 
   We Democrats look forward to the Senate debating and taking action on proposals that can be enacted now and working over the long haul on additional structural remedies. No matter what legislation we pass this week, we also need long-term solutions to school violence. These solutions include getting smaller classrooms; smaller schools--not these schools that are cities in and of themselves where students don't even know each other and the teachers don't know them--helping parents spend more time supervising their children, realizing that is the bond that is often broken in today's society; and working constructively with the movie, television, and video game industries to adopt rating systems that parents can understand and use. 
   This law enforcement amendment is substantial and comprehensive. It has five separate parts. I will highlight a few of the important proposals in this amendment. It addresses some of the same subject matter areas as S. 254. I will highlight some of the differences in our approaches. 
   In the area of federalization, my amendment also proposes reforms in the Federal juvenile justice system. We do so without Federalizing run-of-the-mill juvenile offenses and 
   ignoring the traditional prerogative of the States to handle the bulk of juvenile crime. Too often when we have talked about crime on the Senate floor in recent years, we basically have told the States, the State legislatures, State law enforcement, and State prosecutors, that they are irrelevant, that we will run everything out of Washington, and the Federal Government knows better. I don't believe that. 
   My proposal for reforming the Federal juvenile justice system heeds the advice of Chief Justice Rehnquist and the Federal judiciary and reflects the proper respect for our Federal system. 
   Let me explain. My amendment retains the provision in current law which establishes a clear presumption that the States should handle most juvenile offenders. S. 254 repeals that provision. 
   Furthermore, current law directs that most juveniles ``shall'' not be proceeded against in Federal court, unless the Attorney General certifies certain things--in most cases, that the State does not or refuses to exercise jurisdiction over the juvenile. Judges may review that certification to see whether the threshold for exercise of Federal jurisdiction has been met. S. 254 changes that. 
   As I mentioned in my statement yesterday, the bill before us gives conflicting signals. S. 254 contains one welcome change over S. 10 from the last Congress by requiring the Attorney General or the U.S. attorney, depending on the charge, to ``exercise a presumption in favor of referral'' of juvenile cases to the appropriate State or tribal authorities, where there is ``concurrent jurisdiction.'' But, in contrast to the law today, that certification is not reviewable by any court. My amendment would continue to permit such court review in most cases but not cases involving serious violence or drug offenses. 
   Because of the repeal of the important State presumption provision and the lack of review of the Federal prosecutor's decision to proceed against a juvenile federally, many rightly fear that the State prerogative to handle juvenile offenders will be undermined by this bill. My amendment would not do that. Basically, what I am saying is that we are not going to stand in the U.S. Senate and tell the 50 State legislatures that they are irrelevant and tell the prosecutors of the 50 States that they are irrelevant because 100 U.S. Senators know better and we can do it better from Washington. 
   Ironically enough, some of the same people who will vote for something that would take it away from the States and turn it over to Washington are the same ones who go back to their States and give great speeches about: We know better here in our State, and we don't need Washington to tell us what to do. And then they come up here time after time and vote to federalize cases that are being handled by the State courts and make irrelevant the State legislatures, State prosecutors, and State law enforcement. Sooner or later, some of those speeches are going to catch up with us and haunt us. 
   Our law enforcement officials should be proud of the decline of the violent crime rate and murder rate we have experienced since 1993, because it is largely due to their efforts and innovative programs like the COPS Program and community policing. There is nothing like seeing a police officer on the corner to make a criminal move on. We want that decline to continue, particularly in schools. Certainly, it 
   does not take a criminologist to know that if you have the presence of the police, crime will go elsewhere, or not occur at all. 
   The strong bipartisan report for this proposal was demonstrated yesterday on passage of the amendment by Senator GREGG, which was cosponsored by Senator BOXER and myself. That amendment set up a new grant program with eligibility requirements to put cops in schools. The proposal in my amendment would expand the COPS Program and waive the matching non-Federal fund requirement to put more police in and around our schools. 
   My approach builds on a program with a proven track record. It is not a hypothetical. The States are familiar with it. We, at the State level, know how it works. This amendment extends grants to local law enforcement for other programs, such as rural drug enforcement and Byrne grant funding. 
   My amendment also provides, in section 124, funding for the juvenile State court prosecutors. Yesterday, the Senate passed the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment which authorizes $50 million per year for prosecutors. As I pointed out yesterday, this amendment does not authorize any additional money for judges, public defenders, counselors, or correctional officers. By leaving them out, you could end up exacerbating the backlog in the juvenile justice system rather than helping it, because it requires all those parts within the juvenile justice system to make it work. 
   In contrast to Hatch-Biden-Sessions, my amendment authorizes funding for ``increased resources to State juvenile court systems, juvenile prosecutors, juvenile public defenders, and other juvenile court system personnel.'' I hope that will be something my distinguished friend from Utah, the exemplary chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, might support. 
   We need to do more to protect our children from drugs. My drug amendment would increase certain penalties for drug sales to children or near schools or for using children in the illegal drug trade. 
   As terrible as it sounds, Mr. President, we see this--where children are being used in the drug trade and where they abuse children as runners for distributors. It is one of the cruelest, most cynical things that can be done. 
   We also establish juvenile drug courts that are modeled on the successful drug court programs for adults, because it gives special attention to supervision and treatment of offenders, and how to get them clean. 
   It doesn't do any good to simply prosecute a drug offender if they are going to come back out and be just as addicted. We should try to get them off their dependence on drugs. 
   Let's talk about guns. Everybody tiptoes around this Chamber when it comes to the question of guns. On the one hand, you have people who feel there should be no guns at all, who couldn't even conceive of handling a gun, to those who feel that everybody should walk around with their own arsenal. The reality is somewhere in between. 
   Growing up in Vermont in a rural State, I grew up with guns. I have owned guns from the time I was a youngster. I went through the usual gun safety courses, became a champion marksman in college, and, in fact, competed in schools all over the country, and still shoot competitive target shooting. 
   I also taught my two sons and my daughter how to use and enjoy guns safely. We have very strict rules, and still have very strict rules at our home in Vermont in using guns, or in target practice--a lot stricter rules than most gun clubs would have.  
   But having said all of that, every gun owner, or not, is sickened by the school shootings and the tragic murders of the young children and dedicated teachers. 
   We recognize we have to take steps to protect our children from gun violence--steps that might go beyond just one parent to their child. Nothing can substitute for parental involvement and supervision. 
   Let me emphasis that. Most of us know as parents that nothing substitutes for parental involvement and supervision. But we also know we can take constructive steps to keep guns out of the hands of children when they are not under that kind of parental involvement and supervision. 
   The statement of administration position on S. 254 points out that this bill does not include any provisions on guns, and that this should be part of the broad-based, comprehensive approach to juvenile crime. 
   This amendment contains a number of proposals to protect children from guns. 
   I ask Senators: Are you willing to stand up and vote for or against these proposals? 
   Let me tell you what you are going be voting on, that every Senator is going to determine whether they want to vote for it or against. 
   We ban the transfer to and possession by juveniles of assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition clips. 
   Are you for or against that? 
   We increase criminal penalties for transfers of handguns, assault weapons, and high-capacity ammunition clips to 
   juveniles. 
   Senators are going to have to ask themselves when they vote on this: Are we for or against that provision? 
   We ban gun sales to persons who have violent crime records, even if those crimes were committed as juveniles. 
   Senators, are we for or against this provision? 
   We increase penalties for certain gun offenses involving minors. 
   Senators, are you for or against this provision? 
   We provide grants for the children's gun safety programs and for juvenile gun and youth violence courts with dissemination of model programs via Internet web sites. 
   Senators, are you for or against this provision? 
   We expand youth crime gun interdiction efforts in up to 250 cities by the year 2003. 
   Senators, are you for or against this provision? 
   We grant priority for tracing of guns used in youth crime, with increased Federal resources dedicated to the enforcement of firearm laws. 
   Senators, are you for or against this provision? 
   We have heard that this administration is not enforcing our gun laws. Let's stop the political mudslinging and ignoring of important facts and realize that as Americans we are in this together. The murder rate for juveniles rose sharply in the late 1980s and the early 1990s due to a rise in gun violence. Since then, with some strong programs by this administration, the murder rate is on the decline. In fact, juvenile murder and non-negligent manslaughter arrests declined almost 40 percent between 1993 and 1997. 
   According to the Justice Department, Federal enforcement has focused on serious firearm offenders. These prosecutions are up 30 percent from 1992--up 30 percent. Federal and State law enforcement are working together more and more resulting in a 25-percent increase in combined annual firearm prosecutions since 1992--a 25-percent increase. The violent crime rate has come down. The murder rate has come down. The prosecution of gun offenses has gone up. 
   Those are indisputable facts. But having said that, we should strive to improve enforcement of our gun laws. That is why my law enforcement amendment provides $100 million for the next 2 years dedicated to Federal firearm prosecutions. 
   It also establishes grant programs to replicate successful juvenile crime and truancy prevention programs, such as the program in Boston where they had a terrible, terrible slew of juvenile murders. They started this program and the murders stopped. We can replicate that in other cities. 
   As an aside, I strongly urge that those who prosecute cases involving weapons--be it at the Federal level or the State level--do what I did as a prosecutor. When I had a case involving a weapon of any sort--a gun, a knife, in a couple of instances a baseball bat--I sought, under our State law, a law that is similar to almost every State, an additional penalty for the use of a weapon. It can be anything that was used as a weapon in the commission of a crime. The word got around pretty quickly that if you used any kind of a weapon in a crime, assault, or burglary, or anything else, you were going to pay some additional penalty and you served additional time. 
   Finally, we commit resources and attention in this amendment to preventing juvenile crime with grant programs to youth organizations for supervised youth activities and 
   afterschool programs. 
   The amendment would authorize spending $2 billion over the next 2 years on juvenile crime prevention and intervention. 
   Mr. President, everybody in law enforcement will tell you the same thing. The easiest crime to handle is the crime that never happened. And our crime prevention programs are modeled after what the police and others have told us work the best to prevent crimes. 
   I do not know and have never worked with a police officer who hasn't told me to help them prevent the crime from happening in the first place--juvenile crime especially. There are proven ways that work. 
   We are talking about spending billions and billions and billions of dollars more on the Kosovo crisis, along with the billions and billions and billions of dollars we spend in bombing Belgrade and elsewhere. Why don't we take a small part of that and invest it on our children, the safety of our children in a nation of a quarter of a billion people? Why not spend some money to protect our children within our own borders? 
   Similarly to S. 254, my amendment would reauthorize the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. But in contrast to S. 254, my amendment preserves intact four core protections for youth in detention, but it also grants flexibility for rural areas. 
   We can come to the floor of the Senate and vote for feel-good proposals. We can pass resolutions condemning crime and violence--as though any Senator within this debate is for crime and violence; we are all against it. The reality is sometimes more difficult than the rhetoric. We need more than feel-good efforts. Parents and children in this country want concrete proposals. We give them those in this amendment. 
   As I said earlier, the question will be, Are Senators for or against them? We will have the vote and we will make that determination. These are proposals put together by Senators whose political philosophies go across the spectrum, by law enforcement officials who have testified and given Members their best analyses, by those who have run successful juvenile programs that have lowered juvenile crime and have stopped juvenile violence. We have put all this together. We have taken off any mantles of partisanship. These are proposals that we know work, not pie-in-the-sky but proven proposals. 
   The American people send Senators here to do a job, to pay taxes, to help parents seek a life where they do not have to fear for their children when they go to school, where parents do not have to fear for their children while they are at school, where there will be some control of juvenile violence. That is what is in this amendment. 
   How much time remains for the Senator from Vermont?

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, first off, I thank my good friend from Utah for the kind words. I am reminded of Shakespeare and Julius Caesar: I am here not to praise Caesar but to bury him. I think my friend from Utah has expanded on that. He wants to both bury me and praise me. I thank him for one-half of that equation and regret the other half. 
   I will point out a few errors, though, in his statement. One, this is an amendment. It is not a substitute. It is not intended as a substitute. It would not begin to be a substitute because there are many parts of S. 254 with which I agree. 
   The distinguished chairman has talked about the hearings on S. 254. In fact, there have been no hearings on S. 254; not one, not one at all. In fact, my amendment, which is basically what was introduced over a year ago and not something that popped out here yesterday, has had just as many hearings as S. 254. 
   There are things in S. 254 I like. I praised Chairman HATCH for including my reverse waiver in the bill. That is very good. Senator DEWINE of Ohio and I worked on it, and we adopted a technology grant, the DeWine-Leahy-Hatch Law Crime Identification Technology Act that provides a $250 million block grant for States to upgrade their criminal records. It will be funded this year to help States upgrade their criminal history records.  
   My amendment provides money for both intervention and primary prevention programs because we need primary prevention programs before children get into trouble. In some ways we fail, because the only time we step in is after they get into trouble. Let's stop it before they get into trouble. 
   The distinguished chairman said that it is a lot of money, that I am adding $ 1/2 billion for prevention for children. Let's talk about this. That is a lot of money. That is close to $2 a person in this country. I think the math probably works out to about $1.85 or $1.90 per person every year. That is almost enough to buy a small soda at a movie, or that is almost enough to buy a comic book. 
   Let's be realistic. To help keep our children out of trouble, can we not afford $1.85 or $1.90 a year? Ask the parents in Littleton, CO, whether they would spend that kind of money, or ask the parents in any town in Vermont, California, Oregon, Utah, or Alabama if they would. 
   We want to address youth violence and school violence problems in this country. This is a problem that is a lot bigger than just whatever happens in our courts, once the crime has happened, once the juvenile has been apprehended. 
   We need an approach obviously to handle juvenile crime after it happens, but let's spend that extra $1.85 or $1.90 to try to use programs that have been proven to work, that our own hearings have shown work to prevent a crime from happening in the first place. 
   How much time do I have left, Mr. President?

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know we are going to have a series of votes in a short while. I would like to speak about one of them, amendment No. 332, introduced by the distinguished Senator from Idaho, Mr. CRAIG. I have heard of the emperor not having clothes, but this amendment has no clothes. 
   This is an amendment that speaks about controlling gun sales at guns shows, auctions or out of the back of your truck or whatever, and we are going to put some controls on it. We are going to put some controls on for background checks, but only if the person who opens the back of his trunk to sell these guns ``desires to have access to the national instant check system.'' Of course, if he doesn't want to, he can keep right on selling the guns, no checks, nothing. I am not that great at driving a truck, but I could drive an 18-wheeler through that hole. 
   Then it has a whole lot of civil liabilities in here for certain future Federal firearm violations. But then there is probably the best sweetheart deal I have ever seen. It dismisses pending actions from any Federal or State court for gun dealers. It gives blanket immunity. This amendment might cover a State or a city, Attorney General or anybody else who sued a gun dealer and dismiss the case. Not even a TV judge could throw it out that easy, but this amendment could. It is not clear from its drafting who is covered by this immunity section of the amendment. 
   I do not know why we do not amend it. I am sure there are some around here, because of their ties with the tobacco industry, who would like to do that for the tobacco industry. Can you imagine if anybody brought up a piece of legislation that said we will, by this amendment, remove all liability on tobacco suits? They would be laughed out of here. It would be a front-page story in the paper. Suppose somebody came in and said, I want to throw a little amendment in here to do away with suits against toxic waste sites. People would be calling up, saying, what, did you get a PAC contribution from Polluters, Incorporated? 
   I have seen some remarkable amendments. I commend the distinguished  Senator. He has very strong feelings about guns and he has concerns about any limitations on them. But this is remarkable. 
   I keep a file of extraordinary things I have seen during my 25 years here. This will go in the file. To put in an amendment, not even debate this line, but to say, anybody who has a suit against a gun dealer or perhaps a gun manufacturer, it might be thrown out. No hearings. No debate. Nothing. But the Senate has thrown it out. In fact, this section is just titled ``Immunity.'' That is pretty amazing. It says:  
   A qualified civil liability action pending under the date of enactment of this subsection shall be dismissed immediately by the court.  
   Man, every defendant is going to be rushing into court if we pass this, saying, I am home free. I get out of jail. I do not have to pass ``go.'' I do get to collect the $200. 
   Mr. President, every Senator who votes for this is voting to override the courts of their State. They are voting to override the municipalities of their State. They are voting to override the legislature of their State. They are voting to override the Attorney General of their State. They are voting on suits they have not even seen, to just throw them out of court. I have been here long enough to know special interest legislation makes it to the floor of the Senate, but this may be the all-time king.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, first, on the Hatch-Leahy Internet amendment, let me just say I have worked on a number of these issues with the distinguished Senator from Utah. I think this is one that should get very broad support in this body. 
   I have talked for years about how we should allow the users of the Internet to control limited access to objectionable material that can be found on line. Anybody with any kind of ability at all can find objectionable material on line. It fits the standard of objectionable by any of us in this body. Some of it is disgusting and obscene and nothing I would want even my adult children to see. 
   But there is also a lot of amazing and wonderful material in this relatively new communication medium when you can go on the Internet and see people exploring in Antarctica or on Mount Everest, or see surgery being performed experimentally, or talk with astronauts on our space shuttle. These are the wonderful 
   things on line and should be encouraged. 
   What worries me is when Congress tries to regulate content on the Internet. I have opposed that. For example, I was against the Communications Decency Act, eventually found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The law was passed with the best of intentions. It was done to protect children from indecent on-line materials, something all of us as parents want to do. It did it by empowering the Government and was, thus, unconstitutional. 
   What we should do is empower individual users and parents to decide what material is objectionable. This belongs to parents and users. Also, it brings parents and their children closer together if they actually work together and look at what is on the Internet. 
   The amendment Senator HATCH and I have offered will require large on-line service providers to offer subscribers filtering software systems that will stop material parents find objectionable from reaching their computer screen. 
   I am supportive of voluntary industry efforts to provide Internet users with one-click-away resources on how to protect their children as they go on line. Senator CAMPBELL, the distinguished Senator from Colorado, and I joined the Vice President at the White House just last week to hear about this One Click Away Program. Vice President GORE, Senator BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL, I, and others across the political spectrum joined together to say this is something parents want, need, and can use. 
   Our amendment promotes the use of filtering technologies by Internet users. It is a far better, more constitutional alternative to Government censorship. I commend the distinguished Senator from Utah. I appreciate working with him on this. While I realize we will not vote on this one until tomorrow morning, I look forward to joining the distinguished Senator from Utah and encourage all Senators of both parties to vote for it. 
   Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from Utah.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand the thrust of what the distinguished Senator from Kansas wishes to do. I am inclined to agree with him. 
   I am worried that his amendment may be creating not just one, but two antitrust exemptions in the bill. I do not want, nor do I expect that he would want to create unnecessarily large loopholes in our antitrust laws. 
   I will support his amendment so we can go on to conference with it, because what he is trying to accomplish is something I think the majority of us here in this Senate would want to accomplish. I suggest that the distinguished Senator, between the time this bill leaves the Senate and goes to conference, may want to work with the distinguished Senator from Utah and myself to make sure that we do not create an antitrust exemption that goes beyond what the distinguished Senator wishes to accomplish. 
   I am not suggesting such an expertise in antitrust law that I could tell him precisely how we might do that, but there are a couple red flags here. My recommendation is that we pass the amendment, but then that the three of us, and any other Senators who may be interested, may want to look at it closely to make sure that it is drafted, one, to accomplish exactly what all of us want to accomplish, but, two, not to raise an antitrust problem in another area. 
   With that, Mr. President, I am perfectly willing to yield back the remainder of my time, if there is any time on this side.

   Mr. President, I have spoken earlier about this. The Craig amendment, as drafted, dismisses pending and future lawsuits against some firearms dealers. And I say ``some,'' because the way it is drafted it is not clear, but it throws out State court cases, Federal court cases, gives blanket immunity. I think that goes to such special interests on gun legislation that we ought to reject it, even in this setting.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have had a series of shocking schoolyard shootings. I cannot imagine any Senator, as a human being or as a parent or citizen, who would not be shocked, just as have most people around the world. The Senate is now finally turning its attention to doing something about youth violence in this country. Two weeks ago, the distinguished majority leader promised the American people that this week he would permit full and open debate on this issue. I commend him for that, because for 3 years we have not been given the opportunity to discuss this critical issue on the floor of the Senate without some kinds of procedural gimmicks or artificial limits on debate or amendments. I think the American people do not want to see that. They want to see a full and real debate. 
   Over that same 3-year period when we tried to have this debate, this country has witnessed schoolyard shootings by children in Arkansas and Washington, Oregon, Tennessee, California, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Mississippi, and most recently in Littleton, CO. I say to the distinguished Presiding Officer and all Members on the floor, none of us can look at our States and say with certitude that we are immune to such a tragedy. 
   Finally, after the deaths and injury of 41 children just in the incidents to which I have referred, the Senate is turning its attention to this matter. Violence in our Nation's schools, committed by or against children, devastates all of us--as parents or as grandparents, as educators, as civic leaders or whatever. But devastating as it is to us, most importantly these incidents scar and upset our children. Obviously, it takes them away from the learning, which should be the focus at this important time in their lives, a time that should be a time of joy, a time of growth, a time of learning--a time that will set their path, really, for the rest of their lives. They should not be distracted by these terrible things. 
   This is a complex issue. Frankly, no one party has all the right answers. It is time we as Democrats and Republicans discuss all of our ideas and proposals for actions and then choose the best among them. A good proposal that works should get the support of all of us. 
   Our first question really should be whether a program or proposal will help our children effectively, not whether it is a Democrat or Republican proposal. I have learned through the years that good legislators coming together can make good proposals. I have been honored to see passed into law numerous law enforcement proposals I have sponsored and co-sponsored with like-minded Members on the other side of the aisle. But we also have to recognize that legislation alone is not enough to stop youth violence. We can pass a law saying we don't want violence. We can also pass a law saying we would like the Sun to rise in the west and set in the east. Either one would be about as effective as the other. We have to do a lot more than that. 
   We can pass an assortment of new laws and still turn on the news and find out some child in the country has turned violent and turned on other teachers or children with a weapon, with terrible results. So this is not just about Littleton. Littleton is the most recent, it is the most bloody, but it is the seventh incident of schoolyard killings in the past years and no area of the country has escaped the bomb threats or fears these incidents have generated. Each incident of school violence leaves us with more questions than answers. It is easy to say each is related to the next, but together they all point to problems we must do something about. There is not one major catalyst that touches off an eruption of violence in a school; there are a whole lot of contributing causes. 
   We can certainly point to inadequate parental involvement. Frankly, that is an area about which I worry--very, very busy parents and very, very little time for their children. In an increasingly affluent society, we have to ask whether we are paying a terrible price for our affluence. 
   We can talk about overcrowded classrooms and oversized schools that add to students' alienation. When we have high schools with 1,200, 1,500, 1,600 people, how can they possibly have a sense of community within that high school? 
   We can talk about the easy accessibility of guns. We can speak of the violence depicted on television and movies and video games. We can talk about the inappropriate--more than inappropriate--disgusting content now available on the Internet. There is no single cause, and because there is no single cause, there is no single legislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our schools and in our streets. 
   Just as those who look at a fire know if you remove enough kindling, you can prevent the fire, so there are things we can do right now, and there is no excuse for not trying. Everybody has a role to play in the solution. While we cannot legislate the problems away, we all have a role, and that means parents, teachers, lawmakers, Hollywood, Internet providers and gun manufacturers and sellers. But we should also recognize that despite the recent and shocking school shootings, we have been doing some things right. 
   By any measure you want to use--victimizations reported by police or crimes reported by police or arrests--the serious violent crime rate is going down. Let me show this chart. This is something of which we ought to be proud. Since 1973, the total violent crime rate has gone down. In fact, it has gone down the most in the last 6 years, certainly more than I have seen it go down at any time. 
   According to the most recent statistics from the Bureau of Justice, the overall crime rate has fallen more than 18 percent since 1993. 
   This next chart is remarkable. It is something in which we should take pride. After seeing for decades, during my adult life, the crime rate go up, up, up and up, to see it these last 6 years go down is very significant. 
   The rate of serious violent crime being committed by juveniles is also on the way down. Following a period of going up in the late 1980s and early 1990s, they peaked in 1993. That also is something in which we should take some pride and we should take comfort as Americans and as citizens. 
   The reduction in the murder rate alone is truly good news. In 1997, the murder rate was 28 percent lower than 1993. And in 1998, this rate had fallen to its lowest level in three decades. That, again, is something in which we should take some comfort, even though any murder is one murder too many. 
   In the years I have been here, in 30 years--this goes back to the time when I was a prosecutor and throughout all this--I have seen through each administration, Republican or Democrat, the murder rate go up. Finally, we have seen in the last 6 years the murder rate come down to where it is now, the lowest level in three decades. 
   Over the past few months, we have begun hearing criticism that this administration is not focusing sufficient resources on enforcing our gun laws. Of course, there is always room for improvement, as there is with anybody. But let's not let 
   political name-calling detract from the indisputable fact that the murder rate for teenagers and young adults rose sharply in the late eighties and early nineties due to a rise in gun violence that is now on the decline. In fact, juvenile murder and non-negligent manslaughter arrests declined almost 40 percent between 1993 and 1997. To use real numbers, there were 3,800 juvenile arrests for murder at the peak in 1993. By 1997, that number was down to 2,500 out of a population of 30 million children between the ages of 10 and 17. 
   As we talk about juvenile crime legislation, it is important to keep in mind these statistics show some successes and we should be promoting and expanding those programs that are helping to produce these successes. 
   We have some complex, sweeping legislation before us. S. 254 was never referred to the Judiciary Committee for consideration, which is extraordinarily unusual. I look forward to discussing this. 
   It was introduced by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and cosponsored by the distinguished Senator from Alabama, who is on the floor. I wait to hear from the distinguished chairman as to what will be accomplished with it. 
   While we did not examine the bill in the Judiciary Committee because the majority chose, as they have a right to, to place the bill directly on the Senate Calendar, instead the Judiciary Committee has been busy on a bankruptcy  bill protecting creditors and a proposed constitutional amendment to protect the flag. Protecting the flag and protecting creditors may be important issues, but frankly, as a parent, I am far more interested in protecting children from violence, both in the schoolyard and outside school. 
   Last Congress, we had an earlier version of this bill, S. 10. We tried to improve it, and I think we did. I will describe in more detail S. 254. The juvenile crime bill we turn to today reflects that progress, and I commend Senator HATCH for his leadership in continuing to push forward and building a consensus of Republicans and Democrats. I thought we missed opportunities in the last Congress to come together on legislative efforts to deal with youth violence. I hope we will not miss that opportunity in this Congress and we can come together. 
   In fact, many of the improvements we tried to make to the juvenile crime bill, S. 10, were rejected mostly along party-line votes in the Judiciary Committee, and by nearly a party-line vote we saw it passed out of committee. Not surprising, because it was a partisan bill, and crime should not be a partisan issue, it was hard to find anybody who liked it when it came to the floor. I made, as did others, a number of criticisms of the bill, and those criticisms were echoed by virtually every major newspaper in the United States, as well as by national leaders, and ranged across the spectrum from Chief Justice William Rehnquist to Marian Wright Edelman, the president of the Children's Defense Fund. 
   The Philadelphia Inquirer called the bill ``fatally flawed.'' The Los Angeles Times described the bill ``peppered with ridiculous poses and penalties'' and as taking a ``rigid, counterproductive approach'' to juvenile crime prevention. The St. Petersburg Times called the bill ``an amalgam of bad and dangerous ideas.'' 
   Chief Justice Rehnquist criticized S. 10 because it would, as he said, ``eviscerate [the] traditional deference to state prosecutions, thereby increasing substantially the potential workload of the federal judiciary.'' 
   He was concerned that federalizing juvenile crimes meant that ``federal prosecution should be limited to those offenses that cannot and should not be prosecuted in state courts.'' 
   The National District Attorneys Association, having been the vice president of that association, I listened to them. They expressed concern that ``S. 10 goes too far'' in changing the ``core mandates'' which have kept juveniles safer and away from adults while in jail for over 25 years, and that S. 10's new juvenile record-keeping requirements were ``burdensome and contrary to most state laws.'' 
   Similarly, the National Governors' Association, the Council of State Governments, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Counties, the National Conference of State Legislatures expressed concerns about the restrictions S. 10 would place on their ability to combat and prevent juvenile crime effectively. 
   So with all this criticism, when the Republican leadership said we could not have real debate in the last Congress, that became an unacceptable situation and one, frankly, which created a lot of concern among a number of Republican legislators. 
   Despite the wellspring of concern by the Federal judiciary and by State and local law enforcement and public officials over significant parts of S. 10 as reported by the Judiciary Committee, we were not going to be allowed to debate it. 
   In September 1998, the majority propounded a unanimous consent request to permit the Republicans to offer a substitute that contained changes to over 160 separate paragraphs of the bill, but not allow Democrats the same opportunity. That did not allow full and fair debate. 
   I suggested a plan that would have ensured debate on the more controversial aspects of last year's bill by placing in the RECORD on September 25, 1998, a proposal for a limited number of Democratic amendments. My proposal was never responded to. 
   I say that because that was in the past. And I accept the majority leader's representation that this will not happen this year, that we will not allow narrow procedural devices to limit debate on S. 254. And I think we will have a better bill because of that. 
   There are very good ideas on both the Republican and Democratic side of the aisle here in the Senate to improve this legislation. After all, keeping children safe, both in school and out of school is not a Republican or Democratic idea; that is a basic, automatic feeling that every parent, every family and every person in this Chamber of either party feels strongly. 
   The concerns I outlined about S. 10 are shared by many others, as well as by child advocates, judges, law enforcement and State and local officials, and were shared here on November 13, 1997; January 29, 1998; April 1, 1998; June 23, 1998; September 8, 1998, and October 15, 1998. I said the bill skimped on effective prevention efforts to stop children from getting into trouble in the first place. 
   Second, I said the bill would have gutted the core protections which have been in place for over 20 years to protect children who come into contact with the criminal justice system and keep them out of harm's way from adult inmates, to keep status and nonoffenders out of jail altogether, and to address disproportionate minority confinement. 
   Thirdly, I expressed concern about the federalization of juvenile crime resulting from S. 10's elimination of the requirement that Federal courts only get involved in prosecutions of juveniles if the State cannot or declines to prosecute the juveniles. 
   Finally, I was concerned that the new accountability block 
   grant in S. 10 contained onerous eligibility requirements which would end up imposing on the States a one-size-fits-all uniform sewn up in Washington for dealing with juvenile crime. The States simply did not want this straitjacket. In fact, at one stage, the way it was written in the bill, no State would have qualified for the block grant; no State of the 50 would have. 
   So I say this, and I say this as a compliment to Senators on both sides of the aisle who worked on S. 254: It is a much more improved bill than S. 10 in the last Congress. It incorporates many of the improvements we suggested last Congress. I am delighted to see that proposals that the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee specifically voted down in 1997 have now been put back in the bill. These are changes that we have been pushing for a number of years. It is the right approach now to put them back in the bill. 
   So let's make progress together. I hope through an open floor debate and an open amendment process, without procedural games, we will be able to make sufficient progress to be able to support a Senate bill that can make a difference. 
   We tried in July 1997 to amend S. 10 to protect the States' traditional prerogative in handling juvenile offenders. And my amendment would have limited the Federal trial as an adult of juveniles charged with nonviolent felonies to circumstances when the State is unwilling or unable to exercise jurisdiction. That was defeated. Whereas, the language in S. 254 contains a new provision analogous to my previously rejected amendment that would direct Federal prosecutors to ``exercise a presumption in favor of referral'' of juvenile cases to the appropriate State or tribal authorities. 
   While the language used in this S. 254 section may need some clarification, particularly since it appears to contradict other language in the bill requiring Federal trial of juveniles who commit any Federal offense, it is a provision in the right direction. 
   In July 1997, we tried to amend S. 10 before the Judiciary Committee to permit limited judicial review of a Federal prosecutor's decision to try certain juveniles as adults. S. 10 granted sole, nonreviewable authority to Federal prosecutors to try juveniles as adults for any Federal felony, removing Federal judges from that decision altogether. 
   I am a little bit hesitant to give authority to any Federal prosecutor--special prosecutors or regular Federal prosecutors--that cannot be reviewed. And my amendment would have granted Federal judges authority in appropriate cases to review a prosecutor's decision. Only three States in the country granted prosecutors the extraordinary authority over juvenile cases that S. 10 proposed, including Florida.  
   I mention that because sometimes we get the impression that here in Washington we always know better than the States. In criminal procedures, criminal process, we should look at the States and their experience in determining whether we should step in and change things. And when you find that only three States have done what we were asking to do, you ask why. And I mentioned Florida as being one of the States that granted this extraordinary authority. 
   Earlier this year, we saw the consequences of that kind of authority, when a local prosecutor in that State charged, as an adult, a 15-year-old mildly retarded boy with no prior record, who stole $2 from a school classmate to buy lunch. The local prosecutor locked up this retarded boy in an adult jail for weeks. You can imagine what that was like, for this $2 theft, before national press coverage forced a review of the charging decision in this case. We do not want to see that kind of incident on the Federal level. 
   Unfortunately, my proposal for a ``reverse waiver'' procedure providing judicial review of a prosecutor's decision was voted down, with no Republican on the committee voting for it.

   Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield, I will explain it. The Senator from Virginia, Mr. ROBB, brought up his amendment in the second degree to the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment. The distinguished Senator from Utah is one of the sponsors of Hatch-Biden-Sessions. He withdrew it, thus withdrawing the second-degree amendment by Senator ROBB. The distinguished Senator from Virginia is thus waiting for time to bring his amendment back up for consideration.

   Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding, on my time, not on the time of the distinguished Senator from Utah. 
   Just so the distinguished Senator from Utah can hear this, I appreciate the fact that he has included many of the provisions in this bill I had argued for in the last Congress. I compliment him on that. I did that earlier today when I spoke, referring to the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment. I tell the distinguished chairman that as he and I are both people who believe in redemption, and I would say this is a long way from redemption, going from 1997 to 1999, but hope springs eternal, and he has included some of my provisions in this bill. I appreciate it. 
   I note that the original bill provided $15 million for primary prevention. This amendment would earmark another $112.5 million. 
   I understand the distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, would like to be added as a cosponsor. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for that.

   Mr. LEAHY. I think this is a positive step, by earmarking the other $112.5 million. I commend Senators HATCH and SESSIONS and BIDEN for this. It shows that our efforts over the last 2 years really have made a difference. Let us put this in context. 
   The rest of the bill also allocates over $330 million for law enforcement, $75 million for juvenile criminal history records, $20 million for gang fighting, and $50 million for prosecutors. In context, that is a total of $482.5 million for law enforcement compared to $112.5 million for primary prevention. S. 254 also provides $400 million for intervention programs after juveniles come into contact with the juvenile or criminal justice system. It is intervention money, not primary prevention money. It is important money, but it is not directed to primary prevention. 
   There is $50 million in the prosecutors grant fund. That is a proposal that was accepted in 1997 by the Judiciary Committee. My only concern is the money goes only to prosecutors, not to anyone else in the juvenile system. It doesn't go to counselors. It doesn't go to public defenders. It doesn't go to corrections officers. It doesn't go to juvenile judges. We have to examine closely the effects of this new prosecutors grant. 
   I want to make sure it doesn't exacerbate overcrowding in the juvenile system and the system does not break down; I pledge to now work with the Senator from Utah to see if there is a possibility of balancing the system in a fair way. 
   Overall, Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Utah, as I said, and the distinguished Senator from Alabama, the distinguished Senator from Delaware for adding the things we have requested for a couple years. I did want to point out, however, as I said earlier, anybody who has ever been in law enforcement will always tell you, if you can prevent the crime from happening, you are a lot better off in what you do after it happens. I wish there was more money for prevention. Money for law enforcement is well spent. I wish there was more money for prevention. 
   Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was happy to yield to the Senator from Colorado. He and I have had discussions of the terrible events that took place in Colorado. The distinguished Senator from Colorado and I wrote legislation on another area of law enforcement, relying on his experience and my experience in law enforcement. That was the bulletproof vests legislation which is now working very, very well. 
   I mention this while the distinguished Senator from Colorado is still on the floor because we have had many discussions about law enforcement matters--most recently an event at the White House. It has been my experience, time and time again, the Senator from Colorado has given pragmatic and realistic solutions to law enforcement problems at a time when we can all get carried away by philosophical arguments. I found most law enforcement people tell me to save the philosophy for them to read in their retirement years--give them the pragmatic solutions today when they have to uphold the law. 
   So I thank the Senator from Colorado.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to be joined by Senators JEFFORDS, HARKIN, KOHL, and FEINGOLD, and Representative HINCHEY in the House of Representatives, in introducing the ``Better Nutrition for School Children Act of 1999.'' This bill seals a loophole undermining our children's nutritional health. 
   One of the most important lessons we can teach our children is good health. Good health includes keeping our children tobacco and drug free, and includes nutrition education for healthy living. 
   Every day, more than 26 million children participate in the National School Lunch Program. One-quarter of those children--approximately seven million--also participate in the National School Breakfast Program. According to a United States Department of Agriculture study, school children may consume between one-third and one-half of their daily nutrient intake at school. Knowing how important school meal programs are to the nutritional health of children, I am extremely concerned by reports of soft drinks being given to children before or during lunch. 
   Current law prohibits the sale of soft drinks during lunch. This prohibition has been around for a long time. However, some schools are now getting around this prohibition by giving soda to children for free. This is a loophole--big enough to drive a soda truck through--that hurts our children. The bill which we are introducing today would close this loophole so that soft drinks cannot be distributed--for free or for sale--during mealtime at schools participating in the National School Lunch Program. Also, the bill would prohibit giving away sodas before lunch. 
   As a parent, I would be outraged to discover that my efforts at teaching my child good nutrition were being undermined by free sugar and caffeine laden soft drinks at school. 
   Studies based on statistics from the USDA Continuing Surveys of Food Intakes by Individuals have shown that heavy soft drink consumption correlates with a low intake of magnesium, calcium, ascorbic acid, riboflavin and vitamin A. The loss of calcium is particularly alarming for teenage women, as calcium is crucial for building up bone mass to reduce the risk of osteoporosis later in life, and women build 92 percent of their bone mass by age 18. 
   Many sodas also contain caffeine, which is not only an addictive stimulant, but which also increases the excretion of calcium. 
   In its Food Guide Pyramid for Young Children, which recommends good dietary habits for children, the United States Department of Agriculture continues to recommend serving children fruits, vegetables, grains, meat and dairy, while limiting children's intake of sweets - including soft drinks. 
   Statistics regarding children's intake of soft drinks are alarming. For instance, teenage boys consume an average of 2 1/2 soft drinks a day--which equals approximately 15 teaspoons of sugar--every day. 
   While children's consumption of soft drinks has been on the rise, their consumption of milk has been on the decline. Statistics from the USDA demonstrate that whereas 20 years ago teens drank twice as much milk as soda, today they drink twice as much soda as milk. Unlike milk, soft drinks have minimal nutritional value and they contribute nothing to the health of kids. One need only compare the ingredient and nutrition labels on a Coke can versus a milk carton to see what a child loses when milk is replaced by a soft drink. 
   The consequence of replacing milk with soda is clear: the declining nutritional health of our children. In her book Jane Brody's Nutritional Book, Jane Brody articulates this point in saying:  
   Probably the most insidious undermining of good nutrition in the early years comes  from the soft drink industry. Catering to children's innate preferences for a sweet taste, the industry has succeeded in drawing millions of youngsters away from milk and natural fruit juices and hooking them on pop and other artificially flavored drinks that offer nothing of nutritional significance besides calories.  
   The Vermont State Board of Education's School Nutrition Policy Statement actually touches on this very issue. Among its recommendations to school districts for dietary guidelines and nutrition, the Board of Education advises:  
   Certain foods which contribute little other than calories should not be sold on school campuses. These foods include carbonated beverages, nonfruit soft drinks, candies in which the major ingredient is sugar, frozen nonfruit ice bars, and chewing gum with sugar.  
   It was only a few years ago that, as Chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, that I fought the soft drink behemoths--Coca-Cola and Pepsi--over vending machines in schools. I felt that schools should be encouraged to close down vending machines before and during lunch. I was unprepared for the wealth of opposition which ensued. 
   However, despite the well-financed opposition by soda companies, the Nutrition and Health for Children Act was met with bipartisan support in Congress. Former Senator Bob Dole noted that ``too often a student gives up his half dollar and his appetite en route to the cafeteria'' and criticized the ``so-called plate waste, where young students and other students decide it is better to have a candy bar and a soft drink rather than eat some meal that is subsidized by the Federal Government.'' 
   Just as the Better Nutrition and Health for Children Act passed with bipartisan support in 1994, I am sure that the Better Nutrition for School Children Act of 1999 will pass with bipartisan support this year.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small Business Y2K Compliance Act of 1999. I am pleased to be joined by Senator DODD, the ranking member of the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, as an original cosponsor of this measure. 
   Our legislation would offer small businesses a tax deduction of up to $40,000 towards the expenses of purchasing and installing Year 2000 compliant computer hardware and software in 1999. In addition, our bill would reward those small businesses that have acted responsibly by allowing an accelerated depreciation of up to $40,000 for the purchase and installation of Year 2000 compliant computer hardware and software made in 1997 and 1998. These tax incentives have been endorsed by thousands of small business owners at last year's White House Conference on Small Business, the American Small Business Alliance and the Small Business Administration. 
   Unfortunately, not all small businesses are doing enough to address the year 2000 issue because of a lack of resources in many cases. They face Y2K problems both directly and indirectly through their suppliers, customers and financial institutions. As recently as last October a representative of the National Federation of Independent Businesses testified: ``A fifth of them do not understand that there is a Y2K problem. . . . They are not aware of it. A fifth of them are currently taking action. A fifth have not taken action but plan to take action, and two-fifths are aware of the problem but do not plan to take any action prior to the year 2000.'' 
   Indeed, the Small Business Administration recently warned that 330,000 small businesses are at risk of closing down as a result of Y2K problems, and another 370,000 could be temporarily or permanently hobbled. 
   Federal and State government agencies have entire departments working  on this problem. Utilities, financial institutions, telecommunications companies, and other large companies have information technology divisions working to make corrections to keep their systems running. They have armies of workers--but small businesses do not. 
   Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, from the city corner market to the family farm to the small-town doctor. In my home State of Vermont, 98 percent of the businesses are small businesses with limited resources. That is why it is so important to provide small businesses with the resources to correct their Y2K problems now. 
   A few months ago, I hosted a Y2K conference in Vermont to help small businesses prepare for 2000. Hundreds of small business owners from across Vermont attended the conference to learn how to minimize or eliminate their Y2K computer problems. Vermonters are working hard to identify their Y2K vulnerabilities and prepare action plans to resolve them. They should be encouraged and assisted in these important efforts. 
   This is the right approach. We have to fix as many of these problems ahead of time as we can. Ultimately, the best business policy and the best defense against any Y2K-based lawsuits is to be Y2K compliant. 
   That is why it is so important to provide small businesses with the resources to correct their Y2K problems now. Our legislation would provide targeted tax incentives to encourage small businesses round the country in their Y2K remediation efforts. Our bill encourages Y2K compliance now to avoid computer problems next year. 
   Moreover, the tax incentives in our legislation would have a negligible revenue cost. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that companion legislation introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative KAREN THURMAN, H.R. 179, would reduce revenue by $171 million from 1990-2003, but would increase revenues by the same $171 million from 2004-2008. Thus, this bill is fiscally prudent as well. 
   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and support the ``Small Business Y2K Compliance Act of 1999.''

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate regarding a peaceful process of self-determination in East Timor. I am joined by Senators FEINGOLD, REED, HARKIN, MCCONNELL, MOYNIHAN, and KOHL. 
   A year ago I doubt anyone would have predicted that a settlement of East Timor's political status would be in sight. 
   While there are many obstacles and dangers ahead, we should take note of what has been accomplished. In the past year: 
   President Suharto relinqushed power. 
   The Indonesian Government endorsed a ballot on autonomy, which is planned for August 8th. 
   The United Nations, Indonesia, and Portugal are to sign an agreement today on the procedures for that vote. 
   If the East Timorese people reject autonomy, there is every expectation that East Timor will be on the road to independence. 
   The resolution that I am submitting today recognizes the positive steps that have been taken. 
   But it also expresses our deep concern that since January, when Indonesian President Habibie expressed the willingness to consider independence for East Timor, violence and intimidation by anti-independence militias backed by members of the Indonesian military has increased dramatically. 
   The perpetrators of the violence want to sabotage the vote on East Timor's future. 
   I spoke with one East Timorese man today, Mr. Franciso Da Costa, who witnessed the April 6th massacre of scores of people in the village of Liquica. 
   An Op Ed article in today's New York Times by East Timorese lawyer Aniceto guterres Lopez says it all. He wrote: ``With arms, money and a license for reckless rampages, the militia leaders have openly threatened death to anyone opposed to continued Indonesian occupation.'' 
   I received a report earlier today that Mr. Lopez' house is surrounded and he has been threatened with death. Bishop Belo, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and one of the most courageous people I have ever had the privilege to meet, has also been threatened.  
   Hundreds of East Timorese civilians have been killed, injured or disappeared. Thousands have fled their homes to escape the violence, and are struggling to survive. Food and medicines are in short supply because the Indonesian Government has severely restricted access. 
   This resolution sounds an alarm. The situation is extremely fragile. The militias are sowing chaos and terror. Far stronger steps are needed by the Indonesian Government and military to rein in the paramilitary groups. 
   The resolution calls on the President and Secretary of State to intensify their efforts to urge the Indonesian Government and military to disarm the paramilitary groups. This must be done. 
   Another recommendation we make is that the United States contribute to the U.N. Trust Fund which will set up polling booths and put people on the ground to monitor the vote. I plan to work with Senator MCCONNELL, who is a cosponsor of this resolution and Chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, to obtain the funding as soon as possible. 
   The resolution says that any agreement to sell or transfer military equipment to Indonesia should state that the equipment will not be used in East Timor. We would prefer that there be no military equipment. But at the very least, we do not want our equipment ending up in the hands of thugs who are trying to derail the vote. 
   We know from history how much blood can be shed in East Timor. Nobody--not the Indonesian Government, not the Indonesian military, and certainly not the East Timorese people, benefits from a return to those days.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona has been doing a good job of running the traffic here today. I commend the Senator from Arizona for helping make the arrangements, and the Senator from Delaware for putting this vote off until tomorrow. I think there are a number of Senators who do wish to speak on both sides of this issue and should have a chance to speak. The Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Delaware and other sponsors of this amendment, the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. DODD, and others are right in saying, give us a chance to speak before voting. 
   Mr. President, I intend to vote against tabling this resolution. I want other Senators to be very clear why I will not join the distinguished majority leader and the distinguished Democratic leader in their motion to table and why, like what I might normally do in a case like this, I will vote against such a leadership motion. 
   The United States, as the leader of NATO, is engaged in a costly and dangerous war in Kosovo that has immense importance for the people of Kosovo, for NATO, and for humanity. Horrendous war crimes are being perpetrated by President Milosevic's forces, and I believe that NATO has no alternative but to try to stop them. 
   We could debate how and why we got into this. We could debate, obviously, whether we are pursuing the best strategy to achieve our goals. We could debate the rationale for the $6 billion in supplemental funds the President has asked for to continue the war and care for the 1.5 million refugees and displaced people who are struggling to survive, many in a life-and-death struggle, but so far we have not had that debate. 
   Now, I support the supplemental funding. In fact, I believe the request for humanitarian assistance is too little. I believe we are not facing up to the reality that these refugees are not going to go back this year, and we are going to come very quickly to the fall months in that part of the world and into the winter. I know the weather; it is not unlike the weather in my own State of Vermont. They are going to be there--hundreds of thousands, if not well over a million refugees--throughout next winter. We are not looking at what those costs are going to be. I also will oppose this motion to table because I believe it is time for the Senate to debate our policy in Kosovo and take a stand on it one way or the other. 
   I want to be clear that by voting against tabling, I am not voting on the merits of this resolution. I am voting only to have a debate. The President has not sought such broad, open-ended authorization in the resolution. But even if he had, it is possible that the resolution may be too broadly worded. That is the sort of thing we would find in a debate, and I believe that the proponents of the resolution have done a service to the Senate by bringing it before us for a debate. If we think it should be different, then we can amend it and vote on it. 
   As my distinguished friend from West Virginia, the senior Senator, has noted, this resolution, if approved, would prematurely write the Congress out of any future debate on Kosovo. He raises a good issue, but one that should be debated. For example, the resolution would authorize the President to deploy ground troops even though he has not expressed an intention to do so, nor provided an assessment of what the costs and benefits of such a deployment would be. 
   But we need to debate this resolution. We saw what happened last week in the House--a partisan, muddled exercise that sent conflicting messages and solved nothing. For too long, we have seen a policy in Kosovo that is guided more by polls than by a policy with clearly defined, achievable goals and a credible strategy for achieving them. 
   The Senate can be the conscience of the Nation, and I believe, after my years here, the Senate should be the conscience of the Nation, and sometimes it is--but only when we rise to the occasion and debate an issue, as difficult as it may be. Issues of war and going to war and committing our men and women to war is as difficult an issue as we could ever debate here. It is an issue of the utmost gravity. It cries out for a thorough debate, and we should not shrink from it. We need the Senate to speak with substance, not sound bites, and we need the administration to do the same. The world's attention is on Kosovo. Many American lives are at stake, and so are 
   billions of dollars of taxpayers' money. 
   So let us debate the resolution. The war is in its second month, and there is  no end in sight. I must say again that I disagree with our leadership in saying that we should table this motion. I don't believe that. I don't believe the Senator from Arizona wishes this resolution to be tabled either. Let us debate. We will either vote for or against it. We will either vote to amend it or not. But 100 Senators will stand up and vote one way or another on this issue. Frankly, I think the American people would like to see that because they would like that kind of guidance. 
   Mr. President, I will not shrink from that responsibility. I will vote tomorrow against tabling this resolution. The resolution will probably be tabled. I hope that it will not be and that the Senate will stop all hearings, all other matters, and stay here and debate this resolution. We could do it. We have the people here to do it. We have the expertise here. I think we can come out with a very clear statement of American policy--perhaps a clearer one than we have heard to date. 
   Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona for his usual courtesy. I see my distinguished colleague from Kentucky on the floor awaiting recognition. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this past Sunday marked the beginning of National Crime Victims' Rights Week. We set this week aside each year to focus attention on the needs and rights of crime victims. I am pleased to take this opportunity to introduce legislation with my good friend from Massachusetts, Senator KENNEDY, and our cosponsors, Senators SARBANES, KERRY, HARKIN, and MURRAY. Our ``Crime Victims Assistance Act'' represents the next step in our continuing efforts to afford dignity and recognition to victims of crime. 
   My involvement with crime victims began more than three decades ago when I served as State's Attorney for Chittenden County, Vermont, and witnessed first hand the devastation of crime. I have worked ever since to ensure that the criminal justice system is one that respects the rights and dignity of victims of crime, rather than one that presents additional ordeals for those already victimized. 
   I am proud that Congress has been a significant part of the solution to provide victims with greater rights and assistance. Over the past 15 years, Congress has passed several bills to this end. These bills have included: the Victims and Witness Protection Act of 1982; the Victims of Crime Act of 1984; the Victims' Bill of Rights of 1990; the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act; the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 1996; the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997; and the Victims with Disabilities Awareness Act. 
   Also, on the first day of this session, we introduced S.9, a youth crime bill. In that legislation, which we have identified as a legislative priority for the entire Democratic caucus, we included provisions for victims of juvenile crime so that their rights to appear, to be heard, and to be informed would be protected. The recent tragedy in Littleton, Colorado, was only the most recent reminder of the urgent need to enhance protections for these victims, to ensure that their voices are heard. 
   The legislation that we introduce today, the ``Crime Victims Assistance Act,'' builds upon this progress. It provides for a wholesale reform of the Federal Rules and Federal law to establish additional rights and protections for victims of federal crime. 
   Particularly, the legislation would provide crime victims with an enhanced: right to be heard on the issue of pretrial detention; right to be heard on plea bargains; right to a speedy trial; right to be present in the courtroom throughout a trial; 
   right to give a statement at sentencing; right to be heard on probation revocation; and right to be notified of a defendant's escape or release from prison. 
   The legislation goes further than other victims rights proposals that are currently before Congress by including: enhanced penalties for witness intimidation; an increase in Federal victim assistance personnel; enhanced training for State and local law enforcement and officers of the Court; the development of state-of-the-art systems for notifying victims of important dates and developments in their cases; the establishment of ombudsman programs for crime victims; the establishment of pilot programs that implement balanced and restorative justice models; and more direct and effective Federal assistance to victims of international terrorism, including victims of the Lockerbie bombing and other terrorist acts occurring prior to passage of the Victims of Crime Act. 
   These are all matters that can be considered and enacted this year with a simple majority of both Houses of Congress. They need not overcome the delay and higher standards necessitated by proposing to amend the Constitution. They need not wait the hammering out of implementing legislation before making a difference in the lives of crime victims. 
   The Judiciary Committee has already held another hearing this year on a proposed constitutional amendment regarding crime victims. Previous hearings on this proposal were held in 1996, 1997, and 1998. Unfortunately, the Committee has devoted not a minute to consideration of legislative initiatives like the Crime Victims Assistance Act, which Senator KENNEDY and I have introduced over the past years to assist crime victims and better protect their rights. Like many other deserving initiatives, it has taken a back seat to the constitutional amendment debate that continues. 
   I regret that we did not do more for victims last year or the year before. Over the course of that time, I have noted my concern that we not dissipate the progress we could be making by focusing exclusively on efforts to amend the Constitution. Regretfully, I must  note that the pace of victims legislation has slowed noticeably and many opportunities for progress have been squandered. 
   I look forward to continuing to work with the Administration, victims groups, prosecutors, judges and other interested parties on how we can most effectively enhance the rights of victims of crime. Congress and State legislatures have become more sensitive to crime victims rights over the past 20 years and we have a golden opportunity to make additional, significant progress this year to provide the greater voice and rights that crime victims deserve. 
   I would like to acknowledge several groups and individuals who have been extremely helpful with regards to the legislation that we are introducing today: The Office for Victims of Crime at the Justice Department; the National Network to End Domestic Violence; the NOW Legal Defense Fund; the National Clearinghouse for the Defense of Battered Women; the National Victim Center; the National Organization for Victim Assistance; Professor Lynne Henderson of Indiana Law School; and Roger Pilon, Director of the Center for Constitutional Studies at the Cato Institute. 
   While we have greatly improved our crime victims assistance programs and made advances in recognizing crime victims rights, we still have more to do. That is why it is my hope that Democrats and Republicans, supporters and opponents of a constitutional amendment on this issue, will join in advancing this important legislation through Congress. We can make a difference in the lives of crime victims right now, and I hope Congress will make it a top priority and pass the Crime Victims Assistance Act before the end of the year.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there have been a lot of interesting things in the news this week. One is a story about the Supreme Court's ruling on Tuesday. It confirms the view that many of us have held for some time. Special Prosecutor Donald Smaltz was overreaching, at the very least, in indicting and trying former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy. Mr. Smaltz spent over 4 years and about $17 million of our taxpayers' money to run out of office this distinguished public servant. 
   Last December, a jury said ``no'' to Special Prosecutor Smaltz and acquitted Mr. Espy of the charges against him. In fact, the jury said ``no'' and ``no'' and ``no'' and ``no'' and ``no'' and ``no,'' I believe, over 30 times. Now the Supreme Court has said a resounding ``no'' also. They rejected the broad reading urged by Mr. Smaltz of the criminal laws he has used to bring down a Cabinet Secretary. The Supreme Court, Tuesday, concluded that the conviction of a trade association for giving Mr. Espy gifts was correctly thrown out by a lower court. 
   According to the Supreme Court, if Mr. Smaltz's reading of the Federal gratuity statute were correct--a reading that out-of-control special prosecutors seem to have--``it would criminalize, for example, token gifts to the President based on his official position and not linked to any identifiable act--such as the replica jerseys given by championship sports teams each year during ceremonial White House visits ..... [or] a high school principal's gift of a school baseball cap to the Secretary of Education, by reason of his office, on the occasion of the latter's visit to the school.'' 
   The Supreme Court wisely rejected these absurd results. 
   Secretary Espy began his tenure as Agriculture Secretary facing challenges to the safety of our food supply, and he dealt with those challenges with enormous energy, compassion, and effectiveness. Just before he was sworn as Secretary, several children died because they ate contaminated hamburgers in Washington State. 
   I remember this very well. I remember Secretary Espy immediately flying to Washington State to be with the families, because he cares about people. I remember talking to him about that, because I was at that time chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. I know that when he flew back to Washington, he devoted himself to preventing these needless deaths. He started putting into effect policies which will save thousands of lives in our country. He fought the industry itself--a very powerful, well-heeled industry--to do the right thing. 
   History will record his tenure as a turning point in updating and modernizing our food safety standards--a tradition continued by Secretary Glickman and President Clinton. 
   But his ``trial by fire'' began at the hand of a special prosecutor run amuck. The unanimous jury verdict acquitting him underscores what I have been concerned about for some time--unaccountable prosecutors with unlimited budgets who can and will bring charges that no other prosecutor in the world would bring. 
   This special prosecutor is one who is extremely frustrating. If I thought that what he did was out of sheer stupidity, that would be one thing. It would be enough if we thought that this was a man who was just not bright enough to know his job. But along with his total lack of judgment, his total stupidity, came a man whose overwhelming ego was such that he cared less about anybody he was after. The taxpayers were paying his bill. He cared only about preening before the cameras himself. 
   He was particularly interested in promoting himself and patting himself on the back. He was among the first of the special prosecutors to establish his own Internet web page. It is like an advertisement for himself on this web page. Mr. Smaltz posted his reaction to the jury verdict and downplayed the acquittal since an ``indictment of a public official may, in fact, be as great a deterrent as a conviction of that official.'' That was the most flagrant admission of abuse of a prosecutor's power that I have ever seen--I was a prosecutor for nearly 9 years--and it remains posted on his web page today. 
   What he is saying is, it doesn't make any difference if the person is guilty or not. It doesn't make any difference if the jury acquitted over and over again, and the person is not guilty. All the prosecutor has to do is bring an indictment; that will teach them. This is no way to restore faith in the criminal justice system. This is an example of a prosecutor who indicts somebody for something that no jury would ever convict the person for, but says, ``I will show them because I am the prosecutor,'' or, ``I can do that because, after all, it is going to cost you hundreds of thousands and maybe millions of dollars to prove your innocence. And, besides, the taxpayers are paying my bill. So why should I care about you?'' 
   What ego, what stupidity, what arrogant abuse of power. I really cannot think of words strong enough to condemn such actions. 
   No prosecutor should bring an indictment simply as a deterrent and without a good-faith belief that the case can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Prosecutors should not bring these charges simply to harass somebody, simply to cost them money. A prosecutor has a sworn duty not to bring a charge unless he or she thinks there is at least a reasonable chance they can prove the charge and the person is guilty. Common decency, saying nothing about the canons of ethics, would require that. Frankly, no prosecutor who has to answer to anybody would do that. Only a prosecutor who 
   doesn't have to answer to anyone, only a prosecutor who has the taxpayers paying their unlimited bills, would do that. 
   Putting aside the harm to reputation and cost to the defendant and witnesses of bringing unwarranted charges, indictments based on flimsy facts can be dangerous. The Government is barred under our Constitution's double jeopardy clause from bringing a case twice. So a prosecutor has a responsibility to ensure that the Government can prove its case the first time around. There is no opportunity for a second ``bite at the apple.'' 
   One item that Special Prosecutor Smaltz did not put up on his web page was, I thought, one of the most disgusting things I have seen any prosecutor do. It was so bad that apparently, even with his unbridled ego and his lack of intellectual honesty, he did not feel he could bring himself to put it on the web page. That item was: he congratulated his team of well paid prosecutors with gifts of wristwatches. According to the press reports, these watches ``look good, with Smaltz' name around an eagle in the center of the independent counsel seal and the case name, `In re Espy.' '' 
   It is like he was on some big game hunt and these were the trophies. Stupidity one might excuse, and stupidity  was evident here. But this kind of arrogant, egotistical abuse of a public trust nobody can forgive. In fact, I have wondered whether the cost of those gratuities exceeded the costs of the gifts that Mr. Espy was charged with receiving. Watch gifts may not be criminal; I find them certainly offensive. 
   Mr. President, as we go into the debate we will have this year on whether we renew the Office of Independent Counsel--something, I predict, will not be done--let us not aim all our fire at the excesses of Kenneth Starr, or his tactics, or his misstatements of the facts to the Attorney General, or even some of the lies that came out of his office. Let us not focus just on that. Let's look at people like Donald Smaltz, a man who showed what happens when somebody of limited talent, of questionable ethics, of no integrity, how they can act when they are given unbelievable power, unlimited budget; and we in the Congress should ask ourselves whether we want to continue this. 
   The Office of Independent Counsel, when filled with good men and women--and there have been some very good men and women of both parties who have been there--who follow the restraints that prosecutors would normally expect to have, have done a good job. But when it is filled by people who would serve with a sense of self-aggrandizement, it hurts the whole Nation. It hurts an awful lot of innocent people--people found innocent by juries, people found innocent by appellate courts, people whose reputations are besmirched and their bankrolls exhausted by the actions of unconscionable, incompetent, out-of-control persons like this man. 
   Mr. President, I may speak more on this. I have tried to restrain myself in my comments about him today and to give him the benefit of the doubt. I have probably given him the benefit of the doubt more than he deserves. 
   Mr. President, seeing no one else seeking the floor, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there has been some discussion about Y2K and the Y2K liability bill. It seems every  moment I settle down in my office to do other work, I get calls for another meeting on Y2K. I thought it might be good to let my colleagues and the public know what is in the Y2K bill we will be discussing this afternoon. 
   I have a chart; we like charts in this place. This chart shows how simple this bill is not. It illustrates the detours, roadblocks, and dead ends the bill would impose on innocent plaintiffs in our State-based legal system. 
   I have a real-life example so we can see what will happen. A small business owner from Warren, MI, Mark Yarsike, testified before the Commerce and Judiciary Committees about his Y2K problems. A few years ago, he bought a new computer cash register system for his small business, Produce Palace. However, they didn't tell him it wasn't Y2K compliant. This brand-new, high-tech cash register system, which the company was happy to sell him for almost $100,000, kept crashing. 
   The computer cash register system kept breaking down. After more than 200 service calls, it was finally discovered why; it couldn't read credit cards with an expiration date in the year 2000--like the credit card I have in my wallet right now. That is a Y2K computer defect that would be covered under this bill and the company would be protected, not Mark Yarsike. The company that sold him this defective piece of equipment for $100,000 would be protected. 
   At the top of this chart is how the State-based court system works today for Mark Yarsike, whose business buys a new computerized cash register system and, because of a Y2K defect, the system crashes. 
   I will in a moment speak to what happens if we pass this legislation before the Senate. Assume we show some sense and reject the legislation; if Mark Yarsike asks the company to fix the system, if the company knows they have to do something for the owner, they will either agree to fix the problem--which is really what he wants; he doesn't want to sue, he just wants his problem fixed--they agree to fix it and make a quick, fair settlement for his damages. That is it. 
   Or they could fail to fix it, he could go into court, and a trial would decide who is at fault. 
   Now, that is basically what happens today. In fact, that is what happened to Mark Yarsike. He was forced to buy a new computer cash register system from another company. He sued the first company which sold him the computer that wasn't Y2K compliant, that caused him to lose so much business. He recouped his losses through a fair settlement, and the court system worked for him. 
   Now, say ``Joe's'' business--not Mark Yarsike, who went through the normal court process--buys a computer cash register system under the bill before the Senate. Assume we pass this bill, assume the President signs it into law. All of a sudden, instead of this very simple straight line as indicated on the chart, the Congress of the United States is saying: We are from the Government and we are here to help you, we will make life simpler for you. 
   Instead of giving the nice straight line, which is what the law is today, this is what he is presented: first he has to wait 30 days, during which nothing happens; during that time, he still has to turn away business because every customer with a new credit card can't use it, and they will say, to heck with this place, I will go somewhere else. Even if after the 30 days, the company may send a written response and just say that we have another 60 days you will have to wait; if that doesn't put you out of business, then you can also file a lawsuit to recover damages if you are not already out of business anyway. 
   If he files a lawsuit, under the bill's contract preservation provision we get to our first dead end on the road to justice. The cash register company may be able to enforce unconscionable limits on any recovery if it is in a written contract. Under this bill before the Senate, the unconscionable limits in the written contract are strictly enforced unless the enforcement of that term would manifestly and directly contravene State law and statute in effect January 1999 specifically addressing that term. 
   In other words, if the State legislatures had not known by January 1 of this year what the U.S. Congress, in its infinite wisdom, was going to do in May of this year when enacting a statute that specifically anticipated what we might do, Joe is out of luck. 
   If the small business owners can't recover the losses from the Y2K defective cash register system because of this contract preservation provision, then he does have other alternatives: He can go bankrupt; he can fire his employees, lay them off; or if somehow he was able to get past these roadblocks, he could actually file a suit. 
   We have another detour. The company gets another 30-day extension to respond to the complaint. Their business isn't hurting, but Joe is barely able to hang on. When the small business owner files that lawsuit, he has to meet special pleading requirements under this bill. He has to file with complaints specific statements on the defendant's state of mind, the nature of the amount of damage, and the material Y2K defect. So he has three more roadblocks--all of which can lead to this dead end. 
   If he misses any one of those hurdles we have put in his way, he is right back to a dead end. The cash register company can say, bye bye, see you; tough, Joe; we will send you a postcard when you are at the bankruptcy court. 
   Now, suppose the cash register company had sold others of these $100,000 system with a Y2K defect. Should we all join together and bring a class action? No, we come into a new roadblock, back to a dead end, back to bankruptcy again. So let's move on to the next roadblock that is put in the bill--the roadblock we are putting in the way of small businesses. That is something the business lobbyists are not telling the small businesses about, all the roadblocks that are in this special interest legislation. 
   This bill has a ``duty to mitigate'' section that turns traditional tort law on its head. It requires the plaintiff to anticipate and avoid any Y2K damage before it occurs, not after. Almost all the States have adopted the traditional duty to mitigate tort law, which requires the injured party to mitigate his damages once the harm occurs. That makes some sense. But this requires mitigation before the harm occurs. If the owners bought this $100,000 cash register and didn't anticipate that a lot of its customers are going to leave because the cash register does not work as he was told it was going to, how does he mitigate? He wants to run his business. He doesn't make cash registers. He expects them, for $100,000, to do it right. But if he didn't try to mitigate before the system crashed, then he could be caught in another dead end, end of the road here, and right back down to bankruptcy, and employees are out. 
   I do not understand how he could have known his cash register system was not going to be able to read credit cards with the year 2000 expiration date after he paid $100,000 for it, but that doesn't matter. This case would be dismissed because of the bill's duty to mitigate provision. 
   So, roadblock after roadblock--in fact, there is another one. Let's assume somehow Joe is driving a humvee of some sort through the legal system and he is getting it past these roadblocks. He has another one. Because what he does not know is that the Senate has overridden the 50 State legislatures. We have said to the legislators: Boy, you guys are dumb. The men and women in these State legislatures are not as smart as we are. So we are just going to throw your laws out and we will just pass our laws and override you. Because the bill would override State contract law and could even preempt existing implied warranties under State law. 
   For the small business owner, the bill's Federal preemption contract clauses may override the State common law claims of breach of implied warranties. Again, here he is at another roadblock, another dead end leading back to bankruptcy. 
   Then, say he somehow got through all of these roadblocks and dead ends that we put in, basically to make it impossible for a small business owner; everything that we have done to put roadblocks and dead ends in. Let's say he gets through all of them. He still has more limits on his legal rights at the jury verdict point. There are severe limits on recovery. In fact, if it is a small business, then $250,000 is the ceiling for any punitive damages award. If  he can prove they intentionally defrauded him, then there is an exemption from these punitive damage caps. This bill is saying: If you can prove intention to defraud, we might give you a chance. 
   This is a meaningless exception in the real world. Nobody is going to be able to meet this exception, proving the injury was specifically intended. How in the world is our small business owner, who is just trying to keep the place alive at this point, going to prove the cash register company intentionally tried to injure him by selling him a Y2K defective cash register system? Let's get real here. It is not going to happen. Again, the best thing for him is bankruptcy. The big company can breathe a sigh of relief and they are out. 
   And on and on. Severe joint liability limits; for directors and officers, partial immunity; severe caps on recovery--all of 
   these things end up protecting the companies, overriding State laws, and saying to the small business owner we are not going to do anything for you. 
   You know, directors and officers are already protected by the business judgment rule adopted by each of the 50 States. But we put a special legal protection for them in this bill. I think that sends the wrong message to the business community. We want to encourage decision makers to be overseeing aggressive year 2000 compliance measures. Instead, we say: Don't worry, be happy. 
   I want those corporate officers motivated to fix their company's Y2K problems now. After their corporation is Y2K compliant and they have worked with their suppliers and customers and business partners and we have avoided Y2K problems is the time to be happy. 
   A few of these detours, roadblocks and dead ends may be justified to prevent frivolous Y2K litigation. But certainly not all of them. 
   This bill makes seeking justice for the harm caused by a Y2K computer problem into a game of chutes and ladders--but there are only chutes for plaintiffs and no ladders. The defendant wins every time under the rigged rules of this game. 
   Unfortunately, this bill overreaches again and again. It is not close to being balanced. 
   In addition, this bill preempts all 50 state consumer protection laws and makes ordinary consumers face the bill's legal detours, road blocks and dead ends on the road to justice. That is not fair. 
   Today, I filed a consumer protection amendment to exclude ordinary consumers from the legal restrictions in the bill. I hope the majority will permit amendments to be brought up on this legislation soon. 
   I remain open to continuing to work with interested members of the Senate on bipartisan, consensus legislation that would deter frivolous Y2K lawsuits and encourage responsible Y2K compliance. Those of us in Congress who have been active on technology-related issues have struggled mightily, and successfully, to act in a bipartisan way. It would be unfortunate, and it would be harmful to the technology industry, technology users and to all consumers, if that pattern is broken over this bill. 
   I hope Members will look at what we are doing here. Here is the system we have today for Y2K. Here is the system we are suggesting with all these dead ends, all these roadblocks: Roadblock, roadblock, roadblock, roadblock, all leading to small businesses going bankrupt and all because we stand up here and say to 50 State legislatures: You are not smart enough. You are not as smart as we are. We are going to override you. 
   I think that is wrong. I think we ought to go back to the drawing boards. I think we ought to do what we did last year when we passed good Y2K legislation because we did it in a bipartisan fashion where we had businesses, Members of Congress, lawyers, those in the high-tech field--we came together and passed legislation that worked and the President signed it into law. 
   This maze, this unnecessary trampling of State legislatures, will not be signed into law by the President of the United States.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to continue my support for dairy farmers by introducing legislation which will make permanent the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact and will authorize the Southern Interstate Dairy Compact. 
   The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has proven itself to be a successful and enduring partnership between dairy farmers and consumers throughout New England, and we want to make sure that this partnership continues. 
   The Northeast Dairy Compact has done exactly what it was established to do: stabilize fluctuating dairy prices and keep New England dairy farmers in business. The Compact provides the perfect safety net for dairy farmers. When milk prices are high, dairy farmers receive no benefits. When milk prices are low, the Compact takes effect, providing temporary benefits to dairy farmers. Yet the Compact costs taxpayers nothing. I don't need to tell you that a zero cost is very unusual among farm programs. 
   The Compact makes a big difference in the lives of dairy farmers in New England. Since the Compact went into effect one and a half years ago, the attrition rate for farms has declined throughout New England. In fact, the Vermont Department of Agriculture recently announced that since July of last year, there has actually been an increase in farms in Vermont. Just a few years ago, an increase in the number of farms would have been unfathomable. Solid dairy prices coupled with the safety net of the Dairy Compact have caused a rebound in the dairy industry in New England. We can achieve similar success in the South with a Southern Dairy Compact. 
   Many of our allies from the South have watched the Northeast Dairy Compact survive several legal and political challenges. They have watched milk sales continue without interruption. They have seen the participation in the WIC nutrition program rise because of help from the compact. And, most important, they see how the compact provides a modest but crucial safety net for struggling farmers. They, too, want the same for their farmers and their farmers deserve the opportunity to create their own regional compact. 
   Compacts are state-initiated, state-ratified and state-supported voluntary programs. And the need for regional compacts has never been greater. Low dairy prices coupled with a disastrous decision on federal milk marketing reform have made the compact more important to us now than ever before. Our legislation is a huge step toward ensuring that the safety net of the Compact will continue. 
   The fight to continue the Northeast Compact and create the Southern Compact, however, will be tough. Opponents of regional compacts--large and wealthy milk manufacturers, represented by groups such as the International Dairy Foods Association--will again throw millions of dollars into an all-out campaign to stop the compacts. And they will say anything to stop it. 
   Some of the most common anti-Compact rhetoric that I have heard suggests that the Compact creates a barrier for trade between states within the Compact and states outside of it. On the contrary, as reported by the Office of Management and Budget, the Northeast Dairy Compact has in fact prompted an increase in interstate dairy sales--particularly for milk coming into New England. 
   Another common anti-Compact argument concerns the impact of the Compact on consumers. However, New England retail milk prices under the Dairy Compact continue to be lower on average than the rest of the nation. 
   Processor groups who are opposed to dairy compacts simply want milk as cheap as they can get it to boost their enormous profits to record levels, regardless of the impact on farmers. But at some point if a lot of dairy farmers go out of business, IDFA and others might regret what they have caused. 
   Make no mistake--I do believe that dairy processors deserve to make their fair share of income. However, the farmers that produce the milk deserve to make a fair living. And a fair living is what dairy compacts provide for farmers. 
   Compacts have been consumer tested and farmer approved, and I look forward to making them a permanent part of our dairy industry.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to commend Commerce Secretary William Daley, acting Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks Q. Todd Dickinson, and the U.S. Department of Commerce for their hard work and dedication in establishing the new Patent and Trademark Office Internet database. This online database truly reinvents how the government does business and how business innovation can flourish with government's help. This database will help erode some of the traditional barriers that have hindered business innovation in small, rural states like Vermont. 
   As an avid Internet user, I have long advocated a transition to an online database for trademarks and patents. The prior painstaking process of searching existing patents and trademarks was a time-consuming frustration for inventors. Last Congress I co-authored an amendment to the Omnibus Patent Act of 1997, which would have required the creation of computer networks to provide electronic access to patent information. I am proud that the database unveiled today achieves the goal of universal electronic access to trademarks and patents.  
   This new system of instant on-line access to the entire patent application--including the drawings--will greatly promote innovation and technology by showing researchers what the current science is. With this new database, there are now more than two million complete patents on-line dating back to 1976 and 1 million trademarks dating back to 1870. 
   This patent and trademark database could not have come at a better time. In the last 2 years, patent applications have increased by 25 percent and trademark applications have increased by 16 percent. In 1998, the Patent and Trademark Office received over a quarter of a million applications for patents alone, and they issued more than 150,000 patents. 
   Advancements in medicine, information technology, pharmaceuticals, transportation, environmental protection, manufacturing, agriculture, entertainment and countless other areas of science depend on patents. New investions build on exisitng science, and existing science will now be available to anyone with Internet access--whether they live in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont or Nome, Alaska or Silicon Valley, California. 
   This free Internet access changes the dynamic for American independent inventors and for corporate giants. Citizens who simply want to learn more by browsing the Web, students doing school projects, independent inventors and corporate research departments now can search this vast database. I have supported this development for several years and am delighted that it is fully up and running.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the sweeping terms of the bill before us are not justified. Senator MCCAIN's substitute, like the underlying bill, unfortunately, remains a wish list for special interests that are or might become involved in Y2K litigation. The broad liability limitations in the legislation risk rewarding irresponsible parties at the expense of the responsible and the innocent. That is not fair or responsible. 
   I cannot support such one-sided legislation that restricts the rights of American consumers, small business owners and family farmers who seek redress for harms caused by Year 2000 computer problems. 
   I remain open to continuing to work with interested members of the Senate on bipartisan, consensus legislation that would deter frivolous Y2K lawsuits and encourage responsible Y2K compliance. In my judgment, today's bill would more likely have the opposite effect. It proposes sweeping liability protection that will encourage more Y2K litigation and discourage curing Y2K problems. 
   The right approach is to fix as many of these problems ahead of time as we can. Ultimately, the best defense against any Y2K-based lawsuit is to be Y2K compliant. 
   Let me offer a few examples how this bill would restructure the laws of the 50 states and cause great harm to the nationwide effort to fix our Y2K computer problems in 1999. 
   First, this bill provides special liability protection to directors and officers of companies involved in Y2K disputes. Why are we doing this? Directors and officers are already protected by the business judgment rule, which has been adopted by each of the 50 states. How will this special legal protection for corporate directors and officers affect the well-established precedents interpreting the business judgment rule in our states? 
   Moreover, every director and officer of a corporation has standard insurance coverage to protect him or her from personal liability in the course of their duties. Will insurance companies reap windfall profits from this special legal protection for corporate directors and officers? Or should insurance companies rebate the premiums they have charged for existing insurance coverage for corporate directors or officers because it might be superfluous now? Who knows? But these questions will be hot spots for future litigation if this bill becomes law. 
   Providing special Y2K liability protection to the key decision makers in a company at this juncture sends the wrong message to the business community. 
   We want to encourage these key decision makers to be overseeing aggressive year 2000 compliance measures. Instead, this bill says to corporate officers and directors: ``Don't worry, be happy.'' 
   I want those corporate officers motivated to fix their company's Y2K problems now. After their corporation is Y2K compliant and they have worked with their suppliers and customers and business partners and we have avoided Y2K problems is the time to be happy. 
   Second, this bill caps punitive damages to 3 times the amount of compensatory damages or $250,000, whichever is greater. If the defendant is a small business, then $250,000 is the ceiling for any punitive damage award. 
   These punitive damages caps again send the wrong message to the business community by protecting the bad actor, instead of rewarding the responsible business owner. 
   The bill contains an exception to these punitive damages caps if a plaintiff can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant intentionally defrauded the plaintiff. This exception will prove meaningless in the real world because no one will be able to meet this high and specific standard for proving the injury was specifically intended. How in the world is a plaintiff going to prove some intentionally tried to injury him or her in a Y2K case? Get real. 
   Punitive damages are awarded only in cases of outrageous conduct. If a business takes responsible steps to become Y2K compliant, it will not be subject to punitive damages. These caps on punitive damages, like many other parts of the bill, discourage responsible Y2K remediation efforts. 
   Indeed, by limiting punitive damage to a dollar figure, $250,000, these special legal protections may encourage some companies to analyze the costs and potential risks of Y2K noncompliance and make the calculated business decision not to make the investment needed to come into compliance. The same type of calculation, for example, apparently made by Ford in the exploding Pinto gas tank case. 
   A cost-benefit approach does not fix a corporation's Y2K problems, but only leads to more litigation. Litigation with punitive damages caps may, in the judgment of the company's accountants, be worth enduring if it costs less than Y2K compliance. 
   Third, the bill severely restricts the amount of damages that an innocent plaintiff can recover from a guilty defendant by abolishing joint and several liability in most cases. The exceptions to this proportionate liability are so complex that they invited more litigation, not less. 
   This proportionate liability may unfairly penalize innocent consumers and small businesses and reward irresponsible companies. 
   For example, a small business forced to shut down temporarily because of a Y2K computer malfunction may not be able to recoup all of its losses under proportionate liability if it fails to identify all the responsible parties that caused that Y2K problem. As a result, that small business may be forced to file for bankruptcy because of its limited resources. Why is the innocent small business owner, who may not know and should not know all the responsible parties in the manufacturing chain of a non Y2K compliant product, forced to go out of business? 
   Moreover, this bill's many federal preemptions of state contract and tort law are all one-sided. The bill's provisions benefit only defendants, not plaintiffs, in Y2K disputes. 
   The bill raises the standards of proof from a preponderance test to a clear and convincing test for plaintiffs to prove negligence and other torts claims without any corresponding responsibility on defendants. The bill adds new state of mind requirements on plaintiffs to prove tort claims without any corresponding responsibility on defendants. 
   The bill also greatly expands the jurisdiction of the federal courts to consider Y2K cases under its class action provisions--an approach soundly rejected last month by Chief Justice Rehnquist and the Judicial Conference. The Judicial Conference found that shifting Y2K cases from state courts ``holds the potential for overwhelming the federal courts, resulting in substantial costs and delays.''

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are all grieving again for victims of school violence. Pearl High School in Pearl, MS; Heath High School in West Paducah, KY; Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, AR; Parker Middle School in Edinboro, PA; Lincoln County High School in Fayetteville, TN; Thurston High School in Springfield, OR; and Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. 
   The President spoke for all Americans Tuesday night when he expressed the shock and sadness of the Nation. He spoke about reaching out to our children and our prayers for the families of those who have suffered loss. 
   I heard Senator KENNEDY reach out to the families yesterday from the Senate floor. I commend Senator DASCHLE also for his thoughtful statement. I know other Senators from both sides of the aisle have spoken to this tragedy, as well. 
   This morning, my wife and I watched on television one of the most painful and difficult interviews I have ever watched. The father of a young African American boy killed in Colorado spoke of his hopes and dreams for his son. Sitting next to him was another student, who is white and who recounted how his classmate and friend, an African American, had died, how he had been selected because he was black and because he was an athlete. To compound the tragedy, the young man who had spoken also recounted the fact that his own sister died in the shooting. It ended with the African American father holding the hand of the  young student, each trying to comfort the other, each seeking solace in their faith, but each at a loss, as we are, to what might have caused this terrible, terrible event. 
   How could students be picked out to be murdered because they were athletes, or because of the color of their skin, or because they happened to be wearing a certain kind of clothes? What kind of nihilistic aberration causes something like this to happen? What causes a person to do that? What causes the kind of behavior around the world where people die because of their faith, because of their color, because of who they are, their ethnic background? 
   I suggest the Senate pause for a moment in the wake of this tragedy and rededicate ourselves to the work ahead and turn our attention to these matters. 
   I serve on the Judiciary Committee and we spent a lot of time this week and this past year on a proposed flag amendment to the Constitution. We spent a lot more time on that than we have on school violence. We held three hearings on a proposed constitutional amendment within the last year. We have held none on the tragic school incidents that have occurred throughout the country. We ought to reconsider the agenda of that committee, maybe even of the Senate. 
   We have become so polarized and so politicized in this Senate--more than I have seen at any time in my 25 years here. We do no good to the country, Republican or Democrat, if we allow that to continue. We ignore the real problems of this Nation when we allow that. 
   We are going to devote our time in the Senate to an artificially truncated debate of proposals to limit corporate liability for Y2K problems because the business lobby wants us to do that. Yet we cannot have a full debate on the needs for a real Patients' Bill of Rights, something that would affect not a special interest group, but every single American. 
   The Senate will turn to a bankruptcy bill to help financial institutions extract additional payments from consumers forced into bankruptcy instead of considering a much needed increase in the minimum wage. 
   The majority leader has indicated that we will be debated on the proposed constitutional amendment to cut back on the first amendment for the first time in our history to make a symbolic statement against flag burning, because that will be popular. Mr. President, no flags were burned at Columbine High School earlier this week, but children and a teacher died at Columbine High School. That is the reality. 
   We should start applying ourselves to substance and not symbols in the Senate. Let the reality get past the rhetoric. We all need to redouble our efforts to find ways to help parents and State and local authorities on matters of school safety. We need to redouble our efforts to help local law enforcement keep our streets safe. After 3 years in which we have missed opportunity after opportunity to cooperate in a bipartisan way on these matters, it is long past time to put partisanship aside and work together with the administration to make progress in prevention and 
   security that remains so desperately needed. 
   We are all Americans in this--not Republicans and Democrats. Let's set partisanship aside for a change. How many Senators, as parents, worry when our children go to school? How many of the staff and the visitors in our galleries have children who go to school and now are terrified and worried and are almost afraid to hear the phone ring? 
   We all know the Federal Government and Federal law cannot solve the problem of school violence or local crime, but we should at least help or make help available. I know the Federal Government has been providing assistance in Littleton; victims services and counselors are being provided. I am proud of the efforts that have been made by the Office for Victims of Crime in coordination with States and local assistance providers. A special reserve fund from my 1996 amendment to the Victims of Crime Act is available to help. These are concrete initiatives, not symbolic things. 
   I want to praise President Clinton for having convened the October 1998 White House Conference on School Safety, and those people, Republicans and Democrats alike, who joined with him. We are working with him to provide additional community police and school resource officers across the country. In addition, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Education, and the Surgeon General are all working on additional initiatives. 
   Over the last several years, I have sponsored legislation in this area with Senator BIDEN, Senator KENNEDY, Senator DASCHLE, Senator BINGAMAN and a number of others. A lot of that legislation has never even been considered in our committee, although we were able to incorporate pieces of it in measures that have been enacted. We reintroduced, again, on the first legislative day of the session one of the Democratic priorities, S. 9, the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1999, which builds on the successful programs we implemented in the 1994 crime law, but also addresses emerging crime problems. 
   It is a comprehensive and realistic bill. We tried to avoid the easy rhetoric about crime that some have to offer in this crucial area. Instead, we put in legislation that might make a difference. The Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act targets violent crime in our schools, it reforms the juvenile justice system, combats gang violence, cracks down on the sale and use of illegal drugs, enhances the rights of crime victims, and provides meaningful assistance to law enforcement officers. 
   Title I deals with proposals for combating violence in the schools and punishing juvenile crime. It gives technical assistance to the schools, reforms the juvenile justice system, and assists States for prosecuting juvenile offenders, but it also protects children from violence, including violence from the misuse of guns. 
   It includes Senator BINGAMAN's proposal for a School Security Technology Center, an inventive proposal building upon expertise from the Sandia National Labs. There are a lot of very real things in it. 
   It is short on rhetoric. It is strong on reality. This is a law that could work. It could be done without federalizing juvenile offenses. It follows what many from the Chief Justice on through have said is important. 
   Our bill contains important initiatives to protect children from violence, including violence resulting from the misuse of guns. Americans want concrete proposals to reduce the risk of such incidents recurring. At the same time, we must preserve adults' rights to use guns for legitimate purposes, such as home protection, hunting and for sport. The bill imposes a prospective gun ban for juveniles convicted or adjudicated delinquent for violent crimes. It also require revocation of a firearms dealer's license for failing to have secure gun storage or safety devices available for sale with firearms. The bill enhances the penalty for the violation of certain firearm laws involving juveniles. In addition, the bill authorizes competitive grant programs for the establishment of juvenile gun courts and youth violence courts. 
   The bill would also make important reforms to the federal juvenile system, without federalizing run-of-the-mill juvenile offenses or ignoring the traditional prerogative of the States to handle the bulk of juvenile crime. One of the significant flaws in the Republican juvenile crime bills last year was that it would have--in the words of Chief Justice Rehnquist--``eviscerate[d] this traditional deference to state prosecutions, thereby increasing substantially the potential workload of the federal judiciary.'' The Chief Justice has repeatedly raised concerns about ``federalizing'' more crimes. The Democratic proposals for reform of the Federal juvenile justice system heed this sound advice and respect our Federal system. 
   Our bill authorizes grants to the States for incarcerating violent and chronic juvenile offenders (with each qualifying State getting at least one percent of available funds), and provides graduated sanctions, reimburses States for the cost of incarcerating juvenile alien offenders, and establishes a pilot program to replicate successful juvenile crime reduction strategies. 
   Also directly relevant is Title IV of the bill, which includes a number of prevention programs that are critical to further reducing juvenile crime. These programs include grants to  youth organizations and ``Say No to Drugs'' Community Centers, as well as reauthorization of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, Anti-Drug Abuse Programs and Local Delinquency Prevention Programs. Additional sections include a program to establish a competitive grant program to reduce truancy, with priority given to efforts to replicate successful programs. 
   The bill would also reauthorize the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) in a similar fashion to H.R. 1818, a bill passed by the House with strong bipartisan support in the last Congress. This section creates a new juvenile justice block grant program and retains the four core protections for youth in the juvenile justice system, while adopting greater flexibility for rural areas. 
   Last year, the Senate Republicans tried to gut these core protections in their juvenile crime bill, S. 10. This Democratic crime bill puts ideology aside, and follows the advice of numerous child advocacy experts--including the Children's Defense Fund, National Collaboration for Youth, Youth Law Center and National Network for Youth--who believe these key protections must be preserved in order to protect juveniles who have been arrested or detained. These core protections ensure that juveniles are not housed with adults, do not have verbal or physical contact with adult inmates, and any disproportionate confinement of minority youth is addressed by the States. If these protections are abolished, many more youth may end up committing suicide or being released with serious physical or emotional scars. 
   I previously described the other titles, programs and initiatives of the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act when we introduced it. It is a comprehensive and realistic set of proposals for keeping our schools safe, our streets safe, our citizens safe when they go abroad, and our borders secure. I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis for passage of as much of this bill as possible during the 106th Congress and to working with the Administration, with the Department of Justice and with the Department of Education to do what we can to be helpful in the continuing school safety crisis. 
   Why I am here today is to join with the Democratic leader in his call for a ``thoughtful discussion about how to shape a comprehensive national response to the problem of violence in our schools and in our communities.'' I commend him for including the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act on the priority list that he sent to the majority leader on Monday. 
   From a personal observation, I recall one time when my children were young, they were in grade school, and I was a prosecutor. Without going into all of the details, a very credible threat was made against me and my family. In fact, one that, had the person been able to carry it out before being apprehended, all of us would have died. I recall during that time, when the police were coming to me and saying, we will set up this cordon of armed police officers around you, my only concern, and the natural concern of any parent, was for my children; I recall even today the terror I felt in my heart and soul. 
   I remember today, almost 30 years later, how I felt until I knew they were safe. They were young children. They saw the police officers coming to school to pick them up and for them it was a lark, they were getting out of school early. For their mother and me, it was a matter of some great concern. 
   Think how parents around this country feel today when they kiss their children goodbye in the morning, and virtually all of them will come back safely, but every parent has to have in his or her soul the thought, what if they don't come back? How does a parent live through this? How do the other students ever go back to a school where this has happened? What about our young people themselves, when they read about this or see this and wonder are they next? 
   There are two areas of great violence in the world today. One we see unfolding in the former Yugoslavia, where the United States and our NATO allies are trying to stop a person who is exercising war crimes that we have not seen in that part of the world since the time of Hitler. We see the people who are suffering there. Yet some respond by seeing who can get out the best sound. 
   Then we see this in Mississippi, Kentucky, Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Oregon and Colorado--enough variety of States to tell every one of us that our own State and our own community is not immune. 
   We are still tempted to dwell on symbols. Symbols do not stop this; substance does. It is not symbolic to set up programs that we know will work, that will allow teachers and parents and police and others to work with students to stop something from happening. That is the key. It is not to respond afterward--and we will respond. We are sending out counselors and investigators and everybody else to Colorado now. How much better, though, if we could respond before it happens. 
   So I ask Senators when they go home this weekend, pause and think: Do we help solve the problems of Littleton, CO, or the problems of Kosovo, or the problems that face our great Nation, by continuing heavy, destructive, unnecessarily partisan actions in the Senate and in the other body? Or do we come back together, as we have so many times in the past, Republicans and Democrats alike, admit the United States faces many crises and that we solve them only by working together, not in seeking short-term political gain? 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would ensure that veterans of the United States Armed Forces are not summarily deported from this country. This bill would correct a grave injustice wrought by the recent changes in immigration policy, which has resulted in decorated war veterans being deported without any administrative or judicial consideration of the equities. 
   Under the immigration ``reform'' legislation enacted in 1996, Congress passed and the President endorsed a broad expansion of the definition of what makes a legal resident deportable. In the rush to be the toughest on illegal immigration, the bill also vastly limited relief from deportation and imposed mandatory detention for thousands of permanent residents in deportation proceedings. 
   The zealousness of Congress and the White House to be tough on aliens has successfully snared permanent residents who have spilled their blood for our country. As the INS prepares to deport these American veterans, we have not even been kind enough to thank them for their service with a hearing to listen to their story and consider whether, just possibly, their military service or other life circumstances outweighs the government's interest in deporting them. 
   Here is the cold and ugly side of our ``tough'' immigration policies. Here are the human consequences of legislating by 30-second political ad. Unfortunately the checks and balances of our government have failed these veterans because Congress and this Administration are determined not to be outdone by each other. ``Tough'' in this case means blinding ourselves to the personal consequences of these people. It means substituting discretion with a cold rubber stamp that can only say ``no.'' 
   Our national policy on deportation of veterans is particularly outrageous at a time when we are sending tens of thousands of U.S. servicemen and women, including untold numbers of permanent residents, into harms way. Why has Congress asked the INS to devote its limited resources to hunting down non-citizens who previously answered this country's call to duty, some of whom were permanently disabled in the course of their service? 
   Interestingly, it appears that even the INS agrees that military service or other life circumstances may, on occasion, outweigh the government's interest in deportation. In one recent case, which I brought to the attention of INS Commissioner Meissner, the INS eventually reached this conclusion. I am honored if my intervention played a part in obtaining some semblance of justice for Sergeant Rafael Ramirez and his family. However, Sergeant Ramirez's example confirms the need to ensure that every veteran's case is carefully reviewed by an immigration judge empowered to do justice. 
   The legislation that I introduce today restores for veterans the opportunity to go before an immigration judge to present the equities of their case and to have a Federal court review any deportation decision. It also provides veterans with an opportunity to be released from detention while their case is under consideration. 
   The injustice addressed by this bill is just one egregious example of how recent immigration ``reform'' has resulted in the break-up of American families and the deportation of people who have contributed to our country. This Congress needs to address the broader injustices that our prior one-upmanship caused. In the meantime, this bill is an important step in the right direction.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, concern over privacy is reaching an all time high. In 1978, 64 percent of Americans reported that they were ``very concerned'' or ``somewhat concerned'' about threats to their personal privacy. By 1998, this number had skyrocketed. According to the Center for Social and Legal Research, 88 percent of Americans reported being ``very'' or ``somewhat concerned'' about threats to their personal privacy. We in Congress must take this concern seriously, and in this regard I look forward to examining the privacy issues confronting us in hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
   Good privacy policies make good business policies. New technologies bring with them new opportunities, both for the businesses that develop and market them, and for consumers. It does not do anyone any good for consumers to hesitate to use any particular technology because they have concerns over privacy. That is why I believe that good privacy policies make good business policies. 
   Protecting privacy plays an important role in the exercise of First Amendment rights. Ensuring that we have adequate privacy laws has a more significant and important role in our democracy than just fostering hi-tech businesses, however. We also must defend our on-line free speech rights from heavy-handed content regulation. That was my purpose in voting against the unconstitutional Communications Decency Act that became law in 1996. 
   Stopping efforts to create government censors is critical to allow our First Amendment rights to flourish, but it is not enough. For people to feel comfortable in exercising their First Amendment rights--by speaking, traveling and associating freely online or in physical space--they must be able to keep their activities confidential and private. When Big Brother is watching, the exercise of First Amendment rights is chilled no less than the threat of a government censor. 
   It is therefore not surprising that our country has a long and honorable tradition of keeping our identities private when we exercise our First Amendment rights. The Federalist Papers, which is probably the most important political document ever written about our Constitution, was authored anonymously by James Madison, John Jay and Alexander Hamilton and published under a pseudonym. 
   Healthy advocacy and debate often rests on the ability of participants to keep their identities private and to act anonymously. Indeed, the Supreme Court has said, ``Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority.'' 
   Healthy commerce also depends on satisfying consumers' desire to keep their business affairs private and secure. A report I released last month on Vermont Internet commerce is very telling on this point. The strongest obstacle among consumers from shopping and doing business online was their fear of the online security risks. This is why promoting the use of encryption is so important, so that businesses and consumers can use this technology to provide the privacy and security they want and best suits their needs. 
   The legislation I introduce today would help ensure that Americans' Fourth Amendment rights to be secure  in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable government searches and seizures are given ample protection in a networked computer environment. In addition, several provisions address the concern Americans have about the use and handling of their personally identifiable records and information by businesses, satellite carriers, libraries and book sellers. 
   Industry self-regulation efforts should be encouraged. In contrast to a citizen's relationship with his or her government, consumers have a choice of whether they want to deal or interact with those in the private sector. In my view, this choice should be generally recognized in the law by allowing consumers and businesses in the marketplace to set the terms of their interaction. This is an area where the Congress should tread cautiously before regulating. Online businesses are engaging in serious efforts to make available to consumers information on privacy policies so that consumers are able to make more educated choices on whether they want to deal. I commend and applaud those efforts. 
   That being said, however, current laws do not apply privacy principles in an even-handed manner. Video rental stores and cable operators are subject to privacy laws to protect our right to keep our viewing habits private, but no protections exist for the books we borrow from the library or buy from a bookstore, or the shows we watch via satellite. This bill would provide more uniform privacy protection for both books and videos, no matter the medium of delivery. 
   Similarly, telephone companies and cable operators are subject to legal restrictions on how they may use personally identifiable 
   information about their Internet subscribers, while other Internet and online service providers are not. The E-RIGHTS bill promotes a more level playing field in terms of the privacy protections available to Internet users, no matter whether they obtain their Internet access from AOL, their cable company or their local phone company. 
   This legislation addresses a broad range of emerging hi-tech privacy issues. For example: 
   When should the FBI be allowed to use cell phones to track a user's movements? 
   Should Kosovo human rights organizations that use a Web site to correct government misinformation be able to get a domain name without having their names publicly available on a database? Should we have the same ability to get an ``unlisted'' domain name (or Internet address) as we are able to get an ``unlisted'' phone number? 
   Should we allow other federal prosecutors to act like Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr and go on fishing expeditions with subpoenas issued to bookstores to find out what we are reading? Should we protect our choices of reading and viewing materials the same way we protect our choice of videotapes that we rent from our local Blockbuster? 
   Should an Internet user who maintains a calendar on Yahoo! get the same privacy protection as people who keep their calendars on their desk or on their PCs' hard-drive? Will people avoid certain network services offered by Netscape or new Internet start-ups because they get less privacy protection for the information stored on the network than on their own PCs? 
   These are all important issues, and I have worked to propose solutions to each of these and to other questions, as well, in the E-RIGHTS bill. This bill has the following four titles: 
   Title I: Privacy Protection for Communications and Electronic Information. This title has ten sections that propose certain Fourth Amendment protections to guide the government's access to, or exercise of, law enforcement's enhanced surveillance capabilities due to new technologies. In addition, this title also contains sections that limit how domain name registrars and Internet/Online service providers may use information collected on Internet users. 
   Network Stored Information.--The bill would require that law enforcement give a subscriber notice of a subpoena or warrant before seizing electronic information stored on a network service. This is the same notice that the subscriber would get if the information were stored on his or her own computer. 
   Cell Phone Location Information.--Before law enforcement may use a person's cell phone as a tracking device, the bill would require a court order based on probable cause that the person is committing a crime. 
   A related provision that has already passed the House in February as part of the ``Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999,'' H.R. 438, would require wireless phone providers to inform a cell phone user's family and emergency services of their location in emergency situations, while requiring the prior customer consent before that location information may be used for any other purpose. 
   Pen Registers.--The bill would authorize a judge to review information presented by a federal prosecutor to determine whether the pen register is likely to produce information relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation, since under current law the judge plays only a ministerial role and must approve any order upon presentation by a prosecutor. Current law compels judges to be only a rubber stamp. 
   Conference Calls.--The FBI has claimed that the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) requires that they be given the capability to monitor conference calls which continue even after the target of a wiretap order has dropped out of the call. This provision would require that a court authorize such continued monitoring of conference calls in the absence of the target. 
   Roving Wiretaps.--A substantial change that provides easier access to roving wiretaps was inserted without debate or hearings into last year's Intelligence Authorization Act. With this change, the FBI is able to get a roving wiretap whenever a person's action could have the effect of thwarting interception. The bill would rectify this change to permit roving wiretaps only when the person actually changes phones in a way which has the effect of thwarting surveillance. 
   Domain Name Registrars.--Internet users or businesses who get an Internet address with a second level domain name must also provide information about contact names, physical and E-mail addresses, network location, and other information that is posted 
   in a publicly available database called WHOIS. The bill would give users registering for a domain name/Internet address authority to prohibit disclosure of the information, and keep the information confidential. Of course, the registrar would be able to override the user's choice of confidentiality and to disclose the information as necessary to provide service or in response to a subpoena or court order. 
   Internet users who want an ``unlisted'' Internet address just as they have the choice of getting an ``unlisted'' telephone number will be able to do so. 
   Internet and Online Service Providers.--The 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) set up procedures for law enforcement to obtain records about subscribers from ``electronic communication service providers'', but contained a blanket exemption allowing such providers to disclose a record or other information pertaining to a subscriber or customer to any non-governmental entity. Due to this exemption, ISPs and OSPs may sell their subscriber lists or track the online movements of their subscribers and sell that information--all without the subscribers' knowledge or consent. 
   The bill would cut back on this blanket exemption. The bill would require electronic communication service providers to give their subscribers an opportunity to prohibit disclosure of their personal information, and enumerates the situations in which the information may be used or disclosed without the subscriber's approval. These proposed rules are generally analogous to restrictions already in place for other providers of Internet services, including cable operators and phone companies, which are restricted in how they may use personally identifiable information about customers without the customers' approval. 
   No criminal penalties attach for violation. ECPA currently authorizes an aggrieved person to bring a civil action. 
   Title II: Promoting the Use of Encryption. This title contains three sections: (1) prohibiting domestic controls on encryption and government-  compelled key escrow encryption; (2) requiring encryption products used by federal agencies to interoperate with commercial encryption products; and (3) adding a chapter to the federal criminal code detailing procedures to law enforcement and foreign government access to decryption assistance. 
   Specifically, the bill would require the release of decryption keys or assistance to law enforcement in response to a court order based upon a finding that the key or assistance is necessary to decrypt lawfully intercepted encrypted messages or data. 
   Title III: Privacy Protection for Library Loan and Book Sales Records. This title would extend the privacy protection in current law for video rental and sale records to library loan and book sale records. 
   Library.--The library provisions are a reprise of sections that were dropped from the Video Privacy Protection Act enacted in 1988. This provision would prohibit libraries from disclosing personally identifiable information about patrons without the written consent of the patron or in response to a court order to release the information to a law enforcement agency, with prior notice to the patron, if there is probable cause to believe a crime is being committed and the information sought is material to the investigation. 
   Booksellers.--The public outcry over Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's subpoena in March 1988 to Kramerbooks & Afterwords for any books purchased by Monica Lewinsky, and the potential threat such government fishing expeditions pose to First Amendment rights, prompted examination of the privacy rules protecting the records maintained by bookstores. There are no rules barring book sellers from disclosing records about their customers. 
   This section would impose the same nondisclosure rules on booksellers--whether online or in physical spaces--that apply to video rental stores. Generally, book sellers would be barred from disclosing personally identifiable information concerning a book purchaser without that purchasers' written consent given at the time the disclosure is sought. 
   Title IV: Privacy Protection for Satellite Home Viewers. In the 1984 Cable Act, Congress established a nationwide standard for the privacy protection of cable subscribers. Since the Cable Act was adopted, an entirely new form of access to television has emerged--home satellite viewing--which is especially popular in rural areas not served by cable. Yet there is no statutory privacy protection for information collected by home satellite viewing services about their customers or subscribers. This title fills this gap by amending the privacy provisions of the Cable Act to cover home satellite viewing. 
   The amendments do not change the rules governing access to cable subscriber information. Instead, they merely add the words ``satellite home viewing service'' and ``satellite carrier or distributor'' where appropriate. 
   The amendment does not address another inconsistency in the law, which bears mentioning: should a cable company that provides Internet services to its customers be subject to the privacy safeguards in the Cable Act or in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), which normally applies to Internet service providers and contains obligations regarding the disclosure of personally identifiable information to both governmental and nongovernmental entities different from those in the Cable Act? One court has described this as a ``statutory riddle raised by the entrance of cable operators into the Internet services market.'' 
   New technologies and new uses for old technologies pose challenging ``riddles'' for privacy, but they are solvable in ways that balance competing commerce, civil rights, and law enforcement interests. The E-RIGHTS bill proposes balanced solutions that protect our privacy rights. I invite others to share their ideas on these matters. There are few matters more important than privacy in maintaining our core democratic values, so I look forward to hearing their comments on ways to improve this legislation.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would clarify the professional standards that apply to federal prosecutors and identify who has the authority to set those standards. These are two questions that have cried out for answers for years, and created enormous tension between the Justice Department and virtually everyone else. 
   The Citizen's Protection Act, which is also known as the ``McDade law,'' was passed last year to address these important questions. This new law was intended to make clear that a State -- not the Attorney General--has the authority to make rules of conduct for attorneys practicing before courts of that State. Rather than resolve the long-standing tensions over this issue, the new law has only exacerbated them. At a hearing before a Judiciary Subcommittee last month, a number of law enforcement officials lined up to criticize the new law. 
   The Justice Department aggressively but unsuccessfully opposed passage of the McDade law last year in favor of continued reliance on controversial Justice Department regulations issued in 1994--regulations which allow contacts with represented persons and parties in certain circumstances, even if such contacts are at odds with state or local ethics rules. 
   Independent Counsel. The debate over the professional standards that apply to federal prosecutors comes at a time of heightened public concern over the high-profile investigations and prosecutions conducted by independent counsels. Special prosecutors Kenneth Starr and Donald Smaltz are the ``poster boys'' for unaccountable federal prosecutors. They even have their own Web sites to promote their work. By law, these special prosecutors are subject to the ethical guidelines and policies of the Department of Justice, and all of them claim to have conducted their investigations and prosecutions in conformity with Departmental policies. Yet, in practice, even the Department has conceded in its March 1999 responses to my written questions in connection with a July 1998 oversight hearing that ``in general, the Department avoids commenting in any way on how an independent counsel conducts his or her investigation.'' 
   I am not alone in my concerns about the tactics of these special prosecutors and, specifically, requiring a mother to testify about her daughter's intimate relationships, requiring a bookstore to disclose all the books a person may have purchased, and breaching the longstanding understanding of the relationship of trust between the Secret Service and those it protects. I was appalled to hear a federal prosecutor excuse a flimsy prosecution by announcing after the defendant's acquittal that just getting the indictment was a great deterrent. Trophy watches and television talk show puffery should not be the trappings of prosecutors. 
   One of the core complaints the Justice Department has against the McDade law is that federal prosecutors would be subject to restrictive State ethics rules regarding contacts with represented persons. Yet a letter to The Washington Post from the former Chairman of the ABA ethics committee pointed out: 
   ``[Anti-contact rules are] designed to protect individuals like Monica Lewinsky, who have hired counsel and are entitled to have all contacts with law enforcement officials go through their counsel. As Ms. Lewinsky learned, dealing directly with law enforcement officials can be intimidating and scary, despite the fact that those inquisitors later claimed it was okay for her to leave at any time.'' 
   The McDade Law. This is not to say that the McDade law is the answer. This new law is not a model of clarity. It subjects federal prosecutors to the ``State laws and rules'' governing attorneys where the prosecutor engages in his or her duties. A broad reading of this provision would seem to turn the Supremacy Clause on its head. Does the reference to ``State laws'' mean that federal prosecutors must comply with state laws requiring the consent of all parties before a conversation is recorded, or state laws restricting the use of wiretaps? Furthermore, by referencing only the rules of the state in which the prosecutor is practicing, does the new law remove the traditional authority of a licensing state to discipline a prosecutor in favor of the state in which the prosecutor is  practicing? The new law subjects federal prosecutors not only to the laws and rules of the state in which the attorney is practicing, but also to ``local Federal court rules.'' What is a federal prosecutor supposed to do if the state rules and local federal court rules conflict? Finally, the new law does not address the possibility of a uniform federal rule or set of rules governing attorney conduct in and before the federal courts. Would this oversight inadvertently interfere with the Supreme Court's existing authority to prescribe such rules under the Rules Enabling Act? 
   These are all significant questions and the lack of clear answers is a significant source of the concern expressed by law enforcement over implementation of the McDade law.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, since coming to Washington, Marcelle and I have had an opportunity to meet very special people who have become special friends. Among those are Bill and Dorothy McSweeny. 
   A great regret I had was having to miss Bill's surprise 70th birthday party recently, but it showed the genius of Dorothy that she was able to keep it a secret. That so many turned out shows a great respect for this multi-faceted man--people across the political spectrum and including some of the best representatives of arts and entertainment. It definitely reflected all of his background.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator GRASSLEY and Senator TORRICELLI in introducing legislation to protect patient privacy when a hospital, nursing home, HMO or other institution holding medical records is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding that leads to liquidation. 
   Of course, in the best case scenario any institution holding patient health care records would continue to follow applicable state or federal law requiring proper storage and safeguards. The fact is, however, under current law during a business liquidation an individual would have to wait until there has been a serious breach of their privacy rights before anyone stepped in to ensure that patient privacy is protected. Under current law it is questionable what protection these most sensitive personal records would have during a liquidation. 
   The reality of this situation and the practical questions of what recourse an individual would have if their personal medical records were not properly safeguarded against a business that is going out of business makes this provision essential. Our legislation would  set in law the procedure that an institution holding medical records would have to follow during a liquidation proceeding. 
   The bottom line is that we do not want to have to wait until there has been a breach of privacy before steps are taken to protect patient privacy. Once privacy is breached--there is nothing one can really do to give that back to an individual. 
   I have been working on the overall issue of medical privacy for many years. I look forward to working with Senator GRASSLEY and Senator TORRICELLI on this issue to make sure that patient privacy rights are protected in bankruptcy.

   Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am delighted to see the Senate take up this bill--and I suspect we will pass this bill unanimously--honoring the courage and leadership of Rosa Parks. She played a significant role in moving this country toward recognition of human dignity and protection of civil rights of all our citizens. 
   As we move forward in unanimity to call for a medal to recognize Rosa Parks' contribution to our history, I hope all of the sponsors and supporters of this bill will also take at least a moment to consider not only the progress we made but the distance we have yet to travel. 
   I hope, among other things, the Senate will honor Rosa Parks and all that the civil rights movement in this country has accomplished by moving forward with the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to head the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice. Action on this matter is long overdue. 
   Bill Lann Lee is the first Asian American to be nominated to 
   head the Civil Rights Division in its history, 42-year history. He is currently serving as the Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights as he has for almost 16 months. He has done an impressive job enforcing our Nation's civil rights laws. 
   He was originally nominated in July 1997. Despite his excellent credentials and legal record, some chose to demagogue his nomination and turn it into a symbolic vote against the President. 
   Six former Assistant Attorneys General for Civil Rights, from the Eisenhower through the Bush administrations, wrote to the Judiciary Committee in support of his nomination: Harold Tyler, Burke Marshall, Stephen J. Pollak, J. Stanley Pottinger, Drew Days, and John R. Dunne. But he has still not come before the Senate. 
   He was renominated in January 1998, but the committee went all of last session without reporting his nomination. He was renominated again for the third time last month. It is past time to do the right and honorable thing, and report this qualified nominee to the Senate. 
   I hope, Madam President, that the Senate will be allowed to vote on Bill Lann Lee and not just leave him bottled up in a committee where a small minority of the Senate can vote. After 29 months and three sessions of Congress, bring it before the Senate of the United States, so that all Senators--Republican and Democrat alike--can either vote for him or vote against him. Let all Senators state to the country whether this extraordinary person is going to be allowed to serve in the position for which he has been nominated or whether we will tell this outstanding Asian American that the doors of the Senate are closed to him. 
   That is the question. Do we open the doors to this outstanding Asian American or do we close the doors? Right now they are closed. Let's have them open. 
   Civil Rights is about human dignity and opportunity. Bill Lann Lee's nomination ought to have the opportunity for an up or down vote on the Senate floor. He should no longer be forced to ride in the back on the nominations bus but be given the fair vote that he deserves. 
   After looking at Bill Lee's record, I knew he was a man who could effectively lead the Civil Rights Division, enforce the law and resolve disputes. Prior to his tenure at the Department of Justice, he had been involved in approximately 200 cases in his 23 years of law practice, of which he settled all but six of them. This is strong evidence that Mr. Lee is a problem solver and practical in his approach to the law. No one who has taken the time thoroughly to review his record could call him an idealogue. I knew Bill Lee would be reasonable and practical in his approach to the job, and that he would be a top-notch enforcer of the nation's civil rights laws. All of this has proven true. 
   Over the past several months, Bill Lee has been acting head of the Civil Rights Division the way it should be run. Here in Washington, where we have a lot of show horses, Bill Lee is a work horse--a dedicated public servant who is working hard to help solve some of our nation's most difficult problems. He is solving problems every day in big and small cases, which are settled or  brought to trial by his remarkable team of attorneys in the Division. 
   During his tenure, the Civil Rights Division has resolved several hate crimes cases, including: In Idaho, six men pleaded guilty to engaging in a series of racially motivated attacks on Mexican-American men, women and children, some as young as 9-years-old; in Arizona, three members of a skinhead group pleaded guilty to burning a cross in the front yard of an African-American woman; and in Texas, a man pleaded guilty to entering a Jewish temple and firing several gun shots while shouting anti-Semitic slurs. 
   The Division has also been vigorously enforcing our criminal statutes, including: indictments against three people in Arkansas charged with church burning; guilty pleas by 16 Puerto Rico correctional officers who beat 22 inmates and then tried to cover it up; cases arising from Mexican women and girls, some as young as 14, being lured to the U.S. and then being forced into prostitution; and guilty pleas from 18 defendants who forced 60 deaf Mexican nationals to sell trinkets on the streets of New York. Out of concerns about slavery continuing in the U.S., Bill Lee has created a Worker Exploitation Task Force to coordinate enforcement efforts with the Department of Labor. I commend Mr. Lee for putting the spotlight on these shameful crimes. 
   Other significant cases which the Civil Rights Division has handled over the past year include the following: several long-standing school desegregation cases were settled or their consent decrees were terminated, including cases in Kansas City, Kansas; San Juan County, Utah; and Indianapolis, Indiana. Japanese-Latin Americans who were deported and interned in the United States during World War II also received compensation last year. Lawsuits in Ohio and Washington, D.C. were settled to allow women better access to women's health clinics. 
   This record indicates that Bill Lee has been running the 
   Division the way it should be run. Over the past year, we have seen the strong and steady work of the Division -- solid achievements and effective law enforcement. I had high expectations for Bill Lee when he was nominated and I have not been disappointed. He is doing a terrific job, and I know that he will keep up the good work. 
   Given his outstanding work as Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, I urge the Committee and the Senate to take up his nomination and accord him the dignity of a Senate vote. I am confident that in a fair vote on his nomination Bill Lann Lee will be confirmed by the United States Senate as the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. He should no longer be relegated to second class status as an Acting Assistant Attorney General. He should be confirmed and serve out his term with the full measure of dignity accorded to all other Assistant Attorneys General in charge of Civil Rights during our history. 
   When Bill Lee appeared before the Committee for his confirmation hearing in 1997, he testified candidly about his views, his work and his values. He articulated to us that he understands that as the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division his client is the United States and all of its people. He told us poignantly about why he became a person who has dedicated his life to equal justice for all when he spoke of the treatment that his parents received as immigrants. Mr. Lee told us how in spite of his father's personal treatment and experiences, William Lee remained a fierce American patriot, volunteered to serve in the United States Army Air Corps in World War II and never lost his belief in America. 
   He inspired his son just as Bill Lee now inspires his own children and countless others across the land. They are the kind of heroes that we honor and respect as fellow Americans. Mr. Lee told us:  
   My father is my hero, but I confess that I found it difficult for many years to appreciate his unflinching patriotism in the face of daily indignities. In my youth, I did not understand how he could remain so deeply grateful to a country where he and my mother faced so much intolerance. But I began to appreciate that the vision he had of being an American was a vision so compelling that he could set aside the momentary ugliness. He knew that the basic American tenet of equality of opportunity is the bedrock of our society.  
   I know that Bill Lann Lee has remained true to all that his father taught him and I hope that the ``momentary ugliness'' of people opposing his nomination based on an ideological litmus test, and of people distorting his achievements and beliefs, and of some succumbing to narrow partisanship, will not be his reward for a career of good works. Such treatment drives good people from public service and distorts the role of the Senate. 
   I have often referred to the Senate as acting at its best when it serves as the conscience of the nation. In this case, I am afraid that the Senate may show no conscience. I call on the Senate's Republican leadership to end their targeting of Bill Lann Lee and to work with us to bring this nomination to the floor without obstruction so that the Senate may vote and we may confirm a fine person to lead the Civil Rights Division into the next century. Racial discrimination, and harmful discrimination in all its forms--remains one of the most vexing unsolved problems of our society. Let the Senate rise to this occasion to unite the nation. 
   Bill Lann Lee is highly educated and highly skilled. He could have spent his career in the comfort and affluence of any one of the nation's top law firms. Yet he chose to spend his career on the front lines, helping to open the doors of opportunity to those who struggle in our society. And now some decry his lifetime of advocacy for civil rights by arguing that a civil rights advocate should not head the Civil Rights Division. The chief enforcement officer for our civil rights should be someone who believes in our civil rights laws. 
   Bill Lee's skills, his experience, the compelling personal journey that he and his family have traveled, his commitment to full opportunity for all Americans--these qualities appeal to the best in us. Let us affirm the best in us. Let us confirm--or at least allow the Senate to vote on the confirmation of this good man. We need Bill Lann Lee's proven problem-solving abilities in these difficult times. 
   If the Senate is allowed to decide, I believe he will be confirmed and will move this country forward to a time when discrimination will subside and affirmative action is no longer needed; a time when each child-- girl or boy, black or white, rich or poor, urban or rural, regardless of national or ethnic origin and regardless of sexual orientation or disability--shall have a fair and equal opportunity to live the American dream. 
   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate is considering the Leahy-Hatch substitute to S. 249, the ``Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children Protection Act,'' which will reauthorize programs under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and authorize funding for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. 
   This bill authorizes a variety of critical programs for our nation's most at risk children and youth--those who are missing or have been exploited and those who have run away or been forced from home or are homeless. That is why I am particularly pleased that Senator HATCH and I were able to work together and with Senator BIDEN, DEWINE and ABRAHAM in the Judiciary Committee to report our substitute amendment without a single objection in early March. These children need our help, not partisan bickering, and I hope the House of Representatives will follow our lead and enact this bill promptly. 
   I have been working since 1996 to enact legislation to reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. Unfortunately, that Act has been without clear authorization since then. It is past time for Congress to remedy this situation. Last Congress, I worked hard to pass a similar bill, S. 2073, which would have reauthorized the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and would have provided special authorization for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (``NCMEC''). With the assistance of Senators KENNEDY, BIDEN, KOHL, and FEINGOLD, Senator HATCH and I reported S. 2073 from the Judiciary Committee to the Senate in May 1998. That bill passed the Senate with the unanimous consent of all Senators on June 26, 1998. 
   Rather than consider the Senate bill last year, the House of Representatives chose to use our bill number as a vehicle to try to force Senate action on controversial juvenile justice matters that had never been considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee or the full Senate. Thereafter, I worked to attach the provisions of our original and noncontroversial bill as an amendment to other legislation. Even when we were successful in the Senate, certain House  Republicans continued to block all of our efforts. 
   I am optimistic that S. 249, this year's bill, will not face the same fate. With such an array of supporters in the Senate, surely the House will also see fit to pass this legislation quickly so that the critical programs in the bill can be funded and implemented. 
   I am particularly pleased that we have passed this bill with such strong bipartisan support. Reauthorizing the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act for five more years is the first step in assuring local community programs that they will have the resources they need to assist runaway youth and their families. And, today's bill will also help the NCMEC to continue their good work by providing them with a special authorization of appropriations for five years as well. These programs are just the sort that studies have found to be effective and efficient uses of limited federal dollars. 
   The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children provides extremely worthwhile and effective assistance to children and families facing crises across the U.S. and around the world. In 1998, the National Center helped law enforcement officers locate over 5,000 missing children. They also handled 132,357 telephone calls to their hotline, which included calls to report a missing child, to request information or assistance and to provide leads on missing or potentially exploited children. This figure includes 10,904 reported leads or sightings of missing children, an increase of 25 percent over such leads in 1997. 
   Since 1984, the National Center has helped investigate 83 cases involving Vermont children who have been reported missing. They have had extraordinary success in resolving these cases, some of which have taken several years and have involved out of state or international negotiations, and have only one unresolved case at this time. I want to thank Ernie Allen and all the dedicated employees and volunteers associated with the National Center for their help in these matters. 
   The National Center serves a critical role as a clearinghouse of resources and information for both family members and law enforcement officers. They have developed a network of hotels and restaurants which will provide free services to parents in search of their children and have also developed extensive training programs. The National Center has trained 728 sheriffs and police chiefs from across the U.S. in recent years, including police chiefs from Dover, Hartford, Brattleboro and Winooski, Vermont, as well as members of the Vermont State Police. They have trained an additional 150,000 other officers in child sexual exploitation and the detection of missing children since 1984. 
   The National Center is also a leader in reducing the number of infant abductions by educating nurses, security staffs and hospitals. Their recent seminar in Vermont, which trained 250 nurses and security personnel, should provide greater peace of mind to new parents in my home State. 
   Most recently, they have expanded their role in combating the sexual exploitation of children by going on-line. Last year, they launched their ``CyberTipline'' which allows internet users to report suspicious activities linked to the Internet, including child pornography and the potential enticement of children on-line. In the second half of 1998, they received over 4,000 leads from the CyberTipline which resulted in numerous arrests. I applaud the ongoing work of the Center and hope the House of Representatives will promptly pass this bill so that they can proceed with their important activities with fewer funding concerns. 
   The National Center established an international division some time ago and has been working to fulfil the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Last year the National Center held a conference on international concerns with child abductions and international custody battles between 
   separated parents from different countries. This week, Lady Catherine Myer will be hosting another important event on these matters and launching an International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children with the help of the First Lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
   The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act distributes funding to local community programs on the front lines assisting the approximately 1.3 million children and youth each year who are homeless or have left or been forced from their families for a variety of reasons. These programs assist some of our nation's neediest children--those who lack a roof over their heads. Many of the beneficiaries of these programs have either fled or been kicked out of their family homes due to serious family conflicts, substance abusing parents or other problems. These programs assist children facing a variety of circumstances and provide funding for shelters and crisis intervention services, transitional living arrangements and outreach to teens who are living on the streets. 
   J.C. Myers, Coordinator of the Vermont Coalition of Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs, noted recently in a letter to me that:  
   Early interventions such as those authorized under this act: the transitional living programs, crisis response and family reunification services, and peer street outreach programs are, in many cases, the only helping resource available to runaway & homeless young people and families in crisis. These services are much less costly and more effective than later, more drastic interventions runaway and homeless youths often eventually encounter, such as substance abuse treatment and incarceration.  
   Miriam Rollin, the Director of Public Policy at the National Network for Youth has noted:  
   Because runaway and homeless youth often cross state lines, there is a uniquely federal interest in addressing the needs of these youth. For a quarter of a century, the federal RHYA programs have helped to meet the needs of these young people, prevent their involvement in criminal activity, and provide them with a doorway to a safe and productive future.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, not very long ago it would have been difficult to find anyone in this country who had heard of Kosovo, that part of the former Yugoslavia which is today engulfed in a humanitarian calamity and where NATO is conducting the first combat operation in its 50 year history. 
   During the past three weeks we have watched the catastrophe in Kosovo unfold. Over 600,000 Kosovar-Albanians have fled their homes or been herded onto trains with little more than the shirts on their backs, simply because of their ethnicity and because they are Muslim. 
   Today they are struggling to survive in the mud and squalor of camps in Macedonia and Albania, or in third countries. Families have been torn apart. Men and boys have been taken away and their fate is unknown. Women and girls have been raped. Children have been lost or abandoned. 
   Another 200-500,000 people are said to be displaced inside Kovoso, with little access to food or medicine. Luckily it is not winter, but it is still a humanitarian disaster on a scale not seen in Europe for half a century. 
   I supported NATO's decision to attack Serbian President Milosevic's forces. 
   We could debate how we got to this point, about the way the negotiations were handled at Rambouillet and whether he might have refrained from invading Kosovo had the diplomacy been conducted differently. 
   Legitimate questions have been asked 
   about whether the ultimatum put to the Serbs at Rambouillet, which would have led to the partition of their country, was realistic or sustainable. Many knowledgeable people have argued that administration officials did not fully understand the history of the former Yugoslavia or the importance of Kosovo to the Serbs, that they seriously underestimated Milosevic, took a bad situation and have made it worse. 
   We could also ask whether our relations with Russia, which have been badly damaged in recent weeks, could  have been managed better, and what role the Russians should be encouraged to play in helping to resolve this crisis. 
   But after the collapse of the Rambouillet talks, and after Milosevic had ignored dozens of United Nations resolutions, violated every agreement he had signed, continued to slaughter innocent Kosovar-Albanians and amassed tens of thousands of troops and armor on the Kosovo-Serbia border--and there apparently is evidence that Milosevic planned the expulsion of ethnic Albanians well before the NATO bombing began--we had but two choices: 
   Do nothing as Milosevic's forces rolled through Kosovo while savagely beating or executing and burning the homes of every man, woman and child who refused his ``ethnic cleansing''; or try to deter him with force. I favored the latter. 
   Like so many others who hoped that Milosevic would accept autonomy for Kosovo secured by an international 
   peacekeeping force, I have seen my worst fears realized. 
   The NATO air attacks have damaged Serbia's military infrastructure, but they have failed to achieve their primary goal: preventing the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo. 
   Milosevic's forces have swept through Kosovo burning whole villages, brutalizing and killing civilians, leaving nothing in their wake and forcing hundreds of thousands of people to flee. It may not be on the scale of Nazi Germany, but it is certainly reminiscent of those days. 
   Mr. President, not many people would have anticipated the magnitude of the catastrophe that has befallen Kosovo today. But many people predicted that Milosevic would fight to hold on to Kosovo, and many doubted that air power alone would stop him. 
   I favored the use of force. But, like many others, I have been disappointed by the way this air campaign has been carried out. 
   We probably could not have stopped Milosevic's forces from invading Kosovo after the Rambouillet talks collapsed. Forty thousand of his soldiers, with tanks, were poised on the border ready to invade. 
   But I certainly expected that we would hit him with enough firepower so that among the first targets bombed would be those Serbian forces. Instead, they encountered almost no resistance as they emptied Kosovo of its inhabitants, destroyed their homes, and achieved complete control over Kosovo in a matter of days--the very result we had sought to prevent. 
   Now his soldiers are hiding in the villages 
   and rugged terrain of Kosovo, and we are facing the far more difficult, dangerous and costly challenge of forcing them to withdraw and creating a safe environment for the refugees to return and rebuild their lives. 
   Despite claims by NATO and Pentagon officials that they predicted everything, the United States and the rest of NATO were clearly unprepared for the debacle that has unfolded. I suspect historians may not look kindly on the Administration officials who did not have a contingency plan if Milosevic refused to back down after a few days or weeks of NATO bombing, who seem to have no strategy except more bombing, and who apparently selected their targets by committee. 
   The fact that NATO leaders have been scrambling to get more aircraft to Kosovo, and that we are told that it will take weeks to put a few Apache helicopters into service there, is perhaps the best evidence of this. 
   Having said that, we should not lose sight of the reasons we are in Kosovo. Had it not been for the Secretary of State, I doubt that anyone in the Administration would have argued as passionately for using force to try to prevent crimes against humanity. 
   I applaud her for it, because I believe that today, in the year of the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, NATO could not have turned its back on the ethnic cleansing of thousands of defenseless people in the heart of Europe. 
   The alternative was to give a green light to Milosevic and other would-be Milosevic's, and to severely curtail NATO's future role as an enforcer of international 
   humanitarian law in Europe. 
   Some have suggested that because we did not act to prevent the slaughter in Rwanda, or in Sierra Leone, or Sudan, or any number of other places, that NATO should not intervene here. 
   I disagree. In fact, I believe that we and our allies in and outside of Africa should have tried to protect the innocent in Rwanda, where half a million people, in the span of only three months, were murdered because of their ethnicity. 
   If we have learned anything from that experience and others, it is that by not acting, by allowing genocide to occur, we diminish ourselves and we invite similar atrocities elsewhere. 
   Others have opposed our involvement in Kosovo on the grounds that we risk becoming bogged down in another Vietnam. As one who in 1974 cast a deciding vote against the Vietnam war, I am sympathetic to those concerns. 
   But we and our NATO allies have been at war in Kosovo for a total of three weeks. For the first four years of the Vietnam War, our Government's policy was strongly supported by the Congress and the American people. It was only when the Pentagon's credibility was shattered by the 1968 Tet offensive, and it became clear that the war could not be won, that the country turned against the war. 
   It is also interesting that some of the most vocal opponents of NATO's use of force in Kosovo are the very Members of Congress who strongly supported our involvement in Vietnam. 
   Some of them have argued that since the Serbian people have rallied behind President Milosevic we should recognize that our policy is not working and find a way out. The reaction of the Serbian people is very troubling, but it is a predictable consequence of war and Milosevic's tight control of the press. We saw the same thing in Iraq, despite Saddam Hussein's brutal repression of his own people. 
   One does not have to equate Milosevic with Hitler. But let us not forget that millions of Germans supported Adolf Hitler. That was hardly a reason not to fight him. 
   And contrary to the lies of Serbian officials that the ethnic Albanians who were rounded up and forced to flee were only trying to escape the NATO bombing, the refugees, many of whom saw their relatives murdered, see NATO as their only hope. 
   The facts are: 
   Whether or not we believe that diplomacy handled differently might have achieved a different result; 
   Whether or not the NATO military campaign should have been conducted differently once the decision to use force was made; 
   Whether or not the President should have publicly ruled out the use of ground forces; 
   Whether one likes it or not--we need to recognize the unavoidable fact of which the senior Senator from Arizona, Senator MCCAIN, has so consistently reminded us: Our country is the leader of NATO and NATO is fighting a war. Now that we are in it we need to win it. If we fail we will all be the losers. 
   This is not the time to debate what might have been or to obfuscate or to hedge one's bets. It is a time to stand up as a country united behind the President, the Secretary of State, the Pentagon, our soldiers and our NATO allies in support of a cause that is just, and a cause that will determine the credibility, effectiveness, and future mission of NATO. 
   Let us remember. It is President Milosevic who is destroying the lives of the people of Kosovo, the very people whom he claims to represent. It is he who has driven them from their homes. It is his forces who are killing, raping and pillaging. It is his forces who are laying landmines where refugees are fleeing. 
   And let us remember that this is not the first time President Milosevic has laid waste to an entire country. In Bosnia his troops murdered thousands and buried them in mass graves, and uprooted hundreds of thousands, again because of their ethnicity. 
   We should all be concerned by the damage the NATO military campaign has caused to our relations with Russia. 
   I am told that the Russian people are united in their anger at the United States like never before since the end of the Cold War. 
   They have seen their country transformed from a superpower to a crippled giant. They felt that NATO's expansion was unnecessary and an attempt to gain advantage over Russia. They see  the air attacks against Serbia as one more example of the unchecked misuse of American power. 
   I am told that our policy has only strengthened the hard-liners in Russia. 
   I am disturbed by the photographs of Russian Prime Minister Primakov coddling President Milosevic. We have also heard threatening statements by President Yeltsin and other Russian officials, opposing the NATO air strikes and intimating that Russia might act militarily to defend its interests in the Balkans. 
   No one can deny the overriding importance of our relations with Russia and the need to find a way for Russia to join with us in trying to resolve this crisis. Perhaps that includes a major role for Russian soldiers in any international security force in Kosovo. 
   But the fact remains that it would be foolhardy for Russia to become militarily involved in Kosovo. The NATO attacks against Milosevic are not in any way directed at Russia. All of NATO's members are collectively standing up against genocide in Europe. Russia's long-term economic and security interests are clearly better served by joining with the United States and Europe, rather than casting its lot with the likes of Milosevic. 
   We must also reflect on the reaction of the people of Serbia and Montenegro. For years our policy has failed to account for the complexities of the history of the 
   Balkans, and we are paying a price for that today. 
   We have a tendency to oversimplify and over-personalize our foreign policy, to forget that in the past the Serbian people have suffered, too. But while we know that they also have been victimized by President Milosevic, we cannot excuse them for rallying to his defense when all of Europe is united against everything he represents. 
   Mr. President, there has been a great deal of talk, both pro and con, about the deployment of American soldiers as part of a NATO ground force, in Kosovo. 
   As much as I hope that ground troops are not necessary, I felt it was unwise to rule them out because I believe it only emboldened President Milosevic. 
   I also know of no one who thinks this mission can be accomplished by air power alone, and the administration needs a more realistic strategy. We need policy based on solid plans--not policy based on polls. 
   Again, I think we should heed the advice of Senator MCCAIN. What are our goals--NATO's goals--today? In my mind, it is to force Milosevic to agree to a ceasefire, the withdrawal of his forces from Kosovo, the safe return of the refugees secured by an international force, and autonomy for Kosovo. 
   If we can prove the experts wrong and accomplish that with air power alone, so much the better. 
   But if we cannot, if ground troops are necessary to achieve our goals, we must use them, and NATO should be making preparations for the possibility that they 
   will be needed. The bulk of those forces should come from Europe, but as the leader of NATO we would have a responsibility to contribute our share. 
   To those who complain that Kosovo is not worth the life of a single American soldier, I would say this: As Americans we cherish the life of every American soldier, and we give our armed forces the best available training and technology to defend themselves. Military missions always involve danger. In this mission, an enormous amount is at stake for our country, for NATO, for the people of Kosovo, and for humanity. 
   What is the alternative? To give in to ethnic cleansing after taking a principled stand against it? That would be a terrible defeat for NATO, and for the cause of international justice and security. It would be a terrible precedent for us to bequeath to the generations that will follow us in the next century. 
   No one can predict how long this war will last, or how it will end. Let us hope that President Milosevic soon recognizes that he risks losing everything. 
   In the meantime, we owe our gratitude and our support to our soldiers, and to the humanitarian relief organizations that are providing emergency food, shelter and medical assistance to the refugees. 
   They have been heroic. 
   Mr. President, I am also concerned about a disturbing report I received this morning that United States forces have used landmines against the Serbs. 
   I am told that these are anti-tank mines, but they are mixed with anti-personnel mines, which are prohibited under an international treaty which unfortunately the United States has not signed. 
   However, every one of our NATO allies except for Turkey is a party to that treaty, and I wonder if they are aware of this since our planes are using airfields located in those countries. 
   In fact, at last count 135 nations had signed the treaty, and 71 have ratified. The United States should be among them. 
   Nobody would argue that the United States is bound by a treaty it has not ratified. But it is very disappointing that at the same time that the Administration is holding itself out as a leader in the worldwide effort to ban landmines, it is using mines itself. 
   Mr. President, I have asked the Pentagon to confirm whether or not this report is true. I hope it is not. 
   But if it is true, it is only a matter of time before innocent people are maimed or killed by these weapons. 
   It sends the wrong message to the rest of the world. And frankly, while I support the Administration's use of force against Milosevic I do not know anyone who believes we need landmines to achieve our goals. It is unnecessary, it is wrong, and it will only further erode the Administration's credibility on an issue that cries out for the United States to set the example. 
   Mr. President, I am hoping this report is not true. But we will find out because if it is, we should stop using them. It is a disturbing thing that we would be so different from the rest of our allies.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, baseball season began earlier this month and already the Senate is lagging behind the home run pace of Mark McGwire. Last summer I began comparing the Senate's lack of progress on judicial nominations with home run pace of McGwire and other major leaguers. I had tried everything else I could think of: I had lectured the Republican majority about the Senate's duty to the judicial branch under the Constitution, I had cited the caseloads and backlogs in many courts around the country, I had introduced legislation to prevent the Senate from going on vacation while the Second Circuit was experiencing an unprecedented emergency declared by Chief Judge Winter in the face of five vacancies out of 12 authorized members of the court. 
   I recently attended an historic meeting of the Baltimore Orioles major league baseball team and the Cuban team in Havana. During the Easter recess the Nation's Capital witnessed exhibition baseball between the Montreal Expos and the St. Louis Cardinals and got to see Big Mac in person. Maybe another baseball comparison can inspire the Senate into action on Federal judges this year. 
   It is already mid-April and the Senate has yet to act on a single judicial nominee. Worse yet the Senate Judiciary Committee has yet to hold or even schedule a confirmation hearing. At this rate, I will have to start comparing the Senate's pace for the confirmation of Federal judges to the home run pace of American League pitchers. Since they do not bat, the Senate has a chance of keeping up with them. 
   Of course, last year the Senate had gotten off to an early lead on Mark McGwire. Last January through the end of April, the Senate had confirmed 22 judges. By the All Star break last July, the Senate had confirmed 33 judges. It took Big Mac 10 weeks to catch and pass the Senate last year. 
   This year, McGwire passed the Senate's total on opening day. That is because this year the Senate has yet to confirm a single Federal judge. That is right: In spite of the 33 judicial nominations now pending, in spite of the fact that at least a dozen of those nominees have been pending before the Senate for more than 9 months, in spite of the fact that four of those nominations were favorably reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee and were on the Senate calendar last year, in spite of the 67 vacancies including 28 judicial emergency vacancies, the Senate has yet to confirm a single Federal judge all year. Incredibly Mark McGwire is still on pace with what he accomplished last year. Regrettably, the Senate is not on even or on a slower pace than it was last year; it has no pace at all. 
   By the end of last year, the Senate finally picked up its pace and confirmed 65 Federal judges--the highest total since the Republican majority took control of the Senate. That was 65 of the 91 nominations received for the 115 vacancies the Federal judiciary experienced last year. Together with the 36 judges confirmed in 1997, the total number of article III Federal judges confirmed during the last Congress was a 2-year total of 101--the same total that was confirmed in 1 year when  Democrats last made up the majority of the Senate in 1994. Of course, the Senate fell short of the record-setting 70 home run total of Mark McGwire and 66 homers hit by Sammy Sosa. 
   The Judicial Conference of the United States has recommended that Congress authorize an additional 69 judgeships besides, in order for the Federal courts to have the judicial resources they need to do the justice. These are in addition to the 67 current vacancies. That means that the Federal courts need the equivalent of 136 more judges. I cannot remember a time when the resource needs of the Federal courts were so neglected by the Congress. 
   During the four years that the Republican majority has controlled the Senate, it has barely kept up with attrition when it comes to judicial vacancies. Even with the confirmations achieved last year, the current vacancies number as many as existed at the time the Senate recessed in 1994. The Senate has not made the progress it should have in filling the longstanding vacancies that continue to plague the Federal judiciary. The Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court and others continue to speak of the problem of too few judges and too much work. In 1997 the Chief Justice noted: ``Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary.'' 
   Both the Second Circuit and the Ninth Circuit have had to cancel hearings over the past couple of years due to judicial vacancies. The Second Circuit has had to declare a circuit emergency and to proceed with only one circuit judge on their three-judge panels. 
   The New York Times ran a front-page story recently on how the crushing workload in the Federal appellate courts has lead to what the Times called a ``two-tier system'' for appeals. In testimony and statements over the last few years, I have seen Chief Judge Winter and former Chief Judge Newman of the Second Circuit, Chief Judge Hug and Judge Trott of the Ninth Circuit and Chief Judge Hatchett of the Eleventh Circuit all warn of the problem of too few judges and too much work. I deeply regret that these twin problems have combined to lead to the perception that the Federal appellate courts can no longer provide the same attention to individual cases that has marked the Federal administration of justice in the past. 
   Appellate courts have had to forgo oral argument in more and more cases. Litigants are being denied any opportunity to see the judges who are deciding their causes. Law clerks and attorney staff are being used more and more extensively in the determination of cases as backlogs grow. As caseloads grow, bureaucratic imperatives seem to be replacing the administration 
   of justice. These are not the ways to engender confidence in our system of justice, acceptance of the judicial process, support for the decisions being rendered or respect for courts. Congress needs to support the judicial branch with the judges and other resources it needs. 
   Instead of sustained effort by the Senate to close the judicial vacancies gap, we have seen extensive delays continue and unexplained and anonymous ``holds'' become regular order. 
   The only thing the Judiciary Committee does not ``hold'' any more is judicial confirmation hearings. I recall in 1994--the most recent year in which the Democrats constituted the majority --when the Judiciary Committee held 25 judicial confirmation hearings, including hearings to confirm a Supreme Court Justice. By April 15, 1994, we had held 5 hearings involving 21 nominees, and the Committee had reported 18 nominations. Even last year, the Committee had held four confirmation hearings by this time. This year the Committee has not held a single hearing on a single judicial nomination. 
   The Senate continues to tolerate upwards of 67 vacancies in the Federal courts with more on the horizon--almost one in 13 judgeships remains unfilled and, from the looks of things, will remain unfilled into the future. The Judiciary Committee needs to do a better job and the Senate needs to proceed more promptly to consider nominees reported to it. 
   We made some progress last year, but if last year is to represent real progress and a change from the destructive politics of the two preceding years in which the Republican Senate confirmed only 17 and 36 judges, we need to better last year's results this year. The Senate needs to consider judicial nominations promptly and to confirm without additional delay the many fine men and women President Clinton is sending us. 
   Already this year the Senate has received 33 judicial nominations. I am confident that many more are following in the days and weeks ahead. Unfortunately, past delays mean that 28 of the current vacancies, over 40 percent, are already judicial emergency vacancies, having been empty for more than 18 months. A dozen of the nominations now pending had been received in years past. Ten are for judicial emergency vacancies. The nomination of Judge Paez to the Ninth Circuit dates back over 3 years to January 1996. 
   In his 1998 Year-End Report of the Federal Judiciary, Chief Justice Rehnquist noted: ``The number of cases brought to the federal courts is one of the most serious problems facing them today.'' Criminal cases rose 15 percent in 1998, alone. Yet the Republican Congress has for the past several years simply refused to consider the authorization of the additional judges requested by the Judicial Conference. 
   In 1984 and in 1990, Congress did respond to requests for needed judicial resources by the Judicial Conference. Indeed, in 1990, a Democratic majority in the Congress created judgeships 
   during a Republican presidential administration. 
   In 1997, the Judicial Conference of the United States requested that an additional 53 judgeships be authorized around the country. This year that request has risen to 69 additional judgeships. 
   In order to understand the impact of judicial vacancies, we need only recall that more and more of the vacancies are judicial emergencies that have been left vacant for longer periods of time. Last year the Senate adjourned with 15 nominations for judicial emergency vacancies left pending without action. Ten of the nominations received already this year are for judicial emergency vacancies. 
   In his 1997 Year-End Report, Chief Justice Rehnquist noted the vacancy crisis and the persistence of scores of judicial emergency vacancies and observed: ``Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote.'' He went on to note: ``The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.'' 
   During the entire 4 years of the Bush administration there were only three judicial nominations that were pending before the Senate for as long as 9 months before being confirmed and none took as long as a year. In 1997 alone there were 10 judicial nominations that took more than 9 months before a final favorably vote and 9 of those 10 extended over a year to a year and one-half. In 1998 another 10 confirmations extended over 9 months: Professor Fletcher's confirmation took 41 months--the longest-pending judicial nomination in the history of the United States--Hilda Tagle's confirmation took 32 months, Susan Oki Mollway's confirmation took 30 months, Ann Aiken's confirmation took 26 months, Margaret McKeown's confirmation took 24 months, Margaret Morrow's confirmation took 21 months, Judge Sonia Sotomayor's confirmation took 15 months, Rebecca Pallmeyer's confirmation took 14 months, Dan Polster's confirmation took 12 months, and Victoria Roberts' confirmation took 11 months. 
   I calculate that the average number of days for those few lucky nominees who are finally confirmed is continuing to escalate. In 1996, the Republican Senate shattered the record for the average number of days from nomination to confirmation for judicial confirmation. The average rose to a record 183 days. In 1997, the average number of days from nomination to confirmation rose dramatically yet again. From initial nomination to confirmation, the average time it took for Senate action on the 36 judges confirmed in 1997 broke the 200-day barrier for the first time in our history. It was 212 days. 
   Unfortunately, that time is still growing and the average is still rising to the detriment of the administration  of justice. Last year, in 1998, the Senate broke the record, again. The average time from nomination to confirmation for the 65 judges confirmed in 1998 was over 230 days. At each step of the process, judicial nominations are being delayed. Prime examples are Judge Richard Paez, Justice Ronnie L. White, and Marsha Berzon, who have each had to be renominated again this year. 
   I again urge the Senate to take seriously its responsibilities and help the President fill the longstanding vacancies in the Federal courts around the country. Today the score is running against the prompt and fair administration of justice--vacancies 67, nominations 33, confirmations zero. 
   In conclusion, last year I talked about judicial nominations and Mark McGwire. I talked about how well Mark McGwire had been doing. I compared his home run numbers, and that he was going along a lot faster than our judicial nominations. And I may do a little bit of that this year, as well. 
   But I put a little magnifying glass up here to the chart. Here are the number of vacancies of Federal judges. Of course, a person can become a Federal judge only after a nomination and confirmation by the Senate. 
   Here are the vacancies--67. I put a magnifying glass on the chart so everybody can see how many we have confirmed. Zero. Diddle squat. That is all we have done--no confirmations whatsoever. In fact, I don't think we have even had a hearing. We are now in the fourth month of the year and about to go into the fifth month. I don't think in my 25 years here we have ever gone this long, especially in the middle of a President's term, without even having any hearings. 
   Mark McGwire is ahead of us in home runs, both on confirmations and on nomination hearings. Last year we got a little bit ahead of him, at least until the baseball season began. We had confirmed by the time of the All-Star break in July something like 33 judges. It took Mark McGwire almost 10 weeks to catch up and pass us last year. This time he passed us on the very first day he goes out to bat. The very first day that he is playing he beats us. 
   I have heard it said that we can't confirm nominees that we don't have. We have 33 nominees up here right now. They are here sitting before the Senate. Some have already had hearings last year, and they just sit there and sit there, and we don't vote on them. We don't confirm them. 
   Look at how we have done in the past. Let's go a little backward. In 1994, we confirmed 101. In 1999, we only confirmed 65. Mark McGwire hit 70 home runs. 
   I think we will talk a little more about this as we go along. We have also had a problem with the time between nomination and confirmation. Again, it doesn't answer the question to say we can't confirm people if they are not nominated. In fact, they are nominated, and they still don't get confirmed and those that do are taking longer every year. In 1993, it took the average time of 59 days to get them confirmed. Now it takes 232 days. I know of people who have declined appointments to the Federal bench. Why? Because they can't get confirmed at all or confirmed in a reasonable time. 
   So the bottom line, Mr. President, is here we are with 67 vacancies and zero confirmations. And I am willing to bet that, at the rate we are going, Mark McGwire is going to be way ahead of us all year long. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator MOYNIHAN as an original cosponsor of the Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act of 1999. This bill takes the next, important step toward restoring benefits to legal immigrants. 
   Legal immigrants are people in our communities who are in this country legally. They pay taxes and they contribute to our economy and society. Many of our parents, or grandparents, were legal immigrants themselves. The 1996 welfare reform law forced this group to lose their eligibility for various programs, including food stamps, Medicaid and SSI. More than 900,000 legal immigrants--including hundreds of thousands of children and elderly individuals--were cut from the Food Stamp Program alone, with nothing to abate their hunger. 
   In the years since the passage of the welfare reform act, Congress has correctly realized that many of the cuts went too far, and slowly benefits are being restored. For instance, the 1997 Balanced Budget Act restored SSI and Medicaid benefits to a narrow class of immigrants, refugees and asylees. 
   Last Congress, I worked hard to include $818 million in the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reauthorization Act to restore food stamp benefits for thousands of legal immigrants. This legislation restored food stamps to legal immigrants who are disabled or elderly, or who later become disabled, and who resided in the United States prior to August 22, 1996. That law also increased food stamp eligibility time limits--from 5 years to 7 years--for refugees and asylees who came to this country to avoid persecution. Hmong refugees who aided U.S. military efforts in Southeast Asia were also covered, as were children residing in the United States prior to August 22, 1996. 
   Though the Agriculture Research Act restored food stamp eligibility to children of legal immigrants, many of these children are not receiving food stamps and are experiencing alarming instances of hunger. In its recent report entitled ``Who is Leaving the Food Stamp Program? An Analysis of Caseload Changes from 1994 to 1997,'' the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that participation among children living with parents who are legal immigrants fell significantly faster than children living with native-born parents. It appears that restrictions on adult legal immigrants deterred the participation of their children. That is a disturbing development that must be rectified, and the legislation we are introducing today would go a long way toward making the situation right by restoring food stamp eligibility to all legal immigrants. 
   The Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act of 1999 would also address the medical needs of legal immigrants. This bill will permit states to offer Medicaid coverage to all eligible legal immigrant pregnant women and children, as well as certain ``medically needy'' disabled legal immigrants. This legislation would also restore SSI eligibility to elderly and poor legal immigrants who were in this country prior to passage of the welfare reform law. 
   Under current law, legal immigrants who suffer from domestic or elder abuse must wait 5 years to receive Medicaid, TANF, SSI and food stamp benefits if they entered the United States after August 1996. The Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act of 1999 would amend this law so that these victims would not have to wait to receive assistance. 
   I am proud to cosponsor the Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act of 1999. It is a needed bill that will help fill some of the continuing gaps left by the welfare reform law. I look forward to working with Senator MOYNIHAN and all members of the Senate to restore Medicaid, SSI, and food stamp benefits to legal immigrants in need.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is the third Congress in which I have introduced and sponsored legislation to update our country's encryption policies. My objective has been to bolster the competitive edge of our Nation's high-tech companies, allow Americans to protect their online and electronically stored confidential information, trade secrets and intellectual property, and promote global electronic commerce. I am pleased to join Senators MCCAIN, WYDEN and BURNS, in this continuing effort with the ``Promote Reliable On-Line Transactions to Encourage Commerce and Trade (PROTECT) Act of 1999.'' 
   In May 1996, I chaired a hearing on the Administration's ill-fated Clipper Chip key escrow encryption program that drove home the need for relaxed export controls on strong encryption. U.S. export controls on encryption technology were having a clear negative effect on the competitiveness of American hi-tech companies. Moreover, these controls were discouraging the use of strong encryption domestically since manufacturers generally made and marketed one product for both for export and for domestic use here. At that hearing I heard testimony about 340 foreign encryption products that were available worldwide--including for import into the United States--155 of which employed encryption in a strength that American companies were prohibited from exporting. That number has grown exponentially. As of December, 1997, there were 656 foreign encryption products available from 474 vendors in 29 different foreign countries. 
   American companies certainly do not enjoy a monopoly on encryption know-how. The U.S. Commerce Department's National Institute for Standard and Technology (NIST) is developing an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to update the U.S. Data Encryption Standard (DES), the current global encryption standard. Only 5 of the 15 AES candidate algorithms submitted to NIST for evaluation were proposed from American companies or individuals. The remaining proposals came from Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, United Kingdom, Israel, Norway, and Belgium. 
   In the 104th Congress, I introduced encryption legislation on March 5, 1996, with Senators BURNS, Dole, MURRAY and others, to help Americans better protect their online privacy and allow American companies to compete more effectively in the global hi-tech marketplace. Specifically, the ``Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996,'' S. 1587, would have relaxed export controls on strong encryption and promoted the widespread use of encryption to protect the security, confidentiality and privacy of online communications and stored electronic data. This bill would have legislatively confirmed the freedom of Americans to 
   use and sell in the United States any encryption technology that most appropriately met their privacy and security needs. In addition, this bill would have relaxed export controls to allow the export of encryption products when comparable strength encryption was available from foreign suppliers, and encryption products that were generally available or in the public domain. 
   In the years since that bill was introduced, the Administration has made some positive changes in its export policies. In October 1996, the Administration allowed the export of 56-bit DES encryption by companies that agreed to develop key recovery systems. This policy was supposed to sunset in two years. I strongly criticized this policy at the time, warning that this ``sunset'' provision ``does not promote our high-tech industries overseas.'' In fact, when the time came last year to return to the old export regime that allowed the export of only 40-bit encryption, the Administration relented and continues to permit the export of 56-bit encryption, with the condition of developing encryption programs with recoverable keys. 
   The proposals I made in 1996 made sense then, and versions of these provisions are incorporated into the PROTECT Act today. 
   Specifically, the PROTECT Act would provide immediate relief by allowing the export of encryption using key lengths of up to 64 bits. In addition, stronger encryption (more than 64-bit key lengths) would be exportable under a license exception, upon determination by a new Encryption Export Advisory Board that the product or service is generally available, publicly available or a comparable product is available from a foreign supplier. This determination is subject to approval by the Secretary of Commerce and to override by the President on national security grounds. 
   This relief is important since the time and effort to crack 56-bit DES encryption is getting increasingly short. Indeed, earlier this year, a group of civilian computer experts broke a 56-bit encrypted message in less than 24 hours, beating a July 1998 effort that took 56 hours. 
   The breaking of 56-bit encryption comes as no surprise to those doing business, engaging in research, or conducting their personal affairs online. While 56-bit encryption may still serve as the global standard, this will not be the situation for much longer. 128-bit encryption is now the preferred encryption strength. 
   For example, in order to access online account information from the Thrift Savings Plan for Federal Employees, Members and congressional staff must use 128-bit encryption. If you use weaker encryption, a screen pops up to say ``you cannot have 
   access to your account information because your Web browser does not have Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and 128-bit encryption (the strong U.S./Canada-only version).'' 
   Likewise, the Department of Education has set up a Web site that allows prospective students to apply for student financial aid online. Significantly, the Education's Department  states that ``[t]o achieve maximum protection we recommend you use 128-bit encryption.'' 
   These are just a couple examples of government agencies or associated organizations directing or urging Americans to use 128-bit encryption. We should assume that people in other countries are getting the same directions and recommendations. Unfortunately, while American companies can fill the demand for this strong encryption here, they are not permitted to sell it abroad for use by people in other countries. 
   Significantly, the PROTECT Act would permit the export of 128-bit (and higher) AES products by January 1, 2002. While not providing relief as quickly as I have urged in other encryption legislation, including the E-PRIVACY Act, S. 2067, in the last Congress, this bill moves in the right direction, and provides a sunset for unworkable encryption export controls. In my view, this bill would give most Internet users access to the strongest tools they need to protect their privacy starting in 2002--a long time by Net standards, but time our law enforcement and intelligence agencies say they need to address the global proliferation of strong encryption. 
   Encryption is a critical tool for Americans to protect their privacy and safeguard their confidential electronic information, such as credit card numbers, personal health information, or private messages, from online thieves and snoops. This is important to encourage the continued robust growth of electronic commerce. A March 1999 report of the Vermont Internet Commerce Research Project that I commissioned analyzed barriers to Internet commerce in my home State, and found that ``the strongest obstacle among consumers'' was the perceived lack of security. 
   Focusing on the export regime for encryption technology is only one aspect, albeit an important one, in the larger debate over how best to protect privacy in a digital and online environment. Legislation to provide encryption export relief is a start, but we also have important work to do in addressing broader privacy issues, such as establishing standards for law enforcement access to decryption assistance. I look forward to working with Senators MCCAIN, WYDEN and BURNS on passage of the PROTECT Act as well as other privacy legislation.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have worked for many years to try to keep the costs of prescription drugs down. Too many Americans are unable to afford the costly medications they need to stay healthy. Seniors in Vermont living on fixed incomes should not be forced to choose between buying food or fuel for heat, and paying for prescription drugs. 
   As part of this continuing effort, I am pleased to cosponsor the Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act of 1999, which is being introduced today. This bill is an important step toward increasing the access of older Americans to the prescription drugs they need for their health and well-being. The Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act will allow pharmacies to purchase prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries at the same discounted rates available to the federal government and large insurance companies. Seniors should no longer foot the bill for generous discounts to the favored customers of pharmaceutical companies. Under this legislation, seniors could see their medication costs decrease by more than 40 percent. 
   This is only the first step. We must begin to address the greater problem that the costs of most prescription drugs are not covered by Medicare. As drug costs skyrocketed 17 percent in the last year alone, paying for prescription drugs has become a tremendous out-of-pocket burden for seniors, who fill 18 prescriptions a year on average. I am encouraged by the debate on the Senate floor on the Budget Resolution which has focused on addressing the lack of a drug benefit. I will support efforts to include coverage of prescription drugs in the Medicare program. This is the right thing to do for seniors, and this is the right time to do it.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators CHAFEE, BOB SMITH, and FEINGOLD in offering this amendment to restart the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) state assistance program. Our amendment will recognize the outpouring of support for open space conservation and urban revitalization demonstrated by the passage of 124 ballot measures dedicating tax revenues to these goals. 
   Our amendment will allocate $200 million to the state grants program of LWCF. More than thirty years ago Congress made a promise to future generations that we would use the revenues from offshore oil and gas leases to protect the ``irreplaceable lands of natural beauty and unique recreational value.'' The revenues would be placed into the Land and Water Conservation Fund and used by the federal government, states and local communities to build a network of parks, refuges, hiking trails, bike paths, river accesses and greenways. 
   Unfortunately, only half of that promise has been kept. For the past three years, Congress has not funded the state grants program of the Fund. Instead, we have been diverting these revenues for other purposes at a time when these investments are needed more than ever. We have all seen the impact of urban sprawl in our home states, whether it be large, multi-tract housing or mega-malls that bring national superstores and nation-sized parking lots. We are losing farm and forest land across the country at an alarming rate. If we are going to reverse this trend, Congress has to step in to the debate and start funding federal land conservation programs that help states address their land conservation priorities. The LWCF state grants program is one of the few federal programs available to do this--Congress now needs to make a commitment to fund it. 
   By funding the state grants program we will be investing in a proven success. The program has proved itself by helping to fund more than 37,000 projects across the country. As the National Park Service has testified, these projects are in ``every nook and cranny of the country and serve every segment of the public.'' I am sure every one of us have visited one of these places without even knowing that federal funds--which leveraged state and local funds--made it happen. 
   But it is not happening any more. By not funding the state grants program we are leaving state and local governments to fill the gap. In Vermont, we are fortunate. Most Vermonters are within a few hours of the Green Mountain National Forest or the Appalachian Trail. Most Americans, however, are much further away from a national park, national forest or wildlife refuge. They depend on their local parks and bike paths for weekend getaways or evening excursions. 
   I have seen the success of the state-side program in Vermont, where more than $27 million from the Fund has helped conserve more than 66,000 acres of land that was set aside as open space, parks and recreation places. I have a list of more than 500 projects that touch every corner of Vermont. However, there are still many special places in Vermont that remain unprotected. I constantly hear from Vermonters what are trying to protect their town green, a local wetland or access to their favorite fishing hole. 
   By restarting the state grant program we will be able to protect some of these special places in each of our states. In Vermont, I would like to see the Long Trail, which follows the spine of the Green Mountains through my state and attracts more than 200,000 hikers a year, completed. I would like to see better access to the banks of one of the premier fly-fishing rivers, the Battenkill. Although these will not become part of our federal network of conservation areas, we still have a federal responsibility to ensure they remain open and accessible for future generations to enjoy.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators GRASSLEY and SCHUMER in sponsoring the ``Sunshine in the Courtroom Act.'' 
   Our democracy works best when our citizens are fully informed. That is why I have supported efforts during my time in the Senate to promote the goal of opening the proceedings of all three branches of our government. We continue to make progress in this area. Except for rare closed sessions, the proceedings of Congress and its Committees are open to the public, and carried live on cable networks. In addition, more Members and Committees are using the Internet and Web sites to make their work available to broader audiences. 
   The work of Executive Branch agencies is also open for public scrutiny through the Freedom of Information Act, among other mechanisms. The FOIA has served the country well in maintaining the right of Americans to know what their government is doing--or not doing. As President Johnson said in 1966, when he signed the Freedom of Information Act into law:  
   This legislation springs from one of our most essential principles: A democracy works best when the people have all the information that the security of the Nation permits.  
   The work of the third, Judicial Branch, of government is also open to the public. Proceedings in federal courtrooms around this country are open to the public, and our distinguished jurists publish extensive opinions explaining the reasons for their judgments and decisions. 
   Forty-eight states, including Vermont, permit cameras in the courts. This legislation simply continues this tradition of openness on the federal level. 
   This bill permits presiding appellate and district court judges to allow cameras in the courtroom; they are not required to do so. At the same time, it protects non-party witnesses by giving them the right to have their voices and images obscured during their testimony. Finally, the bill authorizes the Judicial Conference of the United States to promulgate advisory guidelines for use by presiding judges in determining the management and administration of photographing, recording, broadcasting or televising the proceedings. The authority for cameras in federal district courts sunsets in three years. 
   In 1994, the Judicial Conference concluded that the time was not ripe to permit cameras in the federal courts, and rejected a recommendation of the Court Administration and Case Management Committee to authorize the photographing, recording, and broadcasting of civil proceedings in federal trial and appellate courts. A majority of the Conference were concerned about the intimidating effect of cameras on some witnesses and jurors. 
   The New York Times opined at that time, on September 22, 1994, that ``the court system needs to reconsider its total ban on cameras, and Congress should consider making its own rules for cameras in the Federal courts.'' 
   I am sensitive to the concerns of the Conference, but believe this legislation grants to the presiding judge the authority to evaluate the effect of a camera on particular proceedings and witnesses, and decide accordingly on whether to permit the camera into the courtroom. A blanket prohibition on cameras is an unnecessary limitation on the discretion of the presiding judge. 
   Allowing a wider public than just those who are able to make time to visit a courtroom to see and hear judicial proceedings will allow Americans to evaluate for themselves the quality of justice in this country, and deepen their understanding of the work that goes on in our courtrooms. This legislation is a step in making our courtrooms and the justice meted out there more widely available for public scrutiny. The time is long overdue for federal courts to allow cameras on their proceedings.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Seniors Safety Act of 1999, a bill to protect older Americans from crime. 
   The Seniors Safety Act contains a comprehensive package of proposals developed with the assistance of the Department of Justice that address the most prevalent crimes perpetrated against seniors, including proposals to reduce health care fraud and abuse, combat nursing home fraud and abuse, prevent telemarketing fraud, safeguard pension and employee benefit plans from fraud, bribery and graft. In addition, this legislation would help seniors whose pension plans are defrauded to obtain restitution. Finally, the bill authorizes the collection of appropriate data and examination by the Attorney General to develop new strategies to fight crime against seniors. 
   Seniors over the age of 55 make up the most rapidly growing sector of our society. In Vermont alone, the number of seniors grew by more than nine percent between 1990 and 1997, now comprising almost twelve percent of Vermont's total population. According to recent census estimates, the number of seniors over 65 will more than double by the year 2050. 
   It is an ugly fact that criminal activity against seniors that causes them physical harm and economic damage is a significant problem. While the violent and property crime rates have been falling generally, according to the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics, in 1997 the violent victimization rates for persons over 50 years of age were no lower than they had been in 1993. In 1997, these older Americans experienced approximately 680 thousand incidents of violent crime, including rape, robbery, and general assault. 
   We need to do better job at protecting seniors and ensuring that they enjoy the same decreasing violent and property crime rate as other segments of our society. The Seniors Safety Act contains provisions to enhance penalties for criminal offenses that target seniors and fraudulent acts that result in physical or economic harm to seniors. In addition, to assist Congress and law enforcement authorities in developing new and effective strategies to deter crimes against seniors, the Act authorizes comprehensive examination of the factors associated with crimes against seniors and the inclusion of data on seniors in the National Crime Victims Survey. 
   One particular form of criminal activity--telemarketing fraud--disproportionately impacts Americans over the age of 50, who account for over a third of the estimated $40 billion lost to telemarketing fraud each year. The Seniors Safety Act continues the progress we made last year on passage of the Telemarketing Fraud Prevention Act to address the problem of telemarketing fraud schemes that too often succeed in swindling seniors of their life savings. Some of these schemes are directed from outside the United States, making criminal prosecution more difficult. 
   The Act would provide the Attorney General with a new, significant crime fighting tool to deal with telemarketing fraud. Specifically, the Act would authorize the Attorney General to block or terminate telephone service to telephone facilities that are being used to conduct such fraudulent activities. This authority may be used to shut-down telemarketing fraud schemes directed from foreign sources by cutting off their telephone service and, once discovered, would protect victims from that particular telemarketing scheme. Of course, committed swindlers may just get another telephone number, but even relatively brief interruptions in their fraudulent activities may save some seniors from falling victim to the scheme. 
   Another crime prevention provision in the Seniors Safety Act is the establishment by the Federal Trade Commission of a ``Better Business Bureau''-type clearinghouse. This would provide seniors, their families, or others who may be concerned about the legitimacy of a telemarketer with information about prior complaints made about the particular company and any prior convictions for telemarketing fraud. In addition, seniors and other consumers who believe they have been swindled would be provided with information for referral to the appropriate law enforcement authorities. 
   Criminal activity that undermines the safety and integrity of pension plans and health benefit programs pose threats to all of us, but the damage is felt most acutely by seniors who have planned their retirements in reliance on the benefits promised by those programs. Seniors who have worked faithfully and honestly for years should not reach their retirement years only to find that the funds which they were relying upon have been stolen. This is a significant problem. According the Attorney General's 1997 Annual Report, an interagency working group on pension abuse brought 70 criminal cases representing more than $90 million in losses to pension plans in 29 districts around the country in that year alone. 
   The Seniors Safety Act would add to the arsenal of authority that federal prosecutors have to prevent and punish the defrauding of retirement arrangements. Specifically, the Act would create new criminal and civil penalties for defrauding pension plans or obtaining money or property from such plans by means of false or fraudulent pretenses. In addition, the Act would enhance penalties for bribery and graft in connection with employee benefit plans. The only people enjoying the benefits of pension plans should be the people who have worked hard to fund those plans, not crooks who get the money by fraud. 
   Spending on health care in this country amounts to roughly 15 percent of the gross national product, or more than $1 trillion each year. Estimated losses due to fraud and abuse are astronomical. A December 1998 report by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) states that these losses ``may exceed 10 percent of annual health care spending, or $100 billion per year.'' By contrast to health care fraud, which covers deliberate criminal efforts to steal money, the term ``abuse'' describes billing errors or manipulation of billing codes that can result in billing for a more highly reimbursed service or product than the one provided. 
   As electronic claims processing--with no human involvement --becomes more prevalent to save administrative costs, more sophisticated computer-generated fraud schemes are surfacing. Some of these schemes generate thousands of false claims designed to pass through automated claims processing to payment, and result in the theft of millions of dollars from federal and private health care programs. Defrauding Medicare, Medicaid and private health plans harms taxpayers and increases the financial burden on the beneficiaries. Beneficiaries pay the price for health care fraud in their copayments and contributions. In addition, some forms of fraud may result in inadequate medical care and be dangerous for patients. Unfortunately, the NIJ reports that many health care fraud schemes ``deliberately target vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or Alzheimer's patients, who are less willing or able to complain or alert law enforcement.'' 
   Fighting health care fraud has been a top priority of this Administration and  this Attorney General. The attention our federal law enforcement officials are paying to this problem is paying off: the number of criminal convictions in health care fraud cases grew over 300 percent from 1992 to 1997. These cases included convictions for submitting false claims to Medicare and Medicaid, and other insurance plans; fake billings by foreign doctors; and needless prescriptions for durable medical equipment by doctors in exchange for kickbacks from manufacturers. In 1997 alone, $1.2 billion was awarded or negotiated as a result of criminal fines, civil settlements and judgments in health care fraud matters. 
   We can and must do more, however. The Seniors Safety Act would give the Attorney General authority to get an injunction to stop false claims and illegal kickback schemes involving federal health care programs. This Act would also provide the law enforcement authorities with additional investigatory tools to uncover, investigate and prosecute health care offenses in both criminal and civil proceedings. The use of civil laws is considered by the Justice Department to be a ``critical component of our enforcement policy.'' In fact, the Department has recovered $1.8 billion in False Claims Act (FCA) civil enforcement actions since 1986, when Congress amended the FCA to address fraud against the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Seniors Safety Act will permit criminal prosecutors to share information more easily with their civil counterparts. 
   In addition, whistle-blowers, who tip-off law enforcement about false claims, would be authorized under the Seniors Safety Act to seek court permission to review information obtained by the government to enhance their assistance in FCA law suits. Such qui tam, or whistle-blower, suits have, in the Justice Department's estimation, dramatically increased detection of and monetary recoveries for health care fraud. More half of the $1.2 billion the Department was awarded in health care fraud cases in FY 1997 were related to allegations in qui tam cases. This is a successful track record. According to the Department in its most recent health care fraud report, ``qui tam plaintiffs often work with DOJ to build a strong chain of evidence that can be used during settlement discussions or at trial.'' The Act would allow whistle-blowers and their qui tam suits to become even more effective tools in the fight against health care fraud. 
   Finally, the Act would extend anti-fraud and anti-kickback safeguards to the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. These are all important steps that will help cut down on the enormous health care fraud losses. 
   Long-term care planning specialists estimate that over forty percent of those turning 65 years of age will need nursing home care, and that 20 percent of those seniors will spend five years or more in nursing homes. Indeed, many of us already have or will live through the experience of having our parents, family members or other loved ones--or even ourselves--spend time in a nursing home. We owe it to them and to ourselves to give the residents of nursing homes the best care they can get. 
   The Justice Department's Health Care Fraud Report for Fiscal Year 1997 cites egregious examples of nursing homes that pocketed Medicare funds instead of providing residents with adequate care. In one case, five patients died as result of the inadequate provision of nutrition, wound care and diabetes management by three Pennsylvania nursing homes. Yet another death occurred when a patient, who was unable to speak, was placed in a scalding tub of 138-degree water. 
   This Act provides additional piece of mind to residents of nursing homes and those of us who may have loved ones there by giving federal law enforcement the authority to investigate and prosecute operators of nursing homes for willfully engaging in patterns of health and safety violations in the care of nursing home residents. The Act also protects whistle-blowers from retaliation for reporting such violations. 
   The Seniors Safety Act has six titles, described below. 
   Title I, titled ``Strategies for Preventing Crimes Against Seniors'': directs the Attorney General to study the types of crimes and risk factors associated with crimes against seniors. In addition, authority is provided in this title for the Attorney General to include statistics on the incidence of crimes against seniors in the annual National Crime Victims Survey. Collection and analysis of this data is critical to develop effective strategies to protect seniors from crime and respond effectively to the justice needs of seniors. 
   Title II, titled ``Combating Crimes Against Seniors'': provides enhanced penalties for crimes targeting seniors, for health care fraud and other fraud offenses, and the creation of new criminal and civil penalties to protect pension and employee benefit plans. 
   Specifically, the U.S. Sentencing Commission is directed to review the sentencing guidelines and enhance penalties, as appropriate, to adequately reflect the economic and physical harms associated with crimes targeted at seniors, and with health care fraud offenses. This bill would also increase the penalties under the mail fraud statute and wire fraud statute for fraudulent schemes that result in serious injury or death. 
   In addition, this title of the Seniors Safety Act provides new tools in the form of a new criminal provision and civil penalties for law enforcement to investigate and prosecute persons who defraud pension plans or other retirement arrangements. In addition, the Act increases the penalty for corruptly bribing or receiving graft to influence the operation and management of employee benefit plans from three to five years. 
   Title III, titled ``Preventing Telemarketing Fraud'': addresses telemarketing fraud in two ways: by providing a ``Better Business''-style hotline to provide information and log complaints about telemarketing fraud, and by allowing the Attorney General to block or terminate telephone service to numbers being used to perpetrate telemarketing fraud crimes. 
   Title IV, titled ``Combating Health Care Fraud'': provides important investigative and crime prevention tools to law enforcement authorities to uncover and punish health care fraud, including authority to obtain injunctive relief, grand jury disclosure for civil actions, and issuance of administrative subpoenas. In addition, the Act would better protect the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program by extending the anti-kickback and anti-fraud prohibitions to cover this program. 
   Attorney General's injunction authority: The Act would authorize the Attorney General to seek injunctive relief to prevent persons suspected of committing or about to commit a health care fraud or illegal kickback offense from disposing or dissipating fraudulently obtained proceeds. 
   Authorized Investigative Demand Procedures: The Attorney General is currently authorized to issue administrative subpoenas during investigations of criminal health care fraud cases, but cannot do the same in related civil cases. The Act would extend that authority to civil cases, subject to stringent privacy safeguards. 
   Grand Jury Disclosure: Currently, grand jury information may not be disclosed in related civil suits, except under limited circumstances, resulting in duplicative work on the part of government civil attorneys. The Act would allow federal prosecutors to seek a court order allowing the sharing of grand jury information regarding health care offenses with government civil attorneys for use in civil or other regulatory proceedings. 
   Extension of anti-fraud safeguards: The Federal Employee Health Benefits Act is currently exempt from anti-fraud safeguards available to both Medicaid and Medicare. The Act would remove the exemption and subject the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program to anti-fraud and anti-kickback protections. 
   Title V, titled ``Protecting Residents of Nursing Homes'': contains the ``Nursing Home Resident Protection Act of 1999'' to establish a new federal crime, with substantial criminal and civil penalties, against operators of nursing homes who engage, knowingly and willfully, in a pattern of health and safety violations that results in significant physical or mental harm to persons residing in residential health care facilities. In addition, whistle-blowers, who tip off officials about poor nursing home conditions, would be authorized to sue for damages, attorney's fees and other relief should there be any retaliation.  
   Title VI, titled ``Protecting the Rights of Senior Crime Victims'': would authorize the Attorney General to use forfeited funds to pay restitution to victims of fraudulent activity, and the courts to require the forfeiture of proceeds from violations of retirement offenses. In addition, the Act would exempt false claims law actions from a stay by bankruptcy proceedings and ensure that debts due to the United States from false claims law actions are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, in order to pay restitution to fraud victims or regulatory agencies. 
   The Seniors Safety Act of 1999 provides a new safety net for seniors to protect them from the criminal activity that affects them the most. I commend the Administration and particularly the Vice President for his attention to this issue, and the Attorney General for her work and assistance on this legislation. We should move to consider and pass this legislation before the end of the 106th Congress.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on March 16, the American Ireland Fund hosted a dinner to honor Senator EDWARD KENNEDY and his longstanding efforts to promote peaceful and constructive change throughout Ireland. The individuals that gathered together that night--Taoiseach Bertie Ahearn, Nobel Prize Winners John Hume and David Trimble, Sinn Fein Leader Gerry Adams, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Mo Mowlan, among many others--are the best indication of the significant progress that has been made to replace violence and mistrust with cooperation and dialogue. It is also an indication of the Irish community's high esteem for Senator KENNEDY and his key role in bringing the parties to the negotiating table. While differences still impede full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, pride in Ireland's past and present, and a strong commitment to a peaceful and prosperous future was the common bond that united all of those in attendance on the eve of Saint Patrick's Day.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last night, the Senate passed the Supplemental Appropriations bill, which, among other things, contains funding for hurricane relief for Central America. I am very pleased that the Supplemental also specifies that up to $2,000,000 should be made available for humanitarian demining activities in Nicaragua and Honduras. Hurricane Mitch has greatly exacerbated the problem of anti-personnel landmines in both countries. An estimated 100,000 mines were placed in the Nicaraguan-Honduran border area in the 1980's by Sandanista and Contra soldiers. Demining activities to date have been diligent, but painstakingly slow, as over 70,000 mines continue to threaten the population. 
   While the problem has certainly been very serious, at least the areas which contained these mines in both countries were reasonably well known. Until Hurricane Mitch, that is. Mudslides and the tremendous volume of water that accompanied the hurricane have carried mines into areas not previously contaminated. Two Nicaraguan civilians were killed last fall by a mine in an area never thought to hold them previously. A U.S. Army study confirmed the new threat in many areas of Nicaragua. 
   Imagine, Mr. President, the impact on reconstruction efforts in these devastated countries if an American or other foreign national working to rebuild the infrastructure should be injured or killed by a mine. 
   Other Senators may be surprised to hear that one of the most effective ways to demine these areas is the use of man-dog teams. The explosive material in mines emit a gas, which dogs can be trained to detect. Once a mine is detected, the dog is trained to immediately stop and sit, and conventional  demining can begin. Conventional demining amounts to metal detection, a painstakingly slow process which may detect thousands of discarded metal items for every mine found. Most surface area scanned for mines never had any to begin with. But the fear of mines keeps native populations from utilizing the land. Dogs can radically speed the process, and focus the efforts of human deminers into areas which actually contain mines. 
   The Marshall Legacy Institute, responding to a request from the InterAmerican Defense Board, has proposed putting additional man-dog teams into Central America to speed the reconstruction process. The proposal has the support of the Humane Society, and I hope the Administration will give serious consideration to supporting this proposal with these supplemental funds.

   Mr. LEAHY. As a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I am familiar with the Congress' involvement in this program and the specific provisions under discussion. The law requires that the Secretary of the Army make certain certifications concerning the missiles and the program prior to the conduct of the actual test. The required certifications must be made at the appropriate time, which is just prior to the actual live-firings. I understand that the requirement for these certifications has caused some confusion about what efforts the Army can take during Fiscal Year 1999. I believe the law is clear with respect to what the Army should be doing. The Army was directed to commence its efforts in Fiscal Year 1999. We believe that such efforts should include, at a minimum, development of a test plan and the letting of contracts, using the $15 million provided by the Appropriations Committee, to begin the systems integration work. Is this the Chairman's understanding also?

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce implementing legislation for the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks (Protocol). Last Congress, I introduced an identical bill, S. 2191 which unfortunately the Senate did not consider. 
   This bill is part of my ongoing effort to update American intellectual property law to ensure that it serves to advance and protect American interests both here and abroad. The Protocol would help American businesses, and especially small- and medium-sized companies, protect their trademarks as they expand into international markets. Specifically, this legislation will conform American trademark application procedures to the terms of the Protocol in anticipation of the U.S.'s eventual ratification of the treaty. Ratification by the United States of this treaty would help create a ``one stop'' international trademark registration process, which would be an enormous benefit for American businesses. This bill is one of many measures I have introduced and supported over the past few years to ensure that American trademark holders receive strong protection in today's world of changing technology and complex international markets. 
   When I introduced this legislation last year, I also cosponsored S. 2193, legislation to implement the Trademark Law Treaty. S. 2193 simplified trademark registration requirements around the world by establishing a list of maximum requirements which Treaty member countries can impose on trademark applicants. The bill passed the Senate on September 17, 1998, and was signed by the President on October 30, 1998. I am proud of this legislation since all American businesses, and particularly small American businesses, will benefit as a result. 
   I have in the past supported legislation critical to keeping our trademark laws up-to-date. For example, last year I introduced S. 1727, which authorized a comprehensive study of the effects of adding new generic Top Level Domains on trademark and other intellectual property rights. This bill became law as part of the Next Generation Internet Research Act, S. 1609, which was signed into law on October 28, 1998. I also supported the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, enacted in the 104th Congress to provide intellectual property rights holders with the power to enjoin another person's commercial use of famous marks that would cause dilution of the mark's distinctive quality. 
   Together, these measures represent significant steps in our efforts to ensure that American trademark law adequately serves and promote American interests. 
   The legislation I introduce today would ease the trademark registration burden on small- and medium-sized businesses by enabling businesses to obtain trademark protection in all signatory countries with a single trademark application filed with the Patent and Trademark Office. Currently, in order for American companies to protect their trademarks abroad, they  must register their trademarks in each and every country in which protection is sought. Registering in multiple countries is a time-consuming, complicated and expensive process--a process which places a disproportionate burden on smaller American companies seeking international trademark protection. 
   Since 1891, the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks (Agreement) has provided an international trademark registration system. However, prior to adoption of the Protocol, the U.S. declined to join the Agreement because it contained terms deemed inimical to American intellectual property interests. In 1989, the terms of the Agreement were modified by the Protocol, which corrected the objectionable terms of the Agreement and made American participation a possibility. For example, under the Protocol, applications for international trademark extension can be completed in English; formerly, applications were required to be completed in French. It should be noted that the Protocol would not require substantive changes to American trademark law, but merely to certain procedures for registering trademarks. This implementing legislation is identical to legislation that passed the House last year and has been reintroduced this year as H.R. 769, by Representatives HOWARD COBLE (R-NC) and HOWARD BERMAN (D-CA). Indeed, H.R. 769 has already been reported favorably by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property. 
   To date, the Administration has resisted accession to the treaty because of voting rights disputes with the European Union. The EU has sought to retain an additional vote for itself as an intergovernmental entity, in addition to the votes of its member states. I support the Administration's efforts to negotiate a treaty based upon the equitable and democratic principle of one-state, one-vote. However, in anticipation of the eventual resolution of this dispute, the Senate has the opportunity to act now to make the technical changes to American trademark law so that once this voting dispute is satisfactorily resolved and the U.S. accedes to the Protocol, ``one-stop'' international trademark registration can become an immediate reality for all American trademark applicants. 
   I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and the sectional analysis be placed in the RECORD.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am re-introducing the ``Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 1999,'' a bill that I originally introduced during the 105th Congress. I am pleased that Senator SNOWE has agreed to co-sponsor the bill. 
   As United States Senators, we all have a responsibility as stewards for the nation and society we will be entrusting to our children and grandchildren. I became a grandfather for the first time a little over a year ago, and this duty has never been more real for me. The ``Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 1999'' is a comprehensive plan to eliminate mercury--one of the last remaining poisons without a specific control strategy--from our air, our waters and our forests. By eliminating mercury pollution from our natural resources, we will protect our nation's most important resource: the young Americans of today and tomorrow. 
   As we learned from the campaign to eliminate lead, our children are at the greatest risk from these poisons. How many future scientists, doctors, poets, and inspiring teachers have we lost in the last generation because of the toxics they have been exposed to in the womb or in early childhood? Just as with lead, we know that mercury has much graver effects on children at very low levels than it does on adults. The level of lead pollution we and our children breathe today is one-tenth what it was a decade ago. That figure by itself is a tribute to the success of the original Clean Air Act. We should strive to achieve no less with mercury. 
   Mercury is toxic in every known form and has utterly no nutritional value. At high enough levels it poisons its victims in terribly tragic ways. In Japan, victims of mercury poisoning came to be known as suffering from Minimata Disease, which took its name from the small Minimata Bay in which they caught fish for their food. 
   For years, the Chisso Company, a chlor-alkali facility that manufactured chlorine, discharged mercury contaminated pollution in the bay, which was consumed by fish and then by people. Their disease was terribly painful, causing tremors and paralysis, and sometimes leading to death. Thankfully, wholesale discharges of mercury like those in Minimata Bay have been eliminated. But a torrent of air pollution still needlessly dumps this heavy metal into the air of North America, poisoning lakes and streams, forests and fields and--most importantly--our children. Mercury control needs to be a priority now because of the neurological damage it causes. 
   This is not to say that men, women and children are doubled over in agony as they were three decades ago in Japan. Mercury pollution today is more subtle, but it is no less insidious. Wildlife are also being harmed. Endangered Florida panthers have been fatally poisoned by mercury. Loons are endangered as well. In Lake Champlain we have fish advisories for walleye, trout and bass even though we have relatively few mercury emissions within our own state 
   borders. There are now 40 states that have issued fishing advisories for mercury; Vermont's and those of 10 other states cover all of the water bodies in these states. Nearly 1,800 water bodies nationwide have mercury fishing advisories posted. The number of water bodies with mercury advisories has doubled since 1993. 
   My fellow Vermonters are exposed to mercury and other pollutants that blow across Lake Champlain and the Green Mountains every day from other regions of the country. The waste incinerators and coal-fired power plants are not accountable to the people of Vermont, and therefore a federal role is needed to control the pollution. 
   That is part of the reason voters send us here. They expect Members of the Congress to determine what is necessary to protect the public health and the environment nationally, then to take the appropriate action. And in many cases, perhaps most, we have done that. But not when it comes to mercury. 
   Mr. President, what I propose is that we put a stop to this poisoning of America. It is unnecessary, and it is wrong. Mercury can be removed from manufactured products, and much of that has been done. Mercury can be removed from coal-fired powerplants, and now that should be done. With states deregulating their utility industries, this is the right moment and the best opportunity we will have for a generation to make sure powerplants begin to internalize the costs of their pollution. We cannot afford to give them a free ride into the next century at the expense of our children's health. 
   So, too, should mercury be purged from other known sources such as chlor-alkali plants, medical waste incinerators, municipal combustion facilities, large industrial boilers, landfills, and lighting fixtures. 
   My bill directs EPA to set mercury emission standards for the largest sources of mercury emissions. The bill requires reducing emissions by 95 percent, but it also lets companies choose the best approach to meet the standard at their facility whether through the use of better technology, cleaner fuels, process changes, or product switching. 
   The bill also gives people the right-to-know about mercury emissions from the largest sources. That should be the public's right. To facilitate the public's right-to-know and getting mercury containing items out of the waste streams that feed municipal combustion facilities, it also requires labeling of mercury containing items such as fluorescent light bulbs, batteries, pharmaceuticals. The bill also begins a phaseout of mercury from products, with exceptions possible for demonstrated essential uses. 
   We will hear a lot of rhetoric about how much implementing mercury reduction steps will cost. In advance of those complaints I want to make two points. First, when we were debating controls for acid rain we heard a lot about the enormous cost of eliminating sulphur dioxide. But what we learned from the acid rain program is that when you give industry a financial incentive to clean up its act, they will find the cheapest way. More often than not, assertions about the cost of controlling pollution grossly overestimate and distort reality. If you look at electricity prices of major utilities since the acid rain program was implemented, their rates have remained below the national average and some have actually decreased--even without adjusting for inflation. The mercury controls on coal-fired power plants contained in my bill may add a little over $2 dollars per month to the electric bill of the average residential consumer who receives power from a coal-fired plant. So, for the monthly cost of a slice of pizza or a hamburger and fries we can rein in the more than 50 tons of mercury that are being pumped into our air from power plants. 
   Secondly, and most importantly, the bottom line here should not be the cost of controlling mercury emissions, but the cost of not controlling mercury. While we may not be able to calculate how many Einstein's we have lost, if we lose one the price has been too high. 
   Let us make controlling mercury pollution one of our first environmental legacies of the 21st Century.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I again urge prompt consideration and passage of Hate Crimes Prevention Act. I cosponsored this measure in the last Congress and do so again this year. This bill would amend the federal hate crimes statute to make it easier for federal law enforcement officials to investigate and prosecute cases of racial and religious violence. It would also focus the attention and resources of the federal government on the problem of hate crimes committed against people because of their sexual preference, gender, or disability. 
   As the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, I look forward to working on hearings next month on this important initiative. Violent crime motivated by prejudice demands attention from all of us. It is not a new problem, but recent incidents of hate crimes have shocked the American conscience. The beating death of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming was one of those crimes; the dragging death of James Byrd in Texas was another. The recent murder of Billy Jack Gaither in Alabama appears to be yet another. These are sensational crimes, the ones that focus public attention. But there is a toll we are paying each year in other hate crimes that find less notoriety, but with no less suffering for the victims and their families. 
   It remains painfully clear that we as a nation still have serious work to do in protecting all Americans and ensuring equal rights for all our citizens. The answer to hate and bigotry must ultimately be found in increased respect and tolerance. But strengthening our federal hate crimes legislation is a step in the right direction. Bigotry and hatred are corrosive elements in any society, but especially in a country as diverse and open as ours. We need to make clear that a bigoted attack on one or some of us diminishes each of us, and it diminishes our nation. As a nation, we must say loudly and clearly that we will defend ourselves against such violence. 
   All Americans have the right to live, travel and gather where they choose. In the past we have responded as a nation to deter and to punish violent denials of civil rights. We have enacted federal laws to protect the civil rights of all of our citizens for more than 100 years. This continues that great and honorable tradition. 
   Several of us come to this issue with backgrounds in local law enforcement. We support local law enforcement and work for initiatives that assist law enforcement. It is in that vein that I support the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which has received strong bipartisan support from state and local law enforcement organizations across the country. 
   When the Committee takes up the issue of hate crimes next month, one of the questions that must be addressed is whether the bill as drafted is sufficiently respectful of state and local law enforcement interests. I welcome such questions and believe that Congress should think carefully before federalizing prohibitions that already exist at the state level. 
   To my mind, there is nothing questionable about the notion that hate crimes warrant federal attention. As evidenced by the national outrage at the Byrd, Shepard, and Gaither murders, hate crimes have a broader and more injurious impact on our national society than ordinary street crimes. The 1991 murder in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New York, of an Hasidic Jew, Yankel Rosenbaum, by a youth later tried federally for violation of the hate crime law, showed that hate crimes may lead to civil unrest and even riots. This heightens the federal interest in such cases, warranting enhanced federal penalties, particularly if the state declines the case or does not adequately investigate or prosecute it. 
   Beyond this, hate crimes may be committed by multiple offenders who belong to hate groups that operate across state lines. Criminal activity with substantial multi-state or international aspects raises federal interests and warrants federal enforcement attention. 
   Current law already provides some measure of protection against excessive federalization by requiring the Attorney General to certify all prosecutions under the hate crimes statute as being ``in the public interest and necessary to secure substantial justice.'' We should be confident that this provision is sufficient to ensure restraint at the federal level under the broader hate crimes legislation that we introduce today. I look forward to examining that issue and considering ways to guard against unwarranted federal intrusions under this legislation. In the end, we should work on a bipartisan basis to ensure that the Hate Crimes Prevention Act operates as intended, strengthening federal jurisdiction over hate crimes as a back-up, but not a substitute, for state and local law enforcement.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, S. Con. Res. 5 expresses congressional opposition to a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state and urges President Clinton to unequivocally assert United States opposition to such a declaration. I agree with the sponsors of this resolution that it would be extremely unwise for the Palestinian Authority to take such a provocative and destabilizing step. 
   In open forums and behind closed doors the administration has expressed repeatedly its opposition to any unilateral action by either Palestinians or Israelis which would predetermine issues reserved for final status negotiations. There is no doubt that the United States firmly opposes a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state. 
   Such a declaration would be a violation of the principles contained in the Oslo Accords, and it could imperil the hard won but fragile agreement reached at Wye River. At the signing of the Wye River Memorandum, the late King Hussein said, ``we are not marking time, we are moving in the right direction.'' A unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state would throw the entire process into reverse. It would be a serious mistake. 
   So I support S. Con. Res. 5 as far as it goes, Unfortunately, it does not reflect the inescapable fact that there are two sides to the Middle East Conflict. Just as the Palestinian Authority has fallen short in its implementation of its Oslo commitments, so have some Israeli Government actions exacerbated the condition which have caused some Palestinians to demand that the issue of statehood be resolved outside the scope of the Oslo process. Many have lost the hope that was kindled by the handshake between Prime Minister Rabin and Chairman Arafat on the White House lawn in 1995. Had the resolution been better written or balanced I could have co-sponsored it. 
   Despite these setbacks, the administration has played a key role in keeping the peace process alive. Congress has been asked to provide over a billion dollars in new funding to support implementation of the Wye River Memorandum. This is funding that we are very hard-pressed to find, but lasting peace in the Middle East is in the strong interest of the United States. Just as we are doing out utmost to bring the parties together, they need to demonstrate that they are fulfilling their commitments. They must both refrain from taking provocative, unilateral actions that would jeopardize the prospects for peace and they must both be willing to take the necessary risks to ensure a safe and prosperous future for their people.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to be joined by Senators KENNEDY, DASCHLE and DORGAN in introducing the Medical Information Privacy and Security Act (MIPSA). I am also pleased that a companion bill will be introduced in the House by Congressman EDWARD MARKEY. 
   The Millennium Bug is not the only computer-related problem Congress confronts this year. We face the deadline that Congress set for itself of August 21, 1999, to solve the multitude of privacy glitches in the handling of our medical records. 
   At a time when some states are selling driving license photos and information, when our leading computer chip and software companies have built secret identifiers into their products to trace our every move in cyberspace without our consent, it is time for Congress to wake up to the privacy rights and expectations of all Americans before it is too late. 
   The trouble is this: If you have a medical record, you have a medical privacy problem. 
   A guiding principle in drafting this legislation has been that the movement to a more integrated system of health care in our country will only continue to be supported by the American people if they are assured that the personal privacy of their health care information is protected. In fact, without the confidence that one's personal privacy will be protected, many will be discouraged from seeking medical help. 
   Most of us envision that our medical records are held in a manila file folder under the watchful care of our health care provider. If this is what you are picturing, you are sorely mistaken. Increased computerization of medical records and other health information is fueling both the supply and demand for our personal information. I do not want advancing technology to lead to a loss of personal privacy, and I do not want the fear that confidentiality is being compromised to deter people from seeking medical treatment or to stifle technological or scientific development. 
   The traditional right of confidentiality between a health care provider and a patient is at risk. This erosion may reduce the willingness of patients to confide in physicians and other practitioners and may inhibit patients from seeking care. 
   Unlike some, I believe that computerization can assure more privacy to individuals than the current system, if MIPSA is enacted. But if we do not act the increased potential for embarrassment and harassment is tremendous. 
   The ability to compile, store and cross reference personal health information has made our intimate health history a valuable commodity. In 1996 alone, the health care industry spent an estimated $10 to $15 billion on information technology. 
   This data can be very useful for quality assurance, and to provide more cost effective health care. But I doubt that the American public would agree with a Fortune magazine article which lauded a health insurer that poked through the individual medical records of clients to figure out who may be depressed and could benefit from the use of the anti-depressant Prozac. Are we now encouraging the replacement of sound clinical judgment of doctors with health insurance clerks who look at records to determine whether you are not really suffering from a physical illness, but a mental illness? 
   Just a few days ago The Wall Street Journal wrote about a company that is ``seeking the mother lode in health `data mining.' '' This company wants to get medical data on millions of Americans to sell to any buyer. Currently there are no laws constraining the creation of large data bases filled with sensitive personally identifiable information on any of us. Our information is like gold to these ``data miners.'' 
   If this battle is between American families who want some privacy and big business buying access to their personal medical records, I will stand with American families every time. 
   Last year, an article in the Washington Post described the story of a woman whose prescription purchases were tracked electronically by a pharmacy benefits management company two states away, hired by her employer. With every swipe of her prescription-drug card she saved 50% on her prescriptions. At the same time, however, without her knowledge her sensitive health information was being compiled. Her doctor was soon informed that she would be enrolled in a ``depression program,'' watched for continued use of anti-depression medications, and be targeted for ``educational'' material on depression. All of this was done at the behest of her employer who had unfettered access to all of her personal health information. 
   This woman was not suffering from a depression-related illness; her doctor prescribed the medication to help her sleep. This woman had no idea that by signing up for her managed care plan she was signing up to have her personal health information disclosed to individuals she had never even met. 
   Employer access to personal health information of their workers is a real problem. A recent University of Illinois study found that 35 percent of all Fortune 500 companies regularly review health information before making hiring decisions. On-work-site health care providers have testified before Congress that they are routinely pressured for employee health information and must comply or lose their jobs. 
   What MIPSA makes clear is that there must be a ``fire wall'' between those within a company involved in providing health services and benefits, and other managers. The goal of privacy legislation is to be the first line of defense, so that individuals are not put in the situation of possibly being discriminated against. Our bill complements other laws and proposed legislation that bar discrimination based on health status. 
   We must not let privacy slide to the point that the only way for a person to ensure confidentiality 
   is to avoid seeking medical treatment. 
   The simple fact is that many patients will not agree to participate in health research or to be tested if they fear the information that is revealed in the course of the research could be released, bringing them harm. In genetic testing studies at the National Institutes of Health, thirty-two percent of eligible people who were offered a test for breast cancer risk declined to take it, citing concerns about loss of privacy and the potential for discrimination in health insurance. 
   The bill we are introducing today, the Medical Information Privacy and Security Act, would be the first comprehensive federal health privacy law. 
   Our bill is broad in scope: It applies to medical records in whatever form--paper or electronic. It applies to each release of medical information, including re-releases. It comprehensively covers entities other than just health care providers and payers, such as life insurance companies, employers and marketers and others who may have access to sensitive personal health data. 
   It gives individuals the right to inspect, copy and supplement their protected health information. 
   It allows individuals to require the segregation of portions of their medical records, such as mental health records, from broad viewing by individuals who are not directly involved in their care. 
   It gives individuals a civil right of action against anyone who misuses their personally identifiable health information. It establishes criminal and civil penalties that can be invoked if individually identifiable health information is knowingly or negligently misused. 
   It creates a set of rules and norms to govern the disclosure of personal  health information and narrows the sharing of personal details within the health care system to the minimum necessary to provide care, allow for payment and to facilitate effective oversight. Special allowances are made for situations such as emergency medical care and public health requirements. 
   We have been very careful to balance the right to privacy with the needs of providers and health care plans, who can use medical information to improve the care of patients. MIPSA does not force patients to sign a blanket authorization allowing their information to go to anyone for any purpose in order to receive care. Unfortunately, individuals now have no choice but to sign away their rights if they want any health care treatment at all. 
   MIPSA changes the authorization procedure by requiring that providers, health plans and hospitals clearly lay out to patients how their protected health information will be used, who will have access to their protected health information, and for what purpose. If anyone wants to use or disclose personally identifiable health information for a purpose that is not directly related to their treatment or billing, the patient has that right to say no without losing the ability to receive needed health care. 
   It also takes special care to make sure that important medical research continues. MIPSA extends the protective practices currently followed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to all health research efforts--whether publicly or privately funded. 
   It establishes a clear and enforceable right of privacy for all personally identifiable medical information including information regarding the results of genetic tests. 
   We have tried to accommodate legitimate oversight concerns so that we do not create unnecessary impediments to health care fraud investigations. Effective health care oversight is essential if our health care system is to function and fulfill its intended goals. Otherwise, we risk establishing a publicly sanctioned playground for the unscrupulous. Health care is too important a public investment to be the subject of undetected fraud or abuse. 
   It prohibits law enforcement agents from searching through medical records without a warrant. It does not limit law enforcement agents in gaining information while in hot pursuit of a suspect. 
   We also require anyone who maintains your medical information to have strong safeguards in place. And MIPSA offers strong enforcement provisions and remedies for the misuse of medical information. 
   It sets up a national office of health information privacy to aid consumers in learning about their rights and about how they can seek recourse for violations of their rights. 
   Most importantly, our bill does not preempt any federal or state law or regulation that offers stronger privacy safeguards. We propose a floor rather than a ceiling, achieving two goals: 
   First, a strong federal privacy law will eliminate much of the current patchwork of state laws governing the exchange of medical information, and will replace the patchwork with strong, clear standards that will apply to everyone. 
   Second, MIPSA makes room for the many possible future threats to medical privacy that we may not even anticipate today. As medical and information technology moves forward into the next century we must maintain the public's right to seek stronger medical privacy laws closer to home. 
   The elements of MIPSA are essential to any strong medical privacy effort. 
   I am encouraged that a variety of public policy and health professional organizations, across the political spectrum, are signaling their intentions to step forward to join forces with consumers during this debate. 
   We have 164 days to implement a strong federal medical privacy law. With the clock ticking toward the August deadline, let us act sooner rather than later.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation to improve the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act and am especially pleased to be joined by Senators FEINGOLD, TORRICELLI and SCHUMER as original sponsors on this law enforcement effort. I am also pleased that the senior Senator from Colorado, Senator CAMPBELL, is joining us, again, in this effort. We worked together closely and successfully last year to pass the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act into law. 
   The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act, which President Clinton signed into law on June 16, 1998, authorizes the Department of Justice to award grants to pay for half of the cost of providing bulletproof vests for State and local law enforcement officers. Beginning this month, the Department of Justice plans to open the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program so that State, county and local law enforcement agencies may receive grants to pay for half of the cost of providing body armor for their officers. The entire application and payment process for the program will occur electronically via the Internet at http://vests.ojp.gov. I am confident that this innovative process will be a great success at harnessing the power of the information age to assist law enforcement do its job better, safer and more cost effectively. I want to commend the Attorney General and the Department for making this effort. 
   To build on the success of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program, our bipartisan legislation would permit the Department of Justice to waive, in whole or in part, the matching requirement for law enforcement agencies applying for bulletproof vest grants in cases of fiscal hardship. Some police departments in smaller jurisdictions may be unable to contribute half of the cost of buying body armor for their officers. This waiver provision was included in the Campbell-Leahy version of the Act introduced last year, but was unfortunately eliminated by others during House-Senate consideration of the final legislation. 
   Our bipartisan bill is strongly supported by Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Louis Freeh and the International Association of Chiefs of Police. 
   More than ever before, police officers in Vermont and around the country face deadly threats that can strike at any time, even during routine traffic stops. Bulletproof vests save lives, and I believe this new law will put vests on our State and local law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line. 
   I look forward to working with all Senators to ensure that each and every law enforcement community in Vermont and across the nation can afford basic protection for their officers.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there have been a number of hearings on Y2K. One was held yesterday in the Judiciary Committee. And in that meeting I offered a very simple and direct principle: Our goal should be to encourage Y2K compliance. No matter how much we talk about liabilities or who is to blame, or anything else, the bottom line is for people who want to go from December 31 to January 1, at the end of this year, we should look for compliance. That is what we are doing by passing this, the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act, S. 314. It offers help to small businesses working to remedy their computer systems before the millennium bug hits. 
   I want to commend Senators BOND and KERRY for their bipartisan leadership in the Small Business Committee on this bill. It is going to support small businesses around the country in the Y2K remedial efforts. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation. 
   We know that small businesses are the backbone of our economy, whether it is the corner market in a small city, or the family farm, or a smalltown doctor. In my home State of Vermont, 98  percent of the businesses are small businesses. They have limited resources. That is why it is important to provide these small businesses with the resources to correct their Y2K problems --but to do it now. 
   Last month, for example, I hosted a Y2K conference in Vermont to help small businesses prepare for the year 2000. Hundreds of small business owners from across Vermont attended this conference. They took time out of their work so they could learn how to minimize or eliminate Y2K computer problems. Those who could not join us at the site joined us by interactive television around the State. 
   Vermonters are working hard to identify their vulnerabilities. They should be encouraged and assisted in these efforts. That is the right approach. The right approach is not to seek blame but to fix as many of the problems ahead of time as we can. Ultimately, the best business policy--actually, the best defense against Y2K-based lawsuits--is to be Y2K compliant. 
   The prospect of Y2K problems requires remedial efforts and increased compliance, not to look back on January 1 and find out who was at fault but to look forward on March 2 and say what can we do to fix it. 
   Unfortunately, not all small businesses are doing enough to address the year 2000 issue because of a lack of resources in many cases. They face Y2K problems both directly and indirectly through their suppliers, customers and financial institutions. As recently as last October the NFIB testified: ``A fifth of them do not understand that there is a Y2K problem........They are not aware of it. A fifth of them are currently taking action. A fifth have not taken action but plan to take action, and two-fifths are aware of the problem but do not plan to take any action prior to the year 2000.'' Indeed, the Small Business Administration recently warned that 330,000 small businesses are at risk of closing down as a result of Y2K problems, and another 370,000 could be temporarily or permanently hobbled. 
   Federal and State government agencies have entire departments working on this problem. Utilities, financial institutions, telecommunications companies, and other large companies have information technology divisions working to make corrections to keep their systems running. They have armies of workers--but small businesses do not. 
   Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, from the city corner market to the family farm to the small-town doctor. In my home State of Vermont, 98 percent of the businesses are small businesses with limited resources. That is why it is so important to provide small businesses with the resources to correct their Y2K problems now. 
   Last month, I hosted a Y2K conference in Vermont to help small businesses prepare for 2000. Hundreds of small business owners from across Vermont attended the conference to learn how to minimize or eliminate their Y2K computer problems. Vermonters are working hard to identify their Y2K vulnerabilities and prepare action plans to resolve them. They should be encouraged and assisted in these important efforts. 
   This is the right approach. We have to fix as many of these problems ahead of time as we can. Ultimately, the best business policy and the best defense against Y2K-based lawsuits is to be Y2K compliant. 
   I am studying the Report from our Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem and thank Chairman BENNETT and Vice Chairman DODD for the work of that Committee. I note that they are just beginning their assessment of litigation. As they indicate in the Report released today: ``The Committee plans to hold hearings and work closely with the Judiciary and Commerce Committees to make legislative proposals in this area.'' 
   I understand that the Special Committee is planning hearings on Y2K litigation soon. As best anyone has been able to indicate to me, only 52 Y2K-related lawsuits have been commenced to date. Of those, several have already been concluded with 12 having been settled and 8 dismissed. 
   At our Judiciary Committee hearing earlier this week we heard from a small businessman from Michigan who was one of the first Y2K plaintiffs in the country. He had to sue to obtain relief from a company that sold him a computer and cash register system that would not accept credit cards that expired after January 1, 2000 and crashed. 
   We also heard from an attorney who prevailed on behalf of thousands of doctors in an early Y2K class action against a company that provided medical office software that was not Y2K compliant. 
   Recent legislative proposals by Senator HATCH and by Senator MCCAIN raise many questions that need to be answered before they move forward. I look to the hearings before the Special Committee and to additional hearings before the Judiciary Committee to gather the factual information that we need in order to make good judgments about these matters. We heard Monday of a number of serious concerns from the Department of Justice with these recent proposals. Those concerns are real and need to be addressed. 
   If we do not proceed carefully, broad liability limitation legislation could reward the irresponsible at the expense of the innocent. That would not be fair or responsible. Removing accountability from the law removes one of the principal incentives to find solutions before problems develop. 
   Why would congressional consideration or passage of special immunity legislation make anyone more likely to expend the resources needed to fix its computer systems to be ready for the millennium? Is it not at least as likely to have just the opposite effect? Why should individuals, businesses and governments act comprehensively now if the law is changed to allow you to wait, see what problems develop and then use the 90-day ``cooling off'' period after receiving detailed written notice of the problem to think about coming into compliance? Why not wait and see what solutions are developed by others and draw from them later in the three-month grace period, after the harm is done and only if someone complains? 
   I would rather continue the incentives our civil justice systems allows to encourage compliance and remediation efforts now, in advance of the harm. I would rather reward responsible business owners who are already making the investments necessary to have their computer systems fixed for Y2K. 
   I sense that some may be seeking to use fear of the Y2K millennium bug to revive failed liability limitation legislation of the past. These controversial proposals may be good politics in some circles, but they are not true solutions to the Y2K problem. Instead, we should be looking to the future and creating incentives in this country and around the world for accelerating our efforts to resolve potential Y2K problems before they cause harm. 
   I also share the concerns of the Special Committee that ``disclosure of Y2K compliance is poor.'' We just do not have reliable assessments of the problem or of how compliance efforts are going. In particular, I remain especially concerned with the Special Committee's report that: ``Despite an SEC rule requiring Y2K disclosure of public corporations, companies are reluctant to report poor compliance.'' I have heard estimates that hundreds if not thousands of public companies are not in compliance with SEC disclosure rules designed to protect investors and the general public. 
   I hope that the Special Committee will follow through on its announced ``plans to address certain key sectors in 1999 where there has been extreme reluctance to disclose Y2K compliance.'' We should not be rewarding companies that have not fulfilled their disclosure responsibilities by providing them any liability limitation protections. 
   On the contrary, after all the talk earlier this year about the importance of the rule of law, we ought to do more to enforce these fundamental disclosure requirements. As the Special Committee reports: ``Without meaningful disclosure, it is impossible for firms to properly assess their own risks and develop necessary contingency plans. 
   Disclosure is also important in the context of congressional oversight. The Special Committee will continue to promote this important goal in 1999.'' The Senate should do nothing to undercut this effort toward greater disclosure in accordance with law.  
   Sweeping liability protection has the potential to do great harm. Such legislation may restrict the rights of consumers, small businesses, family farmers, State and local governments and the Federal Government from seeking redress for the harm caused by Y2K computer failures. It seeks to restructure the laws of the 50 states through federal preemption. Moreover, it runs the risk of discouraging businesses from taking responsible steps to cure their Y2K problems now before it is too late. 
   By focusing attention on liability limiting proposals instead of on the disclosures and remedial steps that need to be taken now, Congress is being distracted from what should be our principal focus--encouraging Y2K compliance and the prompt remedial efforts that are necessary now, in 1999. 
   The international aspect of this problem is also looming as one of the most important. As Americans work hard to bring our systems into compliance, we encounter a world in which other countries are not as far along in their efforts and foreign suppliers to U.S. companies pose significant risks for all of us. This observation is supported by the Report of the Special Committee, as well. We must, therefore, consider whether creating a liability limitation model will serve our interests internationally. 
   The Administration is working hard to bring the Federal Government into compliance. President Clinton decided to have the Social Security Administration's computers overhauled first and then tested and retooled and retested, again. The President was able to announce on December 28 that social security checks will be printed without any glitches in January 2000. That is progress. 
   During the last Congress, I joined with a number of other interested Senators to introduce and pass into law the consensus bill known as ``The Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act.'' We worked on a bipartisan basis with Senator BENNETT, Senator DODD, the Administration, industry representatives and others to reach agreement on a bill to facilitate information sharing to encourage Y2K compliance. The new law, enacted less than five months ago, is working to encourage companies to share Y2K solutions and test results. It promotes company-to-company information sharing while not limiting rights of consumers. 
   The North American Electric Reliability Council got a great response from its efforts to obtain detailed Y2K information from various industries. We also know that large telephone companies are sharing technical information over websites designed to assist each other in solving year 2000 problems. Under a provision I included, that law also established a National Y2K Information Clearinghouse and Website at the General Services Administration. That website is a great place for small businesses to go to get started in their Y2K efforts. 
   If, after careful study, there are other reasonable efforts that Congress can make to encourage more computer preparedness for the millennium, then we should work together to consider them and work together to implement them. 
   Legislative proposals to limit Y2K liability now pending before the Commerce and Judiciary Committees were printed in last Wednesday's CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. Given the significant impact these bills might have on State contract and tort law and the legal rights of all Americans, I trust that the Senate will allow all interested Committees to consider them carefully before rushing to pass liability limitation provisions that have not been justified or thoroughly examined. 
   The prospect of Y2K problems requires remedial efforts and increased compliance, which is what the ``Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act,'' S.314, will promote. It is not an excuse for cutting off the rights of those who will be harmed by the inaction of others, turning our States' civil justice administration upside down, or immunizing those who recklessly disregard the coming problem to the detriment of their customers and American consumers.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, every Congress in which I have served--I have served here since 1975--has focused significant attention on crime legislation. It doesn't make any difference which party controls the White House or either House of Congress, the opportunity to make our mark on the criminal law has been irresistible. In fact, more than a quarter of all the Federal criminal provisions enacted since the Civil War--a quarter of all Federal criminal provisions since the Civil War--have been enacted in the 16 years since 1980, more than 40 percent of those laws have been created since 1970. 
   In fact, at this point the total number is too high to count. Last month, a task force headed by former Attorney General Edwin Meese and organized by the American Bar Association released a comprehensive report. The best the task force could do was estimate the Federal crimes to be over 3,300. Even that doesn't count the nearly 10,000 Federal regulations authorized by Congress that carry some sort of sanction. 
   I have become increasingly concerned about the seemingly uncontrollable impulse to react to the latest headline-grabbing criminal caper with a new Federal prohibition. I have to admit, I supported some of the initiatives. Usually, the expansion of Federal authority by the creation of a new Federal crime is only incremental. Some crime proposals, however, are more sweeping, and they invite Federal enforcement authority into entirely new areas traditionally handled by State and local law enforcement. 
   In the last Congress, for example, the majority on the Senate Judiciary Committee reported to the Senate a juvenile crime bill that would have granted Federal prosecutors broad new authority to investigate and prosecute Federal crimes committed by juveniles--crimes now normally deferred to the State. In addition, it would have compelled the States to revise the manner in which they dealt with juvenile crime, overridden all the State legislatures and told them to comport with a host of new Federal mandates. I strenuously opposed this legislation on federalism and other grounds. 
   Even the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court went out of his way in his 1997 Year-End Report of the Federal Judiciary to caution against ``legislation pending in Congress to `federalize' certain juvenile crimes.'' The Meese Task Force also cites this legislation ``as an example of enhanced Federal attention where the need is neither apparent nor demonstrated.'' 
   The Meese Task Force report chided Congress for its indiscriminate passage of new Federal crimes wholly duplicative of existing State crimes. This Task Force was told by a number of people that these new Federal laws are passed not because they were needed ``but because Federal crime legislation in general is thought to be politically popular. Put another way, it is not considered politically wise to vote against crime legislation, even if it is misguided, unnecessary, and even harmful.'' We all appreciate the hard truth in this observation. 
   While the juvenile crime bill was not enacted, we have not always generated such restraint. The Meese Task Force examined a number of other Federal crimes, such as drive-by shooting, interstate domestic violence, murder committed by prison escapees, and others, that encroach on criminal activity traditionally handled by the States--almost reaching the point that jaywalking in a suburban subdivision could become a Federal crime because that street may lead to a State road which may lead to a Federal road. You see where we are going. The Task Force found that federal prosecution of those traditional State crimes was minimal or nonexistent. Given the dearth of Federal enforcement, one is tempted to conclude that maybe the Federal laws do not encroach and that any harm to State authority from passage of these laws is similarly minimal. But the task force debunks the notion that federalization is ``cost-free.'' 
   Federalizing criminal activity already covered by State criminal laws that are adequately enforced by State or local law enforcement authorities raises three significant concerns, even if the Federal enforcement authority is not exercised. 
   First, dormant Federal criminal laws may be revived at the whim of a federal prosecutor. Even the appearance--let alone the actual practice--of selectively bringing Federal prosecutions against certain individuals whose conduct also violates State laws, and the imposition of disparate Federal and State sentences for essentially the same underlying criminal conduct, offends our notions of fundamental fairness and undermines respect for the entire criminal justice system. The Task Force criticizes the ``expansive amount of unprincipled overlap in which very large amounts of conduct are susceptible to selection for prosecution as either federal or state crime is intolerable.'' 
   Second, every new Federal crime results in an expansion of Federal law enforcement jurisdiction and further concentration of policing power in the Federal government. Americans naturally distrust such concentrations of power. That is the policy underlying our posse comitatus law prohibiting the military from participating in general law enforcement activities. According to the Task Force, Federal law enforcement personnel have grown a staggering 96 percent from 1982 to 1993 compared to a growth rate of less than half that for State personnel. The Task Force correctly notes in the report that:  
   Enactment of each new federal crime bestows new federal investigative power on federal agencies, broadening their power to intrude into individual ives. Expansion of federal jurisdiction also creates the opportunity for greater collection and maintenance of data at the federal level in an era when various databases are computerized and linked.   
   Finally, and most significantly, Federal prosecutors are simply not as accountable as a local prosecutor to the people of a particular town, county or State. I was privileged to serve as a State's Attorney in Vermont for eight years, and went before the people of Chittenden County for election four times. They had the opportunity at every election to let me know what they thought of the job I was doing. 
   By contrast, Federal prosecutors are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, only two Members of which represent the people who actually reside within the jurisdiction of any particular U.S. Attorney. Federalizing otherwise local crime not only establishes a national standard for particular conduct but also allows enforcement by a Federal prosecutor, who is not directly accountable to the people against whom the law is being enforced. The Task Force warns that the ``diminution of local autonomy inherent in the imposition of national standards, without regard to local community values and without regard to any noticeable benefits, requires cautious legislative assessment.'' 
   Distrust and dismay at the exercise of Federal police power fueled the public outcry at the tragic endings of the stand-offs with Federal law enforcement authorities at Ruby Ridge in 1992 and at Waco in 1993. I participated in the Judiciary Committee oversight hearings into those incidents, and was struck that both of those standoffs were sparked by enforcement of Federal gun laws. The regulation of firearms is a subject with extraordinary variance among the States and requires great sensitivity and accountability to local mores. 
   Vermont has virtually no gun laws, and we also have one of the lowest crime rate in the country, but our laws reflect our needs. We should be very careful not just about federalizing a prohibition that already exists at most State levels, but also creating a Federal criminal prohibition where none exists at the State level, like mine. 
   Proposals to create new Federal crimes that run roughshod over highly sensitive public policy choices normally decided at the local level prompt significant concern over Federal overreaching and the exercise of Federal police power. For example, the majority on the Judiciary Committee reported in the last Congress a bill that would have made it a Federal crime to travel with a minor across State lines to get an abortion without complying with the parental consent law of the minor's home State. This law, if enacted, would invite Federal prosecutors to investigate and prosecute the violation of one State's parental consent law even if neither State would subject the conduct to criminal sanction. Establishing a national standard through creation of a new Federal crime to deal with conduct that the States have addressed in a different manner is a dangerous usurpation of local authority. 
   The death penalty is a good example. Congress has increasingly passed Federal criminal laws carrying the death penalty, even though twelve States, including Vermont, and the District of Columbia have declined to adopt the death penalty. Federal prosecutors in those States are free, with the Attorney General's approval, to buck the State's decision and seek the death penalty in certain Federal cases which have resulted in murder--for which every State has overlapping jurisdiction. In Vermont, for example, we are for the first time confronting a Federal death penalty case. These cases always present facts that could have been prosecuted by the State, and often involve high-profile cases that have generated press attention. 
   In the aftermath of a heinous murder, the public may cry out for blood vengeance. But the considered judgment of the State against the death penalty should not be easily bypassed, and Federal prosecutors should not be encouraged to find some basis for the exercise of Federal jurisdiction merely to be able to seek the death penalty. 
   The Task Force report concludes with a ``fundamental plea'' to legislators and members of the public alike ``to think carefully about the risks of excessive federalization of the criminal law and to have these risks clearly in mind when considering any proposal to enact new federal criminal laws and to add more resources and personnel to federal law enforcement agencies.'' This is a plea I commend to all Senators as we return to the business of legislating and are asked to consider any number of crime proposals in this Congress. 
   Mr. President, I urge Senators to think very carefully. We should not feel that the only way we show that we are against crime is to suddenly federalize all crimes and basically tell our State legislatures, our State law enforcement, our State prosecutors that they are insignificant. Let us resist that impulse. Maybe we can pass a resolution saying that all Senators are opposed to crime--as we are. But let the States do what they do best.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the Senate belatedly begins this congressional session, I look forward to working with the Democratic Leader, the Majority Leader, Senator HATCH, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and all Senators again this year with respect to fulfilling our constitutional duty regarding judicial nominations. 
   Last year the Senate confirmed 65 federal judges to the District Courts and Courts of Appeals around the country and to the Court of International Trade. That was 65 of the 91 nominations received for the 115 vacancies the federal judiciary experienced last year. 
   Together with the 36 judges confirmed in 1997, the total number of article III federal judges confirmed during the last Congress was a 2-year total of 101--the same total that was confirmed in one year when Democrats made up the majority of the Senate in 1994. The 104th Congress (1995-96) had resulted in a 2-year total of only 75 judges being confirmed. By way of contrast, I note that during the last two years of the Bush Administration, even including the presidential election year of 1992, a Democratic Senate confirmed 124 federal judges. 
   As we begin this year there are 64 current judicial vacancies and seven more on the horizon. In 1983, at the beginning of the 98th Congress there were only 31 vacancies. Even after the creation of 85 new judgeships in 1984, the number of vacancies had been reduced by a Democratic majority in the Senate for a Republican President to only 41 at the start of the 101st Congress in 1989. 
   After the first Republican Senate in a decade, during the 104th Congress (1995-96), the number of unfilled judicial vacancies increased for the first time in decades without the creation of any new judgeships. Vacancies went from 65 at the start of 1995, to 89 at the start of the 105th Congress in 1997. That is an increase in judicial vacancies of 37 percent without a single new judgeship having been authorized. 
   We made some progress last year when the Senate confirmed 65 judges. That only got us back to the level of vacancies that existed in 1995. If last year is to represent real progress and a change from the destructive politics of the two preceding years in which the Republican Senate confirmed only 17 and 36 judges, we need to at least duplicate those results again this year. The Senate needs to consider judicial nominations promptly and to confirm without additional delay the many fine men and women President Clinton is sending us. 
   We start this year already having received 19 judicial nominations. I am confident that many more are following in the days and weeks ahead. Unfortunately, past delays mean that 26 of the current vacancies, over 40 percent, are already judicial emergency vacancies, having been empty for more than 18 months. A dozen of the 19 nominations now pending had been received in years past. Ten are for judicial emergency vacancies. The nomination of Judge Paez to the Ninth Circuit dates back over three years to January 1996. Judge Paez along with three others were reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee to the Senate last Congress but were never considered by the full Senate. I hope that the Senate will confirm all these qualified nominees without further delay. 
   In addition to the 64 current vacancies and the seven we anticipate, there is also the longstanding request by the Federal judiciary for additional judges who are needed to hear the ever growing caseload in our Federal courts. In his 1998 Year-End Report of the Federal Judiciary, Chief Justice Rehnquist noted: ``The number of cases brought to the federal courts is one of the most serious problems facing them today.'' Criminal cases rose 15 percent in 1998, alone. Yet the Republican Congress has for the past several years simply refused to consider the authorization of the additional judges requested by the Judicial Conference. 
   In 1984 and in 1990, Congress did respond to requests for needed judicial resources by the Judicial Conference. Indeed, in 1990, a Democratic majority in the Congress created judgeships during a Republican presidential administration. 
   In 1997, the Judicial Conference of the United States requested that an additional 53 judgeships be authorized around the country. If Congress had passed the Federal Judgeship Act of 1997, S. 678, as it should have, the Federal judiciary would have 115 vacancies today. That is the more accurate measure of the needs of the federal judiciary that have been ignored by the Congress over the past several years. 
   In order to understand the impact of judicial vacancies, we need only recall that more and more of the vacancies are judicial emergencies that have been left vacant for longer periods of time. Last year the Senate adjourned with 15 nominations for judicial emergency vacancies left pending without action. Ten of the nominations received already this year are for judicial emergency vacancies. 
   In his 1997 Year-End Report, Chief Justice Rehnquist focused on the problem of ``too few judges and too much work.'' He noted the vacancy crisis and the persistence of scores of judicial emergency vacancies and observed: ``Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote.'' He went on to note: ``The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.'' 
   During the entire four years of the Bush Administration there were only three judicial nominations that were pending before the Senate for as long as 9 months before being confirmed and none took as long as a year. In 1997 alone there were 10 judicial nominations that took more than 9 months before a final favorably vote and 9 of those 10 extended over a year to a year and one-half. In 1998 another 10 confirmations extended over 9 months: Professor Fletcher's confirmation took 41 months--the longest-pending judicial nomination in the history of the United States--Hilda Tagle's confirmation took 32 months, Susan Oki Mollway's confirmation took 30 months, Ann Aiken's confirmation took 26 months, Margaret McKeown's confirmation took 24 months, Margaret Morrow's confirmation took 21 months, 
   Judge Sonia Sotomayor's confirmation took 15 months, Rebecca Pallmeyer's confirmation took 14 months, Dan Polster's confirmation took 12 months, and Victoria Roberts' confirmation took 11 months. 
   I calculate that the average number of days for those few lucky nominees who are finally confirmed is continuing to escalate. In 1996, the Republican Senate shattered the record for the average number of days from nomination to confirmation for judicial confirmation. The average rose to a record 183 days. In 1997, the average number of days from nomination to confirmation rose dramatically yet again, and that was during the first year of a presidential term. From initial nomination to confirmation, the average time it took for Senate action on the 36 judges confirmed in 1997 broke the 200-day barrier for the first time in our history. It was 212 days. Unfortunately, that time is still growing and the average is still rising to the detriment of the administration of justice. Last year, in 1998, the Senate broke the record, again. The average time from nomination to confirmation for the 65 judges confirmed in 1998 was over 230 days. 
   At each step of the process, judicial nominations are being delayed and stalled. Judge Richard Paez, Justice Ronnie L. White, Judge William J. Hibbler and Timothy Dyk were each left on the Senate calendar without action when the Senate adjourned last October. Marsha Berzon, Matthew Kennelly and others were each denied a  vote before the Judiciary Committee following a hearing. Helene N. White, Ronald M. Gould and Barry P. Goode, were among a total of 13 judicial nominees never accorded a hearing last year before the Judiciary Committee. 
   At the conclusion of the debate on the nomination of Merrick Garland to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, as 23 Republicans were preparing to vote against that exceptionally well-qualified nominee whose confirmation had been delayed 18 months, Senator HATCH said ``playing politics with judges is unfair, and I am sick of it.'' I agree with him. I look forward to a return to the days when judicial nominations are treated with the respect and attention that they deserve. 
   It is my hope that we can start in the right spirit and move in the right direction by reporting out the nominations of Timothy Dyk to the Federal Circuit; Judge Richard Paez and Marsha L. Berzon to the Ninth Circuit; William J. Hibbler and Matthew F. Kennelly to the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois; and Ronnie L. White to the District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. They have each already had confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Four of the six have previously been reported favorably by the Committee. The Senate should act to confirm these six nominees before the end of the month. 
   We should proceed to confirmation hearings for Helene N. White, Ronald M. Gould, Barry P. Goode, Lynette Norton, Legrome D. Davis and Virginia Phillips. Each of these nominations has been before the Committee for more than nine months already. It is time for us to proceed. 
   With the continued commitment of all Senators we can make real progress this year. We can help fill the longstanding vacancies that are plaguing the Federal judiciary and provide the resources needed to the administration of justice across the country.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, every Senator supports our men and women in uniform, and we all have heard the troubling retention and recruiting reports coming from the military. The Administration and Congress need to address these problems. Many items in this bill build on the President's initiative to improve compensation for our military personnel. The Armed Services Committee has added other provisions that will enhance our Nation's ability to attract and retain high-quality personnel. 
   However, it should concern us, just as it should concern our personnel in uniform, that this bill has not yet been provided for in the budget. The plain fact is that this bill is being considered at the wrong time. We should have waited until the Senate completed its annual work on a comprehensive budget framework. Social Security, Medicare, retirement of the national debt, discretionary spending and tax cuts are all issues that need to be considered at the time that we decide to commit billions to defense or any other spending program. This bill should have been considered in conjunction with the rest of the defense authorization bill, because under the currently structured budget caps, the new spending in this bill will have to be offset by other cuts in defense to pay for it, and this is an enormously expensive bill. 
   Much of this bill is warranted. I will vote for it because the effectiveness of our military depends on the quality of its personnel. This bill will improve the quality of our military, but with little regard for fiscal concerns. I hope that this does not become a trend in the 106th Congress and I expect the final concerns to be addressed in conference.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to submit a statement delivered by our colleague Senator DODD on January 8th at the commencement of the impeachment trial of President Clinton. 
   This statement, like the others delivered that day, is remarkable in several respects. 
   First, it captures the rich history that has transpired over the years in the Old Senate Chamber--a history marked often by greatness, but occasionally by shame. 
   Second, it wonderfully expresses Senator Dodd's own personal sense of the history of the Senate. His reflections on past Senators--from Roger Sherman, the Founding Father whose seat Senator DODD occupies, to his own father, former Senator Thomas Dodd--remind us that the Senate is an institution made up of individuals, and that the totality of their actions shapes the destiny not just of the Senate itself but indeed of the entire country. 
   Third, and most importantly, Senator DODD's statement stands as a powerful plea for cooperation and bipartisanship in the discharge of the Senate's profound responsibility in this trial. Senator DODD's statement played a critical role in setting the stage for the historic bipartisan agreement reached at the outset of the trial, and for the spirit of civility that prevailed throughout this ordeal. I commend Senator DODD's statement to all citizens who in the future may wish to learn something of how the Senate was inspired to conduct the impeachment trial of President Clinton in a noble and dignified manner. 
   I am beginning my 25th year in the Senate. After Senator DODD spoke I told him his speech was one of the finest I had heard in those years. 
   No Senator ever spoke more directly--or more persuasively--to other Senators about the duty we all have to the Constitution and the Senate. I am proud to serve with him.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I regret to have to return to an unfinished aspect of the Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton. 
   On February 2, I attended the deposition of Vernon Jordan as one of the Senators designated to serve as presiding officers. On February 4, the Senate approved the House Managers' motion to include a portion of that deposition in the trial record. Unfortunately, the House Managers moved to include only a portion of the videotaped deposition in the trial record and left the rest hidden from the public and subject to the confidentiality rules that governed those proceedings. 
   On Saturday, February 6, at the conclusion of his presentation, Mr. Kendall asked for permission to display the last segment of the videotaped deposition of Vernon Jordan, in which, as Mr. Kendall described it ``Mr. Jordan made a statement defending his own integrity.'' The House Managers objected to the playing of the approximately 2-minute segment of the deposition that represented Mr. Jordan's ``own statement about his integrity.'' 
   I then rose to request unanimous consent from the Senate that the segment of the videotaped deposition be allowed to be shown on the Senate floor to the Senate and the American people. There was objection from the Republican side. 
   I noted my disappointment at the time and in my February 12 remarks about the depositions. After the conclusion of the voting on the Articles of Impeachment and before the adjournment of the court of impeachment, unanimous consent was finally granted to include the ``full written transcripts'' of the depositions in the public record of the trial. As far as I can tell, however, the statement of integrity by Mr. Jordan has yet to be published in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
   I regret that the Senate chose to prohibit the viewing of the videotape of this powerful personal statement during the trial. I regret that it continues to be restricted from public viewing.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Chief Justice, like others, I want to thank you for your professionalism and good humor in these proceedings even though I suspect there are days that both you and I wish we were back at our homes in Vermont rather than here. 
   But I want to tell the Senators also of an extraordinary day that my good friend, Senator STEVENS of Alaska, and I spent. We left Sunday afternoon from Washington for the funeral of King Hussein of Jordan. We came back at about 2 o'clock yesterday morning. The delegation was an extraordinary one: Two other Members of Congress, senior members of the President's staff; even the parents of the King's widow, Queen Noor of Jordan, were with us. 
   And the airplane, Air Force One, that is so recognizable around the world as a symbol of America, underscored our country's presence even as it landed. And TED will recall the TV was on in the plane. We could see they interrupted national television in Jordan to show our plane landing. What was most remarkable to the people assembled from around the world for the funeral was the dramatic appearance not only of the President of the United States, William Jefferson Clinton, but three former U.S. Presidents--Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George Bush--they joined with President Clinton as an extraordinary demonstration not only of bipartisanship but of a united American commitment to the peace policies of King Hussein, and the U.S. role in a continuing peace process. 
   The symbol of American presence and the American continuity could not have been stronger with these four Presidents. It was a privilege to be there, a privilege I will always cherish. 
   In the frenetic hours on the ground, I observed the leaders from the Middle East and around the world. 
   I saw leader after leader making a strong effort to come to President Clinton and to speak with him. I listened to his conversation. It was clear to me he had a very good understanding of the issues that faced not only our country, but their country, and an understanding about how America's interest affect all of us. 
   Probably the greatest contrast was in President Clinton's brief meeting with Boris Yeltsin, the President of Russia, a country that long symbolized our polar opposite during the cold war. We saw an aging President Yeltsin, unable to stand without two men helping him, a man who had to leave very shortly thereafter--well before the funeral was over--because his strength had faded. What a contrast. 
   We saw a dynamic Tony Blair, the Prime Minister of England. We saw the leaders of Israel, Japan, Syria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Pakistan, India, Germany, France, Ireland, Egypt, and others coming together, brought together by their respect for King Hussein. Much of their attention was focused on the leader of the United States. 
   The questions raised by this trial came back to me. I thought, do we  abandon our elected leader because of concern about his personal conduct? Now, if this question was in my mind, it was in the minds of a lot of people there. I have been privileged to know many of them, and many asked me the question, Are we really serious about impeachment and removal? They asked that because they said the United States is not a parliamentary system of government, and the one thing that they can rely on is when we elect a President, even if it is not the President they wished we had elected, there are 4 years to deal with him and they can determine their foreign policy with the most powerful Nation on Earth accordingly. 
   They said they have great respect for our strength and leadership, and they asked if it is really possible that partisanship in the Congress could destroy that heritage overnight. 
   In my notes, as I flew back throughout the dark night, I asked myself, Are we going to spend our heritage of continuity and strength this way? Are we going to convict the President on these charges in this record? Are we going to destroy a heritage and continuity we earned, from our own Revolution, through a Civil War, through World Wars, through deaths and assassinations of Presidents, through great economic prosperity and devastating recession and depression. I completed my notes by writing, ``It is no longer a question of whether we do this to Bill Clinton, but whether we do it to ourselves.'' 
   The record of this impeachment trial is a time capsule. We leave it for succeeding generations. As the trial began, we reopened the records of 1868. I looked at those records. I thought, someday someone will review ours in the same way. We leave behind a trail of precedents. Our successors will try to understand them. If we act wisely, they will try to emulate it. Our actions can stir a chord that will vibrate throughout the history of our Republic. 
   So in explaining my decisions in this trial, I know that I am addressing myself to fellow Vermonters and fellow Senators, but also to future generations. In that future generation is my own grandson and perhaps even his grandchildren. 
   The conclusion I have reached on the articles of impeachment is imbued with this solemn knowledge and sense of duty. My conclusion is we must not avenge the faults of William Jefferson Clinton upon our Nation, our children and our Constitution. 
   Extreme partisanship and prosecutorial zealotry have strained this process in its critical early junctures. Partisan impeachments are lacking in credibility. The framers knew this. We all know this. 
   Socrates said: ``The greatest flood has soonest ebb; the sorest tempest, the most sudden calm.'' 
   In many ways, I say to my friends, especially our two distinguished leaders who worked so hard on this, in many ways the Senate's work has been the calm after the storm. We began the 106th Congress, the last of the 20th century, facing a challenge no Senate has been called upon to address since the aftermath of the Civil War. We took a special oath administered to Senators who must determine whether to override the election by the people of the United States of their President and remove him from office. 
   The Constitution purposely restrains the Congress, and carefully circumscribes our powers to remove the head of the executive branch of the Federal Government. The Constitution intentionally makes it difficult to override the electoral judgment of the American people. I will cast my vote wary of the dangers posed by the House managers' seductive invitation to vote to remove the President for symbolic purposes. 
   We all agree the President's conduct was inexcusable. It was deeply disappointing, especially to those who know the President and who support the many good things he has done for this country and the world. His conduct in trying to keep this relationship secret from his wife and family, his friends and associates, from the public glare of a politically charged lawsuit, may be understandable on the human level, but it has had serious consequences for him personally and for the legacy of his Presidency. 
   The President has admitted before a Federal grand jury terribly embarrassing personal conduct and has seen a videotape of that grand jury testimony broadcast to the entire Nation, with excerpts replayed over and over again. This modern day version of the public stockade has been difficult to witness for those who know this man and his family and care about them. 
   The Jones lawsuit has now been settled and $850,000 has been paid on a case that the District Court judge had dismissed for failing to state a claim. 
   The Clinton Presidency has been permanently tarnished. The Senate trial provided a forum to replay the embarrassing and humiliating facts of the President's improper relationship. No one cay say the Presidency has emerged unscathed. 
   For me, the most regrettable action is the nationally televised statement to the American people, where he shook his finger defiantly and said the allegations were untrue. That was not charged in the articles of impeachment, but it was intended to mislead the American people. That statement was wrong. And even though he later apologized for his action, I feel strongly that no President should so intentionally deceive the American people. 
   But condemning the President is not the purpose of the impeachment trial. Impeachment cannot be about punishing the officeholder. One of the predecessors of mine and of Senator JEFFORDS, Senator George Edmunds of Vermont, explained in 1868, that:  
   [p]unishment by impeachment does not exist under our Constitution......[The accused] can only be removed from the office he fills and prevented from holding office, not as punishment, but as a means merely of protection to the community......  
   So our focus has to be on whether conduct which the House has charged has been proven and warrants President Clinton's removal from office to protect the public. 
   The President's indiscretions alone did not bring us to this point. Raising this matter to the level of a constitutional impeachment only began with the referral from the special prosecutor, Kenneth Starr. Justice Robert Jackson, when he was attorney general, observed that the most dangerous power of prosecutors is the power to ``pick people that he thinks he should get rather than cases that need to be prosecuted.'' I am concerned that is what has happened in the case of President Clinton. 
   Does anyone recall after the fruitless years of investigation of this President, the past year of upheaval, that it was the talking points given to Ms. Tripp by Ms. Lewinsky which were supposed to be the smoking gun that proved a vast conspiracy to suborning perjury? I don't think anybody doubts Ms. Lewinsky's account that she wrote the talking points based on her discussions with Ms. Linda Tripp, and she never discussed them with the President. 
   Monica Lewinsky consistently maintained that no one ever asked or encouraged her to lie; she was never promised a job for her silence. Indeed, in her 24th interview, the Senate videotaped deposition demanded by the House managers, she testified to her own purposes in keeping her relationship secret. She acted in what she thought was her own best interests. She sought to conceal this relationship because she did not want to be humiliated in front of the whole world. And the record establishes it was Linda Tripp rather than President Clinton who acted in the conflicting roles as Ms. Lewinsky's intimate confidante and ultimate betrayer. 
   As a former prosecutor, one of the questions I asked is whether these criminal charges of perjury and obstruction would have been brought against Bill Jones rather than Bill Clinton. Experienced prosecutors, Republican and Democrat, testified before the House Judiciary Committee that no prosecutor would have proceeded based on the record compiled by Mr. Starr, and prosecutors I have talked to have said they wouldn't even get to a jury with it. As a former prosecutor, I agree and note that during the course of the Senate proceeding, the case has gotten weaker. 
   The testimony in the record shows that Ms. Lewinsky had no intention of revealing her relationship with the President. She is the person who originated and carried out the plan to hide certain gifts from the Jones lawyers.  The only crimes shown to possibly have occurred are not high crimes but those for which Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Tripp have already received immunity from prosecution from Ken Starr. To influence our judgment, the managers have argued that the consequences of the President's acquittal of their unproven charges would be dire for our children, I have been married for 37 years to a woman I love; my wife and I have raised three wonderful children. I don't need the House of Representatives to tell me how to raise my children. I trust the parents of America to raise their children, to explain what the President did was wrong, to point out the humiliation and other consequences brought on himself and his Presidency. That is not our the Congress' job. That is the job for parents in this country. 
   I don't believe the Constitution calls upon us to remove a duly elected President for symbolic purposes. Rather, I believe the precedent set by conviction without proof and removal without constitutional justification would be far more dangerous for our Republic than his actions. 
   The House managers have warned that should the President be acquitted, it would damage the ``rule of law.'' I strongly disagree, because the supreme rule of law in this country is the Constitution; that is what we have to uphold. 
   Partisan impeachment drives are doomed to fail. The Senate must restore sanity to this impeachment process. We must exercise judgment and do justice. We have to act in the interest of the Nation. History will judge us based on whether this case was resolved in a way that serves the good of the country, not the political ends of any party or the fortunes of any person. 
   We have all talked about President Andrew Johnson's impeachment. Few people will recall that after the unsuccessful effort to remove him from office, former President Johnson returned to serve this country as a U.S. Senator. I look forward to the day when the Senate can close our work as an impeachment court and that we can all return to our work--our important work we face as U.S. Senators representing our States. 
   I have served here with 259 Senators, including the 100 here now. I have respected all of you. I have had great affection for many of you on both sides of the aisle. I count among my best friends many Senators on both sides of the aisle. This is a difficult time. I will not question any Senator's vote on this. But the Senator from Vermont cannot vote to convict and I will not. 
   Thank you.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, no matter how each of us viewed the evidence in this case and no matter how each of us voted, we all share common relief that the impeachment trial of William Jefferson Clinton is concluding. In many respects, this was uncharted territory for us. We all felt the weight of history and precedent as we made our decisions on how to proceed. 
   With this in mind, the procedures developed and followed for the three depositions taken during the course of this trial should be made a part of the record of this impeachment trial. Unfortunately, the complete depositions were not introduced into evidence and made a part of the Senate trial record until after the vote on the Articles themselves. Instead, at the request of the House Managers, the only parts introduced into evidence before then were those ``from the point that each witness is sworn to testify under oath to the end of any direct response to the last question posed by a party.'' (Cong. Rec., Jan. 4, 1999, p. S1209). 
   I served as one of the six Presiding Officers at the depositions and attended all of them. In particular, I wish to thank Senators DODD and EDWARDS for serving with me, and Senator DEWINE with whom I jointly presided. 
   The decisions made during those depositions may provide guidance in the future should any other Senate be confronted with challenges similar to those that we have confronted. For that reason, I have described below the manner in which we reached our decisions and summarize the issues we resolved both before and during the depositions of Monica S. Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan, and Sidney Blumenthal. 
   I thank Thomas Griffith, Morgan Frankel and Chris Bryant in the Senate Legal Counsel's office for their assistance during the depositions and in preparing this summary of the rules and procedures.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Chief Justice, and I appreciate the courtesy of my good friend from Mississippi, I notice, as he has, that there are a lot of empty seats here in the Chamber. I realize at one time we thought we were coming in at noon, to have committee meetings. 
   If these statements are not made in the RECORD, the only time we are going to have a chance to discuss with each other what our thoughts are is in this closed session, by being here. I also think, in respect to the Chief Justice, we should be doing that. 
   I am inclined, I would say to my friend from Mississippi, 
   to suggest the absence of a quorum. I am withholding, just for a moment, doing that. But if we are going to be off in committee meetings, I don't think that does service to the intent of this closed door hearing. 
   I hope that both leaders--and I have discussed this with the distinguished Democratic leader, too--would urge Members to be here. Nothing could be more important than this on our agenda today and tomorrow.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with Senator MCCAIN to introduce the Congressional Openness Act of 1999. I want to thank Senators ABRAHAM, ENZI, LOTT and ROBB for joining us as original cosponsors. 
   Our bipartisan legislation makes certain Congressional Research Service products, lobbyist disclosure reports and Senate gift disclosure forms available over the Internet to the American people. 
   The Congressional Research Service (CRS) has a well-known reputation for producing high-quality reports and information briefs that are unbiased, concise, and accurate. The taxpayers of this country, who pay $65 million a year to fund the CRS, deserve speedy access to these public resources and have a right to see that their money is being spent well. 
   The goal of our legislation to allow every citizen the same access to the wealth of information at the Congressional Research Service (CRS) as a Member of Congress enjoys today. CRS performs invaluable research and produces first-rate reports on hundreds of topics. American taxpayers have every right to direct access to these wonderful resources. 
   Online CRS reports will serve an important role in informing the public. Members of the public will be able to read these CRS products and receive a concise, accurate summary of the issues before the Congress. As elected representatives, we should do what we can to promote an informed, educated public. The educated voter is best able to make decisions and petition us to do the right things here in Congress. 
   Our legislation also ensures that private CRS products will remain protected by giving the CRS Director the authority to hold back any products that are deemed confidential. Moreover, the Director may protect the identity of CRS researchers and any copyrighted material. We can do both--protect confidential material and empower our citizens through electronic access to invaluable CRS products. 
   In addition, the Congressional Openness Act would provide public online access to lobbyist reports and gift disclosure forms. At present, these public records are available in the Senate Office of Public Records in Room 232 of the Hart Building. As a practical matter, these public records are accessible only to those inside the Beltway. 
   The Internet offers us a unique opportunity to allow the American people to have everyday access to this public information. Our bipartisan legislation would harness the power of the Information Age to allow average citizens to see these public records of the Senate in their official form, in context and without editorial comment. All Americans would have timely access to the information that we already have voted to give them. 
   And all of these reports are indeed ``public'' for those who can afford to hire a lawyer or lobbyist or who can afford to travel to Washington to come to the Office of Public Records in the Hart Building and read them. That is not very public. That does not do very much for the average voter in Vermont or the rest of this country outside of easy reach of Washington. That does not meet the spirit in which we voted to make these materials public, when we voted ``disclosure'' laws. 
   We can do better, and this bill does better. Any citizen in any corner of this country with access to a computer at home or the office or at the public library will be able to get on the Internet and for the first time read these public documents and learn the information which we have said must be disclosed. 
   It also is important that citizens will be able to get the information in its original, official form. At present, the information may be selected by an interested party who can afford to send a lawyer or lobbyist to the Hart Building to cull through the information. Selected information then may--or may not--be given to the press and public with commentary. Our bipartisan legislation allows citizens to get accurate information themselves, the full information in context and without editorial comment. It allows individual citizens to check the facts, to make comparisons, and to make up their own minds. 
   I want to commend the Senior Senator from Arizona for his leadership on opening public access to Congressional documents. I share his desire for the American people to have electronic access to many more Congressional resources. I look forward to working with him in the days to come on harnessing the power of the information age to open up the halls of Congress to all our citizens. 
   This is not a partisan issue; it is a good government issue. That is why the Congressional Openness Act is endorsed by such a diverse group of organizations as the Congressional Accountability Project, American Association of Law Libraries, American Conservation Union, American Society of Newspaper Editors, Common Cause, Computer & Communications Industry Association, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, Consumer Project on Technology, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics, League of Women Voters of the U.S., National Association of Manufacturers, National Citizens Communications Lobby, National Newspaper Association, National Taxpayers Union, NetAction, OMB Watch, Project of Government Oversight, Public Citizen, Radio-Television News Directors Association, Reform Party of the United States, Taxpayers for Common Sense and U.S. Public Interest Research Group. I want to thank each of these organizations for their support. 
   As Thomas Jefferson wrote, ``Information is the currency of democracy.'' Our democracy is stronger if all citizens have equal access to at least that type of currency, and that is something which Members on both sides of the aisle can celebrate and join in. 
   The Congressional Openness Act is an important step in informing and empowering American citizens. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation to make available useful Congressional information to the American people.

    Mr. LEAHY. In relation to the earlier vote, I have these thoughts. Accustomed as we and the American people are to having our proceedings in the Senate open to the public and subject to press coverage, the most striking prescription in the ``Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate when Sitting on Impeachment Trials'' has been the closed deliberations required on any question, motion and now on the final vote on the Articles of Impeachment. 
   The requirement of closed deliberation more than any other rule reflects the age in which the rules were originally adopted in 1868. Even in 1868, however, not everyone favored secrecy. During the trial of President Johnson, the senior Senator from Vermont, George F. Edmunds, moved to have the closed deliberations on the Articles transcribed and officially reported ``in order that the world might know, without diminution or exaggeration, the reasons and views upon which we proceed to our judgment.'' [Cong. Globe Supp'l, Impeachment Trial of President Andrew Johnson, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., vol. 4, p. 424.] The motion was tabled. 
   In the 130 years that have passed since that time, the Senate has seen the advent of television in the Senate Chamber, instant communication and rapid news cycles, distribution of Senate documents over the Internet, the addition of 46 Senators representing 23 additional States, and the direct election of Senators by the people in our States. 
   Opening deliberations would help further the dual purposes of our rules to promote fairness and political accountability in the impeachment process. I supported the motion by Senators HARKIN, WELLSTONE and others to suspend this rule requiring closed deliberations and to open our deliberations on Senator BYRD's motion to dismiss and at other points earlier in this trial. We were unsuccessful. Now that we are approaching our final deliberations on the Articles of Impeachment, themselves, I hope that this secrecy rule will be suspended so that the Senate's deliberations are open and the American people can see them. In a matter of this historic importance, the American people should be able to witness their Senators' deliberations. 
   Some have indicated objection to opening our final deliberations because petit juries in courts of law conduct their deliberations in secret. Analogies to juries in courts of law are misplaced. I was privileged to serve as a prosecutor for eight years before I was elected to the Senate. As a prosecutor, I represented the people of Vermont in court and before juries on numerous occasions. I fully appreciate the traditions and importance of allowing jurors to deliberate and make their decisions privately, without intrusion or pressure from the parties, the judge or the public. The sanctity of the jury deliberation room ensures the integrity and fairness of our judicial system. 
   The Senate sitting as an impeachment court is unlike any jury in any civil or criminal case. A jury in a court of law is chosen specifically because the jurors have no connection or relation to the parties or their lawyers and no familiarity with the allegations. Keeping the deliberations of regular juries secret ensures that as they reach their final decision, they are free from outside influences or pressure. 
   As the Chief Justice made clear on the third day of the impeachment trial, the Senate is more than a jury; it is a court. Courts are called upon to explain the reasons for decisions. 
   Furthermore, to the extent the Senate is called upon to evaluate the evidence as is a jury, we stand in different shoes than any juror in a court of law. We all know many of the people who have been witnesses in this matter; we all know the Republican Managers--indeed, one Senator is a brother of one of the Managers; and we were familiar with the underlying allegations in this case before the Republican Managers ever began their presentation. 
   Because we are a different sort of jury, we shoulder a heavier burden in explaining the reasons for the decisions we make here. I appreciate why Senators would want to have certain of our deliberations in closed session: to avoid embarrassment to and protect the privacy of persons who may be discussed. Yet, on the critical decisions we are now being called upon to make our votes on the Articles themselves, allowing our deliberations to be open to the public helps assure the American people that the decisions we make are for 
   the right reasons. 
   In 1974, when the Senate was preparing itself for the anticipated impeachment trial of former President Richard Nixon, the Committee on Rules and Administration discussed the issue of allowing television coverage of the Senate trial. Such coverage did not become routine in the Senate until later in 1986. In urging such coverage of the possible impeachment trial of President Nixon, Senator Metcalf (D-MT), explained:  
   Given the fact that the party not in control of the White House is the majority party in the Senate, the need for broadcast media access is even more compelling. Charges of a `kangaroo court,' or a `lynch mob proceeding' must not be given an opportunity to gain any credence whatsoever. Americans must be able to see for themselves what is occurring. An impeachment trial must not be perceived by the public as a mysterious process, filtered through the perceptions of third parties. The procedure whereby the individual elected to the most powerful office in the world can be lawfully removed must command the highest possible level of acceptance from the electorate.'' (Hrg. August 5 and 6, 1974, p. 37).  
   Opening deliberation will ensure complete and accurate public understanding of the proceedings and the reasons for the decisions we make here. Opening our deliberations on our votes on the Articles would tell the American people why each of us voted the way we did. 
   The last time this issue was actually taken up and voted on by the Senate was more than a century ago in 1876, during the impeachment trial of Secretary of War William Belknap. Without debate or deliberation, the Senate refused then to open the deliberations of the Senate to the public. That was before Senators were elected directly by the people of their State, that was before the Freedom of Information Act confirmed the right of the people to see how government decisions are made. Keeping closed our deliberations is wholly inconsistent with the progress we have made over the last century to make our government more accountable to the people. 
   Constitutional scholar Michael Gerhardt noted in his important book, ``The Federal Impeachment Process,'' that ``the Senate is ideally suited for balancing the tasks of making policy and finding facts (as required in impeachment trials) with political accountability.'' Public access to the reasons each Senator gives for his vote on the Articles is vital for the political accountability that is the hallmark of our role. 
   I likewise urge the Senate to adjust these 130-year-old rules to allow the Senate's votes on the Articles of Impeachment to be recorded for history by news photographers. This is an momentous official and public event in the annals of the Senate and in the history of the nation. This is a moment of history that should be documented for both its contemporary and its lasting significance. 
   Open deliberation ensures complete accountability to the American people. Charles Black wrote that presidential impeachment ``unseats the person the  people have deliberately chosen for the office.'' ``Impeachment: A Handbook,'' at 17. The American people must be able to judge if their elected representatives have chosen for or against conviction for reasons they understand, even if they disagree. To bar the American people from observing the deliberations that result in these important decisions is unfair and undemocratic. 
   The Senate should have suspended the rules so that our deliberations on the final question of whether to convict the President of these Articles of Impeachment were held in open session.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to have Senators TORRICELLI, DEWINE, JEFFORDS, KENNEDY, HARKIN, MIKULSKI, LEVIN, KERRY, MURRAY and BOXER join me today to reauthorize a program that has helped hundreds of farmers across the country save their farms and stay in the business of farming. Today, we are introducing a bill to reauthorize the Farmland Protection Program at a funding level of $55 million a year. This new authorization supports the efforts of President Clinton to restart the program with $50 million in Fiscal Year 2000. 
   Since its creation in the 1996 Farm Bill, the Farmland Protection Program has been instrumental in curbing the loss of some of our nation's most productive farmland to urban sprawl. The Farmland Protection Program help shield farmers from development pressures by providing federal matching grants to state and local conservation organizations to purchase easements on farms. 
   We have all seen the impact of urban sprawl in our home states, whether it be large, multi-tract housing or mega-malls that bring national superstores and nation-sized parking lots. We are losing farmland across the country at an alarming rate. This bill will step up our efforts to halt this disturbing trend before too many of America's farms are permanently transformed into asphalt jungles. 
   In Vermont, we are also seeing the impact of development on our farmland. Increasing land prices and development pressure have forced too many Vermont farmers to sell to developers instead of passing on their farms to the next generation. With the former Farms for the Future program and the Farmland Protection Program, farmers now have a fighting chance against development. Since its inception in Vermont, these programs have helped conserve 78,000 acres of land on more than 220 Vermont farms. 
   The success of the program should not just be measured in acres though. The program also has helped farmers expand and re-invest in farm facilities and equipment. Some of the farm projects have also led to construction of affordable housing and preservation of wildlife habitat. There are now success stories all over Vermont. One is the story of Paul and Marian Connor of Bridport, Vermont. Working with the Vermont Land Trust they were able to conserve their 221-acre farm while continuing their dairy operation, raising seven children and retire their mortgage. 
   Although Vermont is making great progress, across the nation we continue to lose as much as one million acres of prime farmland annually. This land is critically important to agriculture. For example, nearly three-quarters of America's dairy products, fruits and vegetables are grown in counties affected by urban growth. 
   For American farmers and ranchers, farmland protection is an issue of the survival of both family farms and agricultural regions. When urban pressure pushes up the value of agricultural land above its agricultural value, it threatens the end of family farms because the next generation simply cannot afford to farm land valued at development prices. As some farmers sell their land for development, it places increasing pressure on their neighbors to sell as well. 
   The 1996 Farm Bill recognized this problem by directly providing $35 million for farmland protection matching funds that have leveraged million more from local and private programs. The Farmland Protection Program is a model of what new federal conservation programs ought to be, enjoying the unanimous support of the National Governors Association. It preserves the private property rights of farmers. 
   It offers the Congress a way to demonstrate a realistic and meaningful commitment to the conservation of America's natural heritage without expanding the role of the federal government, and it encourages local communities and states to contribute their own efforts. The program's overwhelming success though has led to increased demand for the program--applicants requested a federal match of more than $130 million. 
   Our bill will help address some of this demand and encourage more state governments, local communities and private groups to start new matching programs. This modest federal investment will maintain our commitment to the protection of our rural heritage and working landscape.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator HUTCHISON and Senator GRAHAM and a bipartisan group of my colleagues to introduce legislation to prohibit the Federal government from recouping any part of the multi-state settlement between the tobacco industry and the State Attorneys General. 
   To the surprise of many state officials, the Health Care Financing Administration has threatened to seek reimbursement for its share of Medicaid costs for treating tobacco-related diseases from the multi-state tobacco settlement. In other words, the Federal government may want to take more than half of the total multi-state settlement based on the federal share of Medicaid, which is approximately 60 percent of total Medicaid costs. 
   For my home State of Vermont, that means the Federal government may try to take more than $15 million annually out of Vermont's share of the settlement. Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell settled with the tobacco industry for more than $800 million to be distributed over the next 25 years. But now the Federal government may seek more than $400 million of Vermont's tobacco settlement for its own use. 
   Washington State Attorney General Christine Gregoire, one of the lead attorneys generals in the settlement negotiations with the tobacco industry, recently stated: ``These lawsuits were brought by the States based on violations by the industry of state laws. The settlement was won by the states without any assistance from Congress or the Administration. As far as we are concerned the States did all the work and are entitled to every dollar of their allocated share to invest in the future health care of their citizens.'' I could not agree more with General Gregoire. 
   The States, not the Federal government, deserve the full amount of their settlements because the States and their Attorneys General took the risks in bringing the novel lawsuits against Big Tobacco. Without the willingness of the State Attorneys General acting on behalf of the citizens of their states and taking significant financial and professional risks and pursuing these matters so diligently, we would not have any legal settlements by the tobacco industry. These State Attorneys General deserve our gratitude and our respect for their extraordinary efforts. I commend them all for their diligence on behalf of the public. 
   When tobacco companies were fighting any and all lawsuits against them, the State Attorneys General pursued their legal challenges against great odds. Men and women whose lives were cut short by cancer and other adverse health consequences from tobacco deserved better treatment than the years of obstruction and denial by the tobacco industry. Only now as the internal documents are being disclosed and the legal tide is beginning to turn have tobacco companies decided to change their strategy and pursue settlements. The tobacco industry did not agreed to these settlements out of some new found sense of public duty. The truth is that giant tobacco corporations came to the bargaining table only after they realized that they might lose in court. 
   In my home state, General Sorrell took the financial and legal risks in bringing suit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the people of Vermont. General Sorrell and his legal team put together a powerful case in support of the public health of all Vermonters. General Sorrell did this without any assistance from the Federal government. As a result, the people of Vermont deserve the full amount of their tobacco settlement. 
   If the Federal government wants to recover its costs for tobacco-related diseases, the appropriate avenue to do that is a Federal lawsuit. Indeed, President Clinton announced during the recent State Of The Union address that the Department of Justice is planning litigation against the tobacco industry. I applaud the President and Attorney General Reno for pursuing legal action against the tobacco industry so that the Federal government may recoup its costs for tobacco-related diseases. That is the proper approach for the Federal government. 
   The multi-state tobacco settlement provides an historic opportunity to improve the public health in Vermont and across the nation. I believe that the States, not the Federal government, are in the best position to determine their public health needs. Our bipartisan bill grants the States that flexibility by permitting each state to use its settlement payments in whatever way that state deems best. 
   That is why the National Governors Association, National Association of Attorneys General, National Conference of State Legislatures, National Association of Counties, National League of Cities, and U.S. Conference of Mayors support our bipartisan legislation. In my home state, our bipartisan bill is supported by Governor Dean, Attorney General Sorrell, the Vermont Health Access Oversight Committee, and the Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems. 
   I want Governor Dean and the Vermont legislature to have the flexibility to use Vermont's settlement funds in whatever way they deem is best for the public health of Vermonters. It is only fair for the other 49 Governors and state legislatures to have that same flexibility to use their settlement funds in whatever way they deem is best for their citizens. 
   In the final analysis, I trust the people of Vermont and the other 49 States to determine how best to use their tobacco settlement funds. I look forward to working with my colleagues as Congress moves forward on legislation to ensure that the interests of Vermont and the other States are protected in the multi-state tobacco settlement.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the House Managers want to conduct depositions of at least four people and their requests to admit affidavits could very well lead to the depositions of at least three others and, indeed, many more witnesses. The three people they expressly ask be subpoenaed are Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal. All three have previously testified before the Starr grand jury and Ms. Lewinsky has been interviewed or testified at least 23 times on these matters over the last year. 
   The fourth deponent requested by the House Managers is none other than the President of the United States. Although they characterize their request  as a ``petition'' that the President be requested to appear, in their Memorandum, the House Republican Managers are less coy about their request. They note that ``obtaining testimony from the witness named in the motion, and additionally from the President himself'' is what they seek. 
   The House Manager' request is unprecedented in impeachments. The Senate has never formally requested or demanded that a respondent testify in his own impeachment trial. Should the President decide that he wants to speak to the Senate, that would be his choice. But I cannot support an effort that would have the Senate reject over 200 years of our jurisprudence and begin requiring an accused to prove his innocence. 
   The presumption of innocence is a core concept in our rule of law and should not be so cavalierly abandoned. The petition of the House Managers is a clever but destructive effort to stand this trial on its head. As a former prosecutor and trial attorney, I appreciate the temptation to turn the tables on an accused person to make up for a weak case, but the Senate should not condone it. The burden of proof is on the House to establish why the Senate should convict and remove from office the person the American people elected to serve as their President. 
   I commend President Clinton for focussing on his duties as President and on moving the country forward. That the Congress remains immersed in this impeachment trial is distraction enough from the functions of our federal government. We have heard hours of argument from the House Republican Managers and the response of the President's lawyers. Senator BYRD has, pursuant to our Unanimous Consent Resolution governing these proceedings, offered a motion to dismiss to bring this entire matter to conclusion. If, on the other hand, the majority in the Senate wishes to continue these proceedings, that is the majority's prerogative. 
   The House Managers apparently want to excuse the weaknesses in their case by blaming the Senate for not calling the President to the stand or the President for not volunteering to run the gauntlet of House Managers. Having had the House reject their proposed article of impeachment based on the President's deposition in the Jones case, the House Managers are left to pursue their shifting allegations of perjury 
    before the grand jury. Their allegations of perjury have devolved to semantical differences and the choice of such words as ``occasional'' and ``on certain occasions.'' Their view of perjury allows them to take a part of a statement out of context and say that it is actionable for not explicating all relevant facts and circumstances. They view perjury by a standard that would condemn most presentations, even some of their own presentations before the Senate. 
   In addition to their request that the President be deposed, the House Republican Managers also propose to include in this record affidavits and other materials apparently not part of the record provided by Mr. Starr or considered by the House. Ironically, in so doing, they have chosen to proceed by affidavit. They must know that by proffering the declaration of an attorney for Paula Jones about that case and the link between that now settled matter and the Starr investigation, they are necessarily opening this area to possible extensive discovery that could result in the depositions of additional witnesses, as well. 
   Does anyone think that the Senate record can fairly be limited to the proffered declaration of Mr. Holmes without giving the President an opportunity to depose him and other relevant witnesses after fair discovery? The links between the Jones case and the Starr investigation will be fair game for examination in the fullness of time if the Holmes declaration proffered by the House Managers is accepted. 
   The Holmes declaration is at variance with the House Managers' proffer. The declaration suggests that the Jones lawyers made a collective decision, whereas the House Managers suggest that the decision to subpoena Ms. Currie was Mr. Holmes' decision. Mr. Holmes declares that no Washington Post article played any part in his decisionmaking to subpoena Ms. Currie and that the ``does not recall'' any attorney in his firm saying anything about such an article ``in the discussions in which we decided to subpoena Ms. Currie.'' This could lead to discovery from a number of Jones lawyers. 
   The Holmes declaration says that the Jones lawyers ``had received what [they] considered to be reliable information that Ms. Currie was instrumental in facilitating Monica Lewinsky's meetings with Mr. Clinton and that Ms. Currie was central to the `cover story' Mr. Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky had developed to use in the event their affair was discovered.'' That assertion was strongly omitted from the House Republican Managers' proffer. That assertion raises questions abut what the Jones lawyers knew, when they knew it and whether there was any link to the Starr investigation. If the purpose of the declaration is to rebut the notion that Ms. Currie was subpoenaed because the Jones lawyers were following the activities of the Starr investigation, this declaration falls far short of the mark. It raises more questions that it resolves. 
   I am surprised to see a judicial clerk submit an affidavit in this case. The one thing that is clear from Mr. Ward's affidavit is that it does not support the conclusions drawn in the House Managers' proffer. Mr. Ward says only that President Clinton was looking directly at Mr. Bennett at one moment during the argument by the lawyers during the deposition. He 
   does not aver, as the House Managers suggest he would competently testify, that ``he saw President Clinton listening attentively to Mr. Bennett's remarks.'' 
   While the affidavit of Barry Ward cannot convert the President's silence into statements, it does provide one perspective on the President's deposition in the Jones case. Accepting that proffered evidence may, however, prompt the President's lawyers to want to examine other perspectives to give the Senate a more complete picture and a fairer opportunity to consider what was happening during the discussions among Judge Wright and the lawyers. For that purpose, is the Senate next going to authorize the deposition of Judge Wright and the other lawyers who attended the deposition? The circumstances under which Mr. Ward came to take such an affidavit and what he knows about the variety of issues mentioned in the House Managers' proffer on this item will undoubtedly be fair subjects of discovery by the President's lawyers if this is admitted. 
   The House Managers characterized documents as certain telephone records and the participants in various telephone calls whose identifies are not revealed by the records. Indeed, those proffered documents are without authentification. The House Republican Managers' brief goes even farther, suggesting that the telephone records will prove what happened at the White House gate on December 6, and asserting the identity of those who participated in telephone calls and the content of those telephone calls and concluding that they prove meetings and conversations that were not even by telephone. The documents appear to be a series of numbers. Giving them content and context will require more than mere authentification and any such testimonial explanation can be expected to engender further discovery, as well. 
   Now let me turn to the witnesses that the House Managers have identified by name and for which they are expressly seeking subpoenas at the outset of this discovery period. I understand that under Senate Resolution 16 Senator must vote for or against the entire package of witnesses and discovery requested by the House. 
   The House Republican Managers have already interviewed Monica Lewinsky after Mr. Starr arranged for that interview and had her ordered to comply. In light of the circumstances under which she has already been forced to cooperate with the House Republican Managers, any doubt as to the coercion being exercised through her immunity agreement could not be more starkly seen. I seriously question Ms. Lewinsky's freedom to express herself in the present circumstances and suggest that her immunity situation will inevitably affect the credibility of anything that she might ``add'' to the House's case. Mr. Starr has the equivalent of a loaded gun to her head, along with her mother's and her father's. 
   Consider also the report in The Washington Post on Tuesday that Mr. Starr  tore up her immunity agreement once before when she tried to clarify her February 1998 proffer to note that she and the President had talked about using a ``cover story'' before she was ever subpoenaed as a witness in the 
   Jones case, not after. That is now a key point of the House Managers' proffer but it points now in the other direction by suggesting that she is now willing to testify that the President ``instructed'' her to invoke cover stories if questioned in connection with the Jones case. Would not such a shift in testimony necessarily lead to discovery into the impact of the immunity agreement on her testimony and the many twists and turns in the 7-month negotiation between Mr. Starr and Ms. Lewinsky's attorneys and the pressures exerted upon her over the last six months? 
   Moreover, press accounts of the celebrated interview of Ms. Lewinsky by the House Managers last weekend suggest that she may also have said things during that interview that were favorable to the President. The President's counsel are now in the untenable position of having to oppose the House Managers' motion without specific knowledge of any exculpatory information that Ms. Lewinsky may have provided that would weigh against the need to call her as a witness. That is unfair and contrary to basic precepts of our law. The House Managers created this circumstance and should not benefit from it. 
   The House Managers also insist that they must open discovery to take the deposition of Vernon Jordan. Mr. Jordan has been interviewed or testified under oath before Starr's grand jury at least five times already. The House Managers' proffer is merely that they expect that his live testimony will lead to reasonable and logical inferences that might help their case and somehow link the job search to discouraging her testimony in the Jones case. That is not a proffer of anything new but an attempt to take another shot at eliciting testimony that Mr. Starr could not. 
   The House Managers also insist that the Senate must depose Sidney Blumenthal. Mr. Blumenthal also testified before the Starr grand jury. The House Managers' proffer notes nothing new that he would be expected to provide. 
   If the President has been willing to forego the opportunity to cross examine the witnesses whose grand jury testimony has been relied upon by the House Managers, that removes the most pressing need for further discovery in this matter. After all, Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan, and to a lesser extent, Mr. Blumenthal, were interviewed for days and weeks by the FBI, trained investigators, Mr. Starr's lawyers and then testified, some repeatedly, before the Starr grand jury. That is about as one-sided as discovery gets--no cross examination, no opportunity to compare early statements with the way things are reconfigured and re-expressed after numerous preparation sessions with Mr. Starr's office. 
   These witnesses testified under threat of prosecution by Mr. Starr. Ms. Lewinsky remains under a very clear threat of prosecution, even though she has a limited grant of immunity from Starr. This special prosecutor has shown every willingness to threaten and prosecute. 
   If the President has not initiated efforts to obtain more discovery and witnesses and is willing to have the matter decided on the voluminous record submitted to the House, the House Managers carry a heavy burden to justify extending 
   these proceedings further and requiring the reexamination of people who have already testified. 
   I heard over and over from the House Managers that there is no doubt, that the record established before the House and introduced into this Senate proceeding convinced the House to vote for articles of impeachment to require the removal of the President from office last month. The House Managers have told us that they have done a magnificent job and established their case. 
   Based on the House Managers' Motion and their proffer in justification, I do not believe that they have justified extending these proceedings into the future through additional depositions and additional evidence. Can anyone confidently predict how many witnesses will be needed to sort through the evidentiary supplement that the House proffers and the issues that it raises? Can anyone confidently predict how long that discovery will take and how long this trial will be extended? And for what? What is the significant and ultimate materiality to the fundamental issues being contested at this trial of the materials the House is moving now to include in the record? Although the House Managers can say that they only sought to depose three witnesses, does anyone think that in fairness the President's lawyers and the House Managers together will not end up deposing at least 10 people if the Senate were to grant the House motion? 
   The Senate should not extend these proceedings by a single day. The Senate runs a grave risk of being drawn down into the mire that stained the House impeachment proceedings. Republicans and Democrats have all told me that they do not believe that there is any possibility that this trial will end in the conviction of the President and his removal. In that light, the Senate should have proceeded to conclude this matter rather than extend it.

    Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this Senate is the last of the 20th century. We begin this first session of the 106th Congress facing a challenge that no other Senate in over 100 years has been called upon to meet; namely, whether to remove from office the person the American people elected to serve as the President of the United States. 
   What we do in this impeachment of the President, in terms of the standards we apply and the judgments we make, will either follow the Constitution or alter the intent of the Framers for all time. I have heard more than one Senator acknowledge that in that sense it is not just the President but also the Senate that is on trial in this matter. 
   The Senate now has an opportunity, as provided in S. Res. 16, to vote on a motion to conclude these proceedings by adopting Senator BYRD'S motion to dismiss. I commend Senator BYRD and agree with him that such action is both appropriate and in the best interests of the nation. I do not believe that the House Managers have proven a case for conviction and removal of the President on the Articles of Impeachment sent by the House last year. I further suggest that those articles are improperly vague and duplicitous.

   The attachments to Mr. Holmes' declaration is the proof of the subpoena being issued to Betty Currie in January, on January 22, 1998, along with service in the Jones case on January 27, 1998, and a copy of the supplemental witness list, including the name of Betty Currie, which was served on January 23, 1998. And in his declaration, Mr. Holmes explains that Ms. Currie was subpoenaed because of testimony given by President Clinton in his deposition and because of reliable information which the attorneys had received to this effect--that Ms. Currie was an instrumental person in facilitating Monica Lewinsky's meetings with the President and central to their ``cover story,'' as Mr. Holmes refers to it. He explicitly denies that any ``Washington Post'' article played any part in the decision of the Jones attorneys to subpoena Ms. Currie. 
   And in the third and final piece of new evidence that we ask you to take in and accept is a declaration and accompanying documents with regard to a telephone conversation showing that a conversation occurred on December 6 for 56 minutes between the 
   President and Ms. Lewinsky, which we believe that is what it shows. Obviously, the phone records show the phone records. And they state what they are. But we suggest to you that that is relevant information because it confirms what we think the testimony in the record otherwise would lead you to believe. 
   At this point in time, having given you an overview and having given you this amount of new evidence, I want to turn the microphone over and yield to my colleague, Mr. BRYANT, the rest of the time.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in September 1998, I introduced, with the support of Senator DASCHLE and several other Democratic Senators, a comprehensive crime bill, S. 2484, and am pleased today to join in introducing an updated version of that bill, the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1999. A number of provisions from S. 2484 were enacted last year and it is my hope that this new bill, S. 9, will have similar success. 
   The Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1999, S. 9, is designed to keep our Nation's crime rates moving in the right direction--downward. This bill builds on prior Democratic crime initiatives, including the landmark Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, that have reduced violent crime rates by 21 percent over the past five years. Property crime rates have also fallen by more than 20 percent since 1993. The Nation's serious crime rates are now at their lowest level since 1973, the first year the national crime victimization survey was conducted. We are proud of the significant reduction in crime rates, but we must not become complacent. Too many Americans still encounter violence in their neighborhoods, workplaces, and unfortunately, even in their homes. This bill would ensure that the crime rates continue their downward trend next year, the year after, and beyond. 
   The Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act builds on the successful programs we implemented in the 1994 Crime Law while also addressing emerging crime problems. The bill is comprehensive and realistic. The new program initiatives are also funded without downsizing other Federal programs or touching any projected Federal budget surplus, but instead by extending the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund for two more years. 
   I am optimistic that we can enact this bill, without partisan or ideological controversy. In fact, the bill contains a number of initiatives that enjoy bipartisan support. We have tried to avoid the easy rhetoric about crime that some have to offer in this crucial area of public policy. Instead, we have crafted a bill that could actually make a difference. 
   The Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act targets violent crime in our schools, reforms the juvenile justice system, combats gang violence, cracks down on the sale and use of illegal drugs, enhances the rights of crime victims, and provides meaningful assistance to law enforcement officers in the battle against street crime, international crime and terrorism. It also authorizes funding to deploy 25,000 additional police officers on the streets in the coming years. The Act represents an important next step in the continuing effort by Senate Democrats to enact tough yet balanced reforms to our criminal justice system. 
   The bill has nine comprehensive titles to address crime in our schools, crime on our streets, and crime on our borders and abroad. I should note that the bill contains no new death penalties and no new or increased mandatory minimum sentences. We can be tough without imposing the death penalty, and we can ensure swift and certain punishment without removing all discretion from the judge at sentencing. 
   Title I of the bill deals with proposals for combating violence in the schools and punishing juvenile crime. This title provides technical assistance to schools, reforms the Federal juvenile system, assists States in prosecuting and punishing juvenile offenders and reduces juvenile crime, while also protecting children from violence, including violence from the misuse of guns. 
   Assistance to Schools. Americans were dismayed and grief-stricken at the school shootings across the country last year. While homicides at American schools have remained relatively constant in recent years, the number of students who have experienced a violent crime in school increased 23 percent in 1995 compared to 1989. We need to make sure our children attend school in a safe environment that fosters learning, not fear. 
   In response to these concerns, this bill contains an inventive proposal developed by Senator BINGAMAN to establish a School Security Technology Center using expertise from the Sandia National Labs, and provides grants from the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program to enable schools to access technical assistance for school security. 
   Federal Prosecution of Serious and Violent Juvenile Offenders. The bill would also make important reforms to the Federal juvenile system, without federalizing run-of-the-mill juvenile offenses or ignoring the traditional prerogative of the States to handle the bulk of juvenile crime. One of the significant flaws in the Republican juvenile crime bills last year was that they would have--in the words of Chief Justice Rehnquist--``eviscerate[d] this traditional deference to State prosecutions, thereby increasing substantially the potential workload of the federal judiciary.'' The Chief Justice has repeatedly raised concerns about ``federalizing'' more crimes and in his 1998 Year-End Report of the Federal Judiciary noted that ``Federal courts were not created to adjudicate local crimes, no matter how sensational or heinous the crimes may be. State courts do, can, and should handle such problems.'' The Democratic proposals for reform of the Federal juvenile justice system heed this sound advice and respect our Federal system.  
   Among other reforms, the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act would allow Federal prosecution of juveniles only when the Attorney General certifies that the State cannot or will not exercise jurisdiction, or when the juvenile is alleged to have committed a violent, drug or firearm offense. 
   Prosecutors would be given sole, nonreviewable authority to prosecute as adults 16- and 17-year-olds who are alleged to have committed the most serious violent and drug offenses. Limited judicial review is provided for prosecutors' decisions to try as adults 13-, 14-, and 15-year-old juveniles, and those 16- and 17-year-olds who are charged with less serious Federal offenses. 
   Assistance to States for Prosecuting and Punishing Juvenile Offenders, and Reducing Juvenile Crime. The bill authorizes grants to the States for incarcerating violent and chronic juvenile offenders (with each qualifying State getting at least one percent of available funds), and provides graduated sanctions, reimburses States for the cost of incarcerating juvenile alien offenders, and establishes a pilot program to replicate successful juvenile crime reduction strategies. 
   Protecting Children from Violence. The bill contains important initiatives to protect children from violence, including violence resulting from the misuse of guns. Americans want concrete proposals to reduce the risk of such incidents recurring. At the same time, we must preserve adults' rights to use guns for legitimate purposes, such as home protection, hunting and for sport. 
   The bill imposes a prospective gun ban for juveniles convicted or adjudicated delinquent for violent crimes. It also requires revocation of a firearms dealer's license for failing to have secure gun storage or safety devices available for sale with firearms. The bill enhances the penalty for possessing a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence or drug offense and for violation of certain firearm laws involving juveniles. In addition, the bill authorizes competitive grant programs for the establishment of juvenile gun courts and youth violence courts. 
   Title II of the bill addresses the problem of gang violence which has spread from our cities into rural areas of this country. According to the Department of Justice, more than 846,000 gang members belong to 31,000 youth gangs in the United States, and the numbers are growing. 
   This part of the bill cracks down on gangs by making the interstate ``franchising'' of street gangs a crime. It will also increase penalties for crimes during which the convicted felon wears protective body armor or uses ``laser-sighting'' devices to commit the crime. The bill doubles the criminal penalties for using or threatening physical violence against witnesses and contains other provisions designed to facilitate the use and protection of witnesses to help prosecute gangs and other violent criminals. The Act also provides funding for law enforcement agencies in communities designated by the Attorney General as areas with a high level of interstate gang activity. 
   Title III of the bill sets forth a number of initiatives in nine subtitles to combat violence in the streets. The Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act continues successful initiatives in the 1994 Crime Act by putting more police officers on our streets, providing for the construction of more prisons, preventing juvenile felons from buying handguns, and assisting law enforcement and community groups in better protecting women and children from domestic violence. Specifically, the bill would extend COPS funding into 2001 and 2002 (which should lead to at least 25,000 more officers on the streets); establish a state minimum of .75 percent for Truth-in-Sentencing grants and extend this program and the Violent Offender Incarceration prison grant program into 2001 and 2002; and extend authorization for the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) funding and local law enforcement grant programs. 
   A significant problem that arose last year was the loss of confidentiality that had previously attached to the important work of the U.S. Secret Service. The Departments of Justice and Treasury and even a former Republican President advise that the safety of future Presidents may be jeopardized by forcing U.S. Secret Service agents to breach the confidentiality they need to do their job by testifying before a grand jury. I trust the Secret Service on this issue; they are the experts with the mission of protecting the lives of the President and other high-level elected official and visiting dignitaries. I also have confidence in the judgment of former President Bush, who has written, ``I feel very strongly that [Secret Service] agents should not be made to appear in court to discuss that which they might or might not have seen or heard.'' 
   The Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act provides a reasonable and limited protective function privilege so future Secret Service agents are able to maintain the confidentiality they say they need to protect the lives of the President, Vice President and visiting heads of state. 
   This title of the bill also includes a number of provisions to address the following matters: 
   Domestic violence: In addition to extending authorized funding for the Violence Against Women Act, the bill would punish attempts to commit interstate domestic violence, expand the interstate domestic violence offense to cover intimidation, and punish interstate travel with the intent to kill a spouse. 
   Protecting Law Enforcement and the Judiciary: The Act recognizes that law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every day. According to the FBI, over 1,000 officers have been killed in the line of duty since 1980. The Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act contains provisions to protect the lives of our law enforcement officers by extending the Bulletproof Vest Partnership grant program through 2004. It also establishes new crimes and increases penalties for killing federal officers and persons working with federal officers, including in their work with federal prisoners, and for retaliation against federal officials by threatening or injuring their family members. The Act enhances the penalty for assaults and threats against Federal judges and other federal officials engaged in their official duties. 
   Cargo/Property Theft: The bill also contains an important initiative proposed by Senator LAUTENBERG to deter cargo thefts. 
   Sentencing Improvements: This subtitle doubles the maximum penalty for manslaughter from 10 to 20 years, consistent with the Sentencing Commission's recommendation, applies the sentencing guidelines to all pertinent federal statutes (such as criminal prohibitions in statutes outside titles 18 and 21 of the United States Code), and other improvements. 
   Civil Liberties: The bill includes the ``Hate Crimes Prevention Act,'' which was originally introduced by Senator KENNEDY and has the strong bipartisan support of over twenty Members, and other initiatives designed to bolster support for enforcement of civil rights. 
   National Drunk Driving Standard: The bill includes a provision sponsored by Senator LAUTENBERG which requires States to establish a .08 alcohol standard for driving while intoxicated by 2002 or risk losing a portion of their federal highway funds. 
   Title IV of the bill outlines a number of prevention programs that are critical to further reducing juvenile crime. These programs include grants to youth organizations and ``Say No to Drugs'' Community Centers, as well as reauthorization of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, Anti-Drug Abuse Programs and Local Delinquency Prevention Programs. Additional sections include a program suggested by Senator BINGAMAN to establish a competitive grant program to reduce truancy, with priority given to efforts to replicate successful programs. 
   The bill would also reauthorize the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDPA) in a similar fashion to H.R. 1818, a bill passed by the House with strong bipartisan support in the last Congress. This section creates a new juvenile justice block grant program and retains the four core protections for youth in the juvenile justice system, while adopting greater flexibility for rural areas. 
   Last year, the Senate Republicans tried to gut these core protections in their juvenile crime bill, S. 10. This Democratic crime bill puts ideology aside, and follows the advice of numerous child advocacy experts--including  the Children's Defense Fund, National Collaboration for Youth, Youth Law Center and National Network for Youth--who believe these key protections must be preserved in order to protect juveniles who have been arrested or detained. These core protections ensure that juveniles are not housed with adults, do not have verbal or physical contact with adult inmates, and any disproportionate confinement of minority youth is addressed by the States. If these protections are abolished, many more youth may end up committing suicide or being released with serious physical or emotional scars. 
   Title V of the bill contains five subtitles on combating illegal drug use. Illegal drugs are too often at the heart of crime. This Act would protect our children by increasing penalties for selling drugs to kids and drug trafficking in or near schools, and cracking down on ``club drugs.'' It goes a step further and encourages pharmacotherapy research to develop medications for the treatment of drug addiction, a proposal Senator BIDEN has urged. It also funds drug courts, which subject eligible drug offenders to programs of intensive supervision. 
   Title VI of the bill is intended to increase the rights of victims within the criminal justice system. The criminal is only half of the equation. This bill guarantees the rights of crime victims. All States recognize victims' rights in some form, but they often lack the training and resources to make those rights a reality. This bill provides a model Bill of Rights for crime victims in the federal system, and makes available to the States grants to fund the hiring of State and Federal victim-witness advocates, training, and the technology necessary for model notification systems. This bill would help make victims' rights a reality. 
   Specifically, this title reforms Federal law and evidence to enhance victims' participation in all stages of criminal proceedings by giving victims' a right to notice of detention hearings, plea agreements, sentencing, probation revocations, escapes or releases from prison, and to allocution at hearings, as well as grants for obtaining state-of-the-art systems for providing notice. In addition, this title would provide grant programs to study the effectiveness of the restorative justice approach for victims. 
   Title VII of the bill of details provisions for combating money laundering. Crime increasingly has an international face, from drug kingpins to millionaire terrorists, like Usama bin Laden. The money laundering provisions of this bill hit these international criminals where it hurts most--in the pocketbook. 
   These provisions would provide important tools not just to combat international terrorism but drug trafficking as well. We must have interdiction, we must have treatment programs; we must tell kids to say ``No'' to drugs. But we have to do more, and taking the profit away from international drug lords is an effective weapon. This Democratic crime bill would strengthen these laws.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am privileged to join with my colleague Senator TOM DASCHLE to introduce the Paycheck Fairness Act. 
   Early in the next century, women--for the first time ever--will outnumber men in the United States workplace. In 1965, women held 35 percent of all jobs. That has grown to more than 46 percent today. And in a few years, women will make up a majority of the workforce. 
   Fortunately, there are more business and career opportunities for women today than there were thirty years ago. Unlike 1965, federal, state, and private sector programs now offer women many opportunities to choose their own futures. Working women also have opportunities to gain the knowledge and skills to achieve their own economic security. 
   But despite these gains, working women still face a unique challenge--achieving pay equity. The average woman earns 74 cents for every dollar that the average man earns. This amounts to a woman earning $8,434 less than a man over the course of one year and earning more than a quarter of a million dollars less over the course of a career. 
   We must correct this gross inequality, and we must correct it now. 
   How is this possible with our federal laws prohibiting discrimination? It is possible because we in Congress have failed to protect one of the most fundamental human rights--the right to be paid fairly for an honest day's work. 
   Unfortunately, our laws ignore wage discrimination against women, which continues to fester like a cancer in work places across the country. The Paycheck Fairness Act of 1999 would close this legal loophole by addressing the problem of pay inequality by redressing past discrimination and increasing enforcement against future abuses. 
   I do not pretend that this Act will solve all the problems women face in the work place. But it is an essential piece of the puzzle. Equal pay for equal work is often a subtle problem that is difficult to combat. Ant it does not stand alone as an issue that woman face in the workplace. It is deeply intertwined with the problem of unequal opportunity. Closing this loophole is not enough if we fail to provide the opportunity for women to reach high paying positions. 
   The government, by itself, cannot change the attitudes and perceptions of individuals and private businesses in hiring and advancing women, but it can set an example. Certainly President Clinton has shown great leadership by appointing an unprecedented number of women to his administration. In my home state of Vermont, Major General Martha Rainville has been appointed Adjutant General of the Vermont National Guard--the first woman in the country to hold this prestigious position. 
   Vermont is also a leader in providing pay equity. According to the Institute for Women's Policy Research, Vermont ranks second in providing equal pay. Even with this ranking, the average woman in Vermont still is making less than 82 cents for every dollar that the average man makes in Vermont. We must work in the Senate and in the workplace to close this gap. 
   We are all familiar with the glass ceiling which prevents women from advancing in the workplace. However, woman are also facing a glass wall--they are unable to achieve equal pay for equal work. Women cannot break the glass ceiling until the wall comes down. 
   The Paycheck Fairness Act is one step to remedy this problem and bring down the glass wall. This Act will strengthen enforcement of the Equal Pay Act, increase penalties for violations, and permit employees to openly discuss their wages with coworkers without fear of retaliation by their employers. 
   I understand that this bill will not solve all of the problems of pay inequity, but it will close legal loopholes that allow employers to routinely underpay women. By closing these loopholes, we will help women achieve better economic security and provide them with more opportunities.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator GORDON SMITH in introducing the Federal Judiciary Protection Act of 1999. In the last Congress, I was pleased to cosponsor nearly identical legislation introduced by Senator SMITH, which unanimously passed the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate but was not acted upon by the House of Representatives. I commend the Senator from Oregon for his continued leadership in protecting our Federal judiciary. 
   Our bipartisan legislation would provide greater protection to Federal judges, law enforcement officers and their families. Specifically, our legislation would: increase the maximum prison term for forcible assaults, resistance, opposition, intimidation or interference with a Federal judge or law enforcement officer from 3 years imprisonment to 8 years; increase the maximum prison term for use of a deadly weapon or infliction of bodily injury against a Federal judge or law enforcement officer from 10 years imprisonment to 20 years; and increase the maximum prison term for threatening murder or kidnaping of a member of the immediate family of a Federal judge or law enforcement officer from 5 years imprisonment to 10 years. It has the support of the Department of Justice, the United States Judicial Conference, the United States Sentencing Commission and the United States Marshal Service. 
   It is most troubling that the greatest democracy in the world needs this legislation to protect the hard working men and women who serve in our Federal judiciary and other law enforcement agencies. But, unfortunately, we are seeing more violence and threats of violence against officials of our Federal government. 
   Recently, for example, a courtroom in Urbana, Illinois was firebombed, apparently by a disgruntled litigant. This follows the horrible tragedy of the bombing of the federal office building in Oklahoma City in 1995. In my home state during the summer of 1997, a Vermont border patrol officer, John Pfeiffer, was seriously wounded by Carl Drega, during a shootout with Vermont and New Hampshire law enforcement officers in which Drega lost his life. Earlier that day; Drega shot and killed two state troopers and a local judge in New Hampshire. Apparently, Drega was bent on settling a grudge against the judge who had ruled against him in a land dispute. 
   I had a chance to visit John Pfeiffer in the hospital and met his wife and young daughter. Thankfully, Agent Pfeiffer has returned to work along the Vermont border. As a federal law enforcement officer, Agent Pfeiffer and his family will receive greater protection under our bill. 
   There is, of course, no excuse or justification for someone taking the law into their own hands and attacking or threatening a judge or law enforcement officer. Still, the U.S. Marshal Service is concerned with more and more threats of harm to our judges and law enforcement officers. 
   The extreme rhetoric that some have used in the past to attack the judiciary only feeds into this hysteria. For example, one of the Republican leaders in the House of Representatives has been quoted as saying: ``The judges need to be intimidated,'' and if they do not behave, ``we're going to go after them in a big way.'' I know that this official did not intend to encourage violence against any Federal official, but this extreme rhetoric only serves to degrade Federal judges in the eyes of the public. 
   Let none of us in the Congress contribute to the atmosphere of hate and violence. Let us treat the judicial branch and those who serve within it with the respect that is essential to preserving its public standing. 
   We have the greatest judicial system in the world, the envy of people around the globe who are struggling for freedom. It is the independence of our third, co-equal branch of government that gives it the ability to act fairly and impartially. It is our judiciary  that has for so long protected our fundamental rights and freedoms and served as a necessary check on overreaching by the other two branches, those more susceptible to the gusts of the political winds of the moment. 
   We are fortunate to have dedicated women and men throughout the Federal Judiciary and law enforcement in this country who do a tremendous job under difficult circumstances. They are examples of the hard-working public servants that make up the federal government, who are too often maligned and unfairly disparaged. It is unfortunate that it takes acts or threats of violence to put a human face on the Federal Judiciary and other law enforcement officials, to remind everyone that these are people with children and parents and cousins and friends. They deserve our respect and our protection. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Federal Judiciary Protection Act of 1999 and look forward to its swift enactment into law.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator SARBANES in introducing the Financial Information Privacy Act of 1999. Senator SARBANES, along with Senators DODD and BRYAN, have been leaders on the Senate Banking Committee in protecting the privacy of personal financial information. 
   Mr. President, the right to privacy is a personal and fundamental right protected by the Constitution of the United States. But the American people are growing more and more concerned over encroachments on their personal privacy. 
   I seems that everywhere we turn, new technologies, new communications media, and new business services created with the best of intentions and highest of expectations also pose a threat to our ability to keep our lives to ourselves, to live, work and think without having giant corporations looking over our shoulders. 
   This incremental encroachment on our privacy has happened through the lack of safeguards on personal, financial and medical information about each of us that can be stolen, sold or mishandled and find its way into the wrong hands with the push of a button. 
   Our right of privacy has become one of the most vulnerable rights in the information age. The digitalization of information and the explosion in the growth of computing and electronic networking offer tremendous potential benefits to the way Americans live, work, conduct commerce, and interact with their government. But the new technology also presents new threats to our individual privacy and security, in particular, our ability to control the terms under which our personal information is acquired, disclosed, and used. 
   In the financial services industry, for example, conglomerates are offering a wide variety of services, each of which requires a customer to provide financial, medical or other personal information. And nothing in the law prevents subsidiaries within the conglomerate from sharing this information for uses other than the use the customer thought he or she was providing it for. In fact, under current Federal law, a financial institution can sell, share, or publish savings account balances, certificates of deposit maturity dates and balances, stock and mutual fund purchases and sales, life insurance payouts and health insurance claims. 
   Our legislation would protect the privacy of this financial information by directing the Federal Reserve Board, Office of Thrift Supervision, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Securities and Exchange Commission to jointly promulgate rules requiring financial institutions they regulate to: (1) inform their customers what information is to be disclosed, and when, to whom and for what purposes the information is to be disclosed; (2) allow customers to review the information for accuracy; and (3) for new customers, obtain the customers' consent to disclosure, and for existing 
   customers, give the customers a reasonable opportunity to object to disclosure. These financial institutions could use confidential customer information from other entities only if the entities had given their customers similar privacy protections. 
   I hope the Financial Information Privacy Act is just the beginning of this new Congress' efforts to address the privacy issues raised by ultra competitive marketplaces in the information age. 
   For the past three Congresses, I have introduced comprehensive medical privacy legislation. I plan to soon introduce the Medical Information Privacy and Security Act to establish the first comprehensive federal medical privacy law. It would close the existing gaps in federal privacy laws to ensure the protection of personally identifiable health information. Medical records contain the most intimate, sensitive information about a person and must be safeguarded. 
   This Congress will also need to consider how our privacy safeguards for personal, financial and medical information measure up to the tough privacy standards established by the European Union Data Protection Directive, which took effect on October 25, 1998. That could be a big problem for American businesses, since the new rules require EU member countries to prohibit the transmission of personal data to or through any non-EU country that fails to provide adequate data protection as defined under European law. 
   European officials have said repeatedly over the past year that the patchwork of privacy laws in the United States may not meet their standards. Our law is less protective than EU standards in a variety of respects on a range of issues, including requirements to obtain data fairly and lawfully; limitations on the collection of sensitive data; limitations on the purpose of data collection; bans on the collection and storage of unnecessary personal information; requirements regarding data accuracy; limitations regarding duration of storage; and centralized supervision of privacy protections and practices. 
   The problem is not that Europe protects privacy too much. The problem is  our own failure to keep U.S. privacy laws up to date. The EU Directive is an example of the kind of privacy protection that American consumers need and do not have. It has encouraged European companies to develop good privacy techniques. It has produced policies, including policies on cryptography, that are consistent with the interests of both consumers and businesses. 
   The Financial Information Privacy Act updates U.S. privacy laws in the evolving financial services industry. It calls for fundamental protections of the personal, confidential financial information of all American citizens. I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on this first legislative day of the new session, I am joining Chairman HATCH of the Judiciary Committee to introduce a bill to help protect satellite TV viewers. I know it also has the support of subcommittee Chairman, Senator DEWINE, and its ranking member, Senator KOHL. I appreciate the fact that Republicans and Democrats are working together on this issue. I also want to thank the Majority Leader, Senator LOTT, for his assistance on this issue as well as the Chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator MCCAIN and their ranking member, Senator HOLLINGS. I look forward to working with all Senators on this matter. 
   I have received hundreds of calls from Vermonters last year whose satellite TV service was about to be terminated. I am still hearing from Vermonters from all over the state. They are steaming mad and so am I. 
   This is an outrageous situation--the law must be changed and the Federal Communications Commission has to do its job. 
   I have worked to change the law over the last two years to try to avoid the situation we now face. I have also insisted that the FCC change its unrealistic rules that will result in needless terminations of service to Vermont families. 
   Unfortunately, we are on a collision course because of two Court orders affecting CBS and Fox signals offered to home dish owners, an inability to pass needed legislation last year, and the unwillingness of the FCC to step in and alleviate this situation. 
   Before I go into the details I want to point out that this bipartisan bill represents very good public policy. It will increase competition among TV providers, give consumers more choices, preserve the local affiliate TV system, act to lower cable and satellite rates, and will eventually offer local news, weather and programming over satellite TV instead of programming from distant stations. Over the next couple years, this initiative can solve the problem of losing satellite service by allowing satellites to offer a full array of local TV stations. 
   It will lead to lower rates for consumers because the bill creates head-to-head competition between cable and satellite TV providers. The bill will allow households who want to subscribe to this new satellite TV service, called ``local-into-local''--to receive all local Vermont TV stations over the satellite. 
   The goal is to offer Vermonters with more choices, more TV selections, but at lower rates. In areas of the country where there is this full competition with cable providers, rates to customers are considerably lower. 
   Thus, over time this initiative will permit satellite TV providers to offer a full selection of all local TV channels to viewers throughout most of Vermont, as well as the typical complement of superstations, weather and sports channels, PBS, movies and a variety of other channels. This means that local Vermont TV stations will be available over satellite dishes to many areas of Vermont currently not served by satellite or by cable. 
   Under current law, it is illegal for satellite TV providers to offer local TV channels over a satellite dish when you live in an area where you are normally likely to get a clear TV signal with a regular rooftop antenna. This means that thousands of Vermonters living in or near Burlington cannot receive local signals over their satellite dishes. 
   In addition, under current law many families must get their local TV signals over an antenna which often does not provide a clear picture. This bill will remove that legal limitation and allow satellite carriers to offer local TV signals to viewers no matter where they live in Vermont. 
   To take advantage of this, satellite carriers over time will have to follow the rules that cable providers have to follow. This will mean that they must carry all local Vermont TV stations and not carry distant network stations that compete with local stations. 
   Presently Vermonters receive network satellite signals with programming from stations in other states--in other words receive a CBS station from another state but not WCAX, the Burlington CBS affiliate. 
   By allowing satellite providers to offer a larger variety of programming, including local stations, the satellite industry would be able to compete with cable, and the cable industry will be competing with satellite carriers. 
   All the members of the Judiciary Committee have worked on this matter and I appreciate their efforts. On November 12, of 1997, Chairman HATCH and I held a full Committee hearing on satellite issues to try to avoid needless cutoffs of satellite TV service while, at the same time, working to protect the network affiliate TV broadcast system. 
   Soon after, on March 5, 1998, we introduced the Hatch-Leahy satellite bill (S. 1720) to address these concerns. This bill was amended in Committee with a Hatch-Leahy substitute and was reported out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously on October 1, 1998. 
   In the meantime, in July 1998, a federal district court judge in Florida found that PrimeTime 24 was offering distant CBS and Fox television signals to more than a million households in the U.S. in a manner inconsistent with its compulsory license that permits such satellite service only to households who do not get at least ``grade B intensity'' service. Under a preliminary injunction, satellite service to thousands of households in Vermont and other states was to be terminated on October 8, 1998, for CBS and Fox distant network signals for households signed up after March 11, 1997, the date the action was filed. 
   To avoid immediate cutoffs of satellite TV service in Vermont and other states, the parties requested an extension of the October 8, 1998, termination date which was granted until February 28, 1999. This extension was also designed to give the FCC time to address these problems faced by satellite home dish owners. 
   The FCC solicited comments on whether the current definition of grade B intensity was adequate. 
   I was very concerned about the FCC proposal in this matter and filed a comment asking the FCC to come up with a realistic and workable system to protect satellite dish owners. I criticized the FCC rule in that it would cut  off households from receiving distant signals based on ``unwarranted assumptions'' in a manner inconsistent with the law and the clear intent of the Congress. I complained about entire towns in Vermont which were to be inappropriately cut off and insisted that FCC issue a final rule that permits ``a smooth transition to `local-into-local' satellite TV service.'' 
   I said in my comment to their proposal that: ``The Commission's proposal raises a number of complex issues, yet the guiding principle that the FCC should follow is simple: No customer's `distant' satellite TV signals should be cut off if the customer is unable to receive local TV broadcasts over-the-air.'' 
   I also pointed out that: ``The clear purpose of the law was, and is, to protect those living in more rural areas so that they can receive TV signals using satellite dishes when they are unable to receive a strong signal using an antenna. Your final rule should reflect that purpose. I have heard from constituents in two Vermont towns where I am told that almost no one can receive a clear TV signal, yet all families with satellite dishes were being targeted for termination of their satellite TV channels.'' 
   I also noted in my comment: ``A second area that concerns me relates to who should bear the cost of any testing that is done. I have heard from Vermonters who are justifiably furious that they are being asked to pay for these costs. The burden of proof and the burden of any additional expenses should not be assessed upon the families owning the satellite dishes.'' 
   ``While the hills and mountains of Vermont are a natural wonder, they are barriers to receiving clear TV signals over-the-air with roof top antennas. For example, at my home in Middlesex, Vermont, we can only get one channel clearly and the other channel with lots of ghosts.'' 
   In yet another development, the Florida district court filed a final order which will also require that households signed up for satellite service before March 11, 1997, be subject to termination of CBS and Fox distant signals on April 30, 1999, if they live in areas where they are likely to receive a grade B intensity signal, as defined by the Court and FCC rules, and are unable to get the local CBS or Fox affiliate to consent to receipt of the distant signal. My understanding is that each subscriber that is to lose service must receive notice 45 days in advance. 
   I want to make clear, as I did in my comment to the FCC, that I strongly believe in the local affiliate television system. Local broadcast stations provide the public with local news, local weather, local informational programming, local emergency advisories, candidate forums, local public affairs programming, and high quality programs. Local broadcast stations contribute to our sense of community. 
   I strongly believe that when the full local-into-local satellite system is in place, this system will enhance the local affiliate television system. 
   I, thus, urge my colleagues to cosponsor this effort.
