   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce a bill authorizing  the Secretary of Energy to provide for the Office of Nuclear Science and Technology to reverse a serious decline in our nation's educational capability to produce future nuclear scientists and engineers. Let me outline how serious this decline is, after doing so I will outline its impact on our nation and then discuss how this bill attempts to remedy this situation. 
   As of this year, the supply of four-year trained nuclear scientists and engineers is at a 35-year low. The number of four-year programs across our nation to train future nuclear scientists has declined to approximately 25--a 50 percent reduction since about 1970. Two-thirds of the nuclear science and engineering faculty are over age 45 with little if any ability to draw new and young talent to replace them. Universities across the United States cannot afford to maintain their small research reactors forcing their closure at an alarming rate. This year there are only 28 operating research and training reactors, over a 50 percent decline since 1980. Most if not all of these reactors were built in the late 1950's and early 60's and were licensed initially for 30 to 40 years. As a result, within the next five years the majority of these 28 reactors will have to be relicensed. Relicensing is a long, lengthy process which most universities cannot and will not afford. Interestingly, the employment demand for nuclear scientists and engineers exceeds our nation's ability to supply them. This year, the demand exceeded supply by 350, by 2003 it will be over 400. 
   These human resource and educational infrastructure problems are serious. The decline in a competently trained nuclear workforce affects a broad range of national issues. 
   We need nuclear engineers and health physicists to help design, safely dispose and monitor nuclear waste, both civilian and military. 
   We rely on nuclear physicists and scientists in the field of nuclear medicine to develop radio isotopes for the thousands of medical procedures performed everyday across our nation--to help save lives. 
   We must continue to operate and safely maintain our existing supply of fission reactors and respond to any future nuclear crisis worldwide--it takes nuclear scientists, engineers and health physicists to do that. 
   Our national security and treaty commitments rely on nuclear scientists to help stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons whether in our national laboratories or as part of worldwide inspection teams in such places as Iraq. Nuclear scientists are needed to convert existing reactors worldwide from highly enriched to low enriched fuels. 
   Nuclear engineers and health physicists are needed to design, operate and maintain future Naval Reactors. The Navy by itself cannot train students for their four year degrees--they only provide advance postgraduate training on their reactor's operation. 
   Basically, we are looking at the potential loss of a 50 year investment in a field which our nation started and leads the world in. What is worse, this loss is a downward self-feeding spiral. Poor departments cannot attract bright students and bright students will not carry on the needed cutting edge research that leads to promising young faculty members. Our system of nuclear education and training, in which we used to lead the world, is literally imploding upon itself. 
   I've laid out in this bill some proposals that I hope will seed a national debate in the 
   upcoming 107th Congress on what we as a nation need to do to help solve this very serious problem. It is not a perfect bill, but I think it should start the ball rolling. I welcome all forms of bipartisan input on it. My staff has worked from consensus reports from the scientific community developed by the Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee to the Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Science and Technology, in particular its Subcommittee on Education and Training. The report is available on the Office's website. I encourage everyone to read and look at these startling statistics. 
   Here is an outline of what is in the bill. 
   First and foremost, we need to concentrate on attracting good undergraduate students to the nuclear sciences. I have proposed enhancing the current program which provides fellowships to graduate students and extends that to undergraduate students. 
   Second, we need to attract new and young faculty. I've proposed a Junior Faculty Research Initiation Grant Program which is similar to the NSF programs targeted only towards supporting new faculty during the first 5 years of their career at a university. These first five years are critical years that either make or break new faculty. 
   Third, I've proposed enhancing the Office's Nuclear Engineering Education and Research Program. This program is critical to university faculty and graduate students by supporting only the most fundamental research in nuclear science and engineering. These fundamental programs ultimately will strengthen our industrial base and over all economic competitiveness. 
   Fourth, I've strengthened the Office's applied nuclear science program by ensuring that universities play an important role in collaboration with the national labs and industry. This collaboration is the most basic form of tech transfer, it is face-to-face contact and networking between faculty, students and the applied world of research and industry. This program will ensure a transition between the student and their future employer. 
   Finally, I've strengthened what I consider the most crucial element of this program--ensuring that future generations of students and professors have well maintained research reactors. 
   I've proposed to increase the funding levels for refueling and upgrading academic reactor instrumentation. 
   I propose to start a new program whereby faculty can apply for reactor research and training awards to provide for reactor improvements. 
   I have proposed a novel program whereby as part of a student's undergraduate and graduate thesis project, they help work on the re-licensing of their own research reactors. This program must be in collaboration with industry which already has ample experience in relicensing. Such a program will once again provide face-to-face networking and training between student, teacher and ultimately their employer. 
   I have proposed a fellowship program whereby faculty can take their sabbatical year at a DOE laboratory. Under this program DOE laboratory staff can co-teach university courses and give extended seminars. This program also provides for part time employment of students at the DOE labs--we are talking about bringing in new and young talent. 
   In making all of these proposals, let me emphasize that each one of these programs I have described is intended to be peer reviewed and to have awards made strictly on merit of the proposals submitted. This program is not a hand out. Each element that I am proposing requires that faculty innovate and compete for these funds. If they do not win, then their reactors will simply be shut down by their institutions. 
   I have outlined a very serious problem that if not corrected now will cost far more to correct later on. If the program I have outlined is implemented, then it will strengthen our reputation as a leader in the nuclear sciences, strengthen our national security and our ability to compete in the world market place.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today, the PILT and Refuge Revenue Sharing Permanent Funding Act, deals with an issue that I believe must be addressed in the next Congress. The bill is a measure to make permanent funding for two important programs managed by the Department of the Interior: the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program (or PILT) in the Bureau of Land Management and the Refuge Revenue Sharing Program in the Fish and Wildlife Service. These programs provide support to local governments in areas in which these two agencies hold land. Under the authorizations for these programs, the funds are to be provided as an offset to the local property tax base lost by virtue of the Federal ownership of these lands. 
   Federal ownership of lands in the American West, in states like New Mexico, does not come without its share of burdens for local governments. If there is a fire or other emergency, they must help respond. If there is increased traffic to and from the site, they must maintain the public roads that provide the necessary access to the public. In enacting the original authorizing legislation, Congress decided that, as a matter of policy, it was appropriate for the Federal Government to bear a fair share in paying for these costs, in lieu of the taxes that would be levied on any private landowner in these localities. 
   But in setting up these programs, Congress decided to make them subject to annual appropriations, either partially (in the case of Refuge Revenue Sharing) or completely (in the case of PILT). In retrospect, this was a mistake. The annual appropriations process has never come even close to providing the funds agreed upon by the underlying authorizing law. Moreover, the amount made available has changed significantly from one year to the next, frustrating the ability of localities to plan effectively for the use of these funds. Many of the burdens they face as a result of Federal land ownership require expenditures and commitments that are long-term. If you want to have a reasonable system of country roads, you need to have a consistent multi-year plan. If you want adequate fire protection, you can't be hiring a dozen new firefighters in one year and firing them the next, as appropriation levels gyrate up and down. 
   The Federal Government needs to be a better neighbor and a more reliable partner to local governments in the rural West. Since the system of meeting our obligations to these localities through the annual appropriations process has not worked, I am proposing that we start treating our payments in lieu of taxes in the same way that we account for incoming tax revenues to the Federal Government--on the mandatory side of the Federal ledger. By making the funding for these crucial programs full and permanent, we will be keeping the commitments to rural communities throughout the West made in the original PILT and Refuge Revenue Sharing authorizing legislation. It's a matter of simple justice to rural communities. I hope that enacting legislation along the lines of what I am proposing today will receive high priority in the next Congress.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important legislation, to amend the National Energy Conservation Policy Act of 1986. This legislation, the ``Energy Efficient Cost Savings Improvement Act of 2001'' will improve the current law by enhancing and extending the authority relating to energy savings performance contracts of the Federal Government. The benefit to the taxpayer will be not only the realization of greater cost savings as they pertain to older, inefficient Federal buildings but, more importantly, the reduction in the waste of monies spent trying to improve these buildings when other, more cost effective alternatives are available. 
   The National Energy Conservation Policy Act, as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, established a mandate for energy savings in Federal buildings and facilities. Aggressive energy conservation goals were subsequently established by Executive Order 12902, stating that, by 2005, Federal agencies must reduce their energy consumption in their buildings by 30 percent per square foot when compared to 1985 levels. Executive Order 13123 increased this goal to 35 percent by 2010. 
   To help attain these objectives, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 created Energy Savings Performance Contracting, ESPC, which offered a means of achieving this energy reduction goal at no capital cost to the government. That's right--no capital cost to the government, since ESPC is an alternative to the traditional method of Federal appropriations to finance these types of improvements in Federal buildings. Under the ESPC authority, Federal agencies contract with energy service companies, ESCO, which pay all the up-front costs. These costs relate to evaluation, design, financing, acquisition, installation, and maintenance of energy efficient equipment; altered operation and maintenance improvements; and technical services. The ESCO guarantees a fixed amount of energy cost savings throughout the life of the contract and is paid directly from those cost savings. Agencies retain the remainder of the cost savings for themselves and, at the end of the contract, ownership of all property, along with the additional cost savings, reverts to the Federal government. Currently, contracts may range up to 25 years. Over the entire contract period, Federal monies are neither required nor appropriated for the improvements. 
   But, as innovative as the ESPC alternative may be, there is one area in which it falls short--and that is, how to avoid wasting valuable funds improving energy efficiency in a building that has long since passed its useful life. How do you justify energy conservation measures in buildings that are in constant need of maintenance or repair? Facilities that, no matter how much money is invested for renovation, will never meet existing building code requirements? You may save money by improving energy efficiency, but then turn around and reinvest even larger amounts in operating and maintaining a very old facility. Somewhere there has to be a point where we decide there must be other alternatives--and that is exactly what my legislation offers. 
   The most important element of my legislation is in the way it proposes to fund the construction of replacement Federal facilities. The legislation builds upon the existing Energy Savings Performance Contracting and takes it one logical step further--to include savings anticipated from operation and maintenance efficiencies of a new replacement Federal building. Perhaps the easiest way to explain the benefits of this change is by citing an example. In my home state of New Mexico, the Department of Energy Albuquerque Operations office resides in a complex of buildings constructed originally as Army barracks during the Korean War. Although these facilities have been renovated and modified throughout the years, they remain energy inefficient and require high maintenance and operation costs when compared to more contemporary buildings. What's more, over the next seven years, the Operations office will institute additional modifications to meet compliance requirements for seismic, energy savings, and other facility infrastructure concerns (maintenance, environmental, safety and health, etc.) at a cost of $34.2 million. Even with these modifications, we end up with a modernized 50-year-old building that will continue to require expensive maintenance dollars. The estimate to replace the office complex with a new facility, by the way, is $35.3 million. While Congress cannot afford to appropriate funds to build a new facility, we're willing to spend--no, we're forced to waste--almost as much in maintaining an old one. 
   As requested by the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2000, the Department of Energy conducted a feasibility study for replacing the Albuquerque Operations office using an ESPC. The results of the study are enlightening, for it demonstrated that by using anticipated energy, operations, and maintenance efficiencies of a new  replacement building over the old one, the cost savings alone pay for the new facility. What's more, the analysis forecasts that after the annual ESPC loan payment is made to the contractor, there is a $1 million per year surplus. Over a 25-year contract, the savings to the taxpayer is $25 million. 
   Finally, I want to draw your attention to the broader implications that this legislation has for Federal agencies and taxpayers alike. The application of authority created by this legislation in the replacement of other Federal buildings could result in billions of dollars of avoided waste. Simply by considering operation and maintenance cost savings, we would reap a double benefit of newer facilities and much needed improvements to the Federal infrastructure at a fraction of the cost. And, since ESCOs typically use local companies to provide construction services, this type of program would have a very beneficial effect on local economies. 
   There is certainly enough work within the Federal government to move forward on this ESPC legislation. To this end, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill authorizing the Secretary of Energy to provide for a long term commitment in its Office of Science to the area of nanoscience and nanoengineering. This new area is of fundamental importance for maintaining our global economic leadership in energy technology as well in areas such as microchip design, space and transportation, medicines and biomedical devices. The fields of nanoscience and nanoengineering are so new and broad in their reach that no one industry can support them. They are a perfect example how we in Congress can make a difference to support our nation's technological leadership, a key element of the 21st century global economy. 
   The fields of nanoscience and engineering encompass the ability to create new states of matter by prepositioning the atoms that make up their structure. The physical features that nanoscale R&D will develop are on the order of about 10 nanometers or 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. What we are talking about is making materials and devices not by miniaturization, which is a top down approach. Nanoscience is the bottom up fabrication of materials, atom by atom. When you build materials at this level, amazing things begin to happen. We are talking about microchips whose features will shrink by a factor of 100 below where industry projects they will be in the year 2010. These chip features will lead to radical breakthroughs in speed, cost and density of information storage. In the field of medicine and health, we are talking about drugs whose routes of delivery are literally at the molecular level. It will be possible to custom build proteins and other biological materials for future biomedical devices. In the field of energy efficiency, batteries and fuel cells can be built with storage capacities far exceeding our current state of the art. In the transportation industry, it will be possible to make ultra strong and light materials reducing the weight in airplanes, cars and space vehicles. All these breakthroughs in the diverse industries I have discussed will keep the United States' as a global leader in the 21st century economy. 
   The Department of Energy and its Office of Science are uniquely suited to support this critical research. The Office of Science has been at the forefront of conducting nanotechnology research for the past decade through its broad array of materials, physics, chemistry and biology programs. This authorization bill will carry forth four broad objectives of the Office of Science's existing nanotechnology effort, (1) attain a fundamental understanding of nanoscale phenomena, (2) achieve the ability to design bulk materials with desired properties using nanoscale manipulation, (3) study how living organisms produce materials naturally by arranging their atomic structure and implement it into the design process for nanomaterials, (4) develop experimental and computer tools with a national infrastructure to carry out nanoscience. Let me briefly comment on the fourth area in this list. The Office of Science is the nation's leader in developing and managing national user facilities across the broad range of physical sciences. It would be a natural progression for the Office of Science to develop similar user facilities to advance nanoscience. These facilities, located across the United States, will contain unique equipment and computers which will be accessible to individuals as well as multi-disciplinary teams. In the past, Office of Science national user facilities have served as crossing points between the transition from fundamental science to industrial capability. I expect that these nanoscience user facilities will serve as a similar transition point from long term fundamental research into applied industrial know-how. Accordingly, in this authorization bill I have allotted portions of the yearly budget towards developing these unique user facilities. 
   This bill is an important first step in a combined national nanoscience effort which will help to maintain the technological edge of our U.S. industry. I hope that the other federal R&D agencies will make similar commitments in their areas of expertise. Maintaining this edge, by promoting these long term and high risk investigations is something which we cannot expect in the short time frame world of today's industry. It is critical that our U.S. government step into this void, particularly in the area of nanoscience, and provide the necessary intellectual capital to propel our national economy as a leader in the 21st century.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to address the importance of the Department of Energy's Office of Science, the nation's leading source for fundamental research in the physical sciences for the areas of physics, chemistry, and materials science, and a significant contributor to the biological sciences. Besides funding the individual researcher, the Office of Science leads our nation in providing specialized large user R&D facilities. A partial list of such facilities would include the Stanford Linear Accelerator, the Center for the Microanalysis of Materials at the University of Illinois, The Los Alamos Neutron Science Center, the High Flux Isotope Reactor at Oak Ridge, the high energy accelerators at the Fermilab and the National Synchrotron Light Source at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. These user facilities are national treasures. One cannot over emphasize their importance. They are used by not only university researchers from all 50 states but by industry in both the biological and physical sciences. In 1999, there were 5500 users on just the large light sources alone to investigate new structures of matter in both the biological and physical sciences. In the last four years, the number of biological researchers using these facilities has risen by a factor of four and now accounts for 40 percent of all users. Each of these 5500 investigations on just the light sources alone generates new intellectual property--a dominant export in the 21st century global economy. In short, these facilities provide the critical basic R&D that industry cannot and will not fund directly, R&D that is crucial to maintaining the tremendous technological engine of growth that fuels our economy today. 
   I would like to point out that in the 106th Congress there was a large and successful bipartisan campaign in both the House and Senate to support the Office of Science's budget request for Fiscal Year 2001. However, the Office of Science's 2001 budget request only met the level of its 1990 budget as adjusted in year 2000 dollars. In comparison the overall federal R&D budget for the life sciences has increased by 45 percent in the same period. The trends in the neglect of funding for the Office of Science are deeply disturbing and are now beginning to influence the basic indicators of intellectual property generation. If one tracks the submissions by U.S. researchers in some of our most prestigious physics journals you'll find that in 1990 the United States commanded the lead of submissions at about 50 percent worldwide. In 1999 the submission rate has dropped to about 25 percent worldwide. The momentum at a national level in the physical sciences is one of decline. We should be disturbed by this trend--the physical sciences are the foundation of the microchip industry, the telecommunications industry, the transportation industry and the petrochemical industry. We are talking about what fuels our engine of U.S. economic growth--high technology and maintaining a commanding lead in a 21st century global economy.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in 1998, I co-authored section 3137 of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Public Law 105-261), which dealt with research and other activities conducted at Department of Energy (DOE) laboratories and facilities for other entities. 
   Section 3137(b)(2)(A) allows the Secretary of Energy to impose a federal administrative charge in an amount not to exceed 3 percent of the cost of the research carried out by Federal agencies and other entities at DOE laboratories and facilities. My preference in putting forward this language was to eliminate such charges altogether, but I agreed to some flexibility so that such a change could be phased in. We are now in fiscal year 2001, and the President has signed a bill providing for full appropriations for the Department. I would urge at this point that the phase-out of administrative costs be completed by DOE. For example, it makes little sense to have one Federal agency racking up administrative charges against other Federal agencies for the privilege of using Federal facilities. We should encourage such sharing of common assets in the name of efficient administration, instead of keeping incentives to have each agency build its own duplicative equipment and facilities. Additionally, it is in the public interest to encourage outside use of DOE facilities by other entities. This is because outside entities that want to use DOE laboratory facilities are likely to have similar research interests and aims with the DOE researchers at the labs who also use these facilities. The opportunity for enhanced scientific interaction from facilitating their use of these facilities can result in additional scientific efficiencies that will benefit the government. 
   Accordingly, Mr. President, I urge that the Secretary of Energy reduce these administrative costs to zero for fiscal year 2001 and each succeeding fiscal year.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the President of South Korea, Kim Dae Jung, for winning the Nobel Peace Prize. This is a man who truly deserves this honor, as there are few men in the world today who have worked so tirelessly for democracy and peace in East Asia. Like so many of the outstanding men of our time, President Kim's life reads something like a novel, from his early childhood as a farmer's son on a small Korean island, to his criticism of the Japanese colonial rule, to his constant fight against dictatorship in South Korea, to his relentless pursuit of a constructive engagement policy with North Korea. No part of his path to the present has been easy, and, he came perilously close to losing his life on several occasions. The stories that are told about his near death experiences at the hands of the military regime in South Korea, and the intervention by the United States to save his life, are legendary in his country. He has been accused of nearly every possible political crime, from subversion to treason. But he has persisted and has succeeded, this in spite of the formidable odds against him. Significantly, South Korea has achieved its status as one of the world's most stable democratic countries because of his efforts, and it is appropriate he should be recognized by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for the impact he has made over the years. 
   As my colleagues know, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrived in North Korea earlier this week, her stated goal being to improve relations with that country. This follows the trip to North Korea by President Kim, the trip to this country by North Korean Vice Marshal Jo Myong Rok, and the normalization of relations between North Korea and both Great Britain and Germany--all of which occurred in the last six months and are a direct result of the ``sunshine policy'' that President Kim introduced when he entered office. Needless to say, since the initiation of the policy he has been roundly condemned by government officials and analysts alike as an idealist who did not entirely understand what was at stake in the region. Recall it was only in June of 1999 that North and South Korea fought a battle off the South Korean coast. But President Kim has persevered and, as a result, has brought the region closer to peace and stability than any time in the last fifty years. This is no small accomplishment. 
   There is no doubt that South Korea has some serious challenges to face in the immediate future. Looking at the South Korean economy, although it has recovered substantially from the 1997 financial crisis, it is again showing signs of instability. The reforms that were considered necessary by President Kim for a sustained transformation--financial, corporate, and governmental--have not yet fully occurred, raising the possibility of another crisis down the road. It is also true that most of the rapprochement that has taken place between South Korea and North Korea is symbolic in nature, leading to hard questions concerning what concrete actions will be undertaken to increase cooperation and decrease tensions in the region. 
   But hopefully the Nobel Peace Prize will provide President Kim with additional leverage for the policies his country has been pursuing, and through greater national and international consensus, he will find a path to the desired end of peace and prosperity in the region. There is no doubt that remarkable steps forward have been taken by all those involved, and I remain optimistic that change can occur. Before she left North Korea, Secretary Albright stated that there  were ``many towering peaks ahead'' in the process. This is, no doubt, true. Pragmatic and reciprocal confidence-building mechanisms will be required to convince all the parties involved that the peace process should move forward. But it is also true that the prospects for cooperation are brighter than ever before. And much of this progress can be directly attributed to President Kim. 
   So, Mr. President, I take this opportunity to congratulate President Kim for his selection by the Nobel Committee, to celebrate those things that he has accomplished in his life, and to wish him much success in the days, months, and years that follow.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator for addressing this issue. We are clearly looking, in the next 15 years, at a substantial relicensing workload for hydropower facilities. No one can be against wanting to conduct that process in an efficient and informed manner. But, these projects have multiple impacts and benefits that cut across a wide range of issues that are important to the citizens who live in the vicinity of those projects and to the country at large. Any changes to the current system should deal with these multiple impacts in a sensible way. I fully expect that the hydropower relicensing issue will remain as a topic of concern on our Committee agenda in the next Congress, and I am ready to engage in discussions on how to move forward on this issue in a bipartisan fashion.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Colorado. Senator CAMPBELL has worked very hard on this. This has been a major project of his. I do not know how many conversations he and I have had on this subject in the last 2 years, but I can tell you it has been many. There have been many of those conversations. 
   In 1988, Congress passed legislation endorsing a settlement of Indian water rights for the southern Ute and Ute Mountain Indian Tribe which had been agreed to by the Departments of Justice and Interior, the two tribes, and the State of Colorado and the State of New Mexico. But that 1988 legislation envisioned an Animas-La Plata River Project that would meet a number of regional water needs, including the water for the Navajo Nation and the non-Indian communities. 
   The project envisioned by that legislation has proven infeasible to implement in terms of the cost and also in terms of the environmental consequences, but the need to settle these water rights and live up to the national commitment to these two tribes remains. The two Ute tribes and their neighbors within the San Juan basin have developed a revamped water allocation for a downsized Animas project which the Ute tribes will agree to as a settlement of their water rights. The allocation also supplies a much needed water supply to the Shiprock community of the Navajo Nation and continues the concept that tribes in non-Indian communities must work together collaboratively on a regional basis to solve their water needs. 
   The downsized project is in accordance with the final environmental impact statement issued by the Department of the Interior. In the judgment of the Secretary of Interior, it would comply with Federal environmental laws. He has made that very clear. The Secretary has determined that the project authorized in this legislation also will meet the trust responsibilities of the United States with regard to the settlement of the water rights of these two tribes. 
   This is a project and an issue that has been a concern of people in the northwest part of New Mexico for many years. I have seen various versions of this project discussed and considered over this period of time. I am persuaded that this final so-called ``Animas Lite,'' which is what is generally discussed, or the name that has come to be attached to what is now being considered by the Senate, is a good resolution of many conflicting and competing concerns. 
   I hope very much that we can pass this bill, that we can do so without amendment, and that we can send it to the President for his action. 
   Again, I commend Senator CAMPBELL for his hard work in getting us to this point. I hope very much we can follow his lead and send this legislation to the President for his signature. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield back my time.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr President, I rise today to clarify my position on the vote we are about to take on the Agriculture Appropriations bill. I voted for the bill because it contains funding for a broad range of programs that are very important to farmers in New Mexico and the rest of the United States. But that said, I would like to express my opposition and disappointment at this time to the way this bill frames our national policy toward Cuba. 
   First, let me say that this bill is remarkable in that it represents a dramatic step forward in how the United States deals with restrictions on sales  of food and medicine to designated terrorist states. After considerable debate among my colleagues on this issue, relative consensus has been attained that suggests that unilateral sanctions against countries like North Korea, Sudan, Iran, and Libya are not effective, and that any future economic policy in this regard must include the multi-lateral cooperation of other like-minded governments. Even more importantly, many of my colleagues have come to the conclusion that official sanctions on food and medicine is an inappropriate way to achieve our foreign policy goals. The logic here is straightforward: not only do these sanctions hurt those individuals most in need in these countries--the innocent civilians who are being oppressed by oftentimes ruthless regimes--but they also hurt American businesses that would directly gain from such exports. American farmers in particular suffer under these constraints, and I am convinced those constraints should be removed immediately. 
   I should emphasize here that the elimination of sanctions does not imply that we as a deliberative body agree with the policy pronouncements or activities of terrorist countries. Quite the contrary, they are reprehensible and, as such, we will continue to register our opposition to them at every opportunity. But as a practical matter the elimination of the sanctions does suggest that we finally recognize that we cannot effectively punish dictators or despots through their own people. Perhaps more significantly in this regard, the United States should not be placed in the difficult position of defending such policies as, in my view, they run against some of our most basic values and traditions. 
   It is for this reason that the Agricultural Appropriations bill as it relates to Cuba is seriously flawed. What we have done in this bill is permitted the sale of food and medicine to most of these countries and, moreover, authorized U.S. public and private financing that would allow this to occur. But we have refused to apply these exact same provisions to Cuba. In the case of Cuba, we have permitted the sale of food and medicine, but we have prohibited U.S. financial institutions from assisting in this process. Of course, Cuba can still purchase food or medicine from the United States, but it must do so with its own capital, or with assistance from third-party financial institutions. In short, Cuba must somehow convince a foreign bank to lend it money to purchase food or medicine, an obvious liability given its current situation. Clearly this limitation placed on Cuba defeats the basic rationale underlying the bill, and makes the exercise of sanctions reform almost entirely symbolic in nature. The bottom line is that our farmers will gain little or nothing in terms of increased sales to Cuba, and that is just plain wrong. 
   This bill is also flawed in that it further restricts travel to Cuba, this after several years of moving forward in areas related to increased scientific, academic, social, and cultural exchange. I find this to be an ill-advised provision in that it runs counter to everything we have experienced in Eastern Europe, East Asia, and Latin America in terms of the dynamics of freedom and democratization. For a number of years now I have supported the right of Americans to travel to Cuba, and I continue to do so at this time. I have also suggested that we allow non-governmental organizations to operate in Cuba and to provide information and emergency relief when needed. Furthermore, I believe that Cuban-Americans with relatives still in Cuba should be permitted to visit Cuba to tend to family emergencies. 
   Let me state clearly that I personally deplore the Castro regime and its heavy-handed tactics toward its people. The lack of freedom and opportunity in that country stands in direct contrast to the United States, as well as most countries in the Western Hemisphere. Cuba now stands alone in the West in its inability to allow the growth of democracy and the protection of individual rights. 
   In my view, Cuba is ripe for change, and the best way to achieve positive change is to allow Americans to communicate and associate with the Cuban people on an intensive and ongoing basis, to re-establish cultural activities, and to rebuild economic relations. To allow the Cuban system to remain closed does little to assert United States influence over policy in that country and it does absolutely nothing in terms of creating the foundation for much-needed political economic transformation. The spread of democracy comes from interaction, not isolation. 
   So for all the positive attributes contained within this bill, I see the provisions as they relate to Cuba to represent a serious step backward that will ultimately harm, not help, the U.S. national interest. This is an anachronistic policy that does no one any good. It is my hope that what some of my colleagues are saying today on the floor is true, that this is merely an initial compromise that lays the foundation for more significant change through legislation in the future. If this is correct, I look forward to working with them to ensure that more constructive policy is indeed enacted. I am convinced it is long overdue.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to undertake studies of several areas to determine whether these areas merit potential designation as units of the National Park System. I am introducing this legislation at the request of the Administration. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Donald J. Barry, Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Fish and Wildlife and Parks, transmitting the proposed legislation, be printed in the RECORD. I also ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.  
   Be it enacted in the Senate and the House of Representatives in the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
   SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
   This Act may be cited as the ``National Park Service Studies Act of 2000''.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Conference Report for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 includes a program that I championed in the Senate during its consideration of this bill, along with Senator THOMPSON and others. This program addresses occupational illnesses scientifically found to be associated with the DOE weapons complex, that have occurred and are now occurring because of activities during the Cold War. 
   This new program was a joint effort of a bipartisan group of Senators and House Members. I would like to knowledge the hard work by my staff and by the staff for Senator FRED THOMPSON, Senator GEORGE VOINOVICH, Senator MIKE DEWINE, Senator MITCH MCCONNELL, and Senator TED KENNEDY. We worked with the Administration, with worker groups, with manufacturers, and with staff from the House of Representatives. 
   The workers in the DOE nuclear weapons complex, both at the production plants and the laboratories, helped us win the Cold War. But that effort left a tragic environmental and human legacy. We are spending billions of dollars each year on the environmental part--cleaning up the physical infrastructure that was contaminated. But we also need to focus on the human legacy. 
   This program is an attempt to put right a situation that should not have occurred. But it proposes to do so in a way that is based on sound science. 
   The amendment focuses federal help on three classes of injured workers. 
   The first group is workers who were involved with beryllium. Beryllium is a non-radioactive metal that provokes, in some people, a highly allergic lung reaction. The lungs become scarred, and no longer function. 
   The second group is workers who dug the tunnels for underground nuclear tests and are today suffering from chronic silicosis due to their occupational exposures to silica, which were not adequately controlled by DOE. 
   The third group of workers are those who had dangerous doses of radiation on the job. 
   Along with the workers who are covered by the compensation program being created by this legislation, we are reaching back to the uranium miners and millers who were compensated under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA, and providing them with a similar benefit of a total of $150,000 and ongoing medical care. I think that this is only a matter of simple justice, and I strongly supported its inclusion in the current legislation. Early in this Congress, I introduced legislation that would have provided $200,000 in compensation for the uranium miners and millers--the same financial payment that was initially proposed for the DOE workers in this legislation. I am glad that the final result is a better deal for the persons being compensated under RECA, as well as the persons being compensated under this new program.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I rise to support the passage of H.R. 3244, a bill to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA. In 1994, when I voted in favor of the Violence Against Women Act I supported the purposes of the legislation and I believed the grants authorized in VAWA would provide the resources needed by New Mexico organizations, local governments and tribal governments to  tackle the growing problem of domestic violence. Now it is six years later and I am pleased to report that I have witnessed first-hand the many benefits of VAWA to New Mexico. I now realize how important VAWA was to New Mexico and I fully appreciate the strides New Mexico was able to make as a result of this legislation. Women and families in New Mexico have benefitted tremendously from VAWA and I rise today to lend my support to passage of VAWA II. 
   In New Mexico, we now have several organizations that are devoted to stopping violence against women. One example is the PeaceKeepers Domestic Violence Program based at San Juan Pueblo, New Mexico. PeaceKeepers is a domestic violence program that serves individuals that reside within the Eight Northern Pueblos which include the pueblos of Nambe, Picuris, Pojoaque, San Ildefonso, San Juan, Santa Clara, Tesuque and Taos. Peacekeepers is a consortium of individuals and is comprised of social workers, counselors, victims advocates, a civil attorney and a prosecutor. Because of VAWA grants, PeaceKeepers has been able to implement a comprehensive approach to address domestic violence in Indian Country. 
   The social workers and counselors provide counseling to victims, batterers and children of victims. Approximately twenty men have completed the 24 week batterers therapy program and are working to improve their lives and the lives of their families. The victims advocates provide support in court, assist with obtaining and enforcing protection orders and aid victims with legal matters and basic housing needs. The prosecutor on the Peacekeepers panel is made possible because of a VAWA Rural Victimization grant. 
   PeaceKeepers also provides training for tribal courts, law enforcement and tribal government personnel on domestic violence issues. The civil attorney also assists victims with legal assistance on matters such as child support, custody issues and protection orders. Safety for victims and accountability for offenders is the primary goal of PeaceKeepers. In the end, PeaceKeepers is about providing information, options and advocacy to victims of domestic violence. 
   When VAWA passed in 1994, the States and local organizations were finally provided with the resources they needed to implement programs to respond to the problem of violence against women. I am told repeatedly by sheriffs in counties throughout New Mexico that their urgent calls are usually the result of a domestic violence situation occurring. While VAWA has not stopped domestic violence from occuring, it has provided law enforcement agencies and courts with the training and resources they need to respond to domestic violence cases. Most importantly, VAWA has provided States and local organizations with the resources to begin tackling the underlying problems of domestic violence and given them resources to develop innovative methods to start breaking the cycle of violence in our communities. 
   Another organization in New Mexico that I am proud to support is the Esperanza Domestic Violence Shelter in northern New Mexico. I became acquainted with Esperanza a few years ago when they approached me because they were having trouble meeting the needs of their community. Esperanza operates in four counties and in 1998, Esperanza helped more than 2,000 people, including 1,100 victims of domestic violence, 510 children and teens and 424 abusers. As the name indicates, Esperanza offers women and families hope. Hope that they can live in a safe home, hope that they can survive outside of an abusive relationship and hope that they can offer a better life for their children. Esperanza has provided the supportive services needed for victims that reside in the extensive rural areas of New Mexico--victims who were often overlooked before VAWA. 
   I am very disappointed that it has taken so long for the Senate to take up and reauthorize VAWA. Last year when the reauthorization bill was introduced by Senator BIDEN, I agreed to cosponsor the legislation because I understand the importance of VAWA to New Mexico. Since 1994, New Mexico agencies have received over $17 million in VAWA grants. These VAWA grants have reached all four corners of my state and they have impacted the lives of thousands of New Mexicans. 
   One of the benefits of VAWA is that it authorized grants to address a variety of 
   problems associated with violence against women. In 1999, Northern New Mexico Legal Services, Inc. received $318,500 under the Civil Legal Assistance grant program. In 1998, the City of Albuquerque received $482,168 under the Grants to Encourage Arrest Policies grant program. And between 1996 and this year, 20 New Mexico organizations received grants under the Rural Domestic Violence and Child Abuse grant program--20 grants totaling over $6.5 million. 
   In addition, Indian tribes in New Mexico have benefitted significantly from the passage of VAWA. So far, nine tribal governments and tribal-related organizations received nearly $2 million in grants under the Violence Against Women Discretionary Grants for Indian Programs. I am pleased to see that the pueblos of Acoma, Jemez, Laguna, San Felipe, Santa Ana and Zuni have been proactive and sought out these VAWA grants to make their pueblos a safer place for women and a better place for families. The State of New Mexico has also benefitted enormously from VAWA. Since 1995, the New Mexico Crime Victims Reparations Commission has been awarded over $6 million in VAWA funds. 
   Unless VAWA is reauthorized, domestic violence shelters in New Mexico will be closed, rape crisis centers will be shut down and thousands of victims of violence will be left without the options they have been provided under VAWA. This isn't speculation. I have received calls from police chiefs, shelter directors, church leaders, and other citizens who have told me that they will have to shut down their programs unless VAWA is reauthorized. Moreover, many prosecutors in New Mexico will lose the resources they have utilized to prosecute crimes against women. Because of the objections to bringing up VAWA for debate in the Senate, the original VAWA was allowed to expire on September 30th. That should not have happened. The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in favor of reauthorizing VAWA by a vote of 415-3 before VAWA expired. We need to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and we need to do it now. 
   While violence in the United States has fallen dramatically over the past 6 years, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that almost one-third of women murdered each year are killed by a husband or boyfriend. I believe the drop in crime we have experienced over the past 6 years is partly attributable to the passage of VAWA and the resources it made available to combat violence against women. We should not turn back the clock and go back to the level of violence we experienced in 1993. We should not go back to the days when people did not discuss domestic violence and women in abusive relationships lacked options for them and their children. 
   I commend Senator LEAHY and Senator BIDEN for their work on VAWA and their commitment to stopping domestic violence in this country. The amendments to VAWA will take the program further and expand the number of people benefitting from VAWA grants. I am pleased that the amount available for use by Indian tribal governments under the STOP grants was increased from 4 percent to 5 percent. In addition, 5 percent of the $40 million Rural Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Enforcement grants will be set aside for use by Indian tribal governments in the new bill. 
   I am also pleased to see that institutions of higher education will be provided with resources to address violence on college campuses. Schools will now be able to utilize $30 million in VAWA grants to install lighting and other deterrent measures to enhance the security of their campuses. 
   I also support the addition of transitional housing assistance to the VAWA. Many individuals who stay in abusive relationships often do so because they are financially dependent on their abuser. Transitional housing assistance will provide these victims and their families with temporary housing while they regain their financial independence. 
   The battered immigrant women provision is also important to many New  Mexico residents. No longer will battered immigrant women and children be faced with deportation for reporting an abuser on whom they may be dependent on for an immigration benefit. No person residing in the United States should be immune from prosecution for committing a violent crime because of a loophole in an immigration law. 
   Mr. President, VAWA is worthy legislation that is good for New Mexico and women and families across the country. VAWA should be reauthorized and passed in the form proposed today.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to advise Members of the Senate that New Mexico lost a very distinguished citizen and a good friend with the death of E.S. Johnny Walker on Sunday at the age of 89. His life of public service began with 4 years in the Army in World War II. Subsequently, it included two terms in our State legislature in the House of Representatives in Santa Fe, followed by service as commissioner of our public lands in New Mexico and commissioner of the bureau of revenue. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1964 and served two terms here in Washington representing New Mexico in the House of Representatives. 
   Johnny is survived by his wife Polly, to whom he was married for 63 years; also by their two children, Mike Walker and Janet Walker Steele; also by grandchildren and great-grandchildren, colleagues, and, of course, many friends. I am proud to say that his friends included my family and, of course, me. We have known the Walkers for decades. 
   I fondly recall his friendship with my parents and with my uncle, John Bingaman, during the time when I was growing up in Silver City. He was a ``man of the people'' in the very best sense of that phrase. He worked very hard for the interest of the people of New Mexico, and he will be remembered warmly in our State for his humanity and for his great service.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator DOMENICI of New Mexico to introduce legislation that is intended address a significant problem facing some rural states today--a serious shortage of physicians. The bills we are introducing are intended to demonstrate that physician shortages, and recruitment and retention problems can be ameliorated in some rural states by a multifaceted approach, including providing incentives for physicians in training to practice in areas where they are most likely to be needed. 
   The Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME) has for some time held the position that the U.S., in the aggregate, has enough, if not too many, physicians. However, COGME's most recent report, published in March 1999, documented that almost half of the counties in our country are designated as Health Professional Shortage Areas--a remarkable finding, given almost three decades of Federal government efforts to address the geographic maldistribution of physicians. 
   In our State of New Mexico we have physician shortages that are worsening, with certain types of speciality physicians being in the shortest supply. According to 1998 data from the American Medical Association, New Mexico is 20 percent below the U.S. national average of 224 patient care physicians per 100,000 persons. In 15 New Mexico counties, there is no more than 1 physician or less per 1000 population, and 1 New Mexico county has no physician at all to care for its population. 
   And, Mr. President, New Mexico is not alone. Other rural states are also suffering. 
   A recent Health Care Finance Administration report showed that there has been a decline over the past 5 years in certain types of specialty physicians either practicing medicine or participating in the Medicare program in many rural states. The worst loss for New Mexico has occurred in thoracic surgery with a 35 percent decline. Several other specialities, such as urology, ophthalmology, and psychiatry, are not that far behind. 
   The only significant physician growth that can be seen is in primary care and that's still not adequate. With losses occurring in certain physician specialties, problems for all physicians' practices are continuing to worsen--they can't refer patients to specialists without great difficulty. For example, in New Mexico, there have been accounts of patients being referred to ear, nose and throat doctors having to wait up to 9 months for a non-emergency consultation. Without a timely in-state consultation, the patient's primary care physician may have to refer the 
   patient to an out of state speciality physician for care. This is frustrating for the physician, and costly and time consuming for the patient. 
   As many of you know, New Mexico is one of the nation's poorest states, with a large uninsured population. In 1998, it ranked 48th in the amount of personal income per capita. For many physicians, this means they may never get paid for much of the work they do. 
   The physician shortage is becoming so severe in our state that last year the New Mexico Medical Society conducted a survey of our physicians to try to find out about how doctors are faring in the state. The response from New Mexico physicians was shocking--42 percent of the physicians surveyed said that they are seriously or somewhat seriously considering leaving their medical practice, and 40 percent said that reimbursement rates are a significant problem. Comments offered by physicians in this survey were very clear--``I make a good income, but to do that I have to work 65-70 hours a week, in, and week out. The reimbursement rates are such that I could move to a lot of nice places and maintain my income and work three-quarters as much. Family life is important.'' 
   Almost weekly, New Mexico newspapers report about problems caused by provider shortages. On September 7th, the Albuquerque Journal carried a story about a women who had fallen, bruised her spinal cord, and rapidly developed paralysis of both hands and arms. She had to wait 18 hours to be seen on an emergency basis because of a critical shortage of neurosurgeons in Albuquerque, New Mexico's largest city. Stories like this one are becoming more and more common. There are many accounts of New Mexicans having to wait up to 9 months for an appointment to be seen by a specialist, and of newborns having to be transported out of state because the neonatal intensive care unit does not have adequate physician coverage. 
   My offices in Washington, DC, and New Mexico are constantly receiving letters and phone calls, and visits from constituents who want to tell us about physician shortages, physicians leaving the State of New Mexico, and the loss of their individual providers. They can't understand why this happening in a country with the greatest healthcare system in the world. 
   All of these problems clearly show that New Mexico's health care system  has broken down. However, it is not only New Mexico that is experiencing these problems. Other rural states are experiencing similar problems--they have become states that are being avoided by physicians entering practice. With the population in these states continuing to grow, the problem just gets worse. If this situation is not addressed right now, it will result in a complete breakdown of an already fragile health care delivery system. 
   This is why we are each introducing this package of legislation today. These two bills, the ``Rural States Physician Recruitment and Retention Demonstration Act of 2000, will together, when enacted, demonstrate that physician shortages and recruitment and retention problems can be ameliorated in rural states by instituting a comprehensive plan that provides for a proper physician speciality mix that will address the needs of a rural state's population. 
   My legislation will require the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a demonstration program that will: 
   Target up to a 15 percent increase in physician residency slots identified to be in short supply in demonstration states. These expanded residency slots would carry with them a legally binding commitment to practice in the demonstration state on a year of training for year of service basis. 
   Establish a loan repayment program to provide incentives for physicians in identified shortage specialities to locate their practices in demonstration states. This program will help physicians repay their educational loans on a year of service for a year of loan repayment basis in return for a commitment to practice in the demonstration state. 
   Develop a demonstration state health professional data base to capture and track the practice characteristics and distribution of licensed health care providers. This data will be used to develop a baseline and track changes in a demonstration state's health professions workforce, target this demonstration program to identified physician specialities and determine a state's need for other types of supportive health professionals. 
   Provide for an evaluation of each element of our comprehensive demonstration by the Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME) for physician workforce issues, and by Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (Medpac) for Medicare reimbursement and Medicare funded graduate medical education positions. 
   As I mentioned earlier, one of the primary reason physicians report they are leaving New Mexico is because reimbursement is too low, particularly when combined with other factors like long work days, inability to recruit speciality physicians, and provide comprehensive patient care in a reasonable period of time. 
   That's why the second part of this package, the Physician Recruitment and Retention Act of 2000, consists of legislation that will provide physicians that are practicing in demonstration states with a special 5 percent Medicare part B reimbursement rate increase. This increase will provide a financial incentive to physicians to continue to practice in the underserved states and also to continue to participate in the Medicare program. 
   Both Senator DOMENICI and I anticipate that by the end of this demonstration program, physician shortages, particularly in specific physician specialities, will be greatly diminished or even have disappeared. 
   Mr. President, the health care system in New Mexico is near collapse for reasons too numerous and complex to get into here. These bills we are introducing today, in combination with the fixes we are making to the problems resulting from the BBA of 1997, may stave off disaster for a while. I certainly hope they will.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I'm introducing a bill designed to lower the cost of the government's information technology systems and improve how those systems serve our citizens by encouraging greater use of a ``share-in-savings'' approach to contracting for information technology (IT). 
   Under a share-in-savings approach, the government contracts with a company to provide an improved, lower cost IT service and the company pays the up-front costs of the project, which is not the usual practice. In return, the contractor gets paid a portion of the money saved by the government under the new arrangement. Essentially, the contractor bears the capital costs needed for the government to save some money and has a strong incentive to decrease the government's costs because they get paid a portion of any savings. 
   Although this approach to IT contracting is authorized as a pilot program under the Clinger-Cohen Act, I understand the executive branch has not made much use of this approach to date. Hence, I believe there are opportunities for greater creativity in this area if we give the agencies greater incentives. 
   Basically, my bill does three things. First, and most importantly, it gives agencies an incentive to try a share-in-savings approach by letting them keep up to half the government's net savings to use for additional IT projects, rather than having all the net savings going back to the Treasury. It's just human nature that if you ask someone to do something risky--like a new IT system--but all the benefits go elsewhere, they're not going to be very inclined to do it. That is, unless they get to 
   keep some of the benefits to improve their own operations--which is what this bill let's them do. The point here is that the more agency managers actually are willing to use this approach, the more money the taxpayer will save in the long run. 
   There's precedent for this with regard to certain Energy Savings Performance Contracts. Under a provision applicable to the Department of Defense, local base commanders can keep a portion of the savings from those contracts to purchase more energy saving equipment or even for morale and recreation purposes. 
   Second, my bill gives the executive branch as a whole an incentive to try share-in-savings contracting for IT by allowing the pilot program to graduate to a regular authority once a significant number of projects have been done, the approach has been found to be useful, and guidance on how to use the authority has been issued. This gives the top levels of the executive branch a goal to push toward. 
   Finally, my bill will ease implementation of share-in-savings contracting by allowing agency program managers to approve the projects, thereby giving them greater autonomy and streamlining the selection process. Currently, share-in-savings IT projects must be approved by the Administrator of Federal Procurement, a very high level in the executive branch. 
   In sum, my bill will encourage greater use of the share-in-savings approach to IT contracting under the Clinger-Cohen Act by giving the agencies a portion of the savings to reinvest; 
   the executive branch a goal; and the program managers more autonomy. 
   I had originally planned to introduce this as an amendment to the Treasury, Postal Appropriations bill. But, because it doesn't look like we'll have a chance to really debate that bill this year, I've decided to introduce this bill today to get my proposal before the Senate. 
   Now, to give some credit where credit is due, I got interested in this topic because of a piece I saw in Roll Call on E-Government by Patricia McGinnis of the Council for Excellence in Government. In it she mentioned the idea of letting agencies retain some of the IT savings they achieve in order to reinvest it in more IT. 
   I also understand that the Governmental Affairs Committee recently put up a web site to discuss potential e-government policies and legislation. And, I was glad to learn that the share-in-savings approach to IT is one of its topics. 
   So, I hope the Governmental Affairs committee will take a thorough look at the ideas in my bill. I look forward to working with them to find new ways to save the taxpayer money while improving the services they are provided.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to briefly describe my own thoughts on this royalty-in-kind issue. 
   First, let me say, the Senator from California, and, before her, the Senator from Alaska, talked about a great many issues related to our energy situation. I do not have the time and I have not come to the floor prepared to address all of those. I generally agree with the Senator from California that we need a balanced energy policy. We need to not only do things to increase supply, but we also need to reduce demand in this country. We have fallen short in that regard. 
   I have proposed legislation, which the administration strongly supports, much of which the Senator from California referred to, that I believe would help us to reduce demand and also help us to increase production. I am sorry that we have not been able, as a Congress, and as a Senate, to bring that up for consideration this year. I hope we still can before we adjourn, but the days are growing short. 
   Let me speak for a minute about the particular bill and the royalty-in-kind issue. 
   As I understand it, the action which started this discussion was an effort to move to H.R. 2884. This is the House version of EPCA. EPCA stands for Energy Policy and Conservation Act. 
   That is an important piece of legislation. It reauthorizes the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It sets up a heating oil reserve in the Northeast, about which many feel very strongly. It does a variety of things. It gives the Department of Energy authority to pay above-market prices for production from stripper wells in order to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve when the price of oil falls below $15 a barrel. It does other things on the weatherization grant program. It has some useful provisions and contains a variety of other things. 
   It also contains a provision that the Senator from Alaska has strongly supported, and is intent upon keeping in the bill, on the subject of royalty in kind. 
   Let me explain my thoughts on that. 
   The Congress--for several Congresses now--has spent a lot of time arguing about, How do you determine what the royalty ought to be when the Federal Government allows for production of oil and gas on Federal lands? What amount of money is owed to the Federal Government? 
   We all know it is 12.5 percent; it is one-eighth. But how much is that in dollars? There is a lot of litigation on that subject. There has been, for a substantial period of time, a lot of debate on the subject. 
   The Federal agencies which manage our Federal oil and gas resources indicate that in certain circumstances they believe the United States has the opportunity to realize more money by actually taking its one-eighth in royalty in kind; that is, actually taking that royalty in the form of oil or gas instead of receiving it in cash. 
   The thought is that there is more of a benefit to the Government in some circumstances. Existing law authorized the Department of Interior to do that very thing. But under this authority, the Mineral Management Service, MMS, which is part of the Department of Interior, has conducted several very promising pilot programs on this subject of royalty in kind. Two of the latest of these involve Federal onshore oil, conducted in cooperation with the State of Wyoming and offshore gas in the Gulf of Mexico. Those are two examples. 
   Early indications from both of these are that these pilot programs will result in greater revenue for the United States and for the taxpayer than would have been received had the oil and gas been taken in value, had the Government been paid dollars instead. 
   As an example, the thought of the Senator from California, as I understood it, was that there is something unfair to the Government by having  the Government take its oil or its gas in kind. An analogy which we might think about is if the Government were owed one beer out of a six-pack, would it make more sense for the Government to take that beer or would it be better for the Government to go through a lengthy process of trying to establish the value of that one beer once it considered the cost of transporting the six-pack and the cost of storing it and all the other things. And in some circumstances, as I understand it, the Department of Interior, through this Minerals Management Service, has determined that it is in their interest to go ahead and take the royalty in kind instead of trying to calculate and argue about the price of it. 
   Based on these programs that have been in place, MMS, the Minerals Management Service, has determined that it could conduct a more efficient program, one that would be more likely to result in increased revenues, if it were able to pay for contracts for transporting and processing and selling the oil and gas it takes from Federal leases. Existing authorities allow the MMS to enter into contracts for these services but do not provide a way for them to pay except under general agency appropriations. 
   The amendment the Senator from Alaska has offered and I have cosponsored grants to the Department of Interior authority to use the money it makes when it sells oil and gas it takes in kind to pay for the expenses incurred in preparing it for sale, including its transportation, processing, aggregating, storing, and marketing. There is a 5-year sunset on this. 
   The amendment adds to existing law some very substantial protections for the Government and for the taxpayer. 
   It requires the Department to stop taking royalties in kind if the Secretary of Interior determines that it is not beneficial to the United States to take royalty in that form.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. It also requires that the Department report extensively to Congress on how the program is going. None of these requirements exist in current law. The royalty-in-kind provision in the Interior appropriations bill does not have these protections. This very bill we are getting ready to vote on in the next few days, the Interior appropriations bill, does grant authority to the Department to take the Federal 
   Government's royalty in kind, but it does not have the protections that are in the amendment the Senator from Alaska and I are cosponsoring. 
   While 1 year is better than nothing, which is the Interior appropriations language--the Department clearly supports that provision in the Interior appropriations bill--a 5-year authorization gives the agency enough time to actually enter into contracts it would need to seriously test the workability of this program. 
   I wanted to clarify my own views at least as to what this provision would do. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act is important legislation. I hope we can resolve this dispute and get the legislation up for consideration in this Congress. 
   I do support the royalty-in-kind provision the Senator from Alaska and I have cosponsored. It will be beneficial to the Government--not to the oil industry but to the Government. It would be a win/win situation, and I do not see it as in any way breaking faith with the American taxpayer. 
   It would be good public policy for us to go ahead with this. I hope we can do so before the Congress adjourns. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first let me say a word about the procedural morass that we find ourselves in, as I understand it. I do not claim to understand it all. The Democratic leader was trying to get the Senate to actually consider and vote on this Latino Fairness Act, which I strongly support. But in order to keep that from happening, I understand the majority leader came forward with a motion to proceed to S. 2557. Now, S. 2557 is a bill to protect the energy security of the United States and to decrease America's dependence on foreign oil sources. This is a bill, parts of which I support but many parts of which I cannot support because they have, in my view, wrongheaded policy judgments in them. But that is the National Energy Security Act of 2000 to which the majority leader made a motion to proceed. 
   I am informed by those who follow this activity on the floor more closely than do I that there is no serious effort by the Republican majority to actually consider or vote on or pass any legislation regarding energy security; that that is not a subject which they believe has enough of a priority attached to it that it justifies any real action by this Senate. 
   So we are somewhat on this issue because of a procedural effort to keep us from considering something else. That is just by way of background, to identify for people why I am here today speaking about an amendment which I would offer. If we ever did seriously consider this National Energy Security Act of 2000, then I would offer an amendment to that on behalf of myself, Senator DASCHLE, Senator BYRD, Senator BAUCUS, Senator BAYH, Senator JOHNSON, Senator LEVIN, Senator ROCKEFELLER, and Senator AKAKA. 
   The amendment I would offer would replace the text of S. 2557 in its entirety, and in its place it would offer a comprehensive approach to energy policy, much of which we originally introduced as S. 1833 nearly a year ago. 
   In order to explain why I believe it would be good for this Congress and good for this Senate to go ahead and pass this legislation that I would offer as an amendment, let me just say a few things about the energy situation. There have been several speeches. I do not know about today; I haven't watched the floor proceedings all day, but I did see yesterday where several people were speaking about the problems we have with our energy supply. Those problems are real. 
   With the supplies of crude oil and refined products and natural gas extremely tight, which they are, energy prices and the availability of some of these products are in the forefront of the minds of a lot of people. In my State, people are receiving in their mail notices from the utility companies saying the price of natural gas will be going up, their utility bills will be going up substantially this winter. So I believe it is essential we assess the current circumstance and that we develop a strategy for remedying the identified deficiencies. 
   Current prices are extreme when we compare them with the relatively low prices that we have enjoyed for the past 10 years. Aside from the oil price spike at the time of the Gulf war, the average annual price of crude oil during the 1990s was about $15 a barrel. The price of natural gas is somewhat less volatile than oil, historically, but it was also quite low. It was $1.84 per thousand cubic feet. That was because of what was called by all who focused on it ``the gas bubble.'' 
   This was excess supply following the restructuring of the natural gas markets. 
   The reality is that oil and natural gas are commodities. They are commodities whose prices rise and fall just as those of any other commodity. Since oil and natural gas are often developed together out of common reserves, as they are in parts of my State, the dramatic drop-off in oil drilling in 1998 and 1999 had a direct impact on natural gas supply at the same time that it was impacting future oil supply. 
   So true to what we all learned in Economics 101, once supply was reduced enough--with some direct market intervention by OPEC, I would add--the price of oil began to rise and drilling began again. Drilling is now going on at a robust pace around this country. While U.S. oil production overall has been in decline since 1970, the deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico have recently proven to be a very active oil and gas production area for our country. The deep water royalty incentives that were proposed by Senator Johnston when he was representing Louisiana in this body, which were also supported by this administration, have been a major contributor to the 65-percent increase in offshore oil production that has occurred under this administration. That is something that is often not focused on, but there has been a 65-percent increase in offshore oil production since this administration came into office. 
   Natural gas production on Federal lands--and that is the bulk of the natural gas production in my State--has also increased 60 percent under this administration due, in part, to the development of coalbed methane. My State of New Mexico has been a major contributor to that growth in natural gas production. We look forward to a continuation of that trend. 
   A recent survey by Salomon-Smith Barney projected the highest increase this year in worldwide spending on oil and gas exploration since 1981. The lion's share of that increased spending is directed toward North America, with companies planning to spend 76 percent more on natural gas projects alone this year than they did in 1999. So that is good news. However, those new supplies will not begin having a significant impact on natural gas prices until at least next spring or next summer. 
   There has been considerable consternation about the President's decision just this last week to go forward with a swap of 30 million barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve to address concerns about heating oil stocks. I want to offer to this debate, which has occurred sporadically here on the Senate floor, the following information from the International Energy Agency's September monthly oil market report. That report says that world oil demand is always highest in the fourth quarter of the year, and the IEA, the International Energy Agency, is predicting a drop in world oil demand in the first quarter of next year on the order of 1 million barrels per day. In the near term, however--and this is a quote from their report:  
   The market is too fragile. It needs higher inventories to protect against circumstances such as an abnormally cold winter. Without adequate stock coverage, the market lumbers from one problem to another, creating instability in its wake and dragging prices ever higher.  
   The reduction in world oil demand in the spring, coupled with the new production 
   from non-OPEC sources, should bring prices down appreciably in the spring and summer of next year.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I also ask that an article that appears in this morning's New York Times, the September 27 New York Times, also be printed in the RECORD after my statement. This is an article by Paul Krugman entitled ``A Drop in the Barrel.''

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the thrust of that article is that the decision to go ahead with release of oil from the SPR, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, was the right decision. He says we should be tapping our oil reserves. In fact, our mistake was that we waited too long; we should have been doing it months ago. But he applauds the decision of the President last week to go ahead now. I commend that article to my colleagues. 
   Beyond crude oil availability, the other key and a more complicated element is U.S. refining capacity, which currently is at near maximum utilization. 
   While it is true that the number of refineries has decreased during the past 10 years, the capacity has actually increased. In 1990, there were 205 refineries. By 1998, that number had decreased to 163. However, the total capacity increased from 15.57 million barrels per day to 15.71 million barrels per day over that same period. Certain small, inefficient refineries which were originally built to take advantage of the old oil allocation rules were shut down rather than upgraded to produce cleaner fuels, but the refineries that did upgrade to comply with the Clean Air Act actually expanded capacity--more specifically, the capacity to produce light products. 
   According to the Economist magazine, there was considerable excess capacity in the U.S. refining sector as recently as late 1996. I quote from an article in the Economist:  
   Demand for oil in North America and Western Europe is sluggish. According to the International Energy Agency, it was only 1 percent higher in 1995 than 1993. Yet both regions are plagued with over-capacity. In 1990-1995, the capacity of American refiners to produce light-oil products, such as gasoline, increased by an average of 1 million barrels per day--almost double the rate of growth in demand.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, robust demand growth has finally caught up to eliminate that excess capacity, both in the United States and in Europe. Clearly, domestic refining capacity is a significant concern that needs to be addressed, but if near-term crude prices come down enough--as they have started to since the announcement to swap oil from the reserve--the underutilized refining capacity in Asia and the Caribbean could be utilized to increase the distillate stocks in the world market. 
   There are many political and economic factors beyond the control of the Congress and the administration that drive OPEC decisions. To a substantial extent, the price of oil will be driven by world market factors beyond our control. Natural gas, on the other hand, is largely sold in the North American market. While there is no quick or easy fix, we need to assess the impacts of our current policies on natural gas and on oil development during very low world oil price periods to avoid these boom-and-bust cycles in the future. 
   No one wants to go back to the days of regulation with gasoline lines and natural gas shortages, but we do need to determine where there are market inefficiencies and market failures that cause this extreme volatility in product stocks and prices. 
   One of the major problems in the crude oil market is uncertainty about actual global consumption and production until months after the fact. Our Energy Secretary, Bill Richardson, has already begun the process of improving market data with the successful meeting this summer involving both the consuming countries and OPEC representatives. 
   We also need a better assessment of whether and how increased demand for oil products and natural gas will be met, and this includes better coordination of environmental and fuel policies. 
   Over the long run, the least costly, most environmentally 
   benign, and sustainable thing we can do is to use energy more efficiently. 
   I refer to this chart to make that point. When one looks at the petroleum consumption in this country by sector, it is very easy to conclude what our problem is. Our problem is consumption in the transportation sector. That is this top line, which is going off the chart. 
   What does that mean? It means the cars especially the sport utility vehicles, we are driving now are much less fuel efficient than they could and should be. That makes no sense. We now have much better technology than we used to have. We know how to produce a car with good power without it consuming such enormous quantities of gasoline, and in fact there are some of those on the market. 
   Because of lack of attention, because of lack of commitment, because of lack of purpose, we in the Congress in particular, but also the administration, have given too little attention to this transportation issue. 
   We are going to have to get serious about energy efficiency in this country if we are going to ever reduce the demand and see to it that we do not become further dependent upon foreign sources of petroleum products. 
   That is not popular, I understand. We had a vote last year on whether or not to even allow the study of whether sports utility vehicles could be considered to be cars and come under corporate fuel efficiency standards. The truth is, that effort last year failed. Most Senators chose to look the other way and to say this was not something that was a priority. Now we see the result. 
   I found it a little more than ironic that once gasoline prices began to rise this summer, our major auto manufacturers realized they could increase fuel economy of sport utility vehicles and light trucks by as much as 25 percent without costing jobs or eliminating the features that consumers want in those vehicles. 
   In fact, one of the companies' CEO made an announcement that they were going to go ahead and do that on their own, even though nobody required it of them. We need to make sure those efficiency improvements show up in the marketplace as quickly as possible, and we need to educate Americans on the importance of taking advantage of those efficiency improvements. 
   There was reference yesterday to a New York Times article suggesting that Japan appears unaffected by the current high price of crude oil. I point out that according to the Energy Information Administration, Japan has among the highest gasoline prices in the OECD, second only to Norway. Approximately half the price of gasoline in Japan is made up of taxes, about 48 percent. American consumers are not as inured to such high prices as the Japanese. The Japanese, however, have done a much better job of increasing overall fuel economy than we have in our country. 
   Many of the provisions in this amendment which I would offer if we were going to seriously consider passing legislation on energy security--and as I said at the beginning of my statement, there is no serious intention on the part of the majority leader to have us consider energy security before this Congress adjourns--but if we were to consider energy security and I were permitted to offer my amendment to S. 2557, it would address a broad range of technologies and industries that are necessary to meet our energy needs. 
   The amendment would include a serious commitment to more efficient use of energy in its many forms, as well as incentives to ensure we can maintain production of our domestic resources. 
   It would address several issues. I will list six of them. 
   First, it would address the purchase of more efficient appliances, homes, and commercial buildings; 
   Second, address greater use of distributed generation; that is, fuel cells, microturbines, combined heat and power systems and renewables; 
   Third, the purchase of hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles and development of the infrastructure to service those vehicles; 
   Fourth, the investment in clean coal technologies and generation of electricity from biomass, including co-firing with coal. 
   Fifth, countercyclical tax incentives for production from domestic oil and gas marginal wells. Those are extremely important in my State. 
   Finally, sixth, provisions to ensure diverse sources of electric power supply are developed in the United States and to continue our investment in demand-side management. 
   I notice the assistant Democratic leader is on the floor and anxious to proceed with other business. I conclude by saying I believe this is an important issue. I hope very much that the majority leader and the Republican majority in the Congress will work with us to pass a bipartisan energy package before we conclude this session.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak for a few minutes about my amendment in the managers' package to the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. My amendment is needed to allow the Army Corps of Engineers to continue to work on a feasibility study to alleviate the chronic flooding in the Southwest Valley of Albuquerque, New Mexico. 
   First, I want to thank the committee chairman, Senator SMITH, the distinguished ranking member, Senator BAUCUS, and Chairman VOINOVICH, as well as their fine staffs for all their good work on WRDA2000 (S. 2796). 
   For a number of years the Southwest Valley area of Albuquerque in my state has been prone to flooding after major rainstorms. The flooding has caused damage to irrigation and drainage structures, erosion of roadways, pavement, telephone and electrical transmission conduits, contaminated water and soil due to overflowing septic tanks, damaged homes, businesses, and farms, and presented hazards to automobile traffic. In 1997, Bernalillo County approached the Army Corps of Engineers to request a reconnaissance study of the chronic flooding problems. 
   The study area encompassed 17.8 square miles of mostly residential neighborhoods along the banks of the Rio Grande in the Southwest Valley and the 50 square miles on the West Mesa, including the Isleta Pueblo, that drain into the valley. The reconnaissance study began in March 1998 and is now completed. 
   The conclusions of the reconnaissance study define the magnitude of the continuing flooding problem in the Southwest Valley. The study also established a clear federal interest in the drainage project, found a positive cost to benefit ratio for the project, and identified work items necessary to begin designing a range of solutions to alleviate the chronic flooding problems in the valley. 
   In 1999, based on the positive findings of the reconnaissance study, the Environment and Public Works Committee authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a full study to determine the feasibility of a project for flood damage reduction in Albuquerque's Southwest Valley. The authorization is contained in section 433 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-53). I want to thank the EPW committee for authorizing this much needed feasibility study. The study began in March 1999 and is expected to be completed in February 2002. 
   Currently, Bernalillo County, the Albuquerque Metropolitan Arroyo Flood Control Authority and the Corps are working cooperatively on the feasibility study. Last year, the administration requested, and the Congress appropriated, $250,000 in Federal funding for the feasibility study. This year, the request was for $330,000. I want to thank the Appropriations Committees in the House and Senate for again providing the full amount requested. 
   Last July I had an opportunity to meet with the engineers from the Corps, the County, and AMAFCA to get an update on the study and to tour the areas in the Southwest Valley that are subject to chronic flooding. At the end of the tour, the Corps indicated to me that based on the initial results of the feasibility study, the flooding there was quite severe but the project did not seem to meet the Corps' required flow criterion of 1800 cubic feet per second for the 100-year flood. These flow criteria are outlined in the Engineering Regulations established for the Corps. Because of the obvious severity of the flooding, the engineers requested a legislative waiver of the regulations. Without a waiver, the Corps could not continue as a partner in the project. They also indicated the Corps' regulations do not contain any provision to waive the peak discharge criterion. 
   I'd like to take a few moments to describe briefly the unique situation in the Southwest Valley that necessitates a waiver of the Corps' standard regulations. The land along the west side of the Rio Grande is essentially flat. The river is contained by large earthen levees, which were built for flood control. When a river is contained this way by levees, the sediment accumulates in the river bed, slowly raising the level of the river. Of course, if there were no levees, when sediment builds up, the river would simply change course to a lower level. However, over the years, as the sediment has continued to accumulate in the Rio Grande, the level of the river within the levees is now higher than the surrounding land. Thus, when there are heavy rains during the monsoon season, the runoff has nowhere to go--it simply flows into large pools on the valley floor, flooding homes and farms. The water can't flow uphill into the river, so it stays there until it either evaporates or is pumped up and hauled away. 
   If the flood water sits in large pools and isn't flowing, it clearly can't meet any criterion based on the flow rate of water. Indeed, given the unique nature of the flooding in the Southwest Valley, most areas subject to chronic flood damage do not meet the Corps' peak discharge criterion. 
   During my visit in July, the three partners in the feasibility study specifically asked me for help in obtaining a waiver of the Corps' technical requirements to deal with this special situation. My amendment provides the necessary waiver the Corps needs to continue to work in partnership with the county and AMAFCA on this project. 
   This is not a new authorization; Congress authorized this study last year. My amendment is a simple technical fix to the existing authorization. I do believe the unique situation in Bernalillo County warrants a waiver of the Corps' standard regulations, and I thank the committee for accepting my amendment.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the amendments that have been voted on in relation to H.R. 4444, a bill that authorizes permanent normal trade relations with China. Over the last two weeks or so, several of my colleagues have introduced very thoughtful legislation specifically designed to address problems that exist at this time in China. Taken alone and at face value, many of these amendments--from human and labor rights to technology transfer to religious freedom to weapons proliferation to clean energy--have been worthy and deserving of my support. At any other time, I would have in fact voted for many of these amendments. I personally am of the view that Chinese officials must continue to make significant and tangible efforts in the future to transform their country's policies to coincide with international rules and norms. Although China is indeed making a very difficult and gradual transition to a more democratic society and a market-based economy, much remains to be done. Chinese officials must reinvigorate their commitment to change, and they will inevitably be open to criticism from both the United States and the international community until they do so. 
   But this said, it is clear that any amendment attached to H.R. 4444 at this time will force the bill into conference, and at this late stage in the session, that means that the bill would effectively be dead. In my mind, this bill is far too important to have this outcome. I believe that H.R. 4444 is one of the most important pieces of legislation we will consider this year, for two reasons. 
   First, it creates new opportunities for American workers, farmers, and businesses in the Chinese market. This  bill is not about Chinese access to the U.S. market as this already exists. The bill is about U.S. access to the Chinese market, because if this bill is passed we will see a significant change in the way China has to conduct business. As a result of this bill, we will over time see a reduction in tariff and non-tariff barriers, liberalization in domestic regulatory regimes, and protections against import surges, unfair pricing, and illegal investment practices. If we do not take action on this bill this year, we will be at a tremendous competitive disadvantage in the Chinese market relative to companies from other countries. 
   We cannot let this happen to American workers. In my state of New Mexico alone we have seen dramatic results from increased trade with China. Our exports to China totaled $147 million in 1998, up from $366,000 in 1993. China was New Mexico's 35th largest export destination in 1993, but now it ranks fourth in this regard. In 1993 only six product groups from New Mexico were heading to China as exports, but in 1998 there were sixteen product groups flowing in that direction, from electrical equipment and components to chemicals to agriculture to furniture. In short, increased trade opportunities with China translates directly to increased economic welfare for New Mexico, and all of the United States. 
   A second reason this legislation is so important relates to U.S. national security. From where I stand, China is playing an increasingly active role in Asia and the world, and it is in our national interest to engage them in discussions concerning these activities on an ongoing and intensive basis. There is simply no benefit to be gained from attempting to isolate or ignore China at this time. It has not worked in the past, and it will not work in the future. I am convinced that our failure to pass this bill will limit our country's ability to influence the direction and quality of change in China. I have visited China, and I can tell you that the China of today looks dramatically different than the China of five years ago. This change is at least in part a direct result of our interaction with the Chinese people. As the PNTR debate moves forward, Congress must decide how it would like China to look five, ten, fifteen, twenty years from now. Do we want China to be a competitor, or an enemy? In my view, PNTR will place us in a particularly strong position to promote positive change in China and increase our capacity to pursue our long-term national interest. 
   Although I am certainly sympathetic to the objectives of many of the amendments offered by my colleagues, I feel the issue of trade with China deserves to be debated on its own merits. For this reason, I have chosen to vote against the amendments offered by my colleagues. But I would like to emphasize at this time that I look forward to the opportunity to address them in the future.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on and give my support to a worthy program called National History Day. National History Day is a year-long, nonprofit program in which children in grades 6-12 research and create historical projects related to a broad annual theme. This year's theme was ``Turning points in History: People, Ideas, Events.'' Using this theme, students research their area of interest and create a project, which is then entered in an annual contest. The primary goal of the National History Day program is to revolutionize the techniques implemented in teaching and training our youth. 
   What I want to emphasize today is the tremendous impact this unique and valuable program has had in my home state of New Mexico. New Mexico's involvement with National History Day began three years ago, and has continued to grow and enrich the lives of New Mexico's youth. The participants in the first year were few, but to date we have had more than one thousand young New Mexicans participate in the state competition. 
   New Mexico students that participate in this program are given the opportunity to expand upon critical thinking and research skills, which in turn help them in all subject areas. The projects they work on give them a greater appreciation of historical events that have helped shape their own hometowns as well as their nation. This hands on approach to history is an innovative way to get students excited and genuinely interested in our great nation's history. 
   I know that with our support, the National History Day program will continue to grow, and I believe that this growth is essential for today's students. When students do not have an opportunity to participate in this program, they miss out on a chance to grow and to better themselves. As Pulitzer Prize winner David McCullough states:  
   Knowledge of history is the precondition of political intelligence. Without history, a society shares no common memory of where it has been, of what its core values are, or what decisions in the past account for the present circumstance.  
   National History Day gives students an opportunity to learn of our history and its importance in their daily lives. 
   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this program.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak for a few minutes about my amendment to the Energy and Water Appropriations Bill now before the Senate. My amendment is needed to allow the Army Corps of Engineers to continue to work on a feasibility study to alleviate the chronic flooding in the Southwest Valley of Albuquerque, New Mexico. 
   First, I want to thank the chairman, Senator DOMENICI, the distinguished ranking member, Senator REID, and their fine staffs for all their good work on this Energy and Water Appropriations bill. This bill provides vital funding for a number of programs that are important to my state of New Mexico and to the nation, and I thank them for their efforts.

   Currently, Bernalillo County, the Albuquerque Metropolitan Arroyo Flood Control Authority and the Corps are working cooperatively on the feasibility study. Last year, the administration requested, and the Congress appropriated $250,000 in federal funding for the feasibility study. This year, the request was for $330,000. I want to thank the committee for again providing the full amount requested. 
   Last July I had an opportunity to meet with the engineers from the Corps, the County, and AMAFCA to get an update on the study and to tour the areas in the Southwest Valley that are subject to chronic flooding. At the end of the tour, the Corps indicated to me that based on the initial results of the feasibility study, the flooding there was quite severe but the project did not seem to meet the Corps' required flow criterion of 1800 cubic feet per second for the 100-year flood. These flow criteria are outlined in the Engineering Regulations established for Corps. Because of the obvious severity of the flooding, the engineers requested a legislative waiver of the regulations. Without a waiver, the Corps could not continue as a partner in the project. They also indicated the Corps' regulations do not contain any provision to waive the peak discharge criterion. 
   I would like to take a few moments to describe briefly the unique situation in the Southwest Valley that necessitates a waiver of the Corps' standard regulations. The land along the west side of the Rio Grande is essentially flat. The river is contained by large earthen levees, which were built for flood control. When a river is contained this way by levees, the sediment accumulates in the river bed, slowly raising the level of the river. Of course, if there were no levees, when sediment builds up, the river would simply change course to a lower level. However, over the years, as the sediment has continued to accumulate in the Rio Grande, the level of the river within the levees is now higher than the surrounding land. Thus, when there are heavy rains during the monsoon season, the runoff has nowhere to go--it simply flows into large pools on the valley floor, flooding homes and farms. The water can't flow uphill into the river, so it stays there until it either evaporates or is pumped up and hauled away. 
   If the flood water sits in large pools and isn't flowing, it clearly can't meet any criterion based on the flow rate of water. Indeed, given the unique nature of the flooding in the Southwest Valley, most areas subject to chronic flood damage do not meet the Corps' peak discharge criterion. 
   During my visit in July, the three partners in the feasibility study specifically asked me for help in obtaining a waiver of the Corps' technical requirements to deal with this special situation. My amendment provides the necessary waiver the Corps needs to continue to work in partnership with the county and AMAFCA on this project. This is not a new authorization; Congress authorized this study last year. My amendment is a simple technical fix to the existing authorization. Similar language is already in the House companion to this Energy and Water appropriations bill. I do believe the unique situation in Bernalillo County warrants a waiver of the Corps' standard regulations, and I hope the Senate will adopt my amendment.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to address briefly the issue of funding for the fundamental science and engineering research supported by the Department of Energy. 
   The DOE is the leading source of federal support for the physical sciences in the nation. Not many people know that, but it is true. DOE and its predecessor agencies developed this broad portfolio of physical sciences research in pursuit of the agency's statutory missions. To understand energy and its myriad transformations, you have to know a lot about the properties of matter, and of energy flows in matter, at a very fundamental level. In order to conserve energy by, for example, running industrial processes at higher temperatures that have greater thermodynamic efficiencies, you have to know a lot about basic materials science. These are research needs that other science agencies, such as the NSF, cannot meet within their missions and funding levels. It's an important reason why we have a Department of Energy, to begin with. 
   DOE is also a crucial supporter of scientific research in the life sciences. In the life sciences, the DOE initiated the Human Genome Program and co-manges this enormously important and promising effort with the NIH. 
   DOE also plays a leading role in supporting other biological sciences, environmental sciences, mathematics, computing, and engineering. In all these areas, its basic research contributions relate to DOE's energy missions. 
   As a consequence of these research investments, the DOE is responsible for a significant portion of federal R&D funding to scientists and students at our colleges and universities. 
   In addition to the overall size of DOE's basic science funding, the type of activities that DOE funds has a special character among the federal science agencies. One of the primary responsibilities of DOE's Office of Science is to support large-scale specialized user facilities focussed on national scientific priorities. This particular mission makes the Office of  Science unique among, and complementary to, the scientific programs for other federal science agencies, including the NIH and NSF. Each year over 15,000 sponsored scientists and students from academe, industry, and government--many funded by agencies other than the DOE--conduct cutting-edge experiments at the Department's research facilities. Every State in the country has scientists and engineers with a stake in DOE's user facilities. 
   One of the challenges the Office of Science has faced during the past decade is that its funding has been reduced by approximately 13 percent in constant dollars. Other science agencies, such as NIH, have been growing strongly, while the DOE Office of Science has significantly less funding today, in constant dollars, than 10 years ago. 
   These reductions have prevented the Office of Science from fully participating in new initiatives in exciting technical areas important to DOE's statutory missions such as high performance computing and nanotech- nology. More troublesome, the declining funding for the Office of Science has reduced the number of scientists and students able to conduct research suing DOE's national user facilities. In fact, DOE's national and university-based laboratories are currently operating well below their optimum levels, especially in light of growing demand from the scientific community. 
   DOE's scientific user communities and DOE's own scientific advisory committees have completed a number of reports over the past year to two to put a number on what DOE's science budget should look like, in order to fully take advantage of the scientific opportunities that are out there. They estimated that in FY 2001 alone a funding level of over $3.3 billion can easily be justified in order to support research and to fully utilize and modernize DOE facilities. 
   I am mindful that both the Chairman and the Ranking member of this appropriations subcommittee would like to make more money available for DOE's science programs. They have made statements yesterday that they will seek additional funds for the non-defense side of this bill as it moves forward. As they know, Senator FRANK MURKOWSKI, and I are circulating a letter in the Senate for signature by Senators to indicate their support for this goal. It's a letter that I hope strengthens their hand in getting a better allocation as we move forward. The letter is addressed to the bipartisan leadership of the Senate, and is already attracting strong bipartisan support. 
   I hope that when the Conference Report on this bill is finally written, the FY 2001 funding level for the DOE Office of Science will be no less than the President's request level of $3.16 billion. I hope that the funding level can be higher, in some areas, if at all possible. And I hope that both the President and Congress will provide significant increases in funding for the DOE Office of Science in future years in order to sustain the Office's steady growth. Such funding increases are merited by the important and unique work being conducted by the DOE Office of Science. The funding increases would also be consistent with the Senate's passage of a bill that both Senator DOMENICI and I were original co-sponsors of the Federal Research Investment Act (S. 296) which calls for doubling investment in civilian research and development efforts.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. I commend Chairman MCCAIN, Senator HOLLINGS and the members of the Commerce Committee for moving expeditiously to pass this Pipeline Safety Reauthorization bill. The bill includes requirements for each pipeline to develop an integrity management plan to address the specific circumstances of each individual pipeline. There is reference in the Pipeline Safety Act, and the amendments, to circumstances such as pipelines in environmentally sensitive and densely populated areas warranting special attention, but no reference to pipelines that are attached to bridges at such places as river crossings or in other exposed circumstances. The tragic accident in my State of New Mexico was adjacent to a river crossing. The rupture occurred along a buried section of the pipe just before the pipe emerged and was attached to the bridge. I am very concerned that these pipelines are vulnerable to many different types of damage, including even that from a hunter's stray bullet or an auto accident. I would like to ask the chairman and members of the committee whether these exposed pipes on bridges are a category given special attention?

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, on July 24, the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, brought before the Senate a report on payments made by the Project on Government Oversight, a public interest group commonly called ``POGO,'' to two federal employees. Unfortunately, the chairman referred to the report in his remarks as a ``committee report.'' It is not, and I think we need to set the record straight on that point. 
   The rules of the Senate give the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, like all our standing committees, broad authority to ``make investigations into any matter within its jurisdiction.'' But the power to make investigations rests with the Committee  as a whole. It is not vested in the chairman or any one Senator. 
   In January, at the chairman's request, the Comptroller General detailed an employee of the General Accounting Office, Mr. Paul Thompson, to the committee to conduct a ``preliminary inquiry'' into the payments. In February, the chairman informed the committee that the inquiry was underway and that he would ``make recommendations'' to the committee ``as soon as we have something tangible.'' 
   The chairman has leapt from ``preliminary inquiry'' to a final report without any intervening action or consideration by the committee. The committee never authorized Mr. Thompson's investigation and it never approved his report. I first learned about it after the chairman posted it on the Internet. 
   Nor was the report written or approved by the General Accounting Office. Although Mr. Thompson is a GAO employee, he was detailed to the committee. So far as I can tell, no one at the General Accounting Office participated in the investigation or in writing the report. Mr. Thompson's activities were not subject to the professional standards of conduct that govern GAO investigations, and his report was not subject to review and approval by senior GAO officials. 
   If the chairman had asked the committee to approve Mr. Thompson's report, I would have voted against it. If a majority of the committee had agreed to adopt the report as its own, I would have filed minority views. Since I was not given that opportunity, I will state my views for the RECORD. 
   POGO's payments to Mr. Berman and Mr. Speir cannot be understood in isolation. They must be viewed in the larger context of the ongoing controversy over federal oil and gas royalties. 
   Oil companies that produce oil on federal land are, by law, required to pay royalties to the Federal Government based on the value of the oil they produce from federal leases. Many of the major oil companies have been accused of undervaluing and, thus, underpaying the royalties they owe to the American people. The alleged underpayments total many hundreds of millions of dollars. 
   A few years ago, POGO and various private individuals sued the oil companies under the False Claims Act. The False Claims Act allows a private citizen to sue anyone who has defrauded the Government. If successful, the person bringing the suit, known as a ``relator,'' is entitled to a share of the money recovered by the Government as a result of the suit. 
   The essential facts surrounding the POGO payments are not in dispute. POGO asked Robert A. Berman, an employee at the Department of the Interior, and Robert A. Speir, an employee at the Department of Energy, to join its False Claims Act suit. Neither man agreed. POGO then offered to share any money it received from its suit with the two men and they agreed. In January 1998, they put their agreement in writing. In August 1998, Mobil Oil Corporation settled the claims against it by paying the Government and the relators a total of $45 million. In November 1998, POGO got about $1.2 million from the settlement and it paid Mr. Berman and Mr. Speir $383,600 apiece out of its share. 
   The current dispute centers on why POGO made those payments. POGO characterized the payments as ``awards'' for the two men's ``decade-long public-spirited work to expose and stop the oil companies' underpayment of royalties for the production of crude oil on federal and Indian lands.'' POGO's opponents believe POGO had sinister motives. 
   Mr. Thompson's report attempts to substantiate the opponents' suspicions. I am troubled by Mr. Thompson's report for several reasons. 
   First, I am troubled by the very nature of Mr. Thompson's report. In his letter of transmittal to Chairman MURKOWSKI, Mr. Thompson makes very serious charges against POGO; its chairman, Mr. Banta; its executive director, Ms. Brian; and the two federal employees who received the payments, Mr. Berman and Mr. Speir. He accuses POGO of paying the two men ``to influence the Department [of the Interior] toward taking actions and adopting policies'' benefiting both POGO and the two employees. Without saying so directly, Mr. Thompson's report insinuates that POGO and the two employees may have broken federal criminal laws 
   against bribery, the payment and acceptance of gratuities, and the payment and acceptance of private compensation for government service. 
   Yet nowhere in his 42-page report does Mr. Thompson present the evidence necessary to back up his charges. In place of evidence, he offers only theories, speculation, suspicions, circular reasoning, and his personal conviction that all assertions of innocence from Ms. Brian and Messrs. Banta, Berman, and Speir are untrustworthy. 
   Second, I am troubled by the report's lack of a coherent theory of the case. Mr. Thompson laboriously rebuts the explanations offered by POGO, but never meets his own burdens of production and persuasion. 
   Part of his problem may stem from the fact that the chairman never defined the scope of the inquiry. Mr. Thompson states that the ``chief concern'' behind the inquiry was ``whether the payments represent an improper influence upon the Department of the Interior's development of its new oil royalty valuation policy,'' but his report focuses little attention on this issue. 
   Whether the payments improperly influenced the Department of the Interior's oil valuation rule is, of course, a legitimate concern of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. In his transmittal letter, Mr. Thompson concludes that the rule ``may have been improperly influenced by'' the payments. Yet his own report fails to support that conclusion. The report states that the two men's involvement in the rulemaking ``terminated'' around December 1996, before the Department of the Interior published its proposed rule in January 1997. After Mr. Berman and Mr. Speir stopped working on the rule, it was substantially revised over the course of 8 public comment periods, 20 public meetings and workshops, the review of thousands of pages of testimony, and close congressional oversight. Mr. Thompson's assertion that POGO's payments may have ``improperly influenced'' the final rule simply is not supported by the rulemaking record. 
   The bulk of Mr. Thompson's report is devoted to his search for an improper motive for the payments. I do not believe that this is an appropriate use of the committee's investigative powers. The matter is now under investigation by the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior and the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice--as it should be. The appearance of impropriety created by the payments warrants investigation, but by the proper authorities. It is for the appropriate law enforcement agencies and, ultimately, the courts, not the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, to decide if any laws were broken. 
   This is particularly the case where, as here, the targets of the committee's investigation are not senior policy officials, but private citizens or low-ranking civil servants, and where, as here, the committee has shown a strong bias against the targets of its probe. The chairman of the Energy Subcommittee publicly declared the payments to be ``grossly unethical'' soon after they came to light in May 1999, and the chairman of the full committee publicly declared them to involve ``apparent gross impropriety'' only a month after Mr. Thompson began his investigation. 
   The Framers wisely kept law enforcement and judicial powers out of Congress's hands, because, as Alexander Hamilton said, ``of the natural propensity of [legislative] bodies to party divisions,'' and their fear that ``the pestilential breath of [party] faction may poison the fountains of justice.'' The strong political feelings recently displayed in the House Committee on Resources over this matter bear this out. 
   Over two centuries ago, Benjamin Franklin observed that ``There is no kind of dishonesty into which otherwise good people more easily and frequently fall than that of defrauding the Government.'' All too often, otherwise good people are tempted to cheat their Government because they think they can get away with it. All too often, they do, because most fraud against the Government goes unreported. Most federal employees are reluctant to report fraud because they believe nothing  will be done if they do report it, or because they are afraid of reprisal. 
   For this reason, Congress amended the False Claims Act in 1986, in the words of the Judiciary Committee, ``to encourage any individual knowing of Government fraud to bring that information forward.'' The 1986 amendments offer large rewards to whistleblowers who bring a successful false claims action and afford new protections against employer retaliation. While the amendments do not expressly authorize federal employees to file whistleblower suits, the courts have generally read the amended law to permit them to, since the courts recognize that federal employees are often in the best position to uncover and report government fraud. 
   What happened here seems fairly clear. Two federal employees had information they believed showed that oil companies were defrauding the Government. They brought it forward to their agencies. They also, it seems likely, may have shared some of that information with POGO. They could have openly joined POGO's False Claims Act suit but, for whatever reason, they chose not to. They chose instead to become, in effect, silent partners in POGO's suit. POGO generously, if foolishly, shared its windfall with them. 
   Probably all concerned would now agree that this arrangement was a serious mistake. POGO has handed its opponents a powerful weapon with which to wound its credibility and its effectiveness. It has not only brought down a world of trouble on itself, Mr. Berman, and Mr. Speir, but it has deflected attention away from the question of whether the oil companies defrauded the Government to the matter before us. 
   At the very least, the payment of large sums of money by an outside source to a federal employee for work related activities creates an appearance of impropriety. If the appropriate authorities ultimately determine that the payments to Mr. Berman and Mr. Speir were not 
   unlawful, then Congress may need to tighten the conflict of interest laws to more clearly bar federal employees from accepting such payments in the future, or to amend the False Claims Act to prevent federal employees from aiding or benefiting from False Claims Act suits. Crafting a legislative solution that would prevent a recurrence of this problem in the future would, in my view, be a more constructive--and far more appropriate--use of the Senate's time and energy than trying to build a case against POGO and Messrs. Berman and Speir. 
   Any changes in the current laws should, however, be carefully drawn to avoid shutting off the legitimate flow of allegations and information about government fraud and corruption from federal employees to organizations like POGO. These organizations play a valuable role in exposing government fraud and corruption. They offer a safe harbor to federal employees who may be unable or unwilling to come forward publicly on their own. We may not always agree with the causes they espouse or the allegations they make, but we would make a terrible mistake if we were to choke off the flow of allegations and information to them or still their voice. 
   They must, of course, operate within the law. Good intentions do not give them, or the people that come to them, free rein to violate federal conflict of interest laws, agency ethnic rules, or the protective orders of the courts. If anything like that happened in this case, then POGO and the two federal employees should be held accountable by the appropriate law enforcement officials and the courts. But, as the Supreme Court has admonished us in the past, Congress is not a law enforcement agency or a judicial tribunal, and we should not presume to be one in this case. 
   The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, like most of the Senate's standing committees, from time to time, has to conduct investigations into certain matters to do its job. The Energy Committee has, in recent years, conducted a number of sensitive investigations into serious allegations of wrongdoing leveled against senior Administration officials whose nominations were pending before the committee. Each of these investigations was handled very thoroughly and professionally on a bipartisan basis by the committee's own lawyers. 
   Special, partisan investigations like Mr. Thompson's carry with them special problems. By focusing exclusively on proving the guilt of their chosen target, they tend to lose sight of the larger picture and their sense of proportion. Justice Robert Jackson warned us of this danger in the case of prosecutors who ``pick people'' they think they ``should get rather than cases that need to be prosecuted.''  
   With the law books filled with a great assortment of crimes, [Justice Jackson said,] a prosecutor stands a fair chance of finding at least a technical violation of some act on the part of almost anyone. In such a case, it is not a question of discovering the commission of a crime and then looking for the man who has committed it, it is a question of picking a man and then searching the law books, or putting investigators to work, to pin some offense on him. It is in this realm--in which the prosecutor picks some person he dislikes or desires to embarrass, or selects some group of unpopular persons and then looks for an offense, that the great danger of abuse of prosecuting power lies. It is here that law enforcement becomes personal, and the real crime becomes that of being unpopular with the predominant or governing group, being attached to the wrong political views, or being personally obnoxious to or in the way of the prosecutor himself.  
   Sadly, I fear that has happened in this case.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to address a serious issue currently pending in the Senate--pipeline safety. On August 19, there was a tragic pipeline accident in my state of New Mexico. A natural gas transmission line ruptured at 5:30 a.m. that Saturday morning in a rural area south of Carlsbad, NM. Unfortunately, the rupture occurred near a popular fishing spot along the Pecos river. Two families were camped below the bridge traversed by the pipeline. Eleven people, including five small children, died when their favorite camping spot was overcome by heat and flames. I have just learned that the one survivor, Amanda Smith, died earlier today. I would like to include a couple of articles about the victims to be printed in the RECORD after my statement. They should be remembered as individuals, not mere statistics. 
   This was a human tragedy I can barely describe. I spoke briefly with Martha Chapman, mother of two of the victims, and grandmother of two of the children. She had just returned to Carlsbad for the funeral from Lubbock where she had been keeping vigil at the bedside of her daughter-in-law. She was devastated. She said her whole life was gone. She begged me to do what I could  to make sure something like this would never happen to another family. I had no words that could ease her grief, but I promised to do what I could when I returned to Washington. That afternoon I went out to the site to see firsthand the damage and what was being done to determine the cause of the rupture. 
   I spent several hours with Kelley Coyner, the chief pipeline safety official at the Department of Transportation, and some of her engineers and inspectors. What became abundantly clear to me is that the Office of Pipeline Safety does not have adequate resources to carry out its mandate. There are only 55 inspectors for the entire interstate pipeline system. Secondly, the agency needs the additional authority it has requested in the current reauthorization bill to address the different circumstances on individual pipelines. 
   The first thing we need to do is to ensure the Office of Pipeline Safety has the necessary resources to protect the public safety and the environment. The budget of the Office of Pipeline Safety is fully reimbursed by user fees charged to the pipeline operators, yet for the last five years the Congress has under funded the agency's budget request. For FY 2001 the request was $47 million. The Senate has appropriated $43 million, the House only $40 million. I urge the conferees to increase the appropriation for FY 2001 to at least the requested level. 
   Second, we need to pass the Pipeline Safety Reauthorization bill. The bill reported by the Commerce Committee requires each and every interstate natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline to develop and implement an integrity management plan. This approach will give the Office of Pipeline Safety the authority to impose more rigorous requirements, as necessary, to address areas with the greatest likelihood of failures and on aging pipelines and those in populated or environmentally sensitive areas. This bill is a major step toward ensuring the safety of our pipeline infrastructure. I am concerned, though, that the authorization levels included in the bill as filed may not be adequate for the task of a very individualized approach that will require a significant increase in staffing to address regional differences and community-specific needs. 
   I would like to commend the efforts of Senator MCCAIN, chairman of the Commerce Committee, and Senators MURRAY and GORTON and their staff, who have all worked hard to move the reauthorization forward. I also want to acknowledge Senators BREAUX and BROWNBACK for their efforts to include a workable set of requirements that can be fully implemented and enforced. 
   Although the National Transportation Safety Board has not determined the cause of the accident in New Mexico, it appears that internal corrosion was a major factor. The transmission line in New Mexico ruptured at a point near a sharp bend in the pipe. An electronic internal inspection device, commonly called a smart pig, which is used for detecting corrosion in a pipeline, could not be run through that section of pipe because of the bend. Currently, about the only way to inspect sections of pipe such as this is to dig up the pipe and evaluate it directly. The company in New Mexico is doing just that along nearly 400 miles of pipeline to ensure there are not any other vulnerable spots along the pipe. But, with nearly 500,000 miles, and growing, of transmission lines across the country, this is not an optimal solution from the standpoint of time or cost. 
   This country has the technological capability to 
   collect data from the outer reaches of the solar system; we should be able to develop technologies to measure pipeline integrity under six feet of soil without digging up thousands of miles of pipe. 
   I asked one of the scientists from Sandia National Laboratories, one of the Department of Energy's multipurpose labs, to come to Carlsbad with me to visit the site of the accident and to talk to the pipeline safety experts about the gaps in our technical capabilities. The national labs have capabilities for remote sensing, satellite monitoring and materials development that could surely be adapted for better testing and inspection of the pipeline infrastructure. I am also wondering whether MEMS, the efforts at miniaturizing electronic equipment, could be applied to develop a smart pig, or device with the same purpose, to negotiate older pipelines. Sandia has been working on a project to upgrade the Russian pipeline system, the scientists have the knowledge and expertise on pipeline operations to benefit our own system. 
   Since returning from Carlsbad, I have been working to develop a framework for a collaborative R&D effort directed by the Department of Transportation with the assistance of the Department of Energy and the National Academy of Sciences. The Departments of Transportation and Energy, as well as a number of industry research groups, including the Pipeline Research Council International and the Gas Technology Institute, currently conduct research on pipeline integrity, but there is no coordinated, prioritized plan to ensure the most critical issues are being addressed in the most effective manner. I am introducing a bill today, the Pipeline Integrity, Safety and Reliability Research and Development Act of 2000, that will set up such a structure led by the Department of Transportation. I want to thank Senators MCCAIN, HOLLINGS, MURRAY, GORTON, ROBB, BROWNBACK, BREAUX, DOMENICI, LANDRIEU, KERRY and TORRICELLI for cosponsoring this bill. 
   The bill directs DOT and DOE to work with an Advisory Committee set up by the National Academy of Sciences to develop a five-year accelerated plan of action to address the most critical R&D needs to ensure pipeline integrity, safety and reliability. The Advisory Committee would include representatives of the natural gas, oil and petroleum product pipelines, the national labs, universities, the industry research groups, state pipeline safety officials, environmental organizations, pipeline safety advocates and any other technical experts the Academy includes. 
   According to a recent GAO report, ``From 1989 through 1998, pipeline accidents resulted in an average of about 22 fatalities per year. Fatalities from pipeline accidents are relatively low when compared with those from accidents involving other forms of freight transportation: On average about 66 people die each year from barge accidents, about 590 from railroad accidents, and about 5100 from truck accidents.'' Recent accidents, including the tragedy in my state, have undermined public confidence in the safety of pipelines. As policymakers we must take responsibility for restoring that confidence. 
   Natural gas and liquid pipelines are a critical element of our nation's energy infrastructure. They provide a cost-effective and relatively safe means of delivering energy. As the economy has grown, and become increasingly urbanized, siting new pipelines has become more and more challenging. At the same time, the importance of these pipelines has increased dramatically. Incidents on two gasoline pipelines, relatively unnoticed since no one was injured, reduced their operations at a critical time this summer contributing to a gasoline price spike of $2.50 a gallon in the northern Midwest. The rupture of this major natural gas transmission line in New Mexico reduced supplies into California at a critical time of peak electricity demand. I hope we don't experience a major failure of a product line into the northeast this fall or winter which could send the price heating oil off the charts. 
   I plan to offer my bill as an amendment to the pipeline safety reauthorization when it comes before the Senate. As the ranking member on the Energy Committee and representative of a state crisscrossed with thousands of miles of pipelines, I urge my colleagues to support passage of the pipeline safety reauthorization bill with my amendment. I further urge you to support full funding for the Office of Pipeline Safety and the R&D program.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President: I rise today to introduce legislation calling for the establishment of a Pension Reform and Simplification Commission. The legislation derives directly from conversations I have had with constituents and experts on three key issues. 
   First, there is the problem related to the current cost and complexity of private pension plans. In my view current regulations place an unnecessary burden on small and medium business as they attempt to adopt pension plans. Indeed, even the most simple plans are often so complicated in form and function as to be incomprehensive to an everyday businessperson. 
   Second, there is the problem involved in coverage. Although over-all pension coverage may be consistent over the last decade and the assets of private plans have been on the increase, my concern is with those individuals of low to moderate income who are being left out of the private pension plan equation. As companies move toward cheaper plans--401(k)s being a salient example--and feel less obligated to offer defined benefit-type plans, individuals who do not have the extra money to contribute to their pension plans are  unable to benefit from a plan's availability. This is if a plan is available at all, and in many cases it is not. 
   Third, there is the problem of what kind of private pension plans are best suited for the so-called ``New Economy''. Clearly there is considerable debate as of late in terms of what kind of private pension plans should be offered so as to increase saving, decrease mobility, provide opportunity, enhance entrepreneurship, and so on, all of which is apparent in the rise of hybrid pension plans. My foremost concern here is that Congress now finds itself reacting to innovative private pension plans rather than being pro-active in their creation. 
   Mr. President, in 1974, Congress passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known by most people by its acronym of ERISA, our intention at the time being twofold. First, we wanted to protect the assets held in private sector retirement plans. Second, we wanted to create uniform rules that govern how these plans will be implemented in each and every state. 
   From most accounts we have accomplished these two goals. There is no question that ERISA has flaws that must be addressed--and I will discuss these in detail later--but for all these flaws ERISA was extremely significant in that it reaffirmed the government's commitment to the importance of retirement plans for all Americans. Furthermore, it created a comprehensive framework in this country under which the expansion of private retirement plans could occur. Equally important, the mechanisms it established for personal saving has added trillions of dollars in available investment capital over the last decade alone, fueling in a very tangible way the unprecedented economic growth that we are seeing right now. 
   But for all the praise ERISA receives, it is also criticized widely and, in my opinion, correctly on a number of counts. For this reason, it is time to seriously re-evaluate whether it is addressing the needs and concerns of all Americans. It is time to examine whether it fits the demands of a changing, global, ``new'' economy. 
   As a specific example of these problems, the adoption of piecemeal, narrow, and complicated statutes and regulations in the 26 years since ERISA's implementation has made substantial portions of our retirement system inefficient, expensive, and oftentimes incomprehensible to anyone wishing to use it. It is well-known that we continue to add provisions and plans with no effort at all to make them internally compatible. We may have a broad vision about what we want to do with retirement policy in this country, but we instead of revising retirement policy in a comprehensive and strategic manner, we simply add new ideas and language incrementally, hoping they will appeal to businesses who wish to offer them to their employees. 
   Sadly, the end result is that for many businesses the cost of compliance with ERISA regulations--the administrative and professional costs of qualification--rival and even outweigh the costs of providing the benefits themselves. This, in turn, has led to a decision by many business owners that they can no longer afford to offer retirement plans to their employees, this in spite of their desire to do so. For these people, the current rules burden the system beyond the benefits they provide. This has to change. 
   But the cost and complexity I have just mentioned has had a corollary effect, that being a lack of access to pension plans on the part of low- and middle-income workers, women and minorities in particular. Rightly or wrongly, one of the foremost criticisms directed toward ERISA is that it has accelerated the demise of traditional defined benefit pensions and increased conversions to new forms of plans, specifically defined contribution plans like 401(k)s. Employers oftentimes no longer feel it is their role to provide retirement income to their employees as they once did under defined benefit plans. Instead they make defined contribution plans available and then educate employees as to how to save for themselves. 
   The problem is that the retirement security of a great many workers now lies in their ability to contribute individually to these plans, and this is not always possible. Indeed, data suggests that if these individuals are able to save adequately at all, they do so late in their careers--this after paying for their homes, their childrens' education, and other important spending priorities. Only then do they have the opportunity to accumulate the money needed to supplement Social Security and carry them through retirement. But these are the lucky ones. The fact is a large portion of Americans simply no longer have the capacity to save, this in spite of living in a time of economic prosperity. This too needs to be changed. 
   There is a third reason to re-evaluate ERISA, and that is that the dynamics of the New Economy demand a discussion of what retirement policies best serve the economic interests of the United States. For a good part of this century, private pension plans were seen by employers as a way to keep their workforce intact, their employees' morale high, and devotion to the company constant. Employees stayed with companies because they identified with the company and were treated by employers as family. Continuity and connection were the primary motivations for individuals as they considered a job. 
   Recently, however, this rationale has changed, and has done so significantly. According to most analysts, the main determinant for most employees as they choose a job is personal 
   development and professional growth, the feeling being that economic security is best attained by mobility--moving from one job to another, increasing education, pay, and retirement savings as you go. Staying at one firm is still an ideal for some but it is not essential for many. Perhaps more importantly, given the dynamics of the New Economy, it may no longer be practical to assume that you can find retirement security at a single firm. 
   The bottom line, much as the recent debates over cash balance plans suggest, is that some very basic issues concerning pension policy are coming to the fore at this time, examples being the essence of the employer-employee relationship, the ability of companies to attract and maintain a skilled workforce, the benefits provided to short- and long-term employees, the advisability of worker mobility seen in the context of technological innovation and globalization, and so on. Here, we must confront the reality of political economic change, and do so quickly and coherently. 
   But Congress is not doing that. As I stated previously, we are reacting to changes rather than planning for the future in a coherent and strategic manner. In my view, this is an extremely serious problem as it limits our ability to create the conditions necessary for national economic growth and individual economic welfare. 
   As many of my colleagues know, the notion of a Pension Commission has been discussed and debated for a number of years, but we have never placed it high enough on our list of priorities to address it with purpose. I would argue that we can no longer afford the luxury of contemplation, and the time to act is now. Failure to adjust our existing policies to meet the challenges we face both now and in the future will result in several specific outcomes. 
   First, it will mean that many workers will see their retirement expectations fade or disappear. Second, it will likely mean that these individuals will be forced to rely on government sponsored programs that are themselves financially overextended. Finally, it will mean that the capacity of U.S. firms to compete in the global marketplace will be diminished. In my view, none of these outcomes are acceptable. We simply must become more thoughtful and pro-active. 
   The bill I introduce today has a number of purposes, but foremost among them is to establish an affordable, accessible, equitable, efficient, cost-effective, and easy to understand private pension plan system in the United States. It is designed to conduct a complete top-to-bottom evaluation of the current system and provide concrete recommendations as to how we can reform it to serve the interests of employers, employees, and the entire nation as a whole. 
   This Commission will be composed of fifteen members, all with significant experience in areas related to retirement income policy. It is mandated that the activities of the Commission  will be concluded in a little over two years, with specific language to be provided to Congress so that we can act on their recommendations immediately. To ensure that the activities of the Commission are not redundant or otherwise wasteful, it will be allowed to secure data from any government agency or department dealing with retirement policy, and furthermore, may request detailees from these agencies and departments on a non-reimburseable basis. The Commission 
   will also be allowed to hold hearings, take testimony, and receive evidence as appropriate from individuals who are able to contribute to this reform effort. 
   This bill has been created after detailed discussions with a number of individuals and organizations interested in retirement policy, from the Employee Benefits Research Institute, to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, to the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans. Although all of the organizations involved have their own perspective on how retirement policy issues should be addressed in the United States, I have made a concerted effort to make their concerns compatible in this legislation. Significantly, all endorse the goals of the bill, as does the American Academy of Actuaries, the Executive Committee of the New York State Bar Association, and the Chairman of the Special Commission on Pension Simplification of the New York State Bar Association, Mr. Alvin D. Lurie. 
   Mr. President, although there is much to recommend concerning our current pension system, it is common knowledge that this system is, in many instances, too complicated for participants to understand, too difficult for businesses to use, and too inaccessible for individuals to join. We have added layer upon layer of legislation, to the point that the system is not only unwieldy, but often of questionable purpose. We have reached the point that its complexity and inaccessibility is having a tangible impact on individuals and businesses alike. 
   In my view, the status quo is no longer viable or acceptable. It is time to meet the challenge that faces us in a direct and strategic fashion. It is time to reform and simplify the system so that we have a effective mechanism that serves employers and employees alike and provides the means to guarantee all Americans income security in their retirement years. 
   Mr. President, the time to act is now. I ask my colleagues to recognize the importance of this legislation, and lend their support for its passage.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Social Security Family Relief Act, which is legislation designed to both revise current Social Security law and assist families living in New Mexico and across the United States. 
   For those of my colleagues who are not familiar with this issue, at present the Social Security Administration pays benefits in advance, and, thus, a check an individual receives from Social Security Administration during the month is calculated and paid in anticipation that the individual will be alive the entire month in which a payment was received. 
   However, if a person dies during that month, the payment must be reimbursed in full to the Social Security Administration. If a person dies on the 5th of the month, or the 15th of the month, or the 25th of the month, none of this matters. If they die, they are no longer entitled to any benefits for that month, period. Furthermore, if a surviving spouse or family member uses a check received from the Social Security Administration for that month in which a family member had died, they must send it back--in full--to the Social Security Administration. 
   Let me make this clear that this is not just a problem in the abstract. Indeed, the introduction of this bill is prompted by a very real experience faced by a family living in New Mexico. In this case, a constituent had a close relative pass away on December 31, 1999. The last day of the month. Not knowing it ran contrary to Social Security law, the family used the relative's last Social Security check to pay her final expenses. Only after these activities had occurred did they receive a letter from the Social Security Administration stating that they would have to return the check. Not just partial payment, but in full. No recognition on the part of the Social Security Administration that this person was alive for the entire month. No recognition on the part of the Social Security Administration that this person had expenses that had to be paid for after they had died. No recognition on the part of the Social Security Administration that the surviving relatives had their own bills to pay, and that this additional expense imposed a burden on them that was difficult to manage. 
   My constituents found this to absurd. Why, they asked, should they have to return a check for a relative that was alive, was accumulating expenses while she was alive, and deserved the money that was provided to her? Why, they asked, should they be required to pay for the relative's expenses when money should be available? Why should their emotional suffering be made all the more distressful by the addition of financial obligations not of their own making? 
   I think these are good questions, and it is logical that Congress address them directly and in a manner that solves the problem at hand. From what I can see, they are right. Individuals that have worked over the years and have paid into the Social Security Trust Fund all that time, these folks have earned Social Security benefits and should receive them in full for the period that they are alive. As such, Social Security law should be written in such a way that allows the surviving spouse or family member to use the final check to take care of the remaining expenses, whether they be utilities, or mortgages, or car payments, or health care, or whatever needs to be taken care of. 
   But although my constituents are sometimes critical of the Social Security Administration on this issue, in fairness that agency did not create this problem, Congress did. We wrote the law, and the Social Security Administration merely implements it. Any responsibility for what is happening belongs to us. We need to fix the law so the Social Security Administration can do its job better. 
   It is my understanding that this issue has been discussed in the past by a number of Senators, but the revisions have gone nowhere because some felt it would impose an administrative burden on the Social Security Administration. I find this argument to be unconvincing as we clearly find a way to calculate complex equations that ultimately benefit that agency. There are those that now argue that tracking down appropriate beneficiaries would be difficult. But I find this to be quite unconvincing as well--after all, we do it already when someone dies. Surely there is a way to make the changes necessary. Surely the technology and expertise already exists. Surely it is time to stop making excuses and do what is right for Americans and their families. 
   The legislation I am introducing today is easy to understand. The legislation says, quite simply, that an individual's entitlement to Social Security benefits shall continue through the month of his or her death, and after  that individual's death, the entitlement shall be calculated in a manner proportionate to the days he or she was still alive. In other words, we are using a method of pro-rating to calculate what portion of the entitlement that individual will receive for the last month. Then, instead of being asked to return that final check, the surviving spouse or appropriate surviving family members will receive a check, which can then be used to settle the decedent's remaining expenses. I think this is a perfectly fair and reasonable approach to solving the problem at hand. And I think it is long overdue. 
   It is my understanding that another bill addressing this problem has been introduced in the Senate by my colleague Senator MIKULSKI. Furthermore, she has introduced this legislation for several years in a row. I commend her for her awareness of this problem and her ongoing efforts to fix it. 
   That said, it is also my understanding that her bill as written calculates these entitlement benefits on a half-month basis. In other words, if you die before the 15th, you get benefits for a half a month. If you die after the 15th, you are entitled to benefits for the entire month. To be honest, I see no obvious rationale for addressing the problem in this way, and I find a pro-rate strategy to be far more compelling. But this said, I look forward to working with her and her co-sponsors to repair the problem. We clearly have the same concerns. 
   Mr. President, let me state in conclusion that this legislation represents only a partial fix of the current Social Security system. There is no doubt in my mind that much more needs to be done. We have talked about the issues far too long, and it is time to make a serious effort to make the Social Security solvent and effective. If had my way, this effort would begin tomorrow. But since it is not, this legislation can be considered one small but very important step on the path to reform.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, on behalf of myself and Senators DASCHLE, BYRD, BAUCUS, BAYH, JOHNSON, LEVIN, and ROCKEFELLER, that offers a comprehensive approach to energy policy. This bill, the Energy Security Tax and Policy Act of 2000, incorporates many of the provisions of S. 1833, a comprehensive package of broad energy tax incentives introduced by Senator DASCHLE last year that I cosponsored along with a number of other Democratic Senators. We have updated and modified the bill after having worked closely with many stakeholders, from the auto  manufacturers, to the oil and gas producers, to the energy efficiency community. 
   The Energy Security Tax and Policy Act of 2000 addresses a broad range of technologies and industries necessary to meet our energy needs. The bill includes incentives to ensure we maintain production of our domestic resources, but the overarching emphasis is on stimulating more efficient use of energy in its many forms. Specific incentives address: 
   Purchase of more efficient appliances, homes, and commercial buildings. 
   Greater use of distributed generation--fuel cells, microturbines, combined heat and power systems and renewables. 
   Purchase of hybrid and alternative fueled vehicles and development of the infrastructure to service those vehicles. 
   Investment in clean coal technologies and generation of electricity from biomass, including co-firing with coal. 
   Countercyclical tax incentives for production from domestic oil and gas marginal wells. 
   Provisions to ensure diverse sources of electric supply are developed in the U.S. and to continue our investment in demand side management. 
   In addition, the bill reauthorizes the President's emergency energy authorities, including establishing a northeastern heating oil reserve. 
   We have tried to take a balanced approach, both supply side and demand side. Many of the provisions in this bill have strong bipartisan support, and I believe would receive the support of the White House as part of a comprehensive package. 
   After my 17 years in the Senate and on the Energy Committee, I have to note that the same issues have been with us in varying degrees for years. Our current energy situation is the result of the policies and decisions of many Administrations, Congresses, companies and individuals, not to mention the vagaries of the marketplace. 
   Finding solutions will take serious bipartisan effort and long term commitment. While we have the attention of the Congress, the White House and the public, I hope we can work together in the remaining days of this Congress to enact as many of these measures as possible to protect our energy security and our economy.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill today--the Medicare+Choice Improvement Act of 2000--that would correct several of the inequities in the complex formula that is used to determine payment rates for Medicare+Choice plans. As many of my colleagues know, the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created a new optional Medicare+Choice managed care program for the aged and disabled beneficiaries of the Medicare program. This new program replaced the previous risk program and established a payment structure that was designed to reduce the variation across the country by increasing payments in areas with traditionally low payments. However, although payment variation has been somewhat reduced, substantial payment differentials remain nationwide. In New Mexico, for example, the Medicare+Choice plan payment for 2000 in Albuquerque is $430.44 monthly per beneficiary vs. $814.32 for NYC. Because these payments are so low in some places it has caused a devastating result--seniors are being dropped in large numbers. 
   The bill I am introducing today will correct inequities in the current formula that is used to develop payment rates for Medicare+Choice managed care plans and keep them as a viable alternative to traditional fee-for-service Medicare. Medicare+Choice plans are a popular alternative to traditional Medicare fee-for-service health care coverage for aged and disabled Americans because they help contain the beneficiary's out-of-pocket expenses, coordinate health care, and increase important benefits. 
   Mr. President, the sad reality is that Medicare+Choice plans are suffering financially under the new payment system and are no longer able to maintain enrollment of Medicare+Choice beneficiaries. 
   As you can see from this chart, New Mexico Medicare+Choice plans have announced plans to drop 15,700 beneficiaries from their rolls on January 1, 2001. 
   And, as you can see from this chart, nationally, the number of Medi-care+Choice plan beneficiaries that will be dropped on January 1, 2001 are expected to be 711,000. Since 1999, 735,000 beneficiaries have been dropped. This would mean that as of January 1, 2001, 1,445,000 beneficiaries will have been dropped. 
   This is a terrible situation. Even though beneficiaries that are dropped from Medicare+Choice plans will revert to traditional Medicare and will be able to purchase Medicare supplemental health insurance plans, the high cost associated with the purchase of these plans will put an additional financial burden on these aged and disabled Americans living on fixed incomes. Additionally, they will not have the additional health care benefits available to them under Medicare+Choice plans, including routine physicals, vision care, and prescription drugs. 
   Because Medicare+Choice plans are offered by private managed care companies and because of their unique structure, these plans were able to limit out of pocket expenses, provide additional benefits to beneficiaries, and control health care costs to the Federal government. 
   As you can see from this chart, Medicare+Choice plans offer a host of important benefits and options over and above traditional Medicare. These include: prescription drugs, lower cost sharing with a catastrophic cap on expenditures, care coordination, routine physicals, health education, vision services and, hearing exams/aids. 
   Mr. President, the loss of this important health care coverage option for the aged and disabled will be devastating for some. This situation will probably cause many of those on marginal incomes to lose the ability to afford normal living expenses that may effectively require them to enroll in Medicaid and state financial assistance programs. If a beneficiary, who was dropped from a Medicare+Choice plan, has a fall and is admitted into the hospital they will be responsible for all deductible expenses and when they are discharged and sent home with a doctor's order for physical therapy, occupational therapy and visiting nurse service they would be responsible for all Medicare deductibles. This event could cost the beneficiary several thousand dollars. This acute episode could force a beneficiary living on a marginal income to be unable to pay for their deductibles, cease treatment prematurely, or even worse, avoid return visits to the doctor until they are in another emergency situation. Additionally, they would be forced to enroll on a state Medicaid program for the indigent. 
   Sadly, Mr. President, the formula that was developed for Medicare+Choice plans was intended to address geographic variation in the payment rates has gone too far in controlling costs and missed the boat with 
   respect to geographic variability. Sure, the goal of managed care is to save money for the taxpayer and coordinate quality care for the beneficiary, but there is a point at which a health plan cannot afford financially to operate. This forces the beneficiary onto traditional Medicare with its higher costs for both the taxpayer and beneficiary. 
   Mr. President, this point has been reached in New Mexico and other areas of the country. We may not be able to have Medicare+Choice plans take back their dropped beneficiaries but, we can prevent more from being dropped by acting favorably on this bill. The bottom line is this: As a nation, we need to do all we can to provide a viable option to traditional fee-for-service Medicare that provides coordinated managed care at a savings to both the beneficiary and the Federal Government. 
   The bill that I am introducing has provisions to raise the minimum payment floor, move to a 50:50 blend rate between local and national rates in 2002, set a ten-year phase-in of risk adjustment and allow plans to negotiate  a rate of payment with HCFA regardless of the county-specific rate, as long as the negotiated rate does not exceed the national average per-capita cost, and delay from July to November 2000 the deadline for offering and withdrawing Medicare+Choice plans for 2001. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this effort and to join me in taking an important step toward maintaining Medicare+Choice managed care plans as a positive alternative to traditional fee-for-service Medicare, and prevent more enrollees from being dropped while we try to reform Medicare. We owe it to our nation to take care of our elderly and aged citizens and not expose them to more hardship.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak for a few minutes about my amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations Bill now before the Senate. The amendment identifies vital funding for Indian Country in four programs under the Rural Community Advancement Program. The cosponsors of the amendment are Senators CAMPBELL, INOUYE, DOMENICI, LEAHY, DASCHLE, DORGAN, FEINSTEIN, BENNETT, MURRAY, JOHNSON, HATCH, SNOWE, and CONRAD. 
   First, I want to thank Chairman COCHRAN and Senator KOHL for their work on this Agriculture Appropriations Bill. This bill provides funding for a number of programs that are vital to my state of New Mexico and to the nation. 
   The rural development programs funded in this bill are especially important for a rural state like New Mexico. Through a variety of grant and loan programs, rural development is helping to make sure that our smaller communities are not being left behind in basic infrastructure, in quality of housing, in economical utilities, in community facilities, or in business development. Rural development is making tremendous progress in improving the quality of life of our smaller communities and in Indian Country. The basic health and well being of rural people in New Mexico, as well as their economic future, are much brighter as a result of the rural development programs. 
   This amendment is straight forward. The bill already provides $24 million for tribal programs, and I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for providing this important set aside. The amendment simply sets the priorities for how the existing tribal funding in the bill should be divided among the various Rural Development Programs. Under our amendment, $1 million is set aside for rural business opportunity grants, $5 million for community facilities for tribal colleges, $15 million for grants for drinking water and waste disposal systems, and $3 million for rural business enterprise grants. These priorities have the support of the National Congress of American Indians and the American Indian Higher Education Consortium.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. The $15 million in water and wastewater grants in this amendment include a special provision that allows the department to provide up to 100 percent of the cost of a project for the most economically disadvantaged tribes that can't otherwise qualify for a loan as normally required. A similar grant program was first established by Congress last year to address the urgent needs in Indian Country for basic water and waste water systems. I am pleased that the Rural Utilities Service has moved quickly this year to implement this new program and we are seeing immediate results. To date, 26 grants have been awarded to tribes in 14 states--from Maine to California. The average grant is a little more than $400,000. The RUS already has in hand requests for many millions of dollars in important projects for next year. This amendment will provide the funding to address these urgent needs. 
   In addition, the amendment provides $5 million in much needed funding for facilities construction and maintenance at our 33 tribal colleges that comprise the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, AIHEC. Many of these institutions are operating in donated, abandoned, and in some cases, even condemned structures. Hazards include leaking roofs, asbestos insulation, exposed and substandard wiring, and crumbling foundations. Tribal colleges receive little or no funding from the states. These institutions are located on federal trust land and are a federal responsibility. The $5 million provided in this amendment will begin to address the backlog in facility requirements for tribal colleges. 
   The development of new businesses in Indian Country is one key to self sufficiency for Native American communities. The amendment provides $3 million in rural business enterprise grants to support the development of small and emerging tribal business enterprises. These funds can be used to develop land, construct buildings and factories, purchase equipment, provide road access and parking areas, extend basic utilities, or provide technical assistance, startup and operating costs, or working capital for new business. 
   Finally, the amendment provides a $1 million set aside for tribal rural business opportunity grants. Tribes may use these funds to analyze business opportunities that will make use of the existing economic and human resources in Indian Country. Funding can also be used to train tribal entrepreneurs and to establish business support centers. Unemployment rates in Indian Country are the highest in the nation, sometimes topping 50 percent. Development of new business opportunities on tribal lands is one of the keys to improving the standard of living in Native American communities. 
   Congress established the rural development programs to assist in the economic development of rural areas of the nation with the highest percentage of low-income residents. Today, some of the most economically disadvantaged communities in America are in Indian Country. The $24 million set aside in this bill for tribal programs represents only a tiny percentage of the total funding available for Rural Community Advancement Programs. This funding will begin to address the needs of some of America's poorest communities. 
   Again, I want to thank Chairman COCHRAN and Senator KOHL for their support for the tribal funding in this bill. These are important programs to help deal with the critical needs of our tribes. I hope the Senate will support our amendment.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is intended to express the sense of the Senate that repayment of the judgment fund for the partial settlement in the Ramah Navajo Chapter v. Lujan case from Indian program funds within BIA and IHS would significantly reduce the funds appropriated to benefit Tribes and individual Native Americans across the country. 
   This unprecedented partial settlement was the result of a lawsuit filed in 1990, pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act against the United States, the Secretary of Interior Manuel Lujan, and others. 
   The Ramah Chapter of the Navajo Nation in northwest New Mexico initiated the lawsuit to recover damages for the alleged non-payment or underpayment of indirect costs, related to 638 contracts it entered into with several federal agencies. 
   This suit became a class action suit and currently involves over 326 class members made up of tribal contractors and tribal consortia from across the country. 
   In 1997, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the tribes involved were underpaid and that several federal agencies were involved in the non-payment and underpayment of indirect costs. 
   Last year, the federal agencies and the plaintiffs negotiated a partial settlement totaling $76,200,000, plus applicable interest. 
   This partial settlement was paid by the United States in September 1999. 
   Many people do not realize that Congress established a Judgment Fund to pay for legal judgments awarded to plaintiffs who sue the United States. This enables plaintiffs to be paid the amount of their judgment without having to wait for Congress to appropriate funds for each case. 
   Years later, in 1978, Congress passed the Contract Disputes Act and required that the Judgment Fund be reimbursed by the responsible agency after an award is paid from the judgment fund. 
   The problem we have today is the Department of Interior, namely the Bureau of Indian Affairs, has been billed for the entire amount of the partial settlement in the Ramah case. With interest, this totals approximately $83 million. 
   Many tribes are concerned that if BIA has to pay back the judgment fund from available funds, Indian programs will be significantly impacted. I share their concern. 
   I introduced this amendment to shed some light on this issue and to encourage the federal agencies to resolve this matter in a way that does not severely impact Indian programs. 
   It does not seem appropriate to me that Indian program funds--funds that benefit tribes and individual Indians--should be used to pay for a lawsuit brought by tribes and tribal entities. 
   Because there were many agencies involved in the underpayment of the contract support costs, I believe the Secretary of Interior should work with the OMB to find the funding from within the budgets of all of the agencies involved. 
   Any other result would be unjust and unfair to Native Americans across the country. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this sense of the Senate and I thank Senator CAMPBELL for his leadership in this area and his support of this amendment.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. I would like to clarify that it is your intent that $5 million of the emergency funds available through amendment 3782 will be used to implement the Collaborative Forest Restoration Program in New Mexico. This program will be authorized by a bill, S. 1288, that Senator DOMENICI and I introduced together. It already passed the Senate last November and will be considered by the full House Resources Committee next week. This program creates a mechanism through which people with varied interests will be able to work cooperatively with the  Forest Service to conduct forest restoration and value-added projects. Improving communication and joint problem solving among individuals and groups who are interested in restoring the diversity and productivity of forested watersheds can assist us in our efforts to address the problem posed by communities at risk from catastrophic wildfire.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment I offer on behalf of myself, Senators KENNEDY, MURRAY, DODD, KERRY, SCHUMER, and DORGAN. 
   It will do a fairly simple thing. It will provide for the relief from estate tax that is proposed as the Democratic alternative on which we voted earlier today so that there will be a substantial reduction in the amount of estate tax over a period of time. It would, however, take some of the additional revenue that would not be going to estate tax relief under the Republican plan and would dedicate that instead to education. 
   This is an important issue. This is an amendment, as were several others we voted on already, that relates to our priorities and what we would like to do with revenue over the next several years, how much of it should be returned, to which group of taxpayers, how much should be spent on needs we have here in the country. 
   Those of us who are proposing this amendment believe it should be a higher priority for us to improve our schools and the future of all of the children in this country--rich and poor, black and white, metropolitan and rural--than it is to assist inordinately a relatively small group of people beyond the $8 million that is provided for as an exemption from the estate tax under the Democratic plan. 
   The amendment makes a commitment to invest some of the savings from the elimination of the Republican estate tax proposal into our public schools. The amendment would guarantee that parents and communities have the support they need to provide every child with a good public education, to send every qualified student to college. 
   I was reading the paper yesterday. I noticed that the first day of the Republican National Convention has the theme of ``leave no child behind.'' That is a worthy theme. I commend them for adopting it. I believe this amendment could be characterized as the ``leave no child behind'' amendment. Instead of dedicating huge resources toward providing very wealthy individuals with a tax break--I think it has been discussed several times and is agreed to by all, the Republican plan does provide over $100 billion of tax relief over the next 10 years, $750 billion over the following 10 years--instead of providing that much in the way of tax relief for the very wealthiest in our society, the amendment ensures that small businesses and family farms receive a significant tax break. It also provides funds for programs that have been proven to improve student achievement in public schools, to assist students seeking postsecondary education. 
   Let me clear up one misconception I have uncovered in my home State of New Mexico. I spoke to one of my good friends there this last week. He said: I don't see why you object to repeal of the estate tax. It does not involve a significant amount of Federal revenue. It is mainly an irritant to people to have an estate tax or to pay an estate tax. 
   What we have been talking about with the Republican proposal is $100 billion over the next 10 years, $750 billion over the following 10 years. We are spending in this current fiscal year $14.4 billion total on elementary and secondary education in this country. That is Federal money. We are talking about tax cuts in the Republican plan which are substantially greater than the amount the Federal Government is spending on education each year. It is an important item. In my view, it is very much a statement about our priorities. 
   One of the critical elements in this amendment is school construction. We would fund a program to increase safety and decrease overcrowding in our schools. We would provide $1.3 billion in grants and loans for urgent repair of 5,000 public elementary and secondary schools in very high-need areas. These programs would provide over $200 million to my home State of New Mexico where current estimates for school repair and modernization approach $2 billion. 
   Accountability: We would support tough accountability for results by setting aside $250 million for title I accountability grants. That is something we have been trying to do at several points in this session of Congress. We still have not succeeded. That would be accomplished if we adopted this amendment. 
   Dropout prevention: The amendment provides crucial support for programs designed to prevent students from dropping out of school. This is a vital issue in my State, particularly for the Hispanic community. Many of our Hispanic young people do not complete high school. The percentage of people who do complete high school is appallingly low. We need to deal with that. It is a crisis situation. 
   Teacher quality: Senator KENNEDY has led the way on trying to improve teacher quality in this session of the Congress. This amendment would provide $2.2 billion for teacher quality programs so we can ensure that every child is taught by a qualified instructor. 
   Class size: We would continue progress in achieving smaller classes by providing $1.75 billion to fulfill our commitment to hire 1 million teachers to reduce class size in the early grades. 
   Afterschool programs: Again, we would try to expand those by adding $1 billion to that funding. 
   Meeting our commitments to special education: Again, we would try to add a billion dollars in this amendment for the IDEA funding, which I know many Members of this body, both Democrats and Republicans, support. 
   Affordable college opportunities: Higher education makes a huge difference in earnings and general mobility, even more in subsequent generations of a family. This amendment provides $3 billion for college opportunity tax credits. It would increase funding for the GEAR UP program by $325 million. 
   I know some critics say this amendment is not related to the underlying tax reduction. I point out that exactly the opposite is true. The real issue for us is, what are our national priorities? Are we going to reduce the revenue coming into the Government by enormous amounts here in order to assist those who are wealthiest in our society, at the expense of adequately funding these education programs that I believe are desperately needed? 
   The truth of the matter is that Americans want better educational outcomes for their children, not more tax cuts for the wealthy. I challenge anyone to pose the option before us to the voters: Should Congress exercise its leadership by providing $50 billion in tax cuts to the wealthiest 2 percent of the population each year? Or should Congress, instead, exercise its leadership by using some of that revenue to improve the educational outcomes in our public schools? I believe the American public is clear in their answer on that. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I will yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Massachusetts.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes and then the remainder of the time to the Senator from Massachusetts. 
   Let me respond to a couple of statements that were made. 
   First of all, this amendment was referred to as a diversion because it tries to bring into this debate the discussion about education and what we ought to be investing in education. Hopefully, we can persuade the Senate to take some of the revenue that the Republican estate tax repeal proposal contemplates eliminating and put it into education. 
   I do not see it as a diversion at all. I would love to have us back on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We had that act before us. We offered some amendments. Those amendments were Democrat amendments. One was for class size reduction. We talked about teacher quality. We had an amendment on that. It was pending, in fact, at the time the bill was taken down by the majority leader. 
   I hope very much that next week we can go back to ESEA and have more debate on that. But regardless of whether we are able to do that, I think it is important that we consider and adopt this amendment as a statement about what we think the priorities of this Nation are. 
   I do not shy from discussing the estate tax repeal proposal that is before us. In my State, frankly, the Democratic alternative, in my view, is a very enlightened and generous proposal which would substantially reduce the estate tax. 
   It would reduce to fewer than 100 estate tax returns that would be filed in my State each year. That is the estimate I have received. It is something I think I can be proud to cosponsor and support. 
   I do not see why we have to go the full route the Republicans are proposing, as the Senator from Massachusetts said, and eliminate this tax entirely for those 2,400 wealthiest Americans. I do not think we are visiting any hardship upon them by maintaining in place some estate tax. 
   Let me get back to the subject of my amendment, which is education. People of this country support more investment in teacher quality, more investment in reducing the class sizes, more  investment in eliminating or reducing the number of students who drop out of our schools before they graduate, more investment in accountability of our schools so we can be sure the schools are performing to standard, and more investment in school construction. There are enormous needs in all these areas. This is an opportunity to address those enormous needs. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I think it would be a major statement of our priorities. We would not, in fact, leave one child behind if we do this. 
   I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Massachusetts.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is focused on education. It is an effort to put our priorities straight, to get our priorities in line with the priorities of the American people, to get back to talking about how do we improve the lot of the average American, instead of talking about the lot of the 400 wealthiest families in the country. 
   I believe this will put funds where they are needed the most, where the American people want to see them spent. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator HELM's resolution that commends Mexico on the results of their elections. There is no doubt that this was an event of historic proportions. The Mexican people have, through careful consideration and a peaceful political process, ended over seven decades of rule by a single political party. By doing so they have turned their country into a true democracy. They deserve this recognition. 
   My colleague's resolution captures the significance of this vote to the United States in terms of our national interest and our social welfare. As my state sits right across the border from Mexico, New Mexicans are well aware that the destinies of our two countries have been, and will be, intertwined. We have always shared similarities in heritage and language with the Mexican people, and this has established the means by which cultural and economic interaction can increase rapidly and consistently over time. 
   It is clear that the new President of Mexico, Vincente Fox, faces a broad range of tough challenges as he assumes office and plots a course for the future. Expectations are high and the obstacles are great. Privatization, corruption, education, economic growth, narcotics, crime and health--all these issues require immediate attention. It is encouraging to see President Ernesto Zedillo already working in tandem with the new government to ensure a successful transition. This will inevitably benefit the Mexican people. 
   I concur with the goals of the resolution, specifically the pledge for increased cooperation with the Government of Mexico so that we might confront the threats that our countries face and improve the quality of life for our people. I wish President-elect Fox luck in his efforts, and I look forward to working with him in the future.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first, I commend my colleague, Senator DOMENICI, for this amendment and indicate I am very glad to be a cosponsor of it. It is an important amendment which is much needed in my State and throughout much of the country. 
   The problem has been well described by Senator DOMENICI, Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator CRAIG, and others. I do not need to elaborate on that to a great extent, except to say there are many communities in our State of New Mexico which genuinely feel threatened because of the fact that they are adjacent to our national forests and the forests have been allowed to build up underbrush in a way which makes them a fire hazard--communities such as Santa Fe and Los Alamos, which have been mentioned, Ruidoso, Cloudcroft, and Weed. I know my colleague was visiting with citizens in the small community of Weed, NM, about this very issue. There is no question the time has come when it needs to be addressed, and this amendment will allow us to do that on an emergency basis. It is, as I said before, much needed. 
   Let me give a little background. Even before this year's catastrophic fires, which have really been a wake-up call to all of us about the significance of this problem, particularly the fire at Los Alamos, the Cerro Grande fire, but the Scott Able fire in the southern part of New Mexico, the Cree fire in the southern part of New Mexico, and the Viveash fire in northern New Mexico--we have had a series of fires. Over, I believe, 65,000 acres in my State have burned so far this year. That does not begin to approach the number of acres perhaps in California, as cited by the Senator from California, but it is a great many acres for our State considering the amount of forests we have. Well over 400 homes have been destroyed in our State. So the problem is very real. 
   Last year, in the first session of this Congress, I was very pleased that, on a bipartisan basis, Senator DOMENICI and I cosponsored a bill, S. 1288, entitled the Community Forest Restoration Act which attempted a demonstration project in New Mexico to begin dealing with this problem of the urban wild land interface, to begin thinning of forest areas near these communities. 
   In putting this legislation together, we were able to get the cooperation not only of the communities themselves but of many of the groups which take a great interest in the health of our national forests, including several of the major environmental groups. I thought this was major progress. The bill passed the Senate unanimously. It went to the House of Representatives. It has been marked up in subcommittee. It will go to the full committee next week. 
   This legislation was very small. It was a demonstration project. It was aimed only at New Mexico communities, but it set a good precedent for the type of thing we are talking about, where the Forest Service and the other Federal land management agencies could make grants available to community groups to deal with this problem in a very real and responsible way. 
   I particularly appreciate the statement Senator DOMENICI made in his presentation that this amendment, to provide substantial additional funding to the land management agencies to deal with the problem, does not involve any change in environmental laws. 
   Also, this amendment does not involve any change in NEPA, 
   the National Environmental Policy Act. This does not waive that law. This amendment is consistent with those laws. We are providing resources and directing that a substantial effort take place to deal with this problem around the communities that are adjacent to our national forests. It is very important that this happen.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me mention one other aspect of this which I think is significant, and that is the Forest Service has a program called a Cooperative Fire Protection Program which they try to use to educate people who own homes in or near the forests and also to work with people who have private homes in our forests, that are private property, so the benefits of some of this clearing, some of this thinning we are talking about can also be realized by the people who have those homes, and those homes can be better protected as a result. 
   One thing that became obvious to me as a result of the Los Alamos fire was that there had been a thinning that had taken place around the laboratory itself, around many of the structures of the Los Alamos National Laboratory; and because of that, because of that thinning activity, there was a dramatic  reduction in the fire risk to those facilities. We had much less damage there than we wound up having in the town of Los Alamos, where, of course, no similar thinning or no similar fire risk reduction activities had occurred. 
   I think it is very important that we try to take what we have learned about how to reduce the risks of fire and apply that in a responsible way, and do so as soon as possible. 
   For that reason, I am very pleased to see this amendment being considered. Again, I compliment my colleague for proposing the amendment. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment being offered by my colleague, Senator DURBIN, calling for effective testing of the National Missile Defense (NMD) program now under development by the Department of Defense. 
   When the President signed H.R. 4, the National Missile Defense Act of 1999, into law a year ago, he made the statement that ``any NMD system we deploy must be operationally effective, cost-effective, and enhance our security.'' The key word in the President's statement, Mr. President, is ``effective.'' In other words, before we decide to move ahead with the NMD program, among other important considerations, we must be confident that the system will be an ``effective'' one. 
   Last year, when we debated this matter in the Senate, I spoke with my colleague, Senator COCHRAN, who agreed with me that we shouldn't buy the system until we know that it will work. It's common sense, of course, to hold back on a decision to purchase something until we know that it will work as advertised. We know that as private consumers. The same is true for the government as a consumer. 
   Indeed, that is the policy of the Department of Defense (DoD) with respect to its purchase of ALL major weapon systems. DoD's policy instruction governing acquisition of all major weapon systems, DoD Directive 5000.1, contains a number of provisions intended to ensure that the customer, DoD as well as the nation as a whole, will get what we pay for. 
   The bottom line for the Department of Defense regarding ``effectiveness'' is whether a weapon system is tested successfully in realistic operating situations. The DoD instruction states that ``before purchasing a weapon system from the production line, the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation must report to the Secretary of Defense that the system is operationally effective and suitable for use in combat.'' That should be true for missile  interceptors as well as for conventional guns, tanks, and airplanes. 
   Mr. President, the Congress has on many occasions expressed its commitment to the taxpayer that the billions spent on weapons will provide the nation with the real military capability we may need. The provision of DoD Instruction 5000.1 that I have cited is one such example. Another was legislation enacted during the 1980's requiring warranties on all major weapon systems and their components. 
   We also, know, Mr. President, that when we fail to require that a system meet operational standards, we pay a heavy price. In the early 1980's, the Congress appropriated over $20 billion dollars to purchase 100 B-1B bombers. The problem was that we had never tested them. The B-1B looked like the B-1A, but in fact was a far different weapon. It needed to be tested. We didn't do it and went ahead with the purchase. Mr. President, we now know the unfortunate history of that purchase. It wasn't until recently that the DoD used the B-1B in combat, and even then under very special operational circumstances. In the intervening decade and a half, the Air Force chose other ways to get the job done. I'm convinced that, in part, it was because the Air Force knew that the B-1B would not have been capable of getting the job done. There are other expensive examples I could use to illustrate the price we've paid for inadequate testing. Design flaws in the C-5 and F-18 have ended up costing the taxpayer a bundle. I'm sure you've recently read the news reports about flaws in the protective suits for our troops to use in a chemical or biological warfare environment. They weren't adequately tested either. 
   The amendment Senator DURBIN is sponsoring today seeks simply to affirm Congressional commitment to the taxpayer, to the men and women in uniform who must operate our weapons, 
   and to the nation that must depend on it for our defense. I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment that would require that the NMD system be tested against possible countermeasures that are likely, or at least realistically possible, to be used to accompany attacking warheads that potential enemies could launch against us. The amendment calls for the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) to plan ground and flight tests to address those threats, to seek funds to support what's needed to meet them, and to report annually on the status and progress of the NMD program regarding countermeasures. In short, Mr. President, the amendment proposes concrete actions to ensure that we know the exact nature of the threat, that we plan appropriate technical responses, and that we test adequately to make sure that those responses work. 
   We are all aware of the recent outcome of the latest NMD flight test, IFT-5. In that test, a developmental test, the kill vehicle failed to separate from its booster to engage the incoming target warhead. Mr. President, this was a test designed and conducted under very controlled, hardly realistic, conditions. It was a test in which all the pieces of the complex NMD system were given special capabilities to carry out their job in a controlled, experimental environment. 
   I think we can all agree that it's appropriate to walk before we run. In ``walking'' through this test, IFT-5, we have discovered once again how difficult it is to ``hit a bullet with a bullet'' even though we think we know how each piece of the system will function. I'd like to emphasize, Mr. President, that this was not an operational test under realistic conditions that DoD requires for every other major weapon system before it decides to go ahead and buy it. This was a controlled, laboratory test in which one of the pieces we thought we know most about failed. 
   I believe that although the NMD test program to date indicates that we are developing some amazing capabilities, we are a very long way from being confident that the NMD system as a whole will work. Indeed, in order for an NMD test to be truly realistic, there are a whole host of variables that must differ significantly from the conditions that were present during the IFT-5 test. In order to be more realistic, for example, future tests should reorient the basic geographic direction of the test from West to East rather than East to West. The flight test envelope would have to be greatly enlarged. Various types of countermeasures, the subject of the amendment, should be used. Actual military personnel who would operate the system should be at the controls. Information from the warning system should reflect likely warning times. We are a very long way from realistic testing the NMD system in those regards and a number of others. This amendment addresses only one of those variables, albeit a very important one. Adopting this amendment will provide us with critical information about the feasibility of the NMD system to get the job done. Committing ourselves to procuring and deploying the NMD system until we know the answers to questions regarding key operational capabilities would be premature and ill-advised. 
   There are other critical factors that will play important and necessary roles in determining whether the President will commit the nation to deploying NMD. Surely the nature of the threat must be assessed and reassessed to make sure that this program is warranted. Surely the possible responses of our allies and potential adversaries will play an important part in the President's calculation. At the end of the day, the President will have determined whether the nation is more or less secure as a result of deciding to deploy the NMD system. 
   In the meantime, as responsible stewards for public expenditures, it behooves us to take all measures necessary to ensure that the billions we are spending for NMD are giving the taxpayer real dividends. This amendment is an important means to make that happen. I urge all of my colleagues to support realistic testing before committing the nation to procurement and deployment of NMD. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators DOMENICI, MURRAY, GORTON, THOMPSON, FRIST, and MURKOWSKI in offering this amendment. This amendment, which is based on my bill, S. 1756, will strengthen the ways the Department of Energy's national labs and facilities can collaborate with industry to achieve their mission--something that's increasingly important now that industry funds 70 percent of our national R&D. The labs simply cannot stay on the cutting edge of technology and do their national security and science missions without rich and effective collaborations with industry. 
   A key provision of this amendment is a three year pilot program, called the Technology Infrastructure Program, authorizing the national labs to promote the development of ``technology clusters''--the phenomena seen most famously in Silicon Valley--that will help the labs achieve their national security and science missions. The basic idea is for the labs to harness the innovative power of technology clusters to do their missions by strengthening collaboration in the regions around the labs. 
   Mr. President, let me explain this a little more. We know from places like Silicon Valley, or our own states, that a special innovative process can get started when enough institutions in an industry or technology come together in one place. For example, if you're interested in Internet businesses, Northern Virginia is an excellent place to be. For cars and, I believe, office furniture, you ought to think about Michigan. 
   Paradoxically, the Internet makes these regional processes more important, not less. Why? Because when it's cheap and easy to move information around, less mobile things like your labor force and special research facilities and how they interact with each other will be what makes the difference in how well you turn information into innovation. Consider how Silicon Valley has not dissipated, despite its many high costs. And, if companies move from there, they may go to Austin or Northern Virginia, but not just anywhere they can plug in a modern. 
   Now, the Technology Infrastructure Program will support projects that will help the labs do their missions by strengthening the institutions and relationships that aid collaborative innovation. Every project funded under this program must, as a threshold test, show that it will help a lab ``achieve technical success in meeting'' DOE missions. Here are some possible example projects: a small business incubator or a research park by the lab; a special training program for technicians in a technology used by the lab and local businesses; or a specialized design and research facility at a local university in a technology of interest to the lab and local businesses. 
   I think you can see from my examples that it would be hard to link these sorts of projects to the labs' missions unless they are done near the labs. So, that's what will happen in most cases. The money authorized for the pilot program is modest--no more than $10 million a year. But, I believe it could well prove to have an immodest result. 
   Here is another way to think about what we're trying to do with the Technology Infrastructure Program. Given the mission of the labs, the reason they exist as organizations with all sorts of sophisticated equipment and scientists is that they together in one place people working on related subjects, so they can collaborate with each other and share special facilities. 
   Well, the Technology Infrastructure Program will help extend that collaboration to outside a lab's gates, to firms and other institutions that are not part of the lab but that can help it do its mission better because they're nearby. Because the projects will be cost shared. DOE can save the taxpayer's money while effectively building out the labs beyond their gates. And, because the projects will help the labs leverage commercial technology, the labs will get more cutting edge technology at a lower cost. 
   In short, the labs' interest in collaborating with industry to achieve their missions means that they also have an interest in promoting a strong network of local collaborators. 
   Other provisions of this amendment will: create a small business advocate at the labs to get small businesses  more involved in lab research and procurement; create a ombudsman at the labs to informally settle disputes over technology partnerships; establish a series of studies to investigate other ways to improve collaboration between the labs and industry; give DOE a highly flexible ``other transactions'' research authority like the one DoD has; and establish a DOE Office of Arctic Energy to focus on the special energy problems and opportunities in Arctic regions of the United States. 
   Of course, I'm well aware this amendment would be good for the communities around the labs. But, just as those of us with labs in our states have seen that what's good for the labs can be good for our communities, what's good for our communities can also be good for our labs. 
   In summary, this amendment takes the next steps in improving the ability of DOE's national labs to collaborate with academia and industry, and I think it will prove of great benefit to our national security, the labs, and the labs' communities. I greatly appreciate the support of Senators WARNER and LEVIN for including it in this bill.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the ``Pecos National Historical Park Land Exchange Act of 2000. This bill will facilitate a land exchange between the Federal government and a private landowner that will benefit the Pecos National Historical Park in my State of New Mexico. 
   Specifically, the bill will enable the Park Service to acquire a private inholding within the park's boundaries in exchange for the transfer of a nearby tract of national forest system land. The national forest parcel has been identified as available for exchange in the Santa Fe National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan and is surrounded by private lands on three sides. 
   Pecos National Historical Park posses exceptional historic and archaeological resources. Its strategic location between the Great Plains and the Rio Grande Valley has made it the focus of the region's 10,000 years of human history. The park preserves the ruins of the great Pecos pueblo, a major trade center and the ruins of two Spanish colonial missions dating from the 17th and 18th centuries. 
   The Glorieta Unit of the park protects key sites associated with the 1862 Civil War Battle of Glorieta Pass, a significant event that ended the Confederate attempt to expand the war into the west. This unit will directly benefit from the land exchange.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to talk about the energy conservation programs in this Interior appropriations bill that we are now considering. First, I want to thank Chairman GORTON and Senator BYRD for their fine work on this bill. In particular, I am very glad to see that funding for energy conservation is 5 percent above last year's level. I firmly believe that every dollar spent on research and development for energy efficiency pays back many times in the real value for the American consumer. These programs are saving the Nation an estimated $20 billion per year in energy costs at this time. 
   I would like to focus my comments today on one particular program in the energy conservation budget, and that is, the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles. This is generally referred to as PNGV. It is a cost-shared, industry-government partnership. 
   It is working to improve the fuel economy of passenger cars with the ultimate goal of developing midsized cars that will get up to 80 miles per gallon. 
   Talking about energy efficiency in the transportation sector I believe is especially timely given the high gasoline prices that we are all concerned about throughout the Nation. I believe every Senator needs to understand why gasoline prices are rising, why the days of cheap oil are unlikely to return anytime soon, and why programs such as PNGV are so important to our economic competitors. 
   During the last couple of weeks, we have heard a lot on the Senate floor about the decline in domestic oil production and various proposals to stimulate new production. But production is only one side of the coin. A far more important factor in the long-term increase in oil prices is the dramatic upsurge in worldwide demand for petroleum products. The steep increase in consumption here in the United States compounds the worldwide situation. 
   Today, the U.S. transportation sector--this includes air, boat, rail, and highway travel, all of our transportation sector--is 95-percent dependent on oil. Transportation accounts for two-thirds of our Nation's oil consumption and a quarter of our total energy use. While over the last 25 years the residential, the commercial, and industrial sectors have all been able to reduce their dependence on oil, the transportation sector consumption of oil has skyrocketed. 
   I show you this chart. This shows petroleum use increases mainly occurring in the transportation sector. This chart goes back 30 years--from 1970 to the year 2000--and then forward for 20 years. If you look at these other areas, it tries to 
   show the industrial use, and the residential, commercial, or electric generation use of petroleum products. They are all relatively stable. The increases are not excessive in those areas. In fact, there are declines in electric generation and residential and commercial. But in transportation the increase is very substantial. 
   From the first gas price shock in 1973 until 1998, oil use for transportation grew an astounding 37 percent. If that is not bad enough, according to this chart from the Energy Information Agency--let me show you this second chart. The demand for oil in the transportation sector is anticipated to increase another 46 percent over the next 20 years. 
   Another key point from the chart is that over half of our oil consumption for transportation is used for light-duty vehicles; that is, passenger vehicles and pickup trucks. Today, more people are driving more miles in vehicles that use more fuel per mile. As you can see, unless something is done, our passenger cars will consume half again more fuel in 2020 than they do today. 
   I think all Senators agree on the need to reduce our dependence on imported oil. Today, America imports more than half of its oil. The cost of importing oil is a dangerous drag on our economy. 
   Reducing our dependence on imported oil is a daunting and long-term challenge that will require a variety of measures. Surely efforts to increase domestic production need to play a role in that strategy. However, I am afraid there is no silver bullet. Increased domestic production alone will not meet America's skyrocketing demand for oil. 
   With transportation accounting for two-thirds of our oil use, I believe the key is to reduce transportation demand through a wide range of measures, including technology advances that squeeze more useful energy out of every drop of oil. 
   That's where PNGV comes in. Started in 1993, PNGV brings together the expertise of the nation's colleges and universities, government agencies, national laboratories, suppliers, and the auto industry in a 10-year effort to dramatically improve the fuel efficiency of passenger vehicles. PNGV research efforts are focused on developing breakthrough technologies that are key to improving fuel economy. Work is underway on lightweight materials, aerodynamics, tires, power electronics, energy storage, combustion science, fuel cells, and hybrid propulsion systems. 
   The long-term goal of the program is to develop mid-size passenger sedans with up to three-times better fuel economy in a vehicle that retains all the  performance, comfort, safety, and cost of today's comparable models. 
   In the past seven years, a number of PNGV's innovations have started to improve the fuel economy of today's production vehicles. Many of these innovations originated in our national laboratories. I am pleased to see our laboratories are playing a major role in PNGV. Let me cite a few examples of recent accomplishments: 
   One automaker is now using a technology developed at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, in my state of New Mexico, to produce axle shafts that are stronger, lighter, and less expensive. 
   The Pacific Northwest Laboratory in the Chairman's home state of Washington helped develop a hydroforming technique that is being used to shape door, deck and hood panels in current model vehicles. 
   Using analytical methods developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, automakers are now producing pickup truck boxes from lightweight composite materials. 
   And Los Alamos National Laboratory, also in my state, is one of the world leaders in fuel cell technology. Through PNGV, the lab's unique capabilities are being brought to bear on what may well be the automobile technology of the future. A fuel cell offers the highest possible efficiency with near zero emissions--certainly a goal worth striving for. 
   In addition to producing immediate fuel savings, PNGV is a program that is meeting its milestones. Earlier this year, and on schedule, all three domestic automakers rolled out high efficiency concept vehicles: the Ford Prodigy, DaimlerChrysler's ESX-3, and GM's Precept. These cars demonstrated, for the first time, the technical feasibility of a 5-passenger, 80-mile per gallon vehicle. This is truly a remarkable achievement. 
   I believe all Senators agree that the views of the National Academy of Sciences carry considerable weight in this body. Just last month, the Academy's National Research Council completed its sixth annual review of PNGV. It had this to say about the program:  
   Though confronted with enormous technological problems, PNGV has made significant progress in meeting its objectives, and reaching the 2000 milestones represents an outstanding effort.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the NRC's report went on to describe the major challenges that remain in the final four years of the program. PNGV's goal is ambitious but achievable: to develop production vehicles that meet all safety and emissions standards while simultaneously maintaining current vehicle cost levels. The increase in federal funding in the bill before us today will help ensure that PNGV can meet its goal. 
   Last month, Chairman GORTON lead a debate here on the Senate floor about fuel efficiency standards, and I want to thank him for his effort. I do believe it is an important issue. How ever that debate eventually plays out, it should be clear that we are not going to be able to reduce our dangerous dependence on imported foreign oil without vehicles that are more efficient. And the American public is not going to stand for vehicles that do not provide the same levels of safety, comfort, and performance they've come to expect. That's exactly what PNGV is all about. 
   I'd like to make one last point. Both Europe and Japan have recently taken steps to raise the average fuel economy of their vehicles. In Europe, automakers are committed to increasing fuel economy by 33 percent by 2008. In Japan, fuel economy levels are set to increase 23 percent by 2010. I do believe fuel efficiency is an issue of international economic competitiveness. We must aggressively pursue efforts like PNGV, or risk falling behind in the global automotive market. 
   In closing, I am pleased that the Senate bill provides adequate funding for PNGV. However, I am concerned this year about maintaining the Senate's funding level for PNGV in conference. In what I believe was a very wrongheaded action, the House all but eliminated funding for this vital program. Mr. President, this is not the time to reduce our commitment to cutting-edge research that offers the promise of dramatic reductions in our need for oil. I hope all senators will want to work with the committee to maintain the Senate's funding level for PNGV as the bill moves to conference. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Secretary Richardson opposing the House's actions be printed the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks.

   Fuel Economy, Cost May Be Compromised To Meet Tougher Emission Standards in Next-Generation Cars 
   WASHINGTON.--A public-private partnership to create a highly fuel-efficient car reached a major milestone earlier this year with the unveiling of concept vehicles, but the ability to meet both fuel-economy objectives and emission standards by a 2004 deadline remains a monumental challenge, says a new report from the National Academies' National Research Council.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of Ms. Madelyn Creedon, who has been nominated by the President to become the Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs of the new National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) at the Department of Energy. 
   Ms. Creedon has a distinguished career with broad and deep experience regarding Department of Energy defense programs over which she will have oversight and management responsibilities in her position as ``second in command'' at the NNSA. 
   My colleagues should be aware that before joining the staff of the Armed Services Committee in 1990, Ms. Creedon worked for ten years with the Office of the General Counsel at the Department of Energy (DOE). 
   She returned to DOE after serving as counsel to the Armed Services Committee during 1990 through 1994 during which time she had oversight and review responsibilities of DOE national security and environmental programs. 
   At DOE, Ms. Creedon served as Associate Deputy Secretary of Energy for  National Security Programs from 1995 to 1997 when she resumed her position on the Armed Services Committee, once again with oversight responsibilities for DOE defense and environmental programs. 
   In short, Mr. President, Ms. Creedon's professional credentials for this position are impeccable. 
   Let me add, Mr. President, that I have worked closely with her during the past several years in my capacity as ranking member of the Strategic and Emerging Threats Subcommittees of the Armed Services Committee. 
   I've found Ms. Creedon to be fully knowledgeable about the issues we have discussed, and to be a person of sound judgment regarding possible solutions in the interest of improving our national security. 
   Her professional capabilities and commitment to public service and national security are plain to see for all of us on both sides of the aisle who have worked with her. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Ms. Creedon's nomination to assume this important new position as Deputy Administrator to NNSA. Her experience and know-how will be key to ensuring a smooth transition to a successful NNSA.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank Senators SPECTER and HARKIN for agreeing to include my amendment dedicating $10,000,000 from the Fund for the Improvement of Education to support proven dropout prevention programs in the managers' package. As my colleagues know, I filed an amendment on behalf of myself and Senators REID, COLLINS, and DEWINE seeking $20 million for this purpose. While both of these amounts fall short of the $150,000,000 level authorized in an amendment passed by the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to the ending ESEA reauthorization bill, this $10,000,000 is an important first step in supporting local efforts to develop, implement, and disseminate effective dropout prevention programs. It is my hope that in future years we will be able to grow the funds for this crucial effort in order to ensure that all schools with high dropout rates have the resources and information that they need to curb the high incidence of students dropping out of school. 
   Today, the lack of a high school education is a greater barrier than ever to employment, income, and advancement opportunities; though we frequently talk about how strong the economy is in the United States, we simply cannot overlook the fact that there are millions of working Americans who have never finished high school, and they earn less than a third of what their peers with a college degress earn. 
   High school completion rates remain distressingly low in many locales around the country--over 3,000 young people drop out of our high schools and middle schools each school day. Not surprisingly, the problem is disproportionately great along racial, ethnic and socioeconomic lines; Hispanic youth for instance, are nearly three times more likely to drop out than their white classmates, and African American students are still dropping out at a rate higher than their white peers as well. As The Hispanic Dropout Project found, widespread misunderstandings of the underlying causes of dropouts, combined with a lack of familiarity with effective programs, has prevented increased school completion for some groups. 
   It is my hope that when ESEA is reauthorized, we will be able to further extend the critical support that is needed to help our at-risk students complete high school with the skills necessary for the workplace or continued education. In the meantime, this commitment to funding is an important step towards ensuring that all students who are at risk of dropping out of school receive the appropriate attention and support they need to further their learning and graduate from high school. I thank my colleagues for working with me on this important effort.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, on behalf of the cosponsors of this amendment I thank Senators SPECTER and HARKIN for dedicating $5,000,000 from the Fund for the improvement of Postsecondary Education for desperately-needed construction and renovation projects at the 32 Tribal Colleges and Universities that comprise the American Indian Higher Education Consortium. 
   These institutions serve students from over 250 federally recognized Tribes in some of the most impoverished parts of the country. Anyone who has ever visited one has seen the overcrowding and the poor condition of the facilities; crumbling foundations, leaky roofs, exposed wiring, and many other safety hazards were in fact recently estimated to require $120 million in repairs. 
   The $5,000,000 supplemental to the Title III Strengthening Tribal Colleges and Universities funding recommended by the committee will provide some relief to the inadequate and unsafe conditions at many of the Tribal Colleges and Universities and hopefully will help the institutions leverage additional private funds. However, we know the needs are extremely great, and hope that the Congress will sustain and expand this commitment of federal resources to aid these schools which play such a key role in the education of our Native American populations.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Senator Lugar, I know you're aware of the tremendous good that the Comprehensive School Reform program (CSRD) has introduced to many struggling schools with high proportions of disadvantaged students, and the potential that the program offers for the numerous schools that desire to implement comprehensive reform in their buildings. While I recognize the considerable task of Chairman SPECTOR and Ranking Member HARKIN in accommodating the great number of priorities funded in the FY'01 Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill, it concerns me that the bill before us provides no funds for the CSRD--a tremendously popular and effective program.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. The notion of systematic, comprehensive reform is inherently appealing because rather than piecing together discordant or incompatible pieces of change, these approaches provide a holistic and coordinated plan of action to improve student achievement and outcomes. I know that a number of research-based models of comprehensive school reform have been developed in recent years, and one that I am familiar with and which has spurred great progress across New Mexico is the Success for All program. 
   Success for All is serving about 1550 elementary schools in 48 states, and is also assisting related projects in five other countries. Fifty schools in New Mexico have adopted this program with great results.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. It is clear that as we seek ways to assist resource-poor and failing schools, we should increase support for research-based proven programs like Success for All. The House bill included the amount requested by the Administration--$240,000,000--for this program and I know that Senators SPECTER and HARKIN are supporters of the program. So, I'd like to encourage the Senators to include funding for it as the bill moves to conference. Funding at this level would allow approximately 2,250 schools to receive new grants and continue support for 1,025 schools currently using such funds to carry out research-based school reforms. It is my hope that we can work together as the bill moves through the appropriations process to fund this successful program.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Senators SPECTER and HARKIN, I'd like to express my appreciation to you and your committee members for agreeing on the importance of the Advanced Placement (AP) Incentive Program by recommending that it be funded at $20,000,000--a $5,000,000 increase over last year's appropriation. As you know, the AP program provides rigorous instruction to high school students by teachers who have had additional, intensive professional development. While historically it was the well-to-do elite that had access to these courses--which not only cover advanced material but enable students to gain college credit and advanced standing--today the AP program continues to expand its reach, so that over half of all high schools in the nation offer AP courses in a variety of subject areas. The fact of the matter is that in this era of focus on high standards and improving student achievement, the AP program offers proven impact on student outcomes in high school, and there is even research that shows that regardless of the grade attained, a student who has access to more rigorous course work in high school is more likely to complete college. 
   As you know, the AP Incentive Program helps ensure that AP classes are within reach of low income students by subsidizing the cost of taking the AP test. These tests cost about $100 and many low income students would have to pass up the opportunity to take it due to expense. The program also supports activities designed to expand access to AP courses, particularly in low income areas. Many schools do not yet have AP programs and schools with large minority and low income populations are less likely to offer AP courses. This can be tragic for many students, as many colleges and universities consider whether a student has  taken AP classes when making admissions decisions. Every student--regardless of socioeconomic background--should have the opportunity to attend college and to take challenging curriculum in high school. This program helps to ensure both.

As technological capacities at schools increase, there is every reason to utilize such tools to deliver high-quality programs like AP courses through distance methods, especially in schools where the student population is too small or location is too remote to sustain a great deal of variety on-site. I look forward to working with you and the Administration to expand support for these kinds of innovative means of advanced instructional delivery to our rural and Native American schools.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment to reiterate my hope that the conferees on the Appropriations Committee will consider restoring funding for the Smaller Learning Communities program under the Fund for the Improvement of Education. Last 7ear $45 million was appropriated for what has been a very important initiative an the President has requested $120 million for FY2001. I strongly believe that we must continue--and indeed increase--our support for this program. As this appropriations bill goes to conference, I hope that you and your fellow committee members will decide to meet the President's request. 
   A number of research studies in recent years have documented the value of small schools and smaller learning communities, and the Bank Street College of Education just last week release a new study called ``Small Schools: Great Strides,'' which unequivocally confirms what we knew from earlier research--namely, that small schools help students succeed. This particular study examined the 150 or so small schools that were founded between 1990 and 1997 in Chicago, and tracks their progress through 1999. In these elementary schools of fewer than 350 students and these high schools of fewer than 400 students, the positive trends encompass everything from diminished violence to higher grade point averages and attendance rates. Of course, small size alone does not translate into these positive changes, but it certainly does foster the atmosphere of closeness and community that is conducive to the kinds of progress that our parents, teachers, and students are seeking. 
   Based on studies of high school violence, researchers have concluded that the first step in ending school violence must be to break through the impersonal atmosphere of large high schools by creating smaller communities of learning within larger structures, where teachers and students can come to know each other well. We really cannot wait for more tragedies of students shooting students or teachers before we act to fix the situation. 
   And just as important, particularly in our search for what works to improve student achievement, is that smaller school size also positively impacts learning. Research demonstrates that small schools outperform large schools on every measure of student outcomes, including grades, test scores, attendance, and graduation rates. In the Bank Street study, nearly twice as many students enrolled in smaller learning communities contained within larger high schools scored at or above national norms in reading compared to their peers. This impact is even greater for ethnic minority and low-income students. 
   In addition, smaller learning communities enhance the school experience for both teachers and students--research shows that smaller schools generate greater community and parental involvement, and a more engaged and enthusiastic staff. Research also shows that students at smaller schools are more likely to participate in extracurricular activities, and in a greater variety of activities--because everyone is needed to fill out the teams, clubs, and offices, even shy and less able students are more likely to participate and develop a sense of belonging. 
   Furthermore, contrary to what some may think, small schools can be created cost effectively. Larger schools can be more expensive because their sheer size requires more administrative support, and because small schools have higher graduation rates, the actual cost per graduating student is lower than at large schools. 
   I certainly hope that we do not turn our backs on this initiative, which we already know from research is a worthwhile investment that has real impact on school climate and student safety, as well as on student morale and achievement.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleagues for voting for final passage of H.R. 4425 and for supporting the funding for the Cerro Grande Fire Assistance Act contained in this bill. By working together with Senator DOMENICI and his staff, we were able to quickly put together a piece of legislation that will compensate the many New Mexicans injured by the Cerro Grande fire that raged through Los Alamos and the surrounding forests in early May. Because of the federal government's role in setting what began as a controlled burn in the Bandelier National Park, this legislation was a necessary response from the federal government. 
   The intensity of the Cerro Grande fire resulted in extraordinary losses for both the residents of Los Alamos and the surrounding pueblos. I am pleased that a compensation fund will now be available for those who lost their homes in the fire, those who were forced to close down their business and those who provided emergency relief to the threatened community. The compensation fund will also be made available for those who suffered other kinds of losses as a result of the fire. This would include aid to the Santa Clara Pueblo to help them restore the thousands of acres they lost to the Cerro Grande blaze. It would also include assistance to the members of the San Ildefonso Pueblo who have suffered economically due to the fire closing down the roads and cutting off the tourist traffic that frequents the pueblo. I'm also glad that we were able to provide funding for the Los Alamos National Laboratory so it can begin to address the damages it sustained as a result of the Cerro Grande fire. 
   I am very pleased that the Cerro Grande compensation fund will be available shortly so people can get on with their lives and start rebuilding their communities. Once this legislation is signed by the President, FEMA will have 45 days to draft regulations that govern this claims process. I would like to thank FEMA, and especially Director James Lee Witt, for taking on this very large responsibility of handling the fire claims process. He has worked tirelessly to aid disaster victims across this country and I know he will devote the resources necessary to aid the victims of the Cerro Grande  fire. We hope that the regulations governing the claims process will be in place shortly and the victims of the fire can begin settling their claims with the federal government by late summer. 
   As I thank my colleagues for their support, I would like to particularly thank Senator DOMENICI for his hard work in fighting for this money in the appropriations process. The initial appropriation of $455 million for this compensation fund will hopefully address most, if not all, of the damage caused by the Cerro Grande fire. The amount appropriated is a significant commitment by the federal government and by passing this legislation today, Congress has committed itself to compensating the victims of the Cerro Grande fire for the losses they incurred.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly about the amendment my good friend from Massachusetts, Senator KENNEDY, has offered to the Labor/HHS appropriations bill to restore critical funding to skills training programs at the Department of Labor. 
   Mr. President, I appreciate the work that Senators SPECTER and HARKIN have put into this bill. Finding the appropriate balance in this bill is particularly difficult. And, while I am disappointed with the funding levels for  many of the programs at the Department of Labor, I do understand that Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN care deeply about the programs affected by this amendment. 
   There are several components of the amendment offered by Senator KENNEDY but I would like to take a minute to discuss one in particular that is of critical importance to my state of New Mexico. 
   Mr. President, the amendment calls for an additional $181 million for dislocated worker assistance This additional funding would meet the President's request for fiscal year 2001. 
   When Congress passed the Workforce Investment Act a couple years ago, an important component was the funding stream for dislocated workers. While much of the Nation has prospered over the past eight years, many in my home state have not. I have seen plant closing from Roswell and Carlsbad in the east, to Las Cruces in the south, Albuquerque in the north and Cobre in the west. Thousands of high paying jobs have been lost, and especially hard hit has been the extractive industries. I don't need to tell my colleagues how devastating a plant closing can be on a community and families. 
   The Workforce Investment Act authorizes grants to States and local areas to provide core, intensive training and supportive services to laid off workers with the aim being to help them return to work as quickly as possible at wages as close as possible to those received prior to the layoff. These funds are critically important as the nature of our economy has changed over the last decade from an industrial base economy to a technologically based one. Workers who are laid off today, particularly those who have been with the same company for a number of years, are often unprepared to reenter the work place or for the new economy they face. Training and retraining is critical to develop the skills they need to quickly find a decent paying job and get back on their feet. 
   Under President Clinton, dislocated worker funding has tripled from $517 million in Program Year 1993 to $1.589 billion in Program Year 2000. Yet despite these increases, the need for these services has unfortunately kept pace with, and in some cases exceeded, the availability of funds. The President's budget for year 2001 continues the commitment to dislocated worker programs by providing adequate funding levels that will give dislocated workers the tools to compete in the new economy. This is the second installment of a five-year Universal Reemployment Initiative. Under the Universal Reemployment Initiative, dislocated worker funding was to be increased each year to ensure that by 2004 every dislocated worker would receive training and reemployment services if they want and need it, every unemployment insurance claimant who loses their job through no fault of their own would get the reemployment services they want and need, and every American would have access to One-Stop Career Centers. 
   However, and unfortunately in my opinion, unless the level of funding in the Senate's Labor/HHS bill is not increased, this will be the first year since 1994 that there will be no increase in these funds, and our commitment to universal reemployment will be in serious jeopardy. Specifically, this bill cuts over $181 million from the President's request which will mean the Department of Labor will be able to serve 100,825 fewer recipients. While the bulk of this cut would fall on State/local formula funding, it is important to note that 20 percent of the cut--over $36 million, would be in the Secretary's reserve funds, reducing her capacity to make National Emergency Grants to respond to disasters and large scale layoffs. 
   Mr. President, as my colleagues know, New Mexico has been through a couple rough months. These funds for dislocated workers are extremely important and I urge my colleagues to support the Kennedy amendment to bring the level of funding for this, and many other important programs, up to the level of the President's request. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I would also encourage my colleagues to support this amendment because of the increased funding levels for Youth Opportunity Grants, the Summer Jobs Program, and for Job Corps, among others. These programs, and the funding levels contained in this amendment are likewise critical to meeting the needs of young people in my state. 
   Again, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support this amendment and commend my friend, Senator KENNEDY, for his leadership on issues that are so important to families and working men and women throughout this country.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Utah, Senator HATCH, and others, to recognize we are passing S. 1515, which makes long overdue improvements to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990. 
   Mr. President, RECA was originally enacted in 1990 as a means of compensating the individuals who suffered from exposure to radiation as a result of the U.S. government's nuclear testing program and federal uranium mining activities. While the government can never fully compensate for the loss of a life or the reduction in the quality of life, RECA serves as a cornerstone for the national apology Congress extended to those adversely affected by the various radiation tragedies. In keeping with the spirit of that apology, the legislation the Senate is passing today will further correct existing injustices and provide compassionate compensation for those whose lives and health were sacrificed as part of our nation's effort to win the Cold War. While this bill does not go as far as the bill I originally introduced in the Senate this Congress, I am pleased that we have been able to take these important steps to begin to compensate our citizens for the sacrifices they made. 
   During the period of 1947 to 1961, the Federal Government controlled all aspects of the production of nuclear fuel. One of these aspects was the mining of uranium in New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, Wyoming and Utah. Even though the Federal Government had adequate knowledge of the hazards involved in uranium mining, these miners, many of whom were Native Americans, were sent into inadequately ventilated mines with virtually no instruction regarding the dangers of ionizing radiation. These miners had no idea of those dangers. Consequently, they inhaled radon particles that eventually yielded substantial doses of ionizing radiation. As a result, these miners have a substantially elevated cancer rate and incidence of incapacitating respiratory disease. The health effects of uranium mining in the fifties and sixties remain the single greatest concern of many former uranium miners and millers and their families and friends. 
   In 1990, I was pleased to co-sponsor the original RECA legislation to provide compassionate compensation to uranium miners. I believe that our efforts in 1990 were well intentioned but have not proven to be as effective as we had hoped in providing redress to those individuals who suffered the effects of working in uranium mines or mills or transporting the ore. The government has the responsibility to compensate all those adversely affected and who have suffered health problems because they were not adequately informed of the risks they faced while mining, milling, and transporting uranium ore. 
   Now we are getting ready to pass this comprehensive amendment to RECA to correct omissions, make RECA consistent with current medical knowledge, and to address what have become administrative horror stories for the claimants. With passage of this bill, we're now a Presidential signature away from offering compensation to thousands more uranium workers than ever. 
   Mr. President, the success of this bill is due in large part to Paul Hicks, who stood up for uranium workers, and strongly encouraged Congress to do the right thing by passing this bill. Paul was President of the Uranium Workers of New Mexico, and his passing just two months ago makes today's action bittersweet. But I hope his family can take comfort in the fact that he made a tremendously positive impact on the lives of thousands of uranium workers. 
   Mr. President, I am appreciative of all the hard work done on this bill by Senator HATCH and others, and I hope the President will sign this bill as soon as possible so that justice will be delayed no longer.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have indicated to the majority that I would take a half hour to discuss the amendment on our side. I know Senator REED also wishes to speak about the amendment, and perhaps others. 
   If the Republican side will take the same limited amount of time, I believe that is the arrangement. 
   This is an amendment to address the central issue that has been part of the education debate all along, and that is the issue of accountability. On the last amendment Senator WELLSTONE proposed, I know the discussion back and forth between Senator WELLSTONE and the Senator from New Hampshire. The position of the Senator from New Hampshire was that he could support increases in title I if there was proper accountability for how the money was spent, if we could be sure the money was spent for the purpose it was really needed. 
   The amendment I am proposing would try to put into place the mechanisms to ensure that accountability. That, I believe, is a reason the amendment should be supported by everyone. 
   Let me indicate what current law is. Current law says that of the title I funds a State receives, they can spend a maximum of one-half of 1 percent of those title I funds in order to ensure accountability in the expenditure of those funds. That is, if you have a failing school--for example, take my State. If one of our school districts in New Mexico has an elementary school that is not doing well and is not showing improvement in student performance, then the State has one-half of 1 percent of the title I funds it can spend in trying to assist that school to do better. That is all it can spend, and that is for the entire State. 
   It is clear to anybody who has worked in education that this is an inadequate amount of money. I have here a letter that has been sent to me by the Council of Chief State School Officers. I want to read a section from that where they indicate their support for this Bingaman amendment to restore an increase in funding for title I accountability grants to assist low-performing schools:

<TEXT>
   Mr. BINGAMAN. I believe that letter summarizes very well the thrust of my argument. We have the Federal Government now spending over $8 billion this next year--almost $9 billion--to assist disadvantaged students through the title I program. But the accompanying accountability provisions in the law have not been fully implemented. That is, we have not seen the  results we would like to see in all cases--in the case of these failing schools in particular--due to a lack of dedicated funding that would be necessary to develop improved strategies and create rewards and penalties that hold schools accountable for continuous improvement in their student performance. 
   The bill before us does not identify any specific funds for accountability enforcement efforts. We need to ensure that a significant funding stream is provided so that these accountability provisions are in fact enforced. The amendment I have offered seeks to ensure that $250 million, which is a small fraction of the total amount appropriated under title I, is directly spent on this objective. This money would be used to ensure that States and local school districts have the resources available to implement the corrective action provisions of title I by providing immediate and intensive interventions to turn around low-performing schools. 
   What type of interventions am I talking about? What are we trying to ensure that States and school districts can do by providing these funds? Let me give you a list. 
   First of all, ongoing and intensive teacher training. If you have a failing school where the students are not performing better than they did last year, it is likely that the problem comes back to the teachers. We need better training of some of our teachers in that school. These funds would make that possible. 
   Second, extended learning time for students, afterschool programs, Saturday, and summer school to help students catch up. Again, a failing school, in many cases, needs those kinds of resources. 
   Third, provision of rewards to low-performing schools that show significant progress, including cash awards and other incentives, such as release time for teachers. 
   Fourth, restructuring of chronically failing schools. In 
   many cases, you need a restructuring of a school. You need to replace some of the people in the administration. You need to have a restructuring so that the school can start off on another foot. 
   Fifth, intensive technical assistance from teams of experts outside the school to help develop and implement school improvement plans in these failing schools. These are teams that go into the school and determine the causes of the low performance--for example, low expectations, outdated curriculum, poorly trained teachers, and unsafe conditions--and assist those schools in implementing research-based models for improvement. 
   Here is one example of what I am talking about. A program with which many of us have become familiar--I certainly have in my State--is called Success for All. This is a program which is called a whole school reform program for the early grades, elementary schools. It was developed by researchers at Johns Hopkins University, and it has been implemented in over 2,000 elementary schools throughout the country. There were over 50 schools in my home State of New Mexico this last year that implemented the Success for All Program. The program is a proven early grade reading program which, if implemented properly, can ensure better results. All of the studies demonstrate that it can lead to better results. 
   At the end of the first grade, Success for All schools have average reading scores almost 3 months ahead of those in matching control schools, and by the end of the fifth grade, students read more than 1 year ahead of their peers in the controlled schools. So the program can reduce the need for special education placements by more than 50 percent and virtually eliminate the problem of having to retain students in a grade more than a year. 
   The funding contemplated in this amendment I am offering is authorized under both the old version of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the proposed new version, on which we just had a debate about how to get that back up for consideration in the Senate. Under section 1002(f) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act currently in effect, Congress is authorized to provide such sums as may be necessary to provide needed assistance for school improvement under sections 1116 and 1117 of the act. That is the current Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   Last year, we did provide additional assistance in this bill--this exact appropriations bill we are debating today. We provided $134 million for this purpose, and we need to follow through on that commitment this year. 
   We also agreed, on a bipartisan basis, that these funds were necessary during the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the bill which was reported out of the committee. Under S. 2, the chairman's bill, there would be an automatic setaside of increased funds for title I for this purpose. 
   Unfortunately, as has been discussed here at length, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act appears to be in limbo, and we are having great difficulty getting back to it on the Senate floor. It is simply irresponsible for us to invest $9 billion--or nearly that--in the title I program and, at the same time, still fail to provide necessary resources to ensure that the States, districts, and schools are held accountable for how that $9 billion is spent. 
   Title I requires the States and districts to implement accountability and assist failing schools. But we in the Congress have failed to give the States and districts the resources necessary to carry out those mandates. 
   Title I authorizes State school support teams to provide support for schoolwide programs, to provide assistance to schools in need of improvement through activities such as professional development, identifying resources for changing and instruction, and changing the organization of the school. 
   In 1998, only eight States reported that school support teams have been able to serve the majority of schools identified in need of improvement. 
   Less than half of the schools identified as needing improvement in the 1997-1998 school year reported that this designation led to additional professional development or assistance. 
   Schools and school districts that need this additional support and resources do five things: Address weaknesses quickly soon after they are identified; second, promote a progressively intensive range of interventions; third, continuously assess the results of those interventions and monitor whether progress is, in fact, being made; fourth, implement incentives for improvement; and, fifth, implement consequences for failure. 
   I think many in this Senate would agree that a crucial step toward improving the public schools lies in holding the system accountable for student achievement and better outcomes. 
   I hope everyone is able to demonstrate with their vote on this amendment that they support these positive initiatives toward establishing that type of accountability. 
   Unfortunately, our debate on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was prematurely ended. As I indicated, it is not clear when that will come back. I continue to hope it will come back to the Senate floor so we can complete that bill and send it to the President. 
   I think that is a high priority that the American people want to see us accomplish before we leave this fall. 
   When we resume consideration of that bill, I intend to offer an amendment that would address the area of accountability in all education programs. 
   This amendment will enhance the existing accountability provisions in title I. As you know, this is the largest Federal program in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and it has been discussed before as to the great good this program does. 
   We made some important changes to title I. I indicated that the chairman's mark has some provision for a significant increase in the amount of funds that could be used for these accountability purposes. But under current law, States and the school districts are not able to spend the money they need in this area. 
   That is why the amendment I am offering today is so important. 
   I hope very much that Senators will support the amendment. 
   In my home State of New Mexico the need is enormous. 
   In 1994, fourth grade reading data showed that an average of 21 percent of fourth graders in my State were reading at a level that was considered proficient. 
   There is a tremendous need for additional resources in this area. The fact  is that many of these students are minority students, and many of these students require the assistance that title I was intended to provide. We need to be sure that the accountability is there so these funds are spent in an effective way. 
   I know that Senator REED is also here on the floor and is a cosponsor of this amendment. He would like to speak to it. 
   Let me indicate also, if I failed to do so at the beginning of my comments, that the amendment is offered on behalf of myself, Senators REED, KENNEDY, MURRAY, DODD, and WELLSTONE.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which will bring focus to an issue that concerns the long-term economic viability of communities in much of America's heartland: the southern High Plains stretching from the middle of Kansas through Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle and including eastern portions of the State of Colorado, and the eastern counties of my home state of New Mexico. This is farm country, and the cornerstone of its economy is its groundwater supply, the Ogallala aquifer, which allows for irrigated agriculture. 
   The Natural Resource & Conservation Service estimates that there are over six million acres of irrigated farmland overlying the southern Ogallala. These farms use between six and nine million acre-feet of water each year. The problem is that current use of the aquifer is not sustainable, and it is being depleted rapidly. 
   As shown on this U.S. Geological Survey Map, the High Plains Aquifer, which is mostly the Ogallala Aquifer, starts in South Dakota, encompasses most of Nebraska and parts of Wyoming, and then continues down into the southern High Plains. 
   This next chart shows the change in water levels in the aquifer over a seventeen year period from 1980 to 1997. As shown by the gray and blue markings on this map, the northern portion of this aquifer is in pretty good shape. The rate of water recharge from rainfall and irrigation water from the Platte River, for the most part matches or is greater than the rate of water depletions. 
   However, the story is quite different in the southern High Plains. In just the 17 years characterized on this map, we have seen large areas of the southern aquifer experience a 10 to 20 foot drop in their water table. That is shown in the dark orange areas on the map. More alarming is that for an almost equal area, as depicted in red on the map, the drop in the water table has been 40 feet or greater. 
   These changes in the level of the water table mean that it takes more wells at a greater pumping cost to produce the same amount of water, and that's if the wells don't go completely dry. This raises the serious question about the viability of continued farming on the southern High Plains. However, while irrigated agriculture uses the lion's share of the water, farm viability is only part of the economic story. This aquifer is also the primary source for municipal water on the southern High Plains. Diminishing productivity from municipal wells and the increased cost of pumping can place huge strains on local and county resources. 
   The insecurity of groundwater resources on the southern High Plains is a multi-state issue with significant economic and social consequences for America as a nation. We must act now to help steer the communities on the southern High Plains toward a sustainable use of the Ogallala aquifer. Ignoring the problem and allowing continuing uses to go unabated invites tremendous economic dislocation for a large section of our country. 
   To address this issue I am introducing the Southern High Plains Groundwater Resource Conservation Act. This bill creates three levels of approach to the problem. 
   First, it recognizes that to guide government decision makers and private investors, accurate, up-to-date, 
   scientific information about the groundwater resources in their area is necessary. Therefore it calls upon the United States Geological Survey to initiate a comprehensive hydrogeologic mapping, modeling, and monitoring program for the Southern Ogallala, to provide a report to Congress and to the relevant states with maps and information on a county by county basis, and to renew and update that report every year.  
   Second, it acknowledges that an effective water conservation plan can only be measured against a multi-year goal. Also, modeling by the U.S.G.S. indicates that groundwater conservation is not economically effective if implemented on a small scale basis. Measures must be implemented over a sufficiently large area in order to see a long-term groundwater savings, and return on the investment in conservation. To ensure groundwater savings over an appropriate area, this bill would authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to provide planning assistance, on a cost-share basis, to states, tribes, counties, conservation districts, or other local government units to create water conservation plans designed to benefit their groundwater resource over at least 20 years. 
   Finally, if the Secretary certifies that such a plan is in place, this bill would provide two primary forms of assistance for groundwater conservation on individual farms. They are a cost-share assistance program to upgrade the water use efficiency of farming equipment, and the creation of an ``Irrigated Land Reserve.'' 
   The cost-share program is based on the knowledge that, while significant water savings could be made from moving farms from historical row or center-pivot irrigation to more modern techniques, the upfront cost is often prohibitive to family farmers. However, estimates by the Natural Resources Conservation Service and the High Plains Underground Water Conservation District in Lubbock, Texas, are that an initial $20,000 in Federal investment in equipment on a cost-share basis would save between 325 to nearly 490 acre-feet of water over a ten year period. A bargain price, considering water prices on the West. 
   The Irrigated Land Reserve in this bill, is designed to convert 10 percent, or approximately 600,000 acres, of the irrigated farmland on the southern High Plains to dryland agriculture. Dryland agriculture, obviously, is less productive than irrigation. So this bill would provide for a rental rate to farmers to ease the economic impact of changing over. It is estimated that when fully implemented this program would save between 600,000 and 900,000 acre-feet of water per year at a cost of $33 to $50 per acre-foot. 
   These two programs, the cost-share program for water conservation, and enrollment in an Irrigated Land Reserve are completely voluntary. However, from the interest I have received in discussions with farmers on the southern High Plains, I expect that there will be no shortage of participants. 
   The program outlined in this bill would cost $70 million per year if fully implemented. Given the opportunity to move the southern High Plains communities to a sustainable use of their groundwater without massive dislocations in their economy, I think it will be an investment worth making.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first I want to thank my colleague, Senator DOMENICI, for his work on this amendment, and Chairman SHELBY and Senator LAUTENBERG for adding this important funding to the Transportation Appropriations Bill. Our amendment provides funding for a new program to help rural communities with inadequate or uneconomical commercial air service to attract new air carriers or to improve their existing service. 
   Mr. President, for a number of years, as I traveled around New Mexico, I heard from many of our community and business leaders about the importance of commercial air service to support economic development and attract new employers to rural parts of my state. To help address this problem, last year I worked with the Commerce Committee, and especially Senators ROCKEFELLER and DORGAN, to authorize a new program to help rural communities to improve their commercial air service. The authorization for this new program was included in the Wendell Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, which Congress passed and the President signed earlier this year. 
   At the same time, the New Mexico State Legislature, lead by Senators Altamirano, Ingle, Jennings, Kidd, and Leavell, established a $500,000 state program to provide matching funds to communities that wanted to improve their commercial air service. Almost immediately, agreements were signed and new air service was made available to Taos and Los Alamos--cities that previously had no commercial air service. More recently, agreements have been signed with a consortium of cities in Southeastern New Mexico, including Roswell, Carlsbad, Hobbs and Lea and Eddy Counties. These are exactly the kinds of communities this program we are funding today is designed to help. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased the committee has found a way to fund this important program for rural communities. I want to work with the committee as the bill goes to conference to ensure that this funding is retained. I again thank Chairman SHELBY and Senator LAUTENBERG for their help.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator DOMENICI. I also want to state how much I have enjoyed working with him on this terrible subject. I think the ability of our offices to work together has been admirable. We have come up with a plan that moves the process forward and closer to some real relief for the people who were damaged by this incident. 
   Mr. President, this was a disaster. This was a catastrophe. Let me show three photos that make the case. This is a photo from space, from a very high altitude, that shows the fire while it was burning, with the smoke plume coming through northeastern New Mexico into Colorado, into Oklahoma, and into west Texas. The photo shows the magnitude of what was involved. This was clearly the largest forest fire we have ever had in our State of New Mexico since they have been keeping records. It is very unfortunate that it was started by a controlled burn to which the Park Service agreed. That clearly makes this the responsibility of the Federal Government. As a country, we need to step up and compensate people for their losses. 
   Let me show two other photos that make the case as to what was done. This is a photo of one of the houses in Los Alamos with a car out front. These people in Los Alamos were advised they needed to leave their homes, get in cars or on buses, and go down to Santa Fe to escape the danger. They did. This is what they came back to a couple of weeks later. Clearly, this is not the kind of a circumstance of which anyone can be proud.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. That is a chimney. 
   The people did not have time to even arrange to drive their cars out of town. Of course, all their personal belongings were in the houses. The damage was total. The loss was total for the families who were burned out. 
   Another photo makes the case, a photo of the rubble that was left at one of the sites. Here is a bicycle. I might add, the water lines in these houses were still running. As we drove up and down the street, we saw water spurting out of the water lines, but there would be no house. Clearly, the devastation was enormous. 
   The people of Los Alamos and Senator DOMENICI made this point, and it has been made many times: The people of Los Alamos were heroic in their response to this tragedy. They pulled together as a community. They helped each other. They worked together to get their community back up and running. The people of the entire State came together and rallied to help the people who were injured. This was a period, and we are still in it to some extent, a period where we have lots of fires going on in New Mexico. It was not just the people who were injured in the Cerro Grande fire who were requiring assistance. We had other fires in our State, including the Scott Able fire in southern New Mexico which was very devastating, the fire at Ruidoso, the Viveash fire near Pecos. 
   Our job now, and what Senator DOMENICI and I are trying to do in this legislation, is to put in place a mechanism so people can get as full a relief as possible. We recognize you are not ever in a position to compensate someone for all of this loss, but we want to compensate people as fully as the Government can. We also, of course, want to do so as quickly as possible. 
   The reason this legislation is important, I believe--and I think this was something which the administration officials, and Jack Lew with the Office of Management and Budget agreed with entirely--is that the time it takes to go through the Tort Claims Act is extensive. History has shown that in many cases it is not satisfactory, that process has not been satisfactory. It was our conclusion, and the conclusion supported by the administration, that we should do a separate bill which would set up a different procedure that, hopefully, would give better compensation to people, and do it much more quickly than is otherwise possible. 
   Senator DOMENICI pointed out we have gone to great lengths to not interfere with the right of people to pursue their remedies under current law, if they choose to do that. We have not changed the rules for that. We have not in any way impeded that. But people have to make a judgment after they consult with everyone involved--their attorneys if they have attorneys, or anyone else with whom they want to consult--make a judgment as to whether to use the remedy, the process we are setting up in this legislation, once this becomes law, or to use the process that is available to them under current law under the Tort Claims Act. 
   My own hope is that we have come up with a better alternative. That is my belief. That has certainly been our purpose. We hope people will see it that way and that this legislation will result in more full compensation, much more rapidly than would otherwise be possible, and that people will be able to get on with their lives because of that. 
   The legislation has many aspects to it, which I discussed in detail. Senator DOMENICI went into some of that. Let me just say, the main thrust of it is to compensate people for injuries they receive, for loss of property, compensate businesses for losses they incurred, compensate businesses and individuals, both, for financial losses that are directly traceable and attributable to this fire. 
   Clearly, we want this to be a fair process for those involved. At the same time, we are anxious that it be done in a responsible way, so once it is over with, we can have an accounting for  what compensation was provided and the justification for it. I think the American people will want that and should be entitled to that. I believe this will substantially improve the chances of folks getting fully compensated, as fully compensated as possible, as early as possible. 
   For that reason, I am pleased to join Senator DOMENICI in cosponsoring this legislation. I do think we have several steps, several hoops to jump through between now and when this becomes law. There will be opportunities for us to fine-tune this as we go forward. I hope we can do that, but I hope we can go forward very quickly. He indicated our desire to have it included in some appropriations legislation--the military construction appropriations bill--which is pending now. I hope very much that can happen, and I hope that bill can get to the President very quickly with this included and can become law. 
   Mr. President, on May 4, 2000, a decision by the National Park Service to conduct a prescribed burn in the Bandelier National Park changed the lives of Los Alamos residents forever. What started as a prescribed burn of approximately 1,000 acres, turned into a fire that roared for 18 days and in the end charred over 47,000 acres. Soon after the fire raged out of control, the National Park Service assumed responsibility for the damage caused by the fire. 
   While we need to take another look at the Park Service's policy concerning prescribed burns, we first need to take care of those that were injured by the Park Service's actions. There will be time for hearings and investigations. But first, there are people that must be clothed, homes that must be rebuilt, and businesses that must pay their bills. We need to make sure our children are settled again before the 2001 school year begins in 2 months. We need to clean up the debris and hazardous waste so families can think about rebuilding. 
   The Cerro Grande Fire Assistance Act that I am introducing with Senator DOMENICI today is what we believe represents the Government's responsibility to the citizens of Los Alamos and the surrounding pueblos. 
   The Cerro Grande fire didn't just burn 47,000 acres of national forest. This fire was so intense that it traveled several miles from the point of origin to the town of Los Alamos, New Mexico. When the fire roared up the canyons in Los Alamos, it completely destroyed 385 dwellings and seriously damaged another 17 dwellings. Over 60 homes were burned on 46th, 48th and Yucca Streets alone. Keep in mind that Los Alamos is not a large community and these numbers reflect a large majority of the residents in those areas. This chart shows what used to be single family homes on Arizona Avenue. It was one of the 50 homes destroyed along Arizona Avenue. 
   This second picture shows the damage done along Alabama Avenue. The fourplexes across the street were spared but many of the fourplexes along Alabama are no longer standing. Most of these fourplexes were built between 1949 and 1954 by the federal government for the first workers of the national laboratory. In the late 1960's the federal government sold these homes to the residents of Los Alamos. On May 4th, many of these homes were occupied by the original residents--individuals who are now retired from the lab and enjoying their golden years. Ten percent of the households destroyed belonged to senior citizens. One such couple showed up to a town meeting to show me all they had left of their former home--the wife had the burned door handle and the husband had the key in his pocket. 
   Other fourplexes that were destroyed were occupied by young families and the most recent generation of lab employees. 35% of the housing units destroyed were being rented and 92 of those tenants were without any form of insurance. Many of these people are now without a home for their young families. One of the couples I spoke with after the fire was a young couple expecting a child who lost their home and their adjoining rental unit. And I was recently informed that over 200 school children were burned out of their homes. 
   Driving through these neighborhoods that are now filled with blackened trees, melted swing sets and burned bicycles is a difficult thing to witness. This fire grew out of control so 
   quickly, mostly because of the 60 mph winds that swirled through the controlled burn area, that most families had less than an hour to gather their belongings and evacuate the mesa. Many others didn't have even that much time. As you can see by the numerous burned cars, many families were unable to get both of their cars down the hill before the fire hit. In the end, 5% of the housing units in Los Alamos was destroyed by this fire. 
   Despite the personal tragedy many of them suffered, the residents of Los Alamos came together and helped one another and supported the efforts of the hundreds of firefighters who fought long and hard to control this monstrous blaze. Several Los Alamos restaurant owners returned to Los Alamos during the height of the fire and donated their inventory and services to cook up meals at the local Elks Lodge for the firefighters, police and National Guardsmen who were sent to this remote community. In addition, the outpouring of support from the nearby communities in setting up shelters and offering food and clothing was something I was proud to witness firsthand. This support also included the shelters and individuals who volunteered to take in the hundreds of animals that belonged to the over 20,000 residents evacuated from Los Alamos and White Rock. 
   The citizens of Los Alamos were heroic throughout this fire. Residents, like engineer Tony Tomei, were single-handedly trying to help save their neighborhoods from spreading wildlife. Tomei used his garden hose to douse small spot fires and used a rake and shovel to extinguish burning debris. His all night efforts saved his own house and the house of one neighbor, much to the neighbor's surprise. 
   After returning from Los Alamos and viewing the extent of damage, I began work with Senator DOMENICI on legislation that would compensate the people of Los Alamos, the surrounding pueblos, and the national laboratory for the damages sustained. We have been working for over 3 weeks now with the Office of Budget and Management, the White House, and the citizens of New Mexico to come up with legislation that will provide those who suffered personal and/or financial injury the most expedient and thorough compensation possible. We have received input from a number of individuals who lost their homes, from business owners who were shut down for up to a week, from the Los Alamos County Council and the governors of the San Ildefonso and Santa Clara Pueblos. While no one can truly be made whole after such a devastating experience, the role of the federal government in this situation is to ensure that people are adequately compensated for the losses resulting from the fire. Senator DOMENICI and I worked to come up with legislation that would compensate New Mexicans as fully as possible, while still being something acceptable to the entire Congress. 
   Based on the numerous meetings we held with the people mentioned above, we have come up with categories of damages that are compensable, including: property losses, business losses and financial losses. The goal is to compensate individuals for losses that were not otherwise covered by insurance or any other third party contribution. 
   For example, compensable property losses will include such things as uninsured property losses. This should address the problem many individuals are facing after realizing that they were under insured for their homes or their personal property. The goal is this legislation is to provide individuals with the funds needed to repair or replace their real and personal property using ``replacement value'' as a determining factor. This means that individuals should receive the dollar amount needed to rebuild their homes using current construction methods and 
   materials, in line with current zoning requirements, and without a deduction for depreciation. It also means that individuals should be provided with the funds necessary to allow them to replace their damaged personal property with property that provides them equal utility. Moreover, we realize that homeowners will need funds to cover the cost of stabilizing and restoring their land to a condition suitable for building after the debris is removed.  
   The legislation will also compensate public entities for the damage to the physical infrastructure in the community. The county and other governmental entities will be able to seek compensation for the cost of rebuilding community infrastructure damaged by the fire, such as power lines, roads and public parks. 
   Compensable business losses will include such things as damage to tangible business assets, lost profits, costs incurred as a result of suspending business for one week, wages paid to employees for days missed during the fire, and other business losses deemed appropriate by the Claims Office. This provision is intended to help business owners who were forced to evacuate Los Alamos for up to 5 days. For people like the local nursery owner, closing shop during Mothers' Day weekend and the short planting season in northern NM was devastating. While the residents of Los Alamos disappeared from the community, the fixed overhead costs of the small business owners did not disappear. 
   Compensable financial losses will include economic losses for expenses such as insurance deductibles, temporary living expenses, relocation expenses, debris removal costs, and emergency staffing expenses for our governmental entities. The intent is to assist victims in rebuilding and recovering incidental expenses that they would otherwise not have incurred, had it not been for the Cerro Grande Fire. This includes costs incurred by the claimant in proving his losses, including the cost of appraisals where necessary. 
   In addition, the pueblos will be eligible to seek compensation for the damage to the forest lands on the pueblo and the impact of the fire on their subsistence hunting, fishing, firewood, timbering, grazing and agricultural activities. Individual tribal members and wholly-owned tribal entities will be eligible to seek reimbursement through this claims process for quantifiable losses. This means that the BIA will not serve as a conduit for any settlement to an individual tribal member or a tribe. 
   This legislation also intends to provide resources for the remediation that will be necessary to prevent future disasters because of flooding and mudslides. While we have experienced an unusually dry summer in the Southwest, forecasters predict an earlier than usual monsoon season and efforts must be made to shore up the burned hillsides and 70 foot canyon walls. The remediation effort will have to be undertaken by several federal agencies, including the Department of interior, the Agriculture Department and other entities with experience in this regard. 
   In order to expedite an individual's recovery, we have designed an administrative claims process that will allow injured parties to seek compensation for the expenses that were incurred, and were not otherwise covered by a third party, as a result of the Cerro Grande fire. This legislation authorizes that claims process and establishes an Office of Cerro Grande Fire Claims which will be under the authority of the Director of FEMA. FEMA is directed to compensate the victims of the Cerro Grande fire for injuries resulting from the fire and to settle those claims in an expeditious manner. FEMA will be given authority to hire an independent claims manager 
   or other experts in claims processing to oversee this large project. We feel that FEMA is the best federal agency to handle this responsibility as they are capable of the task and are familiar with the damages that are common in a disaster. I trust that the FEMA Director will assemble a team that the community of Los Alamos can have confidence in and that will strive to settle claims to the benefit of those injured. 
   The Director of FEMA has 45 days to design this claims process and promulgate regulations for the claims office to follow. The regulations should not be overly burdensome for the claimants and should provide an understandable and straight forward path to settlement. In the event that issues arise concerning a settlement amount, the claimant will be able to enter into binding arbitration to settle any disputes with the claims office. If a claimant would rather have the Director's decision reviewed by a judge, the claimant will be able to seek judicial review of the Director's decision in federal court. Claimants who believe they need legal assistance as they proceed through this process should know that attorneys' fees are provided for in this legislation, with a cap of 10%. And while we believe this administrative claims process is the most efficient and reliable route for those seeking compensation, we are leaving the option of a federal tort action open to this legislation. 
   Mr. President, there is nothing Senator DOMENICI or I can do to replace the personal items and sentimental possessions that were consumed by the Cerro Grande Fire. This federal compensation will do nothing to replace a coin collection collected over a lifetime or an heirloom inherited from a great-grandmother. However, the federal government has the responsibility to try and restore the lives of the people impacted by this horrible tragedy. The federal government started this mess and it is time the federal government started cleaning up this mess and fixing what was damaged. 
   Congress can start the recovery process by passing this legislation. I ask that my colleagues act quickly on this legislation as the season for rebuilding this community is a short season for this city that sits high above the valley. I thank my colleagues for their support and for their willingness to do the right thing in this very unique situation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator THOMPSON and others in offering this strongly bipartisan amendment. It addresses occupational illnesses scientifically found to be associated with the DOE weapons complex, that have occurred and are now occurring because of activities during the cold war. 
   This amendment is a joint effort of a bipartisan group of Senators. Specifically, it has been put together by staff for myself, Senator FRED THOMPSON, Senator GEORGE VOINOVICH, Senator MIKE DEWINE, and Senator TED KENNEDY. We have worked with the administration, with worker groups, and with manufacturers. The staff have met with Armed Services Committee staff during the development of this amendment, and I want to acknowledge the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee for their support for this amendment. 
   The workers in the DOE nuclear weapons complex, both at the production plants and the laboratories, helped us win the cold war. But that effort left a tragic environmental and human legacy. We are spending billions of dollars each year on the environmental part--cleaning up the physical infrastructure that was contaminated. But we also need to focus on the human legacy. 
   This amendment is an attempt to put right a situation that should not have occurred. But it proposes to do so in a way that is based on sound science. 
   The amendment focuses federal held on three classes of injured workers. 
   The first group is workers who were involved with beryllium. Beryllium is a non-radioactive metal that provokes, in some people, a highly allergic lung reaction. The lungs become scarred, and no longer function. 
   The second group is workers who dug the tunnels for underground nuclear tests and are today suffering from chronic silicosis due to their occupational exposures to silica, which were not adequately controlled by DOE. 
   The third group of workers are those who had dangerous doses of radiation on the job.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. For beryllium workers, there are tests today that can detect the first signs of trouble, called beryllium sensitivity, and also the actual impairment, called chronic beryllium disease. If you have beryllium sensitivity, you are at a higher risk for developing chronic beryllium disease. You need annual check-ups with tests that are expensive. If you develop chronic beryllium disease, you might be disabled or die. 
   This amendment sets up a federal workers' compensation program to provide medical benefits to workers who acquired beryllium sensitivity as a result of their work for DOE. It provides both medical benefits and lost wage protection for workers who suffer disability or death from chronic beryllium disease. 
   For radiation, the situation is more complex. Radiation is proven to cause cancer in high doses. But when you look at a cancer tumor, you can't tell for sure whether it was caused by an alpha particle of radiation from the workplace, a molecule of a carcinogen in something you ate, or even a stray cosmic ray from outer space. But scientists can make a good estimate of the types of radiation doses that make it more likely than not that your cancer was caused by a workplace exposure. 
   This amendment puts the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in charge of making the causal connection between specific workplace exposures to radiation and cancer. Within the HHS, it is envisioned by this amendment that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (or NIOSH) take the lead for the tasks assigned by this amendment. Thus, the definition section of the amendment specifies that the Secretary of HHS act with the assistance of the Director of NIOSH. This assignment follows a decision made in DOE during the Bush Administration, and ratified by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, to give NIOSH the lead in identifying levels of exposure at DOE sites that present employees with significant health risks. 
   HHS was also given a Congressional mandate, in the Orphan Drug Act, to develop and publish radioepidemiolog-ical tables that estimate ``the likelihood that persons who have or have had any of the radiation related cancers and who have received specific doses prior to the onset of such disease developed cancer as a result of those doses.'' I would like to ask unanimous consent that a more detailed discussion of how the bill envisions these guidelines would be used be included as an exhibit at the end of my remarks.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Under guidelines developed by the HHS and used in this amendment, if your radiation does was high enough to make it at least as likely as not that your cancer was DOE-work-related, you would be eligible for compensation for lost wages and medical benefits. 
   The HHS-based method will work for many of the workers at DOE sites. But it won't work for a significant minority who were exposed to radiation, but for whom it would be infeasible to reconstruct their dose. 
   There are several reasons why reconstructing a dose might be--this infeasibility might exist. First, relevant records of dose may be lacking, or might not exist altogether. Second, there might be a way to reconstruct the dose, but it would be prohibitively 
   expensive to do so. Finally, it might take so long to reconstruct a dose for a group of workers that they will all be dead before we have an answer that can be used to determine their eligibility. 
   One of the workers who testified at my Los Alamos hearing might be an example of a worker who could fall into the cracks of a system that operated solely on dose histories. He was a supervisor at what was called the ``hot dump'' at Los Alamos. All sorts of radioactive materials were taken there to be disposed of. It is hard to reconstruct who handled what. And digging up the dump to see what was there would not only be very expensive, it would expose new workers to radiation risks that could be large. 
   There are a few groups of workers that we know, today, belong in this category. They are specifically mentioned in the definition of Special Exposure Cohort. For other workers to be placed in this special category, the decision that it was infeasible to reconstruct their dose would have to be made both by HHS and by an independent external advisory committee of radiation, health, and workplace safety experts. We allow groups of workers to petition to be considered by the advisory committee for inclusion in this group. Once a group of workers was placed in the category, it would be eligible for compensation for a fixed list of radiation-related cancers. 
   The program in this amendment also allows, in section 3515, for a lump-sum payment, combined with ongoing medical coverage under section 8103 of title 5, United States Code. This could be  helpful, for example, in settling old cases of disability. It may be a good deal for survivors of deceased workers whose deaths were related to their work at DOE sites. 
   The provisions of the workers' compensation program in this amendment are largely modeled after the Federal Employee's Compensation Program or FECA, which is found in chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code. In many parts of the amendment, entire sections of FECA are incorporated by reference. In other sections, portions of FECA are restated in more general language to account for the fact that the specific language in FECA would cover only Federal employees, while in this amendment we are covering Federal contractor and subcontractor employees, as well. In some instances, we modified provisions in FECA to address known problems in its current implementation or to reflect current standards of administrative law. One example of this is a decision not to incorporate section 8128(b) of title 5, United States Code, into this amendment. That section absolutely precludes judicial review of decisions concerning a claim by the Department of Labor. Since such decisions involve the substantive rights of individuals being conferred by this amendment, and since they are made through an informal administrative process, it seems appropriate to the sponsors of this amendment that there be external review to guard against, for example, arbitrary and capricious conduct in processing a claim. 
   The amendment also had numerous administrative provisions to ensure a fair process and to guard against double compensation for the same injury. 
   As the sponsors were developing this amendment, we received a lot of interest in federal compensation for exposure to other toxic substances. This amendment does not provide federal compensation for chemical hazards in the DOE workplace, but does authorize DOE to work with States to get workers with adverse health effects from their exposure to these substances into State worker compensation programs. It also would commission a GAO study of this approach so that we can evaluate, in the context of a future bill, whether such an approach is effective. 
   We have a duty to take care of sick workers from the nuclear weapons complex today. It is a doable task, and a good use of our national wealth at a time of budget surpluses. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which reauthorizes appropriations for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. In addition to extending the authorization for the museum and the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, the bill makes several clarifying and conforming changes to the 1980 enabling legislation to incorporate the recommendations of a recently completed review of the museum and the council by the National Academy of Public Administration. 
   As described in the museum's mission statement, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is America's national institution for the documentation, study, and interpretation of Holocaust history, and serves as this country's memorial to the millions of people murdered during the Holocaust. The Museum's primary mission is to advance and disseminate knowledge about this unprecedented tragedy; to preserve the memory of those who suffered; and to encourage its visitors to reflect upon the moral and spiritual questions raised by the events of the Holocaust as well as their own responsibilities as citizens of a democracy. 
   Since the museum was opened to the public in 1993, it has been one of the most heavily visited sites in our nation's capital, with more than 2 million visitors last year. Previous bills authorizing appropriations for the museum have enjoyed broad bipartisan support, and I am pleased that this bill is no exception, with over 17 original cosponsors on both sides of the aisle.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank my colleague, Senator DOMENICI. 
   It is a pleasure to work with him in trying to solve some of these imminent problems that afflict our State. We hope very much we can do that in an effective way, with the help of the rest of the Senate and the rest of Congress. 
   Mr. President, on May 4, National Park Service officials set a fire in Bandelier National Monument to clear brush and deadwood that had accumulated in one corner of the monument, known as the Cerro Grande. We all know now what happened next. 
   That fire became an uncontrollable wildfire as high winds fanned the flames over the next several days. 
   Its smoke plume stretched across New Mexico and into Texas and Oklahoma--a plume that was visible from outer space. 
   The fire spread across the Santa Fe National Forest and torched the northern and western parts of the City of Los Alamos, destroying 260 homes and other residential units that had housed over 400 families. 
   The fire has, as of yesterday evening, consumed over 44,000 acres. Its perimeter last night was 85 miles. 
   The City of Los Alamos and the neighboring community of White Rock evacuated a total of over 20,000 people. A voluntary evacuation of 3,000 persons also took place in the next closest city, Espan 6ola 
   The fire has damaged over 10 percent of the Santa Clara Pueblo Indian Reservation, where 1,500 people live, and threatens both the water supply and economic lifeline for that community. 
   On Saturday, President Clinton declared a Major Disaster in 12 New Mexico counties, as a result of the Cerro Grande fire and wildfires in several other locations in the State. 
   This week, and perhaps next week as well, we will be considering appropriations bills that contain emergency supplemental spending for a variety of disasters that have occurred over the past several months. I believe that it is important for the Senate to make some critical adjustments to these spending bills to mitigate the effects of the Cerro Grande fire, and to prevent the occurrence of other catastrophic fires in the West this spring and summer. 
   As a first step, we should consider additional defense emergency spending to mitigate damage that has occurred at Los Alamos National Laboratory due to the fire. Thankfully, the laboratory was spared major destruction. At the same time, the damage to the laboratory was not zero. A number of buildings and trailers were destroyed, and the fire pointed up some systemic weaknesses in some of the laboratory's emergency and security systems that need to be addressed 
   Second, we need to deal with the aftermath of the destruction of dwellings for over 400 families in Los Alamos. The Administration and the Congress needs to act quickly to make them whole for the destruction of their homes and the loss of their belongings. I'm sure we have all seen pictures that show the total loss suffered by many families. 
   Making these Los Alamos community members and their families whole is not simply a matter of fairness--the government, after all, set the fire that burned them out. What happens to the residents of the City of Los Alamos and the surrounding communities also affects our national security. 
   The prime national security asset at Los Alamos, when you stop to think about it, is not some scientific facility at the lab or a stockpile of some special nuclear material. The most important national security asset at Los Alamos are the people who work there. It is their brains, their special expertise, and their detailed knowledge of nuclear security issues that won the Cold War. Without the continuance of this human resource, the long-term future of our nuclear deterrent will be in jeopardy, and we may find ourselves prone to unpleasant surprises in a world where nuclear proliferation is still an important threat. 
   If we do not act quickly to help the scientists and engineers at Los Alamos rebuild their lives there, some of them may take their insurance money and go to rebuild their lives in other places where they can find high-tech employment. That would be a terrible loss to this country's national security. I believe that we have to especially worry about two populations at the laboratory who may find it hardest to rebuild there--the young scientists and engineers who have recently been hired at the lab, and the scientists and engineers who are nearing retirement. 
   The young scientist or engineer who has been at the laboratory for only a few years has many other professional options in today's high-tech economy. 
   For most of them, working at Los Alamos pays considerably less than working for the private sector. Many of these individuals may not be fully insured for their potential losses. If we face these younger investigators with a prolonged stay in temporary housing a substantial distance from the laboratory, or if we ignore their uninsured losses, they may wonder about our long-term commitment to their careers supporting the nuclear security of this country. Already, there have been concerns that the recent attrition rate for these investigators has been higher than the historical average. 
   Another population at risk for loss to the lab is typified by the senior scientist or engineer who is close to retirement. It is hard for these individuals to start all over again, when they face the prospect of a potential second starting-over when they retire in a few years. These individuals are particularly needed over the next 4 to 5 years. That is the time period during which we will have to make the transition from a laboratory workforce with substantial experience in designing and conducting underground nuclear tests to a workforce that will have to maintain our nuclear stockpile without nuclear tests. According to an analysis carried out last year for my staff, much of the workforce at Los Alamos with substantial experience at the Nevada Test Site testing the primary components of nuclear weapons is aged 56 or older. The lab has an aggressive plan to capture and formalize their expertise in computer models over the next 4 to 5 years. We need to validate the computer codes that will be used in the long-term to certify the nuclear  weapons stockpile before these weapons designers with direct test experience retire. 
   As far back as 1955, laws like the Atomic Energy Communities Act stated that the continued morale of nuclear defense laboratory personnel ``is essential to the common defense and security of the United States,'' and that the federal government needed to maintain conditions in these communities ``which will not impede the recruitment and retention of personnel essential to the atomic energy program,'' as the nuclear weapons program was then called. These principles are still true today. They indicate that we quickly move to restore the homes, the community facilities, and the physical infrastructure of the communities around the laboratory. 
   In addition to the workers at Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Cerro Grande fire is also threatening some of the most economically vulnerable citizens of northern New Mexico. These are the rural residents and the Native Americans who depend critically on the land that is being burned and its resources for their livelihood. I am particularly concerned about the residents of the Santa Clara Pueblo Indian Reservation, who face the loss of their natural water supply and of numerous sacred and historic sites as the fire progresses. Native American firefighters have been at the forefront of battling this blaze, and have been unstinting in their time and efforts to protect the federal government's property and that of their neighbors. We need to make sure that they are not forgotten in any restitution and recovery plan. 
   The Cerro Grande fire is one of several major fire disasters now facing the State of New Mexico. 
   Down in Otero County, New Mexico, near the town of Cloudcroft, the Scott Able fire in the Lincoln National Forest has burned over 21,000 acres. The fire was started last Thursday by a downed power line and is still not contained. 
   In Otero and Lincoln Counties, the Cree Fire, which started May 7 from a campfire, has burned over 8,700 acres. It has cost over $1.7 million to fight this fire to date. 
   Up north in Mora and San Miguel Counties, the Manuelitas Fire in the Santa Fe National Forest, which also started last Thursday from an unknown cause, has burned approximately 1,400 acres. And yesterday, another fire broke out and closed a five-mile portion of Interstate 25 near Pecos, New Mexico. 
   We need to make sure that we provide the persons and communities who have been damaged by these fires emergency relief and, where appropriate, compensation, as well. 
   All of these fires, taken together, illustrate the broader danger that States like New Mexico face in this severe fire season from areas of our national forests and public lands that are very close to towns, but in need of management of their vegetation to remove or reduce the dangers of wildfire and to improve the health of the forests. The Forest Service has asked for funds for the past few years to support such activities. This kind of funding would reduce the risk to human life and property while providing a source of local jobs in the rural West. As part of the upcoming emergency appropriations, we need to make sure that we not only provide extra funds for fire fighting, but also for the type of vegetation management, including thinning the forests of certain small-diameter trees, that will help prevent catastrophic fires near cities and towns in the West that are bordered by public forests. 
   I hope that all my colleagues here in the Senate will join me in making sure that the destruction caused by this fire is quickly remedied, and that the funds are rapidly made available to help prevent more repeats of that destruction this spring and summer out West. 
   Mr. President, to reiterate, it is clear now, and acknowledged by the Park Service and by the Secretary of the Interior, that the fire was started by the Park Service on May 4 --well over a week ago--and was set as a so-called controlled burn, which got out of control. 
   This is, unfortunately, not the only instance we know of right at this current time where we have fires out of control which started as controlled burns. So we have a serious problem here. 
   Let me show you a couple of these photos that have been in the newspapers in New Mexico and in some of the national newspapers to show what we are talking about. 
   As you can see from this photo, this is the smoke plume from the fire. From the photo, you can see the red. This is Los Alamos. This is the State of New Mexico. This is the State of Colorado above, and then Texas and Oklahoma. 
   You can see this smoke plume extending to the east out of Los Alamos and out of New Mexico into Texas, into Oklahoma, and into Colorado. That gives you some sense of the size of this conflagration we have been trying to put out as a result of this so-called controlled burn. 
   I have one or two other photos which I also would like to show, just to give you an idea. This is a picture of the perimeter. Last night the perimeter of this fire was 85 miles. The fire has now destroyed something over 44,000 acres. This photo shows the largest of the fires. 
   As Senator DOMENICI has said, we have other fires going on in our State. Those have also been devastating for those communities. 
   Let me just mention those and indicate that we hope that whatever we do here will also provide relief for those communities as well. 
   The Cerro Grande fire is the largest in our State. But in Otero County, near Cloudcroft, we have the Scott Able fire which has burned over 21,000 acres. The fire started last Thursday by a downed power line. 
   In Otero and Lincoln Counties, the Cree fire was started May 7 from a camp fire. It has burned nearly 9,000 acres. 
   Up in Mora and San Miguel Counties, we have another fire that was started last Thursday that has burned approximately 1,400 acres. 
   We have serious human tragedies resulting from each of these fires. We hope we can get it all addressed. 
   The particular thing about this large Cerro Grande fire at Los Alamos, as Senator DOMENICI pointed out, is it was started by the Government. The laws we have passed, as I understand them, providing for Federal assistance in the case of disasters, do not contemplate a circumstance where the disaster was caused by Government action. They are generally disaster relief proposals and resources made available through those statutes, because the Government is stepping in to try to assist where there has been a hurricane or there has been an earthquake or there has been a flood or there has been a fire. Here we have all of that, but we also have the extra overlay and responsibility that I think comes with the fact that the Government set the fire. 
   Los Alamos National Laboratory was spared major destruction. That is a very important fact. It was not spared totally. There have been some damages. I hope we can see to it that those damages 
   are repaired. But fortunately for the country, as well as for our State and the community of Los Alamos, the major facilities of the laboratories were not burned. 
   I do think this fire, though, reminds us of our national security assets located in Los Alamos. They are not just the facilities, and they are not just the nuclear material or equipment that has been developed there over many decades; the main asset we have there with a national security significance to it is the scientists and engineers and other people who work at that facility. 
   For that reason, it is absolutely essential we step up, as Senator DOMENICI said, to make these people whole, do what can be done by way of resources at this point, to help them rebuild, help them get through this period of turmoil, and get back to work on our very important national security needs. 
   We have various distinctions in our State. One that I have always enjoyed is that we have more Ph.D.'s per capita in New Mexico than any other State in the Union. People say, well, that is an unusual statistic. It is a statistic which relates directly to the Los Alamos National Laboratory and to the Sandia National Laboratory. 
   We have many extremely well-trained, well-qualified people working there. These are people who have alternative careers they can pursue; these are not people who need employment there. They could go to any of a number of private firms and be compensated, probably substantially better  than we are compensating them to do this very important national security work. 
   We need to keep those people at our laboratory. We particularly need to keep those people, the young ones who have come in recently and those who are near retirement but who have very valuable information and very valuable expertise, in our nuclear-weapons-related work. 
   I know there is an aggressive plan that the Department of Energy and the Los Alamos National Laboratory have developed for the next 4 to 5 years to try to capture some of that expertise and ensure that we retain that before some of these people retire. 
   We cannot allow this fire and this disruption of activity in the laboratory and in the community of Los Alamos to interfere with our ability to keep that expertise at that laboratory. So that is an important reason why this needs to be done quickly, why we need to move aggressively to deal with this. 
   Let me also mention the other populations in our State that have been very adversely affected by the fire. One, of course, is the Santa Clara Pueblo. If the fire continues--and it has already consumed some 10 percent of their reservation--it continues to threaten that pueblo and the livelihoods of many of those people. We need to see to it that whatever we are able to do benefits them and helps them to recover from the devastating effects of this fire, as well as other individuals in Rio Arriba County, Santa Fe County, and the community of Espanola. 
   All of those factors need to be taken into account. There is a long list of needs that people will have and a long list of damages that people in the communities involved and the businesses involved will have suffered. I need to just say that, to my mind, we need to step up and accept responsibility. We, the Federal Government, we, the country, need to step up and accept responsibility for making those people whole. 
   These natural disasters can result in extended litigation and efforts by people to try to get compensated. We hope that can be avoided to the extent possible in this case, because we hope that we can get a sufficiently effective and coordinated and rapid response from the Federal Government to allow that to happen. So I hope very much that all of this occurs. 
   Mr. President, on behalf of Senator LEVIN, I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks of Senator BIDEN, Senator LEVIN be recognized for up to 30 minutes.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in my absence I would like to submit this statement for the RECORD. As you know, I make every effort not to miss votes in the Senate, and would not do so but for the fact that there is currently a massive wildfire that is raging out of control in my state. At this time a substantial number of homes have been destroyed or damaged, with more surely to follow. And there is no end in sight. Thousands of New Mexicans have had to leave their homes in Los Alamos and White Rock, and if the conditions stay the same there, many more will be leaving in other communities. This is a uniquely catastrophic situation, and I apologize for not being able to cast my vote.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to give my perspective on this upcoming vote to override the President's veto. 
   The question before the Senate is not whether the Senate supports the construction of a nuclear waste repository. Clearly, I support construction of a nuclear waste repository. The President has indicated he does. The Department of Energy has made significant progress on a repository in the time this administration has been in office. In fact, the Department of Energy has made much more progress in the past 7 years under President Clinton than during the preceding 10 years under Presidents Reagan and Bush. 
   The President, according to the statement he issued, is ``committed to resolving the ..... issue in a timely and sensible manner consistent with sound science and protection of public health, safety, and the environment.'' 
   This bill was not vetoed by the President because he does not want to solve  the nuclear waste problem. He vetoed it because, as he stated in his veto message, this bill ``will do nothing to advance'' the program. That is a quote out of the statement that was issued. And secondly, instead of doing something to advance the program, the bill will be ``a step backward.'' 
   What are the problems that face the nuclear waste program today? Let me go through those problems with a little bit of detail so we all understand what those problems are and we can assess whether or not there is anything in this bill that helps us address that. 
   First, burying tens of thousands of tons of highly 
   radioactive waste in Yucca Mountain and making sure it does not escape for tens of thousands of years--that is the goal we set for ourselves--raises very difficult scientific and technical questions. 
   Only last month, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, which Congress created to advise us on these matters, warned that ``a credible technical basis does not exist for the repository design.'' This is the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. This is a group that Congress established. This is not some left-wing environmental organization that made this statement. 
   That report also went on to say, ``large uncertainties'' still exist in how the Yucca Mountain site will behave, and ``much work remains to be completed.'' That is an exact quote from that review board. 
   The bill before us does nothing to advance the scientific program that is trying to resolve these issues. Instead, the bill will make it harder for the Department of Energy to resolve these issues by imposing substantial new requirements which will divert the limited resources they have away from the essential scientific work that needs to be done. 
   A second problem facing the program is public confidence. People need to know that the repository will be safe and will not leak radiation into their water supply now or long into the future. Again, the bill will do nothing to advance public confidence in the repository's safety. Instead, it will undermine that public confidence. Under current law, the repository must meet radiation standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency to protect public health and the environment. 
   The bill on which we are now voting to override a Presidential veto forbids the Environmental Protection Agency from issuing those standards until this administration leaves office. The proponents of the provision are plainly hoping Governor Bush will be elected President and that his administration will adopt more lax standards than the Clinton administration would adopt. Such a blatant attempt to manipulate the scientific review process is sure to undermine public confidence in the ultimate site suitability determination. 
   A third problem facing the program is that it is behind schedule. Again, the bill does nothing to accelerate the program. On the contrary, the bill will delay the program further by forbidding the Environmental Protection Agency from issuing its radiation protection standards before June of 2001. 
   Under current law, EPA will issue the standards this summer, in plenty of time for the Secretary of Energy to take the standards into account in determining whether Yucca Mountain is suitable in 2001. But by delaying the issuance of the standards by nearly one year, the bill is likely to delay the Secretary's suitability determination and his recommendation that the repository be built. 
   A fourth problem facing the program is that the Department of Energy has not been able to begin moving waste from the States where it is now stored to Yucca Mountain. Again, the bill does nothing to begin moving waste to Yucca Mountain or to accelerate the date at which shipments can begin. On the contrary, the bill will probably obstruct shipments of waste by imposing a host of new obstacles to such shipments. 
   The bill says no shipment can be made until the Secretary 
   of Energy has determined that emergency responders in every State, every local community, and every tribal jurisdiction, along every primary and every alternative shipping route, have met certain training standards and until the Secretary has given all of those entities financial assistance for 3 years before the first shipment. That is what the bill provides. 
   The transportation provisions of the bill are far more restrictive than those for shipments to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in my State. They are an open invitation to opponents of the nuclear waste program to obstruct shipments to the repository. I think we are all familiar with the availability of the courts to assist in that obstruction, where we put unreasonable restrictions on the Department of Energy, as we have done in the case of transportation to the site. 
   A fifth problem facing the program--this is the nuclear waste repository program--is the claims against the Government for failing to accept the utilities' waste by the original deadline. The bill permits the Department of Energy to settle these claims by paying the utilities compensation out of the nuclear waste fund--which the utilities said they did not want. 
   This bill does not permit the Department of Energy to take title to the utilities' waste at the utilities' sites, which is the one near-term solution that was sought by the administration when we went into this debate. In fact, that provision was in the bill when we reported it out of the committee, which I think was a step forward. 
   Moreover, the bill creates new unfunded liabilities for the Government. It does so by imposing new deadlines that the Department of Energy cannot meet and imposing substantial new requirements without providing funding mechanisms to meet those obligations. 
   A sixth major problem facing the program is inadequate funding. Our current budget rules make it impossible to give the program the money it requires, even though the fees the utilities pay the Government far exceed what Congress appropriates to the program each year, and the nuclear waste fund has a $9 billion surplus in it. Yet, at the same time, the bill imposes substantial new unfunded spending requirements. So we are setting up and maintaining a prohibition against spending the money at the same time we are imposing new unfunded spending requirements on the program. 
   These unfunded spending requirements are to provide relief to the utilities under the settlement agreements, to provide financial assistance for transportation planning and training, and to conduct research on alternative waste management technologies. 
   Finally, the bill does nothing to help the one utility that is actually threatened with having to shut down one of its plants because of insufficient onsite storage capacity. Here I am talking about Northern States Power's Prairie Island plant in Minnesota. Nothing in this bill forestalls the shutdown of that plant in January of 2007. 
   The bottom line is that this bill will not fix what is wrong with the nuclear waste program. On the contrary, it will make matters worse and move us further from a final solution. 
   The question before the Senate is whether the bill should pass, ``the objections of the President notwithstanding.'' That is the question for us to vote on this afternoon. 
   The President said he remains committed to solving the nuclear waste issue. The administration has made considerable progress toward that end and is close to completing the work needed for the site suitability decision next year. 
   The President says the bill does not help; it does not advance the program's goals. 
   On the contrary, in his view, it is a major step backward because it is likely to delay the site suitability determination, it undermines public confidence, and it is likely to create new unfunded liabilities for the Government--in fact, not likely, but it does create them. 
   The President's objections to the bill are well taken, and, in my view, the Senate should not pass the bill over the objections that have been raised by the President. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I come to the floor today somewhat uneasy and conflicted about this debate. I am hopeful, on the one hand, that we in the Senate can come together to provide national leadership by legislating what research has proven actually works in improving student performance. On the other hand, I stand having witnessed people from both sides of the aisle devoting a tremendous amount of time during the last year trying to figure out how to help all of the children of this country make it in today's knowledge-based economy.  
   I am somewhat dismayed that the bill we finally arrived at the floor with is not the consensus legislation we were working to achieve. Unfortunately, our efforts to achieve a consensus piece of legislation have not succeeded. We have a bill before the Senate today which is decidedly partisan. I hope that can be changed during the course of this Senate debate. 
   We need to examine this bill carefully because it is very important and not easy to comprehend. The bill gives Governors, who choose to exercise it, control of Federal education dollars and it would abandon the well-cultivated partnership and the powerful national leadership role that has been developed over several years. 
   On the surface, we see it is a very large bill. I am sure several people have held it up. It is similar to a lot of bills, almost incomprehensible in its length. It goes on for nearly 1,000 pages. It seems to be, on first reading, chock full of different programs for promising ideas such as Safe and Drug Free Schools, education technology, afterschool programs, even a rural education initiative. 
   It is the kind of assistance that individual schools and localities in New Mexico tell me they would like and need but they do not have the capacity or the resources to pursue on their own. All of my fellow committee members who worked on this legislation in committee know full well that no matter how well we collaborate on the underlying targeted programs, the two Straight A's block grants that were layered on top of the other language at the ninth hour of our deliberations make a lot of the distinctions in the bill and a lot of the programs described in the bill virtually meaningless in those States that opt to pursue that block grant. 
   The Straight A's proposal at the heart of the bill sounds catchy. However, in my view, it is an empty promise. What does it do? I think we need to step back and ask: What do we mean by the Straight A's proposal? Essentially, it allows every State to spend Federal funds as they wish for 5 years without input from school districts or educators, without accountability for increased school performance. Those who favor the block grants say they are good because they allow for more local control. In the case of Straight A's, this is factually incorrect and ironic because a school district or a school actually will lose control because the control is vested with the Governor to set the priorities for spending within the State. 
   This chart demonstrates that 95.5 percent of the Federal funds for education go to local schools and local districts. State administration takes 4 percent and the Federal administration takes one-half of 1 percent. The rest, over 95 percent, goes to the local schools. 
   Under the Straight A's proposal, a Governor who chooses to do so can change that. The discretion as to how that money is spent is no longer a Federal and a local issue; it becomes a State issue. 
   I think this would be a problem for my State of New Mexico. I know of programs I very much want to see continued. I have trouble seeing how they will be continued under this proposal. I have a list that details some of the programs, and I will go through specific amounts. 
   In contrast to this Straight A's State block grant proposal, which is in the bill we are now considering, the alternative, which we have prepared and we are going to offer on the Democratic side, is not just to throw large sums of money to the States but, instead, to target Federal dollars to the communities with the greatest need and to give them true local control by leaving it to them and not the Governor or Secretary of Education to decide how to set up programs to meet those needs we have identified in those local communities. 
   Let me remind you, it was exactly because the States and the localities were not effectively addressing the needs of students in disadvantaged areas that the Federal Government first stepped in to provide targeted aid through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. And, in subsequent Federal programs, we have followed this same principle. We have focused on areas of national priority, areas such as education technology and improving professionalism in the classroom. These are areas that otherwise would not be funded because of limited resources and that historically have not been funded at adequate levels. 
   Let me show one other chart that I think makes this point. When you look at Federal funds, Federal funds are significantly more targeted to low-income children than are State funds. I think no one disputes this. This is a General Accounting Office study in January 1998. It says:  
   For every dollar provided for all children, $4.73 is given from Federal funds to low-income children, whereas 62 cents of local money actually goes to low-income children.  
   So the Federal Government got into the business of providing assistance to education in order to deal with deficiencies which clearly existed nationwide and to deal with inadequacies that were clearly agreed upon. This is what we are getting away from if we wind up adopting the bill which has been presented to us on the floor today. 
   The Straight A's proposal not only does nothing to ensure the most needy children are protected; it allows Federal dollars to flow out of the public school system in the form of vouchers to private schools. I know that is another debate, but unfortunately it has been brought into this debate about this Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Incorporated into this is authority for a State to take its Federal funds and disburse those in a voucher program to the nonpublic schools as well as the public schools. I think that would be a mistake. I think it would be a mistake in my State. We are short of resources. The Federal funds that come in to help the public schools in New Mexico are very important to those public schools and we do not want to see those funds decreased by virtue of some voucher program, which our Governor today, in all due respect, strongly favors. It has been a major subject of dispute in my State between the Governor and a majority of our legislature. 
   Another feature the proponents of the block grant approach in this bill often talk about is providing greater accountability. In the case of this Straight A's proposal, the only accountability you will find is that States which fail to make progress will lose a year of eligibility. It is similar to benching your star player for one semester for flunking a class but bringing him back once he gets his average back up to a D. That is an analogous situation. There is no real accountability in the bill as it comes before us. 
   Under S. 2, as it now stands, at the extreme--and I don't think this will be done, but clearly there have been examples in the past when we had block grants permitted--you could have States deciding to use Federal dollars to buy swimming pools, to recarpet offices. The State could choose maintaining the status quo as its goal over the 5 years. 
   A less malevolent picture, and one that probably is more likely, is that a Governor would receive pressure from a handful 
   of constituent groups to persuade him or her to pour all of the block-granted Federal funds into something such as an intensive literacy program or a voucher program to send kids to private schools. This will sound good, but the problem is you will find it means there are no longer funds for migrant and homeless children to receive targeted aid; there is no longer money to provide for professional development for teachers so in some classrooms the computer can be used effectively; there is no longer money for afterschool programs; no longer money to hire new teachers. At the end of the day, as long as the wealthier and higher performing schools in the State can do well enough to offset stagnation or even decline in progress at the poorer and lower performing schools, then the Governor would be able to claim he has done his job under the Straight A's proposal. 
   If he did not do the job, if the goal was not met, then no matter; he would probably be out of office at any rate before the 5-year experiment was over. If he is not, the only consequence is that he simply would go back to the status quo we have today. So this Straight A's proposal contains no significant accountability. 
   I have an amendment I intend to offer on the issue of accountability. It will try to correct this. It does so by putting some key provisions in the legislation that would provide resources  to States for turning around those schools that are failing. It would demand results of all students so as to eradicate existing achievement gaps between minority and nonminority students, between poor and non-poor students, between English-speaking students and those who do not speak English as a first language. 
   It would provide significant consequences for poor performance, so States and districts have to take responsibility for actually correcting the deficiencies in the failing schools. It would require a single system of accountability for all schools in the State and would limit the availability of flexibility options when a system of accountability is not yet in place. 
   The amendment also would ensure that every class would have a qualified teacher. It would do that by requiring States which receive Federal funds to make that a priority, to ensure that resources are provided and school plans incorporate high-quality, research-based professional development for their instructional staff. 
   There will be a chance to debate this particular accountability amendment as we go forward. I hope very much it can be adopted. It would correct many of the deficiencies in the legislation on which I am focused today. But, in addition, as we debate this education bill, I intend to bring attention to some other elements that I do not think are adequately addressed in the bill. I want to remind the Senate of the importance of teacher training in technology. It simply is not good enough that only 20 percent of current teachers are comfortable integrating technology into the subjects they teach or that we currently invest less than a third of what the experts tell us we should spend on technology training for people going into teaching. We need to deal with that. I will be offering an amendment to do that. 
   Also, in response to concerns from school districts, and also a General Accounting Office study that demonstrates there is still a high level of paperwork burden on schools and 
   districts from States and from environmental and nutritional regulations, I urge a close examination. I have an amendment to do so, to urge a close examination of all of those requirements to try to determine how we can achieve those goals without unduly burdening the schools. 
   Today and throughout the discussion of this bill this week, and I believe next week as well, I intend to propose some amendments. I hope the Senate will think hard about what it is doing here. This is extremely important legislation. 
   I acknowledge there are some philosophical differences on the appropriate Federal role in public education. I must call attention to the great shift in attitudes in the Senate since I came here 18 years ago on the proper role of the Federal Government in education. I am very heartened that we are here today with all sides of the debate arguing in favor of a major Federal role and disagreeing about what it should be. I can remember many other debates on the Senate floor where the argument was that the Federal Government should get out of the education field, that we should disband the Department of Education, we should, essentially, shift those funds over to the Department of Defense and be done with it. So we have made progress in our debate in the Senate. But we clearly have not made enough or we would not have this Straight A's proposal in front of us today. 
   Today the Federal Government's contribution to education spending is roughly 7 cents on the dollar. Yet through an understanding that there is, indeed, a national priority, in the 35 years of the partnership there have been significant improvements. That 7 cents on the dollar has been focused on needs we all agreed needed attention. I believe we can strengthen those programs that work, we can reform those that do not work, and there are some which are not working as well as they should. But we need to keep our eye on the ball and continue to target the Federal funds, the scarce Federal dollars that we have to put into education, on the students and the schools that need them the most. 
   We need to rise to the occasion. We need to enact a bill that will help further the goals of education. We need to come together in the Senate and not let partisan differences and the upcoming election divide us in this very important set of issues. 
   There is no more important legislation that will come before Congress this year. I hope very much we can come together on some reasonable changes in this bill so it becomes acceptable and we can send it to the President in a form he will sign. 
   I want to mention several more items. In my home State of New Mexico, we receive over $1 million for migrant education, we receive $10.4 million targeted for class-size reduction, we receive $2.5 million for professional development, and we receive nearly $3.5 million for the technology literacy challenge fund. Those are important programs. Those are programs upon which the school districts in my State have come to depend. I do not want to see the funds for those programs eliminated. I do not want to see a blank check go to the State with discretion vested in the Governor to either continue or discontinue those programs as he sees fit. 
   I believe it is important we amend this bill in significant ways. I will be joining with my colleagues in offering some of those amendments. I hope very much they will be adopted. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, before I discuss my position on Senate Joint Resolution 3, the crime victims rights constitutional amendment, I would like to briefly talk about my views on amending the Constitution. 
   A recent letter each of use received from our colleagues Senator BYRD  and Senator LEAHY provides some of the history of our Constitution and efforts to amend it. 
   They note that, since its ratification, over 11,000 amendments have been proposed to the Constitution. In the last month alone, the Senate has voted on three constitutional amendments. However, while thousands of amendments have been proposed, only 27 amendments have been adopted. Of those, the first 10, the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791. Therefore, since ratification some 200 years ago, we have generally heeded the caution of James Madison, one of the architects of the Constitution, that amendments to the Constitution should be reserved for ``certain great and extraordinary occasions''. In other words, amending the Constitution should not be done in response to what is politically popular at the moment or because of passions of the moment. If it was, I'm afraid many of those 11,000 amendments would now clutter our Constitution and undermine the very foundation of the freedoms and liberties it gives each of us. 
   Mr. President, the victims of violent crime are a compelling group of Americans and deserve our supports and our attentions. Nothing is more devastating to a family than loosing a loved one through a senseless, random act of violence. Nothing is more devastating to a community than the kind of violence we see in our schools and on our streets almost daily. Yet it is only in the past few years, perhaps 15 or 20, that our laws and lawmakers have begun to focus on the group of people we now refer to as ``crime victims''. 
   During those years, however, the states have not ignored the legitimate calls of crime victims and their families for more protection and more participation in the criminal justice process. Thirty-three states, including my own, have passed either crime victims rights amendments to their constitution or statutes intended to provide many of the same rights contained in S.J. Res. 3. 
   In New Mexico, the voters passed a constitutional amendment in 1992 that is very similar to S.J. Res. 3 and the legislature subsequently passed enabling legislation. This, I think is appropriate and I am glad that New Mexico recognizes the rights of crime victims to more fully participate in the criminal justice system. In fact, it is particularly appropriate that the states have acted in this area because the states are responsible for approximately 99 percent of the criminal prosecutions in this country. 
   From many indications, these amendments and statutes have worked. Not perfectly perhaps, but they have at least begun to bring victims of violent 
   crime into the judicial process in a meaningful way. 
   Because New Mexico has acted to protect the rights of crime victims, district attorneys who I've spoken with often ask why we need to amend the United States Constitution when New Mexico has already addressed this issue? That, Mr. President, is an extremely important question to ask ourselves before we vote on S.J. Res. 3. 
   Mr. President, the Constitution provides a process for amendment when ``both Houses deem it necessary .....'' Today I would argue that only when absolutely necessary or, in the words of Madison, for great and extraordinary occasions, should we vote to amend the Constitution. I would also argue that, where doubt exists as to the absolute necessity of the occasion, the Senate should defer on amending that document. 
   While I support the participation of crime victims in our judicial process Mr. President, and support the efforts of New Mexico and other states to give those rights to crime victims, I simply do find the evidence of a great occasion or compelling need to amend the Constitution in the arguments made by the sponsors of the amendment and therefore will vote no on S.J. Res. 3. 
   As others have pointed out, S.J. Res. 3 is almost as long as the entire Bill of  Rights. It reads like a statute and not a constitutional amendment. This is significant and more than simply a matter of form. Part of the reason why our Constitution and republican form of government have survived largely intact for over 200 years while virtually every other in the world has undergone radical, revolutionary change is the wisdom of the drafters in setting out clear principles and a coherent system to ensure the liberties that the Constitution guarantees. However, as I read the amendment before us today, I do not see the clarity or the simplicity of principle that I see in the Bill of Rights or the other amendments we've adopted. Because this amendment lacks clarity, I am concerned about the litigation this amendment could potentially spawn and the additional costs to an already overburdened legal system. Litigation over who is a ``victim'' alone would likely fill volumes. 
   Mr. President, one of the biggest concerns with this amendment is that, because of its vagueness, it will inevitably lead to a result which I think none of us, even the proponents, want, the diminishing of the 
    rights of the accused. 
   No where in the amendment does it guarantee that it will not be construed to interfere with the rights of the accused. I understand that an amendment was offered in the Judiciary Committee that would have made that clear but was rejected. That to me is very troubling because, as important as the rights of victims are, we absolutely have to keep in mind that the rights of the accused must be paramount. That is because it is the accused that stands to lose life and liberty at the hands of the government. This is a bedrock principle of our judicial system, without argument the best system in the world, and we must not diminish that principle even in the name of a good cause. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I am concerned by the lack of case law to support the arguments of the proponents of S.J. Res. 3. As I understand it, the proponents are unable to point to any cases in which victims' rights laws or State constitutional amendments were not given effect because of defendants' rights in the Federal Constitution. Nor, as the committee report noted, is there any case law where a defendant's conviction was reversed because of victims' rights legislation or a State constitutional amendment. Why then are we amending the Constitution when there is no body of law that justifies the extraordinary step of amending the U.S. Constitution? This is very different from the situation we were in a few weeks ago when the Senate voted on an amendment to the Constitution on the issue of the desecration of the flag on campaign finance limits. In both of those instances, at least we had a final determination by the Supreme Court with which we could take exception. Without such a body of law I do not find the arguments in favor of a Federal constitutional amendment compelling. 
   Mr. President, I strongly support the right of victims of violent crime to be included in the criminal justice system in a meaningful way. I think it helps bring closure to the inured victims and provides an important balance to a system that admittedly has not always been sympathetic to the rights of victims. I would support additional funding and resources for victims rights programs and to properly train the judiciary in the need to be sensitive to the rights of crime victims. However, before we take the drastic and, for all intents and purposes, irreversible step of 
   amending our Constitution for only the 28th time in our history, I believe we must be absolutely certain that we have exhausted all other avenues. As the National Clearinghouse for the Defense of Battered Women argues:  
   The Federal constitution is the wrong place to try to ``fix'' the complex problems facing victims of crime, statutory alternatives and state remedies are more suitable. Our Nation's constitution should not be amended unless there is compelling need to do so and there are no remedies available at the state level. Instead of altering the U.S. Constitution, we urge policy makers to consider statutory alternatives and statewide initiatives that would include the enforcement of already existing statutes, and practices that can truly assist victims of crimes, as well as increased direct services to victims.  
   Mr. President, I believe we should give the states additional time to implement their victims rights amendments and statutes. Change occurs slowly, but I am convinced that real change for the victims of crime will be addressed more effectively by the states and that the federal government should not impose a one-size-fits-all, the federal government knows best, solution on the states. Additionally, if we determine that action at the federal level is absolutely necessary, I believe we should try to fashion a legislative solution before we amend the Constitution. I believe that we can do that and provide meaningful rights to victims of crime. 
   If, failing that, we find that victims are still not being afforded reasonable and real participation in the criminal justice system, then perhaps only a constitutional amendment will work but I am not convinced that we have done all that we can do short of that. 
   Mr. President, good intentions do not necessarily produce good results. The intentions of the supporters of S.J. Res. 3 are certainly good and just and I share those intentions, as well as their belief that we should be doing more for the victims of violent crime. However, I do not believe that this amendment will produce good results and may actually harm those it is intended to help and for that reason, I will vote against S.J. Res. 3.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Robert Kern, a longtime professor at the University of New Mexico where he is head of the European section of the history department. With a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, Dr. Kern's studies, teachings, and writings are centered on Iberian history, and the history of labor in various societies. In nearly 35 years of teaching at UNM, he has earned a well-deserved reputation as a thoughtful professor and a distinguished writer. 
   Believing that teaching is just about the noblest profession anyone can undertake, and coming from a family of teachers myself, I admire more than I can say what Professor Kern has done in this career. As a father, I admire more than I can say the fine job he did raising his sons, one of whom, Josh, worked on my staff for several years. The love, care, and attention Robert Kern gave his boys is reflected in their own lives and I suspect that of all of his achievements in a life well-lived, they are his pride and joy.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important legislation, recognizing the heroic contributions of a group of Native American soldiers who served in the Pacific theater during the second World War. This legislation will authorize the President of the United States to award a gold medal, on behalf of the Congress, to each of the original twenty-nine Navajo Code Talkers, as well as a silver medal to each man who later qualified as a Navajo Code Talker (MOS 642). These medals are to express recognition by the United States of America and its citizens of the Navajo Code Talkers who distinguished themselves in performing a unique, highly successful communications operation that greatly assisted in saving countless lives and in hastening the end of the war in the Pacific. 
   It has taken too long to properly recognize these soldiers, whose achievements have been obscured by twin veils  of secrecy and time. As they approach the final chapter of their lives, it is only fitting that the nation pay them this honor. That's why I am introducing this legislation today--to salute these brave and innovative Native Americans, to acknowledge the great contribution they made to the Nation at a time of war, and to finally give them their rightful place in history. 
   With each new successive generation of Americans, blessed as we are in this time of relative peace and prosperity, it is easy to forget what the world was like in the early 1940's. The United States was at war in Europe, and on December 7, 1941, we were faced with a second front as the Japanese Empire attacked Pearl Harbor. 
   One of the intelligence weapons the Japanese possessed was an elite group of well-trained English speaking soldiers, used to intercept U.S. communications, then sabotage the message or issue false commands to ambush American troops. Military code became more and more complex--at Guadalcanal, military leaders complained that it took 2 1/2 hours to send and decode a single message. 
   The idea to use Navajo for secure communications came from Philip Johnson. Johnson was the son of a missionary, raised on the Navajo reservation, and one of the few non-Navajos who spoke their language fluently. But he was also a World War I veteran, and knew of the military's search for a code that would withstand all attempts to decipher it. Johnson believed Navajo answered the military requirement for an undecipherable code because Navajo is an unwritten language of extreme complexity. In early 1942, he met with the Commanding General of Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet, and his staff to convince them of the value of the Navajo language as code. In one of his tests, he demonstrated that Navajos could encode, transmit, and decode a three-line English message in 20 seconds. Twenty-seconds! 
   Convinced, the Marine Corps called upon the Navajo Nation to support the military effort by recruiting and enlisting Navajo men to serve as Marine Corps Radio Operators. These Navajo Marines, who became known as the Navajo Code Talkers, used the Navajo language to develop a unique code to communicate military messages in the South Pacific. True to Phillip Johnson's prediction, and the enemy's frustration, the code developed by these Native Americans proved unbreakable and was used throughout the Pacific theater. 
   Their accomplishment was even more heroic given the cultural context in which they were operating: 
   The Navajos were second-class citizens and were discouraged from using their own language; and 
   They were living on reservations, as many still are today, yet they volunteered to serve, protect, and defend the very power that put them there. 
   But the Navajo, a people subjected to alienation in their own homeland, who had been discouraged from speaking their own language, stepped forward and developed the most significant and successful military code of the time: 
   This Code was so successful that military commanders credited the Code in saving the lives of countless American soldiers and the successful engagements of the U.S. in the battles of Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Saipan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. At Iwo Jima, Major Howard Connor, 5th Marine Division signal officer, declared, ``Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima.'' Major Connor had six Navajo code talkers working around the clock during the first 48-hours of the battle. Those six sent and received over 800 messages, all without error; 
   This Code was so successful that some Code Talkers were guarded by fellow marines whose role was to kill them in case of imminent capture by the enemy; and finally, 
   It was so successful that the Department of Defense kept the Code secret for 23 years after the end of World War II, when it was finally declassified. 
   And there, Mr. President, is the foundation of the problem. 
   If their achievements had been hailed at the conclusion of the war, proper honors would have been bestowed at that time. But the Code Talkers were sworn to secrecy, an oath they kept and honored, but at the same time, one that robbed them of the very accolades and place in history they so rightly deserved. Their ranks include veterans of Guadalcanal, Saipan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa; they gave their lives at New Britain, Bougainville, Guam, and Peleliu. But, while the bodies of their fallen comrades came home, simple messages of comfort from those still fighting to relatives back home on the reservations were prohibited by the very secrecy of the code's origin. And at the end of the war, these unsung heroes returned to their homes on buses--no parades, no fanfare, no special recognition for what they had truly accomplished--because while the war was over, their duty--their oath of secrecy--continued. The secrecy surrounding the code was maintained until it was declassified in 1968--only then did a realization of the sacrifice and valor of these brave Native Americans emerge from history. 
   For the countless lives they helped save, for this contribution that helped speed the Allied victory in the Pacific, I believe they succeeded beyond all expectations. 
   Through the enactment of this bill, the recognition for the Navajo Code Talkers will be delayed no longer, and they will finally take their place in history they so rightly deserve. 
   To this end, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the Senate passed S. 711, calendar No. 235, a bill to allow for the investment of joint Federal and State funds from the civil settlement of damages from the Exxon Valdez oil spill, on November 19 last year, in the last hours of the First Session. 
   The bill states that moneys in the settlement fund are eligible for the new investment authority so long as they are allocated in a manner identified in the bill. Specifically, S. 711 provides that $55 million of the funds remaining on October 1, 2002 shall be allocated for habitat protection programs. 
   The accompanying report, S. Rept. 106-124, contains a provision in the section-by-section analysis, subsection 1(e), stating that, with respect to the $55 million for habitat protection programs, ``[a]dditionally, any funds needed for the administration of the Trust will also be deducted from these monies.'' I was surprised to see this provision in the report because I do not believe that it reflects the committee's intent with respect to the bill.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, this week marks the tenth anniversary of the International Arms Control Conference hosted by Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I extend my congratulations to Dr. Paul Robinson, Director of Sandia Laboratory for his support for this unique international conference that draws hundreds of technical and policy experts from all over the world each year. 
   It is particularly important at this time in history to recognize this Conference here in the Senate. The conclusion of the Cold War has offered the United States and the nations of the world an historic opportunity to increase security in the international system through seeking cooperative measures that would establish international standards of behavior useful for improving global security. When the Senate voted to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention in 1997, I am pleased to say, this nation acted in a committed and positive way to capitalize on the opportunity we have been afforded. 
   Events in the past two years, however, have brought America to a crossroads with respect to the future of arms control. The Senate recently voted to reject the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a treaty signed by 155 countries, that would have established an international standard permanently banning the testing of nuclear weapons in order to combat the spread of nuclear weapons. I deeply regret that vote by the Senate, Mr. President, and am committed to find a way to achieve the goal for which that treaty was negotiated. 
   Meanwhile, the Russian Duma continues its on again off again consideration of the START II Treaty to reduce the number of strategic weapons in our respective arsenals of nuclear weapons. To date, they have taken no action. Each time a vote in the Duma approaches, an event occurs that postpones its consideration of this important treaty that would reduce the nuclear threat between Russia and the United States and, indeed, to the world as a whole. 
   Many Russian officials have observed that no further progress in reducing nuclear arsenals is possible if the United States chooses to abrogate the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty which restricts the ability of the United States and Russia to deploy national missile defense systems. Many experts and public officials in the U.S., however, have concluded that the missile threat from rogue governments is sufficiently real that the U.S. should move forward on deploying a missile defense regardless of its impact on strategic relations between Russia and the United States. The President, however, in signing the National Missile Defense Act, indicated that before deciding to deploy a national missile defense system, he would assess the potential impact of such a decision on arms control regimes that support our national security. The nation awaits a decision that could occur this summer. 
   While this critical decision lies ahead, U.S. negotiators have been meeting with their Russian counterparts to explore a potential agreement that could permit the U.S. to modify the ABM Treaty in a way that would not threaten the strategic balance between the two countries. The outcome of those negotiations is far from certain. The issues that are involved are complex, and extend beyond the dyadic relations between the United States and Russia. Other nuclear powers, notably China, are watching those negotiations very closely to determine appropriate policy directions regarding their own nuclear strategy and arsenal. 
   As the U.S. and Russia examine the thorny, complex issues involving the relationship between offensive and defensive strategic arms, and nations of the world consider the Senate's vote against the CTBT, the world nevertheless remains committed to preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons through the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). That Treaty, ratified by 187 countries, recently celebrated its 30th anniversary. In 1995, the states parties to that treaty voted to extend its provisions indefinitely. Later this month, the Sixth Nonproliferation Treaty Review Conference will take place in New York. Given the events in South Asia during the past year, and the vote on CTBT in the Senate this winter, the Review Conference will be a very important convocation at which all states parties, including the U.S., will be called on to reaffirm their commitment to the provisions of the NPT. 
   Given these current conditions in the international environment, it is indeed timely and vital that efforts such as the International Arms Control Conference hosted by Sandia Laboratory take place. The meetings and dialogues that occur at this Conference have provided important understanding among the international community on major arms control issues and I am confident will continue to do so as long as the world seeks to improve security through cooperation. 
   I salute Sandia, and in particular, Dr. Jim Brown, who founded the Conference ten years ago and has faithfully served as its organizer and driving force during the past decade. If the nations of the world will be able to build upon cooperative understandings  reached through arms control agreements, it will be because of the efforts of people such as Dr. Brown, who has devoted a career toward that goal. I extend my best wishes to conference participants and urge them to work hard to build a safer tomorrow for all of us.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on why I will vote against the Craig amendment to the budget resolution, amendment #3007. While the amendment offered by Senator CRAIG has many law enforcement provisions that I support, I am very concerned that Senator CRAIG deleted funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, tobacco and Firearms (ATF) in his amendment. 
   If we are serious about providing the necessary resources to effectively pursue offenders of existing federal firearms laws, we cannot exclude the ATF. A true law enforcement initiative should provide sufficient funding for both ATF agents and inspectors. Afterall, the ATF is the federal agency whose mission is to reduce violent crime by enforcing our laws and regulations concerning firearms and explosives. Because the Craig amendment deliberately deleted funding for the ATF, I decided to vote against it. I repeatedly hear that in order for prosecutors to do their job, they need law enforcement, such as the ATF, to detect interstate drug running and to investigate gun dealers making illegal transfers of firearms. 
   Due to Senate procedures, the amendment offered by Senator CRAIG vitiated a vote on amendment #2954, an amendment offered by Senator DURBIN, that I fully supported. The Durbin amendment included funding for more than 1,000 local, State and Federal prosecutors to prosecute firearms offenses. The Durbin amendment also provided funding to expand Project Exile across the country and funding for ballistics testing programs to support law enforcement efforts. As opposed to the Craig amendment, the Durbin amendment provided $94 million in funding for an increase in ATF agents and inspectors. 
   Mr. President, prosecutors and federal task forces aimed at enforcing our existing firearms laws will be missing a key element if the ATF's funding is excluded from a federal law enforcement funding initiative.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to express my disappointment with the failed vote on my amendment to increase funding for the Title I education program for disadvantaged children. Disadvantaged communities need more help to ensure that all public schools give children a good education. Title I is working in many schools across the country. We should help bring success to every community. Ninety-nine percent of Title I funds go to local school districts and Title I is much more targeted to high poverty districts than state and local funds. Yet, current federal resources dedicated to the program fall far short of meeting the existing need. Many schools that are eligible for the program do not receive funding due to insufficient appropriations. 
   During the recent debate of the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in the HELP committee, Senator DODD offered an amendment to authorize an increase in funding for Title I to $15 billion. The amendment was unanimously adopted. My amendment to the budget resolution would ensure that funds will be available to carry out this bipartisan goal. It is unfortunate that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle blocked passage of this amendment.

Subtitle C of Title X of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 put in place a system for allocating mineral revenues between the States and the United States that is complicated and difficult to administer. It has resulted in confusion and conflict between States and the Federal Government, and the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior has noted that the agencies' budgeting processes and accounting systems were not designed to accumulating costs in the detail required for administering the system. The system is criticized by both the States and the Federal agencies charged with administering it, and it is time for it to be changed.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am offering the amendment on behalf of myself, Senator KENNEDY, Senator MURRAY, Senator DODD, Senator KERRY, Senator DASCHLE, and Senator WELLSTONE, several of whom will speak. 
   It would increase the national investment in education over the committee's mark by $5.6 billion in budget authority in fiscal year 2001. 
   Let me put up a chart that shows the difference between our proposed amendment and the budget resolution. You can see that the budget resolution is $75 billion in 2001. Our amendment will raise that up to $80.64 billion. 
   It also would increase over a 5-year period the total amount devoted to education by $34.7 billion. 
   This second chart shows the comparison between the budget resolution that came to the floor and what this amendment would do. 
   In our view, this increase is essential if we are going to reflect the priorities of the American people. All of us know that the top priority of the people we represent is to see improvements in education and to see every child in this country given the opportunity to get a good education. Clearly, the decisions we make in this budget resolution will go a long way to determining whether that is possible or not. 
   The amendment I sent to the desk would use about 15 percent of the proposed Republican tax cut. It would reduce the tax cut by that 15 percent in order to guarantee sufficient funding for programs that have been proven to improve student performance in our public schools and to assist students seeking a postsecondary education. 
   What are those programs? That is the subject of our amendment. The amendment that we are proposing would seek to protect many such programs. 
   First, it seeks to protect a program to increase safety and decrease overcrowding in our schools by providing $1.3 billion in grants and loans for urgent repair of 5,000 public elementary and secondary schools in high-need areas and by leveraging $25 billion in interest-free bonds to help build and modernize 6,000 schools. 
   The amendment also demonstrates a national commitment to building and renovating our schools to make sure all children are able to study in safe, modern environments by setting aside $3.7 billion of the proposed tax cut, which is just 1.8 percent of the total tax cut, to back those interest-free bonds for school construction costs. 
   These programs I estimate would provide about $200 million in my home State of New Mexico where current estimates are that school repair and modernization needs exceed $1.8 billion. Many schools are overcrowded. Over 69 percent of our schools in my State report plumbing and electrical problems; 75 percent have problems with environmental factors such as lighting and heating. 
   Another program we guarantee funding in what we believe is a reasonable  level is the afterschool programs. We expand existing afterschool programs so approximately 1.6 million more school-age children in over 6,000 new 21st century community learning centers have access to afterschool programs in safe and drug-free environments. 
   The amendment seeks to ensure an increase of $547 million in these programs. The estimate for my State would be about $5.3 million of the total amount. Also, in this amendment we support tough accountability standards for increasing the funding for title I accountability grants by $116 million over last year's level, to the level of $250 million. This is essential to accelerate efforts to turn around failing schools and to implement tough accountability systems. 
   Under current law, States in districts receiving funding under the title I program, which is every State and most school districts in the country, are required to monitor student and school performance on State assessments based on State standards. States and districts are required to take action if schools are failing. In committee, we strengthened the accountability system, but we did not strengthen it enough. 
   During the debate on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, I hope to offer an amendment that strengthens it further. Nevertheless, no accountability system is going to prove effective without the resources to implement. Although most States have adopted statewide standards, they have not directed adequate resources to schools that are failing in order to meet those standards. Dedicated funds are necessary to develop improvement strategies which create rewards and penalties holding schools accountable for continuous improvement in their student performance. 
   The Federal Government directs over $8 billion in Federal funding to provide critical support programs for disadvantaged students under title I. However, the accountability provisions in title I have not been adequately implemented due to insufficient resources. The amendment we are offering today provides for this critical assistance and the strict accountability measures for improvement in student performance to turn around so-called failing schools. 
   My colleagues and I believe this amendment is necessary because the proposed budget we are now considering, if 
   implemented, will make adequate increases in education spending virtually impossible. Several of my colleagues have already pointed out the proposed budget calls for at least $168 billion in tax cuts over 5 years; that is the largest tax cut ever proposed. These tax cuts, at a minimum, leave nothing in the budget surplus for education or for the other priorities so important to the American people. 
   Without cutting other programs or dipping into Social Security, this budget resolution causes Members to choose between tax cuts and education. Unless unrealistic cuts are made to noneducation programs, the Republican budget resolution disregards these and other national priorities and exhausts 98 percent of the total non-Social Security surplus on tax cuts over the next 5 years. The budget resolution only covers the next 5 years; over 10 years the tax cuts would cost substantially more than the projected non-Social Security surplus projected by the CBO. 
   While the Budget Committee's resolution provides increases for discretionary spending for defense, it cuts nondefense discretionary funds by $105 billion, or 6.5 percent over the next 5 years below the amount the Congressional Budget Office indicates is necessary to maintain current funding.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator from California for the question. 
   My own view is there are a great many young people out 
   there who want to be in these programs. There are a great many parents who want to have their children in these programs. Our estimate is that 1.6 million more of the students nationwide would be able to participate if we are able to succeed with this amendment and add the $547 million of additional funds that the President has requested. That is what we are trying to do. Clearly, it is a question of priorities. Where do people think this money should be spent? 
   My own view is these programs are extremely effective not only in improving children's performance but in keeping kids out of trouble. The drug problem is real. We all talk about the need to fight the drug problem. We are having a great discussion now in the newspapers about how much should be spent to deal with the drug problem by assisting the country of Colombia. I support doing something significant there. 
   Clearly, reducing demand through more attention to young people through afterschool programs is part of the solution.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me go ahead and complete the summary of this amendment, if I could. 
   First, I do recognize the Republican resolution, which we have on the floor, asserts a commitment to increase spending for a few important education programs. We support the committee's decision to commit to increased funding for IDEA and for Pell grants and some other elementary and secondary education programs. But we do not support pitting these programs against other critical programs. We believe the more prudent course would be to guarantee the level of funding required to protect the programs that have proven themselves in our efforts to reform schools and bring improvements in student performance. 
   Let me just go through this chart to try to clarify my understanding at least of the Republican budget resolution that is before us. The resolution asserts a $4.5 billion increase for mandatory and discretionary Department of Education programs. But when you try to figure out how that $4.5 billion is arrived at, the specific elements that are discussed at different parts of the budget add up to more than $4.5 billion. For example, there is $2.3 billion set  aside for a new, mandatory performance bonus fund which is established.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. When you look at this $2.3 billion the Budget Committee report sets aside for this new, mandatory performance bonus fund, that, of course, presumably, should come out of the total amount for education. I believe it does very explicitly. Therefore, when you subtract that, the resolution asserts a $2.2 billion increase for discretionary education programs. Given the size of the tax cut in relation to the non-Social Security surplus, this increase does not seem possible, as I mentioned before. But if we assume it is, it still falls short of covering the priorities specified in their own resolution. 
   The resolution earmarks, out of the $2.2 billion that remains after you subtract the $2.3 billion down here--$1 billion for IDEA, it sets aside $1.6 billion for increases in other elementary and secondary education programs, and it sets aside $700 million for the increase to raise the maximum Pell grant by $200. If you add the $700 million, the $1.6 billion, the $1 billion, and the $2.3 billion, you get $5.6 billion. 
   So the unfortunate reality is that there is no way to get it all done in the $4.5 billion that is permitted in the way of increases for education. Therefore, the $1.1 billion difference between the $5.6 billion and the $4.5 billion needs to be cut from other education programs in order to reach the specified increases. 
   Based on what is outlined in the committee-reported budget, Non-elementary and Secondary Education Act or IDEA education programs would have to be cut about 22 percent to meet the assumptions for education spending. 
   The funding for fiscal year 2001 for discretionary programs under the Republican proposal is $2.3 billion below what the President requested. If all discretionary education, training, and social programs in function 500 of the budget are considered, the resolution is $4.7 billion below the President's budget. 
   Our amendment would guarantee real dollars for targeted efforts, for programs that are known to improve student performance. The program would provide increases in funding that would allow for this $1 billion increase in IDEA. As I said before, we compliment the committee for agreeing to that. I believe that is very important. 
   Our amendment would also sustain our commitment to the student loan program and to the impact aid programs. The amendment would provide for a $400 increase in the maximum Pell grant rather than the $200 increase proposed by the President and contained in the committee report. 
   In addition, the amendment would guarantee increased investments in programs that we know are essential to educational reform, including those I mentioned before. Let me mention just a few more of those. There is a $1.5 billion increase in our proposed amendment for teacher quality programs. This is $1 billion over the President's proposal, so we can ensure every child is taught by a qualified instructor. Research shows that high-quality teachers are the single most 
   important determinant of student learning. 
   This amendment increases resources for schools with high concentrations of poverty. Here we are talking about the title I program. We would propose to increase funding there by $1 billion, which, frankly, is not enough. During the Elementary and Secondary Education Act markup, which we concluded in the Health and Education Committee just the other day, our committee voted unanimously--all Democrats and all Republicans voted unanimously to increase the authorization for title I to $15 billion. I would like to work with my Republican colleagues to ensure we are at least on the path to meeting that goal. At the very least, we need to commit to make a substantial increase next year. All of us know the importance of title I funding. All of us give speeches about how important it is to adequately fund title I. Here is a chance to actually vote to do that. 
   The amendment we are offering continues our commitment to smaller classes, providing $1.75 billion to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce class size in the early grades. In addition, the amendment expands support for creating smaller learning communities in large schools. 
   This amendment makes college more affordable for many of our young people. As I mentioned before, we are increasing the maximum Pell grant by $400--we are proposing to do that. That would make postsecondary education accessible to 96,000 more recipients than currently have access. The amendment increases the GEAR UP program and the TRIO Program so more disadvantaged children can be given the support they need to attend college. Under the amendment, students in my State would receive an additional $5 million in aid under the Pell Grant Program. 
   Let me just conclude by saying the public does want its schools fixed, even if that means somewhat less in the way of a tax cut. That is the issue before us. Should there be something in the range of a 15-percent reduction in the tax cut in order to adequately fund education in this budget? The budget resolution before us does not reflect the priorities of the American public. It flies in the face of what Americans say their priorities are in this robust economy. In survey after survey, American voters have not only told us education is the most important issue nationally, but they support action at the national level to improve our country's schools. This sentiment extends to the funding of education, just as it extends to other changes in our education. 
   So I believe this is very important. I believe this amendment will improve this budget resolution dramatically and will put it much more in line with the interests and priorities of the American people. I hope very much it will be agreed to by my colleagues. 
   I yield the floor and yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will use the 2 minutes we have to summarize the amendment. 
   I agree with Senator KENNEDY from Massachusetts that this is a simple choice we have to make. Is there going to be a reduction in the amount of the tax cut? The proposed tax cut is the largest on the Senate floor with which I am familiar. And the proposal is to reduce that tax cut by about 15 percent and commit 15 percent of those revenues to improvements in education. 
   The argument is that the underlying budget resolution has $1 billion for IDEA, which we support. Our amendment has that, too. There is no difference on that issue. 
   The argument is that their budget resolution asks for more than the President's proposal. The truth is, their budget resolution says that of the increase in education, $2.3 billion of it needs to be spent on a so-called performance bonus fund. It is committed to that. It is dedicated to that. It can't be spent for 5 years. So no school is going to see any benefit from that. If you take that out, there is a cut in education in the budget resolution on which we are voting. 
   Our amendment tries to restore those funds and get the funds up to the level in the programs that have been proven to work, programs that matter to people all over this country. We believe those programs should be adequately funded: programs to improve the quality of teachers in the classroom, programs to modernize our schools, programs to increase accountability for the expenditure of funds, particularly title I funds, programs for after school. Those are the types of programs we are trying to see are adequately funded. 
   We do not believe those programs should suffer in order that we create a new mandatory performance bonus. That is the issue before us today. 
   I hope Members will support the amendment.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am very proud to be here with my friend and colleague, Senator Jack REED, to introduce the Tobacco Regulation Fairness Act of 2000. 
   I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to join this effort, for it is time for Congress to take action. We must ensure that the Food and Drug Administration can regulate the manufacture, labeling, advertising, distribution and sale of tobacco products. 
   While many are disappointed with last week's Supreme Court ruling on FDA regulation of tobacco products, the ruling reflects reality. Congress has not acted to give FDA the authority it needs to regulate tobacco products. The Supreme Court's decision underscores this fact and heightens the need for Congress to pass meaningful and comprehensive legislation to ensure FDA authority over tobacco products. 
   This legislation is the key to preventing tobacco use by teenagers and adolescents and to preventing the sales of tobacco products to children. If we can prevent kids from smoking, we can head off a tremendous amount of human disease and suffering, medical costs, and loss of life. While even tobacco companies say that they are against kids smoking, we must look at the facts. According to the American Cancer Society, in the course of this Congress, almost 600,000 children will try tobacco products for the first time. Of those, nearly 200,000 will become addicted to nicotine. Additionally, over more than 90,000 people will die from tobacco related cancers. 
   In 1997, a study by the Center for Disease Control showed that children and adolescents were able to buy tobacco products 67 percent of the times they  tried. The CDC found that most young smokers were able to buy their own cigarettes and were seldom asked for identification. While strides have been made in the past 2 years, it is imperative that change continue. The bottom line is that the Supreme Court made its decision and Congress must act so that we can continue to make inroads into youth smoking prevention. 
   Mr. President, this legislation designates the Food and Drug Administration as the Federal agency that regulates the manufacture, distribution and sale of tobacco products. This Act will serve to provide the Secretary of Health and Human Services with the authority to promulgate regulations governing the manufacture, sale and distribution of tobacco products. Additionally, the legislation also establishes a federal minimum age of sale of tobacco products of 18 and require the label to state ``Federal Law Prohibits Sale to Minors.'' 
   Mr. President, in 1989 and again in 1992, I introduced a bill to require the Food and Drug Administration to regulate the manufacture and sale of tobacco products. ``The Tobacco Health and Safety Act of 1992'' had a companion bill with Representative Michael Synar in the House. These bills were very similar legislative attempts to regulate tobacco by bringing it under the jurisdiction of the Federal Food and Drug Administration. 
   I believed then and I believe now that the FDA is the appropriate regulatory entity to address this vital issue. To do anything else is unacceptable. It is time to give the FDA the full authority to regulate the manufacture, sale, labeling, advertising, and promotion of tobacco products. 
   The bill we introduce today is a fair and equitable approach to the issue. It represents a strong commitment to health promotion and disease prevention. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and work with us to act upon this as a public health issue before we adjourn this year.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the ``Networking and Information Technology Research and Development for Department of Energy Missions Act,'' which is cosponsored by Senators CRAIG, SCHUMER, and MURRAY. 
   This bipartisan bill is in recognition of the critical contributions and future potential of computing programs within the Department of Energy's Office of Science. These programs have played a key role in the development of high performance computing, networking, and information technology. Some of their notable accomplishments have included: the establishment of the first national supercomputer center, the development of mathematical algorithm libraries for high performance computing, the development of a critical interface and other software packages to support high speed parallel interconnection of supercomputers, and the development of a fundamental component of how information is routed on the internet. Recent recognition of the scientists supported by this program have included: the 1998 Fernbach award; the 1998 Gordon Bell prize; awards for the best overall paper as well and the best of show award at the Supercomputing 1998 conference; the best paper and a number of special awards at the Supercomputing 1999 conference, the Maxwell prize in applied mathematics, and the 2000 Norbert Wiener Prize in applied mathematics. 
   The future potential of these programs is immense and not limited to the computation, networking, and information sciences. There is also great potential for helping not only the mission needs of the Department of Energy but also the broader scientific community and the public through increased understanding of biological systems, energy and environmental systems, chemical, physical, and plasma systems, and high energy and nuclear systems. This understanding is key to our more efficient and environmentally friendly production and utilization of energy and material goods. 
   The notable features of the bill include: an authorization for increased funding similar in scope to what is proposed in the House of Representatives for the National Science Foundation computational efforts; an open competition for funding; a collaborative program between DOE program offices; building partnerships between laboratories, universities, and industry; a focus on solutions to networking and information technology problems that are critical to the achieving DOE missions; and management of funding provided to NNSA laboratories administered by the sponsoring program of the Department. This last provision is consistent with the legislation which created the NNSA in that it maintains accountability for new money authorized by this bill in DOE civilian programs so that such funding will remain within the purview of civilian programs under the oversight of the authorizing committee for this legislation, while maintaining the principle that funding at laboratories under the purview of the NNSA be consistent with their general programmatic missions.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly on S.J. Res. 14, an amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 
   As my colleagues know, I will vote against this resolution just as I have voted against previous attempts to pass anti-flag desecration amendments during my tenure in the Senate. However, I take a back seat to no one in my respect for the flag, for what it stands for and, most importantly, for the hundreds of thousands of brave men and women of our armed services who sacrificed so much to defend this Nation, our Constitution, and, yes, or flag. I abhor the desecration of the flag as a form of expressing views about America or a policy of our government. That is why I supported an amendment by Senator MCCONNELL that would prohibit most, if not all, incidents of flag desecration by statutorily banning the desecration of a flag if it is done with the intent to incite or produce imminent violence or breach of the peace, or if the flag belongs to the United States Government or the act occurs on lands reserved for the use of the United States. 
   In the end, however, it is our Constitution and not the flag which gives us our freedoms. And chief among those freedoms, indeed the fundamental and most important freedom, is the right to speak freely against the government, against a government official or against a government policy. The speech of an individual may be distasteful to the majority, as is the case when someone burns a flag or when the KKK is allowed to march in our cities,  but our Constitution was established to protect the rights of the minority. For when the majority is allowed to rule without a check and balance, tyranny is not far behind. 
   I don't doubt that the vast majority of Americans oppose, as do I, the desecration of our flag, but we were elected to preserve and protect the Constitution of the United States and I simply do not see how we defend the Constitution by chipping away at its very foundation. 
   Mr. President, there are many reasons to oppose amending the first amendment for the first time in our Nation's history and for this particular purpose. As several of our colleagues have pointed out, we are not experiencing an epidemic of flag burning in the country. But we likely will, if this amendment passes and Congress goes on to ban acts of desecration. 
   I also share the concerns raised yesterday by my friend from Vermont, Senator LEAHY, that while the Senate takes 3 or 4 days to debate this amendment, we have not taken the time to address other issues that are extremely important, especially to our Nation's veterans and to our Armed Forces. One example is S. 2003, of which I am a cosponsor and that begins to address the issue of the Federal Government keeping its promises to our veterans in the area of health care. I wish the Senate would take up and pass S. 2003 but we can't seem to find time to do that. Likewise, I recently introduced legislation that would compensate the remaining survivors of the Bataan Death March for the incredible suffering they endured on behalf of their country. I would like to see the Senate take up and pass that legislation but we haven't. 
   Mr. President, I think our Constitution and Nation are strong enough to handle a few miscreants who want to burn a flag. I think the drafters of the Constitution envisioned that it would survive speech which the majority finds offensive. I believe that a vote against this amendment is a vote for the Constitution and for the most important principle embedded in that document, the right of every American to free speech.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, Senator GRAHAM of Florida and Senator JEFFORDS of Vermont, in the introduction of the ``Medicare Wellness Act of 2000.'' 
   This bipartisan, bicameral measure represents a recognition of the role that health promotion and disease prevention should play in the care available to Medicare beneficiaries. The bill adds several new preventative screening and counseling benefits to the Medicare program. Specifically, the act adds screening for hypertension, counseling for tobacco cessation, screening for glaucoma, counseling for hormone replacement therapy, and expanded screening and counseling for osteoporosis. 
   My colleagues have addressed most of these aspects of the bill so I will focus my remarks on one additional provision that is pivotal in achieving improved health outcomes of beneficiaries with several chronic diseases. Specifically, the Medicare Wellness Act of 2000 provides for coverage under Part B of the Medicare program for medical nutrition therapy services for beneficiaries who have diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or renal disease. 
   Medical nutrition therapy refers to the comprehensive nutrition services provided by registered dietitians as part of the health care team. Medical nutrition therapy has proven to be a medically necessary and cost effective way of treating and controlling heart disease, stroke, diabetes, high cholesterol, and various renal diseases. Patients who receive this therapy require fewer hospitalizations and medications and have fewer complications. 
   The treatment of patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease accounts for a full 60 percent of Medicare expenditures. In my home state of New Mexico, Native Americans are experiencing an epidemic of Type II diabetes. Medical nutrition therapy is integral to their diabetes care and to the prevention of progression of the disease. Information from the Indian Health Service shows that medical nutrition therapy provided by professional dietitians results in significant improvements in medical outcomes in Type II diabetics. 
   Mr. President, while medical nutrition therapy services are currently covered under Medicare Part A for inpatient services, there is no consistent Part B coverage policy for medical nutrition. 
   Nutrition counseling is best conducted outside the hospital setting. Today, coverage for nutrition therapy in ambulatory settings is at best inconsistent, but most often, non existent. 
   Because of the comparatively low treatment costs and the benefits associated with nutrition therapy, expanded coverage will improve the quality of care, outcomes and quality of life for Medicare beneficiaries. 
   Two years ago, my colleague from Idaho, Senator CRAIG and I requested that the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine study the issue of medical nutrition therapy as a benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. The Institute of Medicine released this study last December entitled: ``The Role of Nutrition in Maintaining Health in the Nation's Elderly: Evaluating Coverage of Nutrition Services for the Medicare Populations.'' This IOM study reaffirms what I have been working toward the past few years. Namely, it recommended that medical nutrition therapy, ``upon referral by a physician, be a reimbursable benefit for Medicare beneficiaries.'' The study substantiates evidence of improved patient outcomes associated with nutrition care provided by registered dietitians. 
   Mr. President, I again want to thank my colleagues for including medical nutrition therapy as a key component of the Medicare Wellness Act. I look forward to working with them toward passage of the act this Congress.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the ``Conservation and Stewardship Act,'' which is cosponsored by Senators HOLLINGS, BAUCUS, KERRY, BOXER, LIEBERMAN, BRYAN, AKAKA, LEAHY, and SARBANES. This comprehensive bill will provide permanent and dedicated funding from Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas revenues to be used for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and many other important conservation programs, including coastal, wildlife habitat, endangered species, historic preservation, State and local park and open space preservation, forestry and farmland conservation, and youth conservation corps programs. While the bill will ensure much-needed funding for many Federal conservation programs, most of the programs included in the bill will assist States, counties, or cities to implement local conservation and recreation projects. In addition, this legislation will, for the first time, fully fund the Payments In Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program, which provides payments to local governments for the loss of tax revenues resulting from Federal lands in their jurisdiction. 
   In developing this bill, I have tried to include a variety of programs to ensure that the benefits from OCS revenues--which are a federal resource belonging to all Americans--are equitably distributed throughout the country. While some programs in the bill are of specific interest to coastal States, others will have more application in interior areas; some programs in the bill provide funding for large cities and urban areas, while others are designed to assist rural communities. If we are to succeed in passing a comprehensive conservation bill this year, the benefits must extend to all regions of the country. 
   In addition, I think it's important to recognize that several very meritorious legislative proposals have already been put forward. One of my goals in developing this bill was to try and incorporate important programs from the other bills, and I am pleased that many of the sponsors of those proposals are also supporting this bill. I also want to recognize the efforts that Senator LANDRIEU, Senator MURKOWSKI, and others have made in generating support for a comprehensive conservation bill with their legislative proposal. While there are differences in our bills and in some of our funding priorities, I believe our underlying goals are the same. I am committed to working with them, and with all other interested Senators, as we try to pass a bill this year. 
   I would like to add that my primary goal in introducing this bill is to try and move the legislative process forward in the Senate. I think a consensus approach, such as we are proposing today, is our only chance of getting a bill enacted into law this year. 
   I know some have questioned why these programs--or any program--should be provided with dedicated funding. When Congress amended the LWCF Act in 1968 to credit a portion of Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas lease revenues into the fund, the premise was that at least some of the revenues from OCS oil and gas production, a non-renewable resource, should be used to protect other resources throughout the country. I think that was a wise concept then, and one we should continue to adhere to today. Along those lines, it is important that whatever programs are included in a comprehensive bill contribute to enriching the natural, cultural, or historical legacy of this country. In my opinion, such a bill is not only justifiable, but necessary if we are going to be responsible to future generations. 
   Mr. President, I would like to briefly describe some of the major programs that would receive dedicated funding in this bill. 
   Since its enactment over 35 years ago, the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act has been not only one of the most popular conservation measures ever signed into law, but one of the most far-sighted as well. Revenues deposited into the fund are used to protect our national and cultural heritage in our national parks, forests, wildlife refuges, wilderness areas, trails, wild and scenic rivers, and other important areas. In addition, the LWCF State grant program assists States in the planning, acquisition, and development of open space and outdoor recreation facilities. 
   However, over the past 35 years, appropriations from the LWCF have lagged far behind the amounts credited into the fund, even though demand for LWCF funding continues to increase. In fact, on average, less than half of the amounts credited to the fund have actually been authorized. Today, the fund's unappropriated balance exceeds $13 billion. History has shown that if the LWCF remains subject to the annual appropriations process, the intent of the fund will never be fulfilled. For that reason, my bill uses OCS oil and gas receipts to provide dedicated funding for the LWCF and all of the other conservation programs in the bill. The bill funds the LWCF and its fully authorized level of $900 million annually, divided equally between the Federal land acquisition and State grant programs. 
   In addition, I think it's important that the benefits we will get from fully  funding the LWCF not be negated by placing new restrictions on the land acquisitions in our national parks, forests and wildlife refuges. I am concerned about language in other bills on this issue which are pending in the House and Senate which would create new obstacles to protecting threatened national resources. I think a much better approach is to take the existing LWCF program, which has a proven track record, and ensure that it is adequately funded. However, I have included language which gives the Congress the ability to override proposed Federal agency expenditures, while ensuring that all of the money is actually spent for the intended purpose. 
   Likewise, I believe it's important that new restrictions not be placed on States for the use of the funds they receive under the State grant program. Although some have proposed to restructure the State program, I think the flexibility given to States in the current law is appropriate, and States should continue to determine how to allocate LWCF funds for recreational and open space needs, consistent with the requirements of the Act and with review by the Secretary of the Interior. 
   Title II of the Conservation and Stewardship Act provides funding to protect and restore our fragile coastal resources. It establishes the Ocean and Coast Conservation Fund, and dedicates $365 million annually, primarily to States, to address a broad array of coastal and marine conservation needs. This fund is administered by the Secretary of Commerce. The bill also establishes the Outer Continental Shelf Impact Assistance Fund, administered by the Secretary of the Interior, to provide $100 million annually to Coastal States suffering negative environmental impacts from oil and gas production on the OCS. 
   The Ocean and Coast Conservation Fund addresses four programs. The first account within the fund allocates $250 million to Coastal States for a broad range of coastal and marine conservation activities which ensure protection for coral reefs, wetlands, estuaries and marine species. The second account allocates $25 million to Coastal States to fund joint marine enforcement agreements between States and the Secretary of Commerce, thereby increasing enforcement capabilities for both Federal and State marine resource protection laws. The third account gives $75 million to Coastal States to fund fisheries research and management. The fourth account allocates $15 million to the Secretary of Commerce for the protection of coral reefs. A complementary program for protection of coral resources under the jurisdiction of the 
   Department of the Interior is contained in Title VI of my bill as described further below. 
   Although other bills have been introduced which also address coastal funding, I believe the Ocean and Coast Conservation Fund contains several significant advantages. First, it requires that all money received under this fund be used only for the protection of the marine and coastal environment. Second, it ties the amount of money States will receive to demonstrated conservation need rather than the amount of production occurring offshore the State, or a State's or county's proximity to that production. In this manner, my bill refrains from allowing money from this fund to be used as an incentive to begin or increase production in the Federal OCS. My bill also excludes revenues from leases included within areas covered by a moratorium on leasing. 
   The Outer Continental Shelf Impact Assistance Fund allocates $100 million specifically to address the needs of those Coastal States which have hosted Federal OCS oil and gas production off their shores, and which have suffered negative environmental impacts from that production. Funds are distributed based on shoreline miles and coastal population (25 percent each) and the amount of production occurring offshore the Coastal State (50 percent). States can use the money only to mitigate adverse environmental impacts directly attributable to the development of oil and gas resources of the OCS. 
   The bill also establishes a separate Coral Reef Resources Restoration Fund. This fund provides $15 million annually to the Secretary of the Interior for the protection of coral reef resources under the jurisdiction of the Secretary. The bill authorizes the Secretary to make grants, not to exceed 75 percent of the total costs, for projects which promote the viability of coral reef systems under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior. Grants would be available to natural resource agencies of States or Territories, educational or non-governmental institutions, or organizations with demonstrated expertise in the conservation of coral reefs. 
   Like many of the other comprehensive conservation proposals, my bill includes significant new funding to assist States in protecting wildlife habitat. The Conservation and Stewardship Act includes a $350 million annual increase in deposits into the Pittman-Robertson fund, to help fund a broad variety of wildlife conservation programs, with an emphasis on protecting habitat for non-game species. 
   In addition, the bill establishes a new $50 million fund to protect threatened and endangered species. Under the program, the Secretary of the Interior would be authorized to enter into agreements with private landowners to protect habitat for threatened and endangered species. This incentive program would assist landowners who voluntarily agree to take protective actions beyond what is required under existing law. 
   In addition to the funds provided for Federal and State programs through the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Conservation and Stewardship Act provides funding for several programs to assist States, local governments, and other organizations in the protection of open space. The bill includes $50 million in funding for the Forest Legacy Program, $50 million for the Farmland Protection Program, and $50 million for a new program to allow for the voluntary acquisition of conservation easements to prevent ranchlands from being converted to non-agricultural uses. 
   The bill also includes $125 million for a new grant program to be administered by the Secretary of the Interior to help States conserve, on a matching basis, non-Federal lands or waters of clear regional or national interest. 
   Presently, OCS revenues are credited to only two funds: the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Historic Preservation Fund. Like the LWCF, appropriations from the HPF have lagged far behind the $150 million that is annually credited to the fund. The Conservation and Stewardship Act will, for the first time, ensure that the fully authorized amount is expended. In addition, the bill requires that at least half of the fund, $75 million, be available to States, tribes, and local governments to allow them to better carry out their responsibilities under the National Historic Preservation Act. The bill also requires that at least 50 percent of the Federal funds spent under the program be used for the restoration of historic properties. 
   The bill also funds the American Battlefield Protection Program at $15 million per year, fulfilling recommendations made by the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission. Funding would be available for preservation assistance for all types of battlefields, although with respect to Civil War battlefields, the funding priority would be for ``Priority 1'' battlefields identified in the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission's report. 
   Mr. President, it is well known that many of the natural and historic resources in the parks and historic sites of our National Park System are facing significant threats, especially given the limited funds available to the Park Service to address this issue. In an attempt to improve this problem, the Conservation and Stewardship Act creates a new ``National Park System Resource Protection Fund'' and provides $150 million in annual funding. Moneys from the fund are available to the Secretary of the Interior to protect significant natural, cultural or historical resources in units of the National Park System that are threatened by activities occurring inside or outside of the park boundaries. The Secretary is also authorized to enter into cooperative agreements with State and local governments and other organizations to address these threats. In addition, the bill makes clear that the fund cannot be used to fund land acquisitions, permanent employee salaries, road construction, or projects which already receive funding through the Recreational Fee Demonstration Program.  
   Like many of the other programs included in this bill, the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Program is a program with overwhelming demand and, in recent years, little or non-existent funding. In an effort to revitalize this program, the Conservation and Stewardship Act provides $75 million in dedicated funding each year for UPARR programs, a significant increase over recent appropriations. 
   I think it is important that a comprehensive conservation bill focus not only on land acquisition and other resource conservation programs, but also on improving the tie between these resources and local communities. I have included funding for four programs to assist the way communities, including young people, work with public and private partners to plan and take action for the long-term stewardship and maintenance of lands and resources. 
   Dedicated funding for the Youth Conservation Corps and related partnerships will enable us to make significant investments in two of our country's most valuable treasures--our natural resources and our young people. The investments in our youth and our natural resources can grow together and benefit one another. 
   The Youth Conservation Corps, and related partnerships with nonprofit, State, and local youth conservation corps (``YCC''), are administered by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior. It is clear that they are successful and popular programs. The demand for summer conservation jobs for youth overwhelmingly exceeds the supply. Over the past twenty years, a lack of adequate funding has been the biggest obstacle preventing YCC from realizing an even greater level of success. 
   Our parks, forests, wildlife refuges, and other public lands benefit because important conservation projects are completed at a lower cost. Our youth, on summer break from school, benefit by engaging in positive and meaningful activities. There are many types of projects that youth complete--construction, maintenance, reconstruction, restoration, repair, or rehabilitation of natural, cultural, historic, archaeological, recreational, or scenic resources. 
   Senator Scoop Jackson was the sponsor of the original legislation that created the YCC. He had the foresight and vision to create opportunities for young people to complete conservation and restoration projects on our public lands. The bill I am introducing today will enable us to embrace Senator Jackson's legacy by fully funding YCC, thereby achieving the levels of participation that existed during his tenure in the Senate. 
   Last year, the National Parks, Historic Preservation, and Recreation Subcommittee held an oversight hearing on YCC and related partnerships. Both National Park Service Director Stanton, on behalf of the Department of the Interior, and Forest Service Chief Dombeck expressed enthusiastic support for these programs. Similarly, over the past year I have learned that strong bipartisan Congressional support exists for YCC and related partnerships. 
   All of our country's public lands will benefit from these programs. The existing authorizing law includes a State grant component as well as opportunities for projects to be completed on public lands other than Federal lands.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me conclude by particularly thanking David Brooks, Mary Katherine Ishee, and Bob Simon, who are all on the staff of our Energy and Natural Resources Committee. They have done yeoman's work in getting this bill prepared for introduction and obtaining the support of many of the Senators who are cosponsors on the bill.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator KENNEDY for his leadership on this and all of the issues that relate to education that we deal with in the Senate. I commend him particularly for this amendment that deals with teacher quality and recruiting and training the people who go into the teaching profession. 
   I think it is clear from the experience in my State--that is the experience that I come from and understand a little bit, at least--that we have too few funds available for the training of teachers, people who are already in the workforce who need additional training, and people who are going into teaching. Clearly the Federal funds made available for that purpose meet a real need. Despite the fact a lot of money is spent on education nationally--I certainly concede a lot is--there are other pressures on local school boards. There are other pressures on States that tend to result in too little of the money going to train the teachers and going to upgrade their skill levels. 
   This amendment would ensure that at least a portion of the Federal funds we are providing to States for education go to this vital activity. 
   I think the amendment is absolutely crucial. I hope every Senator will vote for it. 
   When you look at all the factors that affect education, I think there are many studies which have concluded correctly that the factor, if you have to pick one, that is most significant in determining the quality of a child's education is the quality of the teacher and the training of that teacher to provide that instruction. This amendment goes directly to that. It says we need to keep our priorities straight when we spend public money. We need to be sure the funds go to what is most important in terms of improving the education of the children involved. That means training the teachers. 
   I compliment Senator KENNEDY very much for this amendment. I am very pleased to speak for it, and am very pleased to support it. I think this goes to the heart of what we are trying to do. It goes to the heart of the concern I hear all over my State from a lot of people about the inadequacies of our educational system. 
   We have a sad circumstance in my State. I have encountered something which we call a ``permanent substitute.'' I go to school districts and they say: OK, you are trying to ensure that more of the accredited teachers are actually accredited to teach in the subjects they are teaching. That is not our problem. Our problem is we have people teaching on a semipermanent basis in our classrooms, and we call them ``permanent substitutes.'' They not only are not qualified in the subject area they are being asked to teach, but they are not really qualified to be teaching. They haven't been accredited. 
   This is a sad commentary. You have to go through licensing procedures to be a hairdresser in our State. You have to go through licensing procedures to pursue virtually any career. We need to be sure we impose accountability on the teaching of professionals as well. 
   Teachers themselves want to see this happen. This is not an antiteacher proposal. This is something teachers themselves want to see more funds available for in training and upgrading their skills. 
   This is an amendment I strongly support. I commend Senator KENNEDY for proposing this amendment. I hope all Senators will review it carefully and will determine to support the amendment when it comes up for a vote. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes of the 8 minutes allocated for advocating this amendment. Then I will defer to Senator FEINGOLD. 
   This amendment is very straightforward. It would provide an additional $1.2 billion for the Pell Grant Program. I think all of us who have paid any attention to Federal support for education know that the one program that is most helpful to those trying to go to college in our States is the Pell grant. We have a great many young people in this country--and some of them not so young--who are taking advantage of this program. In fact, we have nearly 4 million people in this country who receive Pell grants every year. The average size of those Pell grants this year will be a little over $2,000. This amendment says, let's take the funds that were otherwise provided as a $5-per-student tax benefit in this pending bill and increase by $400 the maximum grant for Pell grants. The current limit on what can be provided in the Pell grant is $3,300 per year. We say, let's raise that to $3,700 per year. 
   Now, most students don't get that maximum amount, but we want to have the opportunity there for them to get the maximum amount, if possible. The estimate we have is that, today, the maximum grant permitted under the Pell Grant Program is 86 percent of the 1980 value of the Pell grant in constant dollars. The simple fact is that we are not keeping up with the increase in the cost of higher education. We used to provide substantial support by providing grants and much less in the way of loans. In the time I have been in the Senate, we have seen that change dramatically. Now we provide loans but little in the way of grants. This amendment would help to correct that to some small degree. This is very meaningful for my State. Over $64 million, this year, goes to Pell grants, and that amount would increase if the amendment I have offered on behalf of Senator KENNEDY and the other Senators is accepted. 
   The average family income for families whose children are taking advantage of the Pell Grant Program is $14,500 a year. So if a Senator is concerned about getting the money to where it is most needed--to the families who most need that money for education--this amendment will do that. It takes money that otherwise is being spread to many people who are much better off than that and concentrates it where the families need it the most--in this case, the families who are eligible for Pell grants. 
   This $400 increase will translate into 96,000 new recipients of Pell grants this next year. In May of 1999, the Health and Education Committee that Senator JEFFORDS heads and of which Senator KENNEDY is the ranking member passed a bipartisan resolution to increase the basic Pell grant by $400, which is exactly what this amendment does.  
   We have a chance with this amendment to make good on that promise with real money for a change and not just a resolution. I urge my colleagues to vote to put aid to needy college kids ahead of the tax breaks that are provided in this bill for families or individuals who are much better off. 
   Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to Senator FEINGOLD.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to state that I agree with the position of my distinguished colleague from California on the issue of social promotion. We must end this practice. Far too many of our young people are graduating without the skills that they need to secure good jobs because they are being passed from grade to grade without accountability for what they have learned. Many young people are also dropping out of school because they find themselves in high schools without the knowledge that they need to succeed in that forum. I am a strong supporter of efforts to end this practice. 
   I have voted for legislation in the past that would have given States and local districts incentives to eliminate social promotion policies. I currently am cosponsoring legislation, based on a proposal from the President, which seeks to end social promotion in all our schools. I must vote against Senator FEINSTEIN's amendment, however, because it would cut all federal funding for education to a State based on this sole issue and provides no flexibility on the State or local level. If this amendment were to become law, we would be imposing a strict requirement without providing adequate resources to achieve the goal. As the Elementary and Secondary Education Act moves to the floor, however, I will work with my distinguished colleague from California to develop legislation that addresses this critical issue.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am introducing this amendment to strike the part of the bill that provides the tax savings because I think there is a better use for that amount of funding. I am proposing an alternative use for that funding that I urge my colleagues to seriously consider. 
   My amendment strikes the part of the bill that provides the average family with a very small tax savings, and there are various estimates as to what that savings would be. Essentially, as I understand it, the Joint Tax Committee says the average benefit per child in public school would be something like $3 in 2001 and $4.50 in 2002. 
   I think it is clear, regardless of the precise number, that these are not tax savings that are going to help any child in this country get a better education. So my thought is that rather than do that with the funds we are expending through this bill--or proposing to expend--we use the money to provide crucial funds to turn around the failing public schools. 
   Public schools are where over 90 percent of our children are educated. I grew up in Silver City, NM where, if you want to go to school, you go to public school. That is the way it has always been, to my knowledge. It is going to be that way for some time. We need to be sure the schools that are not adequately training young people and educating young people get the assistance, the resources, the oversight, and the accountability they need in order to move ahead and solve that problem. 
   Let me talk a little bit more about the bill that is presently pending and then talk about my own amendment. The Joint Tax Committee did this analysis of the Coverdell proposal and indicated that it would, in their view, disproportionately help families with children already in private schools. Eighty-three percent of families with children in private schools would use this account, but only 28 percent of families in public schools would make use of it. 
   Essentially, the proposal is a way of diverting funds that are otherwise public funds into the private schools, at a time when we all recognize that the public schools have inadequate funds to do the job we are calling upon them to do. 
   Also, the pending Coverdell bill we are trying to amend has no mechanisms in it to ensure accountability of the use of the funds we are talking about. The bill does nothing to improve teacher quality. It does nothing to provide safe and modern environments for learning. It does nothing to raise academic standards or to impose upon the public schools or bring them to more accountability in the expenditure of the funds. 
   I believe we need to use Federal funds on initiatives that make a difference in our public schools. That is what my amendment intended to do. 
   The relevant section of the Coverdell bill costs the public an average of $275 million a year for the next 5 years. That is the cost to the taxpayers. I believe we can use that $275 million each year to ensure that higher standards and accountability are implemented throughout our public schools. We have made some progress in implementing higher standards. 
   Most States have adopted or are in the process of adopting statewide standards. This is due in part to the fact that Federal law applicable to the program for disadvantaged students --that is title I--requires that standards be adopted. Although States have  adopted standards, many States and districts have not had sufficient funds to ensure the accountability for meeting those standards they have set or to provide adequate resources to the schools that are failing to meet the standards. I think dedicating specific funds to this purpose is necessary in order to create the rewards and the penalties that will allow schools to be held accountable for the improvement in student performance. 
   The Federal Government directs over $8 billion in Federal funds to provide support programs through title I. But the accountability provisions in title I have not been adequately implemented because they haven't had the resources to do it at the State level, primarily. 
   Title I authorizes State school support teams to provide support for schoolwide programs to provide assistance to schools that are in need of improvement through activities such as professional developments for the teachers in those schools, and 
   identifying resources for changing the way the instruction is provided. 
   In 1998, only eight States requiring these school support teams have been able to serve the majority of the schools that they have been identified as needing improvement. Less than half the schools identified as being in the need of improvement in the school year of 1997-1998 reported that having been designated as a school needing improvement actually got some professional development to accomplish that improvement. 
   Schools and school districts need additional support and resources in order to address the weaknesses that we identify. They need that support and those resources quickly after those weaknesses are identified. They need to be able to promote an intensive range of interventions, continuously assess the results of those interventions, and to implement some incentives for improvement. 
   The National Governors' Association asked us to provide funds for the purpose this amendment tries to address. 
   I have a letter that came to me last October when this same issue came before us in the Senate. I offered an amendment at that time which was not successful but which I believe had merit then, and I believe it has merit now. 
   Let me make it very clear so there is no misunderstanding. At that time, I was not proposing to strike the tax proposal that Senator COVERDELL brought forward and substitute this in its stead. The Governors were not responding to that specific striking aspect of my amendment of today, but they were talking about the need to have additional funds to ensure accountability and to ensure the implementation of these higher standards by the schools that are failing. 
   The amendment I am offering would provide $275 million to help improve failing schools. The money would be used to ensure the States and school districts have the necessary resources to implement the corrective action provisions of title I by providing immediate, intensive interventions to turn around low-performing schools. 
   Let me read part of this letter so that folks know what the Governors are saying. It is a letter to me by Mr. Raymond Scheppach, who is the executive director of the National Governors' Association. 
   It says:  
   On behalf of the Nation's Governors, I write to express our strong support for your amendment to provide States with additional funds to help turn around schools that are failing to provide quality education for title I students.  
   That is what we are trying to do today. 
   He says further:  
   As you know, under current law, States are permitted to reserve one-half of one percent of their title I monies to administer the title I program and provide schools with additional assistance. However, this small set aside--this is one-half of one percent--does not provide the States with sufficient funds to improve the quality of title I schools. A recent study by the U.S. Department of Education noted the ``capacity of State school support teams to assist schools in need of improvement of title I is a major concern.'' The programs authorized to fund such improvement efforts have not been funded. As a result, States have been unable to provide such services.  
   Then he goes on to various other points but essentially 
   says:  
   Your amendment would provide such funding. Therefore, NGA supports your amendment and will urge other Senators to support the adoption of it.  
   Let me make it very clear to people again. This was a letter related to an amendment to direct funds at accountability in the expenditure of public funds and help these failing schools. It does not include the proposal I am making today as well to strike the Coverdell amendment and substitute this instead as a better use of that money. 
   But the types of interventions the States and school districts could provide under these funds are things which I think we would all recognize are needed. 
   First, purchasing necessary materials, up-to-date textbooks, curriculum, technology. 
   I think we all encounter circumstances where teachers, school administrators, and students tell us about how they have outdated textbooks and inadequate lab materials or whatever in order to really pursue their studies as they would like to. 
   These funds could be used for that. They could be used for providing intensive, ongoing teacher training. 
   That clearly is a need, and I think it is a recognized need in the teaching profession. 
   The people who talk to me about the importance of more teacher training are the teachers. So this is not an attack on our public school teachers. This is a recognition that we need to do more to help them constantly stay abreast of the new developments in teaching and do a better job. 
   Third, this would provide access to distance learning. 
   We have the amendment that was talked about just prior to the amendment I am discussing about technology in our schools. All of us recognize there is a great opportunity, particularly in rural communities, to make better use of teacher learning. 
   This past weekend, I was in some communities in my State where there are very small high schools. I was in Eunice, NM; I was in Jal, NM. Those are communities with very small high schools. Frankly, they are not able to offer all of the courses they would like to offer for their students. They have the opportunity through distance learning, through the Internet, through interactive television, and through a variety of technologies to provide courses to some of their students even though they may not have a teacher in that school who is qualified to teach that course. We need to be sure the funds are there to do that. This amendment would help provide those funds. 
   These funds must be used to extend learning time for students--afterschool programs, Saturday programs, and summer school--to help them catch up and perform at least at grade level and, hopefully, better than grade level. 
   These funds could be used to provide rewards to low-performing schools that show significant progress, including cash awards or other incentives such as, in particular, release time for teachers to prepare for the next school year or whatever. 
   Also, these funds could be used for intensive technical assistance from teams of experts outside the schools to help develop and implement school improvement plans in failing schools. 
   These teams would determine the causes of low performance--for example, low expectations, outdated curriculum, poorly trained teachers, and unsafe conditions. They would assist in implementing research-based models for improvement. 
   I am persuaded there are today research-based whole school reform programs that have been developed that can dramatically improve the performance of our elementary schools. I have become most familiar with one which is called Success for All. There are others that are also showing very good results. 
   This Success for All program was developed at Johns Hopkins University. Bob Slavin was the key researcher who worked on it. This is a proven early grade reading program. It also covers other subjects. The core subject which most schools have adopted and are focused on is the reading. This is a program which, if implemented properly, can ensure substantial results. We have 50 elementary schools in New Mexico that are presently using this Success for All program and the results are impressive. At the end of the first grade, Success for All schools have averaged  reading scores almost 3 months ahead of those in other control schools where that program has not been implemented. 
   This amendment will not address all the issues of our schools. I believe sincerely that it is a positive step forward. It will be a more meaningful step forward in improving the educational quality in America than this alternative of providing a $5 a year, or whatever the right number is, tax benefit to the average American. 
   Clearly, we all want to see our schools improved. 
   Senator REED is on the floor and wishes to speak for a moment on this and then I understand Senator ROTH has an amendment he wishes to offer. 
   I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the amendment that is to be voted on next is one I offered which takes the $275 million per year that is the estimated cost of this underlying bill with the tax provisions and it devotes that $275 million to assisting States to hold local school districts accountable to upgrade standards. 
   It is an accountability amendment. Presently, most of the States in the country have established performance standards for their schools and their students but we have no accountability provisions that are adequate for them to meet those standards. This amendment tries to solve that. It gives the resources to the States so they can solve that. I believe it is a very good amendment and it is something we all ought to support. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my good friend and colleague from New Mexico, Senator DOMENICI, to introduce this bill along with Senator BAUCUS. This bill assures that our Native American communities have the funding they need for critical transportation projects. Our bill will fund the Indian Reservation Road Program for the next three years with at least $275 million per year, the full amount authorized by Congress. 
   Mr. President, since I came to the Senate in 1983, I've worked hard to promote economic development and create new jobs for my state of New Mexico. One thing I learned very quickly is that you can't expect to attract new industry unless you have the basic infrastructure to support residential and commercial needs. The most important infrastructure needs include transportation, power, communications, water and sewers. Without these basic services at affordable rates, opportunities to create good jobs will simply not develop. 
   Today our country is fortunate to have one of the strongest economies in history. Our recent advances in job creation and economic growth are accomplishments that all Americans should be proud of. Unfortunately, as many of us know, some sectors of our nation continue to lag behind the wave of economic prosperity that has swept the nation. In particular, I remain concerned about our Native American communities. Unemployment rates today in Indian Country frequently top 30, 40, and even 50 percent. Mr. President, the nation must not stand by while Indian Country is literally being left behind. Perhaps more than any other community in America, the Tribes and Alaska Native Villages suffer from inadequate infrastructure. 
   This year I am pleased to be working with President Clinton, Senators DASCHLE, DOMENICI, and others on a number of new programs and initiatives to help the Native American Communities enjoy the same level of economic prosperity as the rest of America. In this respect, the Tribes are no different than the rest of America--to promote their economic development basic infrastructure must first be in place. The President's initiative recognizes this fact. The bill we are introducing today addresses one element of that initiative--the need for basic transportation, including roads and transit. This bill will help promote transportation on every reservation in America by fully funding the Indian Reservation Roads Program. 
   First established in 1928, the Indian Reservation Roads program is one of the ways America meets its special responsibility to help Native Americans achieve self sufficiency and self determination. The goal of the Indian Reservation Roads program is to provide safe and economic means of transportation throughout Indian Country. Over the years, the program has been reauthorized and modified to help meet the Tribes' needs for basic transportation infrastructure. Most recently, the program was reauthorized for six years in 1998. The program is playing a critical role in economic development, self-determination, and employment of Native Americans in 33 states, including the Alaska Native Villages. 
   Currently, the reservation roads system comprises 25,700 miles of BIA- and Tribal-owned roads and 25,600 miles of state, county and local roads. There  are also 740 bridges on the system and even one ferry boat in the state of Washington. These public roads and transit system are, of course, used by everyone, not just Native Americans. To give the Senate some perspective of the magnitude of this system, the 51,000 total miles on the Indian Reservation Road system are more miles of public roads than there are in 15 states. If you consider only roads on the Federal Aid Highway system, the Indian road system has more miles than the state of California. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, many of the roads on the IRR system are among the worst in the nation. Of the 25,700 miles owned by BIA and Tribes, two thirds or 18,000 miles are not paved and 12,000 are unimproved dirt roads. Currently, 190 of the 740 bridges are listed as deficient, presenting serious safety concerns. The estimated backlog in road and bridge construction alone is $4 billion, and that doesn't even start to include transit needs. When roads are as bad as these, people can't get to work, children in school buses can't get to school, and seniors can't get to their doctors or hospitals. 
   Mr. President, in 1998, under the able guidance of the late Senator Chafee and Senator BAUCUS, Congress produced the Transportation Equity Act for the Twenty-First Century, or TEA-21. Through its many transportation programs, TEA-21 has already had major impacts on transportation, both highways and transit, in my state and around the country. The bill increased funding for state highway programs by an average of fifty percent above the levels in the previous six-year bill, ISTEA. Some states, because of population growth, are seeing increases of seventy, eighty and even ninety percent over the levels in ISTEA. 
   Unfortunately, funding for the Indian Reservation Roads Program did not receive the same magnitude of increase as TEA-21 provided for the states. 
   The full impact of TEA-21 on the Indian Road program has only recently become clear. In the last year of ISTEA, the program was funded at nearly $220 million. Now, under TEA-21, the authorization level was increased to $275 million, but for the first time, the program was subject to an obligation limitation, which reduces the funding this year by $35 million. 
   Thus, despite the massive infusion of transportation funding to the states, funding for Indian Country was inexplicably left behind. While the states averaged a fifty percent increase in annual highway funding, the tribes got less than half that--only about a twenty percent increase. Mr. President, though TEA-21 strived for equity in funding, we fell short of equity when it came to Native Americans. 
   Our bill is very simple. It provides a very narrow exemption to the obligation limitation in TEA-21 to assure that the full authorized amount, $275 million, is available to help meet critical transportation needs in Indian Country. The exemption would only apply to the remaining three years of TEA-21. A number of other programs in TEA-21 already have this exemption, and I believe that Congress should make good on its commitment to the tribes to provide the Indian Road Program the full amount authorized. This increase in funding would bring the program roughly up to parity with the increase that the state highway programs are already receiving in TEA-21. 
   Mr. President, I fully appreciate that a few Senators may have concerns about changing any aspect of the funding distribution in TEA-21. However, I believe a strong argument can be made in this unique case. First, nobody can dispute the incredible needs for transportation infrastructure in Indian Country, which suffers, as I said, a backlog of at least $4 billion. Second, the effect of our bill on all other highway programs in TEA-21, including state highway funding, is truly minimal; its impact amounts to only about one-tenth of one percent. Third, this is an issue of basic fairness. This change would provide both the states and the IRR roughly the same 50 percent increase in their transportation funding above the levels in ISTEA. And finally, I believe we made a commitment to the tribes when we authorized funding of $275 million. Congress should make good on that commitment. 
   In closing, I look forward to working with the distinguished Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator SMITH, and the Ranking Member, Senator 
   BAUCUS, as well as with the Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, Senator VOINOVICH, to correct this serious inequity in what is otherwise an outstanding transportation bill. 
   Mr. President, state highway departments recognize how important this program is to both the tribes and the states. I recently received a letter from Mr. Pete K. Rahn, Secretary of the New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department. In his letter, Secretary Rahn indicates his support for this bill. He goes on to say that the department recognizes that the bill will result in a slight reduction in the federal funds, which flow directly to the state of New Mexico. However, he continues, the department also recognizes that the benefit realized by the state as a whole, by the substantial increase in funds to the state's tribes for road improvements, far outweigh this reduction. I want to thank Secretary Rahn for expressing his support for this bill. 
   I have a similar letter addressed to Senator BAUCUS from Connie Niva, Chair of the State of Washington Transportation Commission, along with a resolution in support of lifting the obligation limitation from the Indian Reservation Road Program.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Ms. Mary Anaya of Roswell, New Mexico, who recently retired from the City Council after 18 years of service. As a long time resident, city councilor and community leader, Ms. Anaya has worked to better the Roswell community while holding true to her convictions with courage and grace. Though her tenacity alone is commendable, there is much more that deserves recognition. 
   Ms. Anaya, who represented Ward 5, is an example of a true representative, always putting her constituents' needs first. During the time she served on the council, the people of Ward 5 could depend on her thoughtful and considerate insight, knowing that their interests were being diligently represented. 
   Roswell's Ward 5 is comprised of many of the city's low-income residents. Ms. Anaya was a champion of issues her constituents faced on a daily basis. She was an advocate of quality of life issues, such as health care, housing and community development. She worked tirelessly to improve primary health care, and as a result of her hard work, a primary health care facility, La Casa de Buena Salud, was built in Roswell. Ms. Anaya was instrumental to the project's success. Furthermore, she spearheaded projects to rehabilitate housing for the elderly and low-income residents in Ward 5. Everyone deserves decent housing, and many of the citizens of Ward 5 benefitted from Ms. Anaya's work for this right. The creation of recreational areas was an issue that she dedicated much of her time to, making places for the community's children to play. She also worked to improve the city's infrastructure, making the streets safer for the entire Roswell community. Ms. Anaya always worked on behalf of the citizens of Roswell, and it is clear that because of her dedication, many people live a better life. 
   As a council member, Ms. Anaya was an advocate for Hispanic causes. When an English-only speaking rule in the school system threatened the educational opportunities of the students, Ms. Anaya rose to overturn the rule. She also fought to increase the hiring of Hispanics by the City of Roswell, and her efforts were rewarded when the City hired their first Hispanic employee. As the Roswell Daily Record states: ``Many people believe that over 50 years she and her husband, Pete, have helped advance Hispanic causes in Roswell more than anyone else in the city and have done it in a positive, productive way. We agree.'' 
   Mary Anaya deserves special recognition for her steadfast work on behalf of the citizens of Roswell. She performed her civic duties with pride and joy, always working with a smile. On the council, she was an asset to Roswell, and as a citizen, she is an asset to us all. Her work will be appreciated for generations to come.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we are now in the final hour of discussion about this nuclear waste-related bill. I thought, since I do not see Senator MURKOWSKI, the chairman of our committee, I would go ahead and make my statement indicating my position. I did speak yesterday on the Senate floor on this issue and laid out the reasons I will be voting against S. 1287 this morning. I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting against the bill. I do so for the simple reason that the bill as presently before us does not solve the problems of the nuclear waste program. In fact, it magnifies those problems. 
   Let me go through some of the specifics. 
   First, the bill does not reduce the liability that is borne by taxpayers for the program's failure. Instead of reducing that liability, this bill would increase that liability. The part of the bill that purports to offer the Department of Energy authority to settle lawsuits filed against it is arguably worse for the U.S. taxpayer than is current law. Other parts of the bill set new and arbitrary deadlines for the Department of Energy to ship nuclear waste to Nevada. We know today that the Department of Energy cannot meet those deadlines, and a vote for this bill is a vote for a new wave of litigation. We are already enmeshed in a great deal of litigation. A vote for this bill will bring us even more litigation. 
   Second, this bill does not speed up the decision of the Department of Energy on whether Yucca Mountain is suitable for a repository. In fact, the effect of the bill is to slow down that decision. By delaying the issuance of a radiation standard for Yucca Mountain by EPA, the bill would delay the process of finalizing whether Yucca Mountain will be a repository site. 
   The third point I want to make is that this bill does not make new funds available to the nuclear waste program so we can do an effective job of investigating Yucca Mountain and building a repository. Instead of making those funds available, which we should be doing, to the contrary, this bill caps the amount of funds the Department of Energy can collect and shifts the burden of paying for nuclear waste disposal from the beneficiaries of that nuclear power--that is, the people who received electricity from it--to everyone else in the country. 
   The fourth point I want to make is that the bill does not facilitate the movement of nuclear waste out of our individual States. In fact, this bill, as I read it, would impede the transportation of waste out of those States. Even if we managed to build a repository, if you are from a State that has nuclear waste, the bill contains an impossible hurdle to moving that waste out of your State. Read page 17 of the bill. You will find that no shipments of nuclear waste can occur anywhere until the Secretary of Energy has determined that emergency responders in every locality and every tribal entity along primary or alternative shipping routes for nuclear waste have met acceptable standards of training. 
   Right in that single provision are the seeds of two huge lawsuits that will keep nuclear waste in your State forever: A lawsuit over what constitutes acceptable training and a lawsuit over the reasonableness of the required determination by the Secretary of Energy that every volunteer fire or ambulance company in every locality that might see nuclear waste at some point is adequately trained. 
   Also, the requirements are vastly more restrictive on the Department of Energy than anything we have ever considered in the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant case. 
   In my view, such a certification by a Cabinet officer is a practical impossibility, not to mention an unprecedented intrusion by the Federal Government into local government responsibilities. 
   The fifth point is that this bill does not fix the problem of the one utility that is actually threatened by a shutdown of one of its plants because of the failings of the Department of Energy's nuclear waste program. I am speaking about the Northern States Power plant at Prairie Island. Nothing in this bill forestalls the shutdown of that plant which is expected in January of 2007. 
   One of the most disappointing developments of the past few days has been the stripping from the bill of the major provision that did make this bill worth passing, in my view, even though some of the flaws I have described are still in the bill. 
   The provision that was stripped was a provision giving the Department of Energy new authority and capability to resolve lawsuits that have been filed against it. We have been told this is what a group of seven Governors are insisting. They wanted us to drop this provision. 
   I studied a copy of their purported letter on this subject, and I find it a very strange document. The copy I have been given is not dated, it carries no signatures, and it is not on any official letterhead. In fact, it carries a heading that suggests it is a draft document. The letter is not about this bill. It is about testimony Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson gave about a year ago. 
   Some of the reasons given in the draft letter for opposing take title do not apply to this legislation. One argument in the letter complains that nuclear waste might be stored on riverfronts or lakes or seashores where, of course, the reality is one finds nuclear waste stored today in powerplants. 
   Specifically, an alternative to take title recommended in the letter is not contained in the bill on which we are about to vote, so the claim that by gutting this bill of its key provision --that is, its take title provision--we have satisfied seven Governors is certainly not supported by anything I have found in the document. 
   The other curious thing about what we have done to the bill during the course of our deliberations this week when we removed this take title provision is that we have converted its statutory instructions to the Department of Energy for settling industry lawsuits into something we know the States themselves publicly oppose. Without take title, all the Department of Energy can do is use money from the nuclear waste fund to give monetary and in-kind compensation to the utilities. That is what section 105 of the bill now authorizes. 
   Listen to what 51 State agencies from 35 different States told a District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals in January 1998 about this concept. This is a quote from their pleadings in that case:  
   The Court should act decisively to bar DOE from using the NWF [Nuclear Waste Fund] and ongoing fee payments to pay the costs and damages resulting from its deliberate noncompliance. Even the potential for DOE to consider such a course should be immediately invalidated.......  
   That is what the States said in 1998, and in this 
   legislation we instruct the Secretary of Energy to do exactly what 35 States pleaded with the court not to allow the Department of Energy to do. 
   The No. 1 remedy sought by the 35 States in this lawsuit, several pages after this statement, was a court order forbidding the Department of Energy from doing what section 105 of this bill now tells the Department of Energy to do. I am not making this statement based on some unsigned, undated document. We have a copy of the signed petition to the court here. I am glad to share that with any colleague who wants to review it between now and the time of our final vote. 
   On that document, many of us will see the signature of our Attorney General, our respective attorneys general from the States, or our representatives from the public utility commissions in our States. 
   The bottom line is this bill is not going to fix what is wrong with the Department of Energy's nuclear waste  program. On the contrary, it will move us further from a final solution we need to achieve. We should not pass the legislation. I hope my colleagues will join me in voting against it. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of our time.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me respond to a few of the points made in debate. The other Senator from Nevada also wishes to speak. 
   First, when my good friend from Wyoming made his comments, he made a point that we hear a lot on the floor, which is that the people who are opposed to this bill have offered no alternatives. That is not true. I think anyone who has followed the course of this legislation in committee knows that I offered an alternative in committee, which got a significant number of votes, which I believe would have been a substantial step forward. On each of the issues we are debating, I have offered alternative language. So, clearly, that is not the case. 
   Second, on the issue about the Department of Energy making no progress with the Yucca Mountain project, I don't think that is an accurate or fair criticism at this point. Clearly, they have not done all we wish had been done, but it is also true that Congress, most years, has not provided the funding requested for this project. 
   The Department of Energy is on target to characterize the Yucca Mountain facility. Five miles of tunnel have been built in the last few years. Numerous test facilities have been built. Progress is being made but not adequate progress. I am sure they are unhappy with the pace of progress. Of course, this legislation contains a delay in the EPA's ability to issue their standards. The take title is perhaps the part that is most confusing because there seems to be an underlying belief on the part of some Senators who have spoken that if we provide this take title authority so that the Department of 
   Energy can go in and take the title and settle these lawsuits that are pending, somehow or other that lessens the need for the Department of Energy to go ahead and move the waste to Yucca Mountain or to any other central facility. I don't see that myself. What Federal agency is going to want to permanently be the owner and caretaker of nuclear waste in 80 different locations? Clearly, DOE would not want that result. They would like to resolve the pending lawsuits, take title to the property, move ahead as quickly as possible to get the site characterized, and if it meets the standard, then go ahead with it. So I don't think this take title thing is what it is described to be. 
   On the land transfer issue, on which there has been some discussion, there were no land transfers in the committee-reported bill. I think we need to understand that. So there are no maps  and there was no discussion about it in the committee because it wasn't brought up there. Page 11 of the bill makes reference to ``maps dated February 1, 2000, and on file with the Secretary of Energy.'' We can't find any such maps. The Secretary of Energy can't find any such maps. We don't know what they are talking about. There is real confusion about the specifics of these land transfers. 
   The final point I will make on this--and I will defer to my colleague, Senator REID--is the chairman, understandably, in his concluding remarks, said if you vote for this bill, we will put this problem behind us. Mr. President, if that were true, I would be sorely tempted to vote for this bill. The truth is, we can vote for this bill, pass this bill, and the President can sign this bill, but not only are the problems not behind us, our problems would be compounded. Therefore, I will not be able to support the bill. I regret that we will not pass something that does, in fact, put the problem behind us. 
   I yield 3 minutes to my colleague from Nevada, Senator REID.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity before we vote to recognize a member of the Senate staff who has contributed a lot to the nuclear waste debate over the years. That person is Joe Barry, who has worked for Senator BRYAN for many years, and who apparently has actually had other duties not related to nuclear waste, as well. He is a tremendous professional who has helped keep the debate in the Senate on this issue on a high level of technical accuracy. I understand that he will be leaving for a position in the private sector in Boston when we break for this recess. Senators don't always agree with each other in debate. The search for relevant and accurate information and perspectives is essential to the legislative process, and is greatly helped when Members have highly competent professional staff like Joe. We will miss him in this chamber, and I would like to extend my personal best wishes to him for great success in the future.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me take the remaining time to commend our chairman, Senator MURKOWSKI, for his heroic efforts in trying  to come up with legislation that would be constructive and deal with this problem. This is not an easy issue to resolve. There are many points of view. 
   First, the subject is complex. The history of the legislation is certainly varied and difficult. 
   I certainly believe the chairman has worked in good faith to try to come up with a solution. As I stated several times this morning, I do not believe he has been successful in that regard. 
   I am not able to support the bill. 
   I think there is a lot of confusion that has surrounded our debate here on the floor. As to the whole notion that the Governors are fearful that waste would wind up remaining in their States if they did not drop this take title provision, I can say if they are worried that waste will remain, they have good grounds to be worried because it is going to remain in their States. Under current law, and under this legislation, if this legislation becomes law, the waste will remain in their States. The only question is, who is going to have ownership and responsibility for that waste. 
   We had proposed that the Department of Energy be given ownership and responsibility. We believe that would, if anything, desensitize the Department to move ahead more quickly on Yucca Mountain. I believe that is clearly the case. 
   The notion that anybody who opposes this bill is going to have to explain why they want waste to remain in their States is not the issue on which we are voting. Waste is going to remain in each of the States where it is now located unless and until we get the Yucca Mountain site characterized. I hope we do that quickly. I am doing all I can to support doing that quickly. I believe the waste should be moved to a permanent repository. I think that is clearly where we need to head. But the notion that this problem is going to be somehow solved by passing this bill is just not supported by anything. There is no logic to that. 
   We can pass this bill. This bill can be signed by the President. You can wind up 5 years from now trying to explain to people in your State why the waste is still sitting there because it is going to be there in 5 years regardless. 
   I think people need to understand that there is much less here than meets the eye. As far as this legislation is concerned, anyone who thinks this legislation is going to put any problem behind them is going to be sorely disappointed down the road. 
   In fact, I think the problems will be compounded if we enact this legislation and it were to become law. 
   I urge colleagues to oppose the bill and I yield the floor.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee for his remarks. I will make a few remarks this afternoon. There will be more in the morning. I will be back on the floor in the morning to express it in more detail. 
   First of all, for anybody who is watching this debate and trying to understand what is happening, it is not easy to understand because we have a complicated set of procedures we have followed around here to get to this point. 
   Yesterday, I outlined my reasons for opposing the manager's amendment that was being considered at that time. It was No. 2808. That was the manager's amendment on which we voted to invoke cloture, or to bring debate to a close. 
   I said at that time I believed the overall legislation, not that particular amendment but the overall legislation, was very important and was necessary to solve particular problems we have with our nuclear waste program, but that the particular provisions in that amendment that was before us yesterday did not solve those problems and, in fact, the particular language in that amendment created some additional  problems. That was why I could not support the language we were considering yesterday. 
   We have, of course, gone beyond that. We now have a new substitute amendment which has many changes in it. It was my hope that when we got to this substitute, it would fix the problems and concerns I had. I commend the chairman of the committee for a number of constructive improvements he did make in this substitute. Unfortunately, though, my own view is that while the new substitute makes improvements, there are still serious flaws and, more important than that even, there is a 
   major step backward, and that relates to the dropping of the take title provision. I will try to explain in more detail why I think the take title provision is important to us. 
   Let me also parenthetically say, I can sympathize with the statement the chairman makes about people who criticize and offer no alternative. Let me make it very clear, and I do not think this will be disputed by the chairman or anyone else, from the beginning of this process, I have not only expressed concerns, I have offered alternative language. In fact, when we were considering this bill in committee, I offered a complete substitute that was voted on by the committee and was defeated at that time but got quite a few votes. It is not as though we have refused to offer alternatives. We have offered alternatives. They have not been acceptable. I understand that. Each Senator votes their best judgment, and their best judgment was that the alternatives were not improvements. I disagree strongly with that judgment. 
   This new substitute on which we are getting ready to vote tomorrow morning--and we will, as I said before, have time to speak about it tomorrow morning; we will have an hour equally divided--eliminates the so-called take title provision which was the core of the committee-reported bill and was the focus of our efforts to reach a consensus with the administration. 
   Let me explain a little bit about what this take title provision is because that is probably not understood well by a lot of folks who have not spent a lot of time on this subject. 
   The Federal Government, particularly the Department of Energy, was obligated to actually take delivery of this nuclear waste that had been developed at these nuclear powerplants around the country by January 31, 1998. We had written that into the law. We said that is an obligation, the Department of Energy has to do it, and the Department of Energy entered into contracts with the various utilities around the country. 
   The map is not up right now, but every place you saw a dot on that map, there is a utility, and they have entered into contracts with the Department of Energy where the Department of Energy says: We will accept your waste at a particular time, and we will move it to a permanent repository. 
   We in Congress were way too optimistic, and the Department of Energy was too optimistic about how quickly they could do all this. They entered into these contracts. When January 31, 1998, came, the Department of Energy had no place to put this waste, so they defaulted on at least the first of those contracts. 
   The contracts become due. The obligation of the Department of Energy to pick up that waste and move it to a site becomes due each year to more and more utilities as we move forward. 
   So today the reality is we have a bunch of lawsuits, lawsuits in the Court of Claims, by utilities against the Department of Energy, saying: You owe us money; you are continuing to be in default; you should have picked this waste up; you have not picked the waste up; for every day you don't pick the waste up, you owe us some more money. 
   That is the situation. 
   The take title provision was a provision we worked out with Senator MURKOWSKI, with the Department of Energy, and with my staff to solve that problem. Basically, what it said was that we would give authority to the Department of Energy to enter into a contract--if a utility wanted to--whereby that utility would give up title to the waste, the Department of Energy would take title to the waste, and that would be done as part of a settlement of the litigation that is presently pending or that would otherwise be filed. 
   We provided a particular length of time in which utilities would have to decide whether they wanted to enter into negotiations to do this, whether they wanted to take advantage of this. There was nothing mandated. But it was a way out of this morass of litigation in which the Department of Energy now finds itself. 
   This bill we are going to vote on at 11 o'clock tomorrow morning eliminates that way out. That way out was a main reason for actually considering this bill. It was the core reason our committee reported the bill in the first place. It was the core reason I thought it was important for us to go ahead and pass the legislation. 
   The new substitute still does preserve the Department of Energy's authority to settle lawsuits arising from its failure to meet its contractual obligations to begin accepting this waste in 1998, by reducing the fees they pay or providing other forms of financial relief. That is still in the bill. But the Department already has that authority. We did not need to legislate that authority again. I think it is clear to anybody who will study it for a little bit, it is not an objectionable part of the bill but it is an unnecessary part of the bill. 
   What the Department lacks, and what we were trying to provide in the legislation, and what would benefit the country, the taxpayers, the utilities--particularly the taxpayers, because the taxpayers ultimately are going to wind up footing the cost of the judgments, whatever judgments are imposed on the Federal Government--but what clearly would benefit all of these groups and individuals I have talked about here is for the Department to take title to the utilities' waste and assume financial and legal liability for management pending the completion of the repository. 
   The truth is, Yucca Mountain is being characterized. It is not being done as quickly as we would like because we have not provided all the funds necessary to do it on a timely basis, but it is being characterized. If it passes muster in the final analysis, if it can meet the standards the Environmental Protection Agency establishes, and then is going to be used, it is still going to be 8 or 10 years from now before waste will actually be moved to that site. That is just the reality. It is not a question of whether you like it or dislike it; that is just the reality. 
   What we were trying to say is, during these 8 or 10 years, there is no reason why the Federal Government's liability for not moving that waste beginning in 1998 should continue to grow and to accrue. The new substitute drops that provision. The new substitute eliminates this way out for the Department of Energy, for the utilities, and, more importantly than anything, for the American taxpayers. 
   There are other provisions where this new substitute we will vote on tomorrow, like the original one, creates problems that would limit the ability of the Department of Energy's waste program to succeed. Let me mention a few. 
   The substitute imposes deadlines on the Department of Energy, saying the Department must ship spent fuel to Nevada on a schedule that the Department of Energy says they cannot meet. 
   I know that is what we did before. We set a deadline. At that time, the Department of Energy did not say they could not meet it. But at any rate, we set a deadline they did not meet and now we have litigation. 
   If we pass this bill, we are in danger of setting another deadline or another series of deadlines which this time the Department says they cannot meet--of course, prompting a lot of new litigation as a result of that. So it holds the Government and the taxpayers liable if the Department of Energy misses those deadlines. 
   There are also some broader issues affecting the program we have been unable to address in this bill that I think are important to consider. One example is Northern States Power's problem. This gets a little bit arcane, but I do not think too arcane. 
   Under Minnesota law, Northern States Power will have to 
   shut down the Prairie Island nuclear powerplant in January of 2007 if the Department of Energy has not picked up Prairie Island's waste by that date. That is Minnesota law I just paraphrased for you. The manager's substitute could require  the Department to enter into a ``backup'' storage contract with Northern States Power to take the Prairie Island waste to Yucca Mountain so that Prairie Island can keep operating. The problem is, the Department of Energy will not be able to honor that contract by January of 2007, so the provision does not prevent the reactor from shutting down. The truth is, we have put in a requirement that the Department of Energy cannot meet. 
   There are also funding problems besetting our nuclear waste program. As I said yesterday, I think this is one of the most critical problems facing the Yucca Mountain program. The substitute does nothing to make the balances in the nuclear waste fund more readily available or even to make deferred payments for waste generated before 1983, the so-called one-time fee under current law available to the program. I believe this latter provision would not score under our budget rules since it is currently outside the 10-year scoring window. That is pretty arcane, but it is an important provision. 
   By dropping the take title provision and by failing to make this simple budget adjustment, in my view, the manager's substitute fails to capture and apply this important source of funds to the program when it is urgently needed. 
   None of us is ever 100-percent satisfied with any vote we cast here in the Senate. We all have to compromise, to give things away, to settle for less than a perfect bill. Senator MURKOWSKI has certainly shown his willingness to do that. I, too, believe I have done that and shown my willingness to make concessions on key issues--issues such as funding, on capping the nuclear waste fee, on potentially shifting the funding burden to taxpayers, conveying 76,000 acres of Federal lands to Nevada localities. These are all things in the bill that I have not thought were really appropriate, but I am certainly willing to compromise on them in order to reach agreement. 
   But as I look at the new amended bill on which we are going to vote tomorrow, and I try to weigh it in relation to the Nation and the taxpayers--what the Nation and the taxpayers of the country are getting versus what they are giving up--I find that the balance that is required for me to support the end result is not there. Legislators, as doctors, need to obey the rule: First do no harm. When I look at the substitute on which we are going to vote tomorrow, to my mind, it does more harm than good. Unfortunately, as a result, I will be compelled to vote against it. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, as well as the Senator from Alaska. 
   Let me first discuss where we are procedurally because I think it is important to put my comments in context. We are going to vote at 2:30 on a cloture motion to proceed to consider an amendment I will be discussing in my remarks. There have been substantial discussions between the chairman and me since that amendment was distributed last Friday. It is my understanding there are going to be major changes made to this amendment after the cloture vote occurs. We will be able to see those. We have not seen them in writing yet, but we have had extensive discussion. 
   I want to make it clear that I will raise serious questions about the bill on which we are voting cloture. At the same time, I will indicate I support cloture so we can move the process forward and I hope we can find in the course of this debate a way to resolve the issues to which I will allude in these comments. 
   The issue of disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste has been debated in the Senate, in one form or another, as long as I have been a Member. 
   Nuclear waste is a serious issue that demands serious attention by all Senators. It is a problem that is national in scope. 
   It is also a particular responsibility of the Federal Government. After all, it was the Federal Government that proposed, beginning with the Atoms for Peace Program in the Eisenhower administration, to develop the peaceful uses of nuclear power. The problems of disposal of spent nuclear fuel that we face today are the legacy of our past laws and decisions. 
   There are serious problems facing the national nuclear waste program that merit attention now, in this Congress. 
   I have some important disagreements with the chairman. I will go through those in some detail here, about the substitute amendment that is going to be voted on, on cloture, because I believe that particular amendment is fatally flawed in several respects. But I also believe the chairman is doing the right thing by pushing the issue to decision and by forcing the Senate and the Congress to grapple with the issue of how to store our Nation's nuclear waste. 
   Let me point out what I think are some of the important nuclear waste-related issues that call out for our attention and require us to take some action, if we can, in this Congress. 
   First, ratepayers have paid over $8 billion in fees to the nuclear waste fund. That money which has been paid in has earned about $2 billion in interest. Only $5 billion of that total of $10 billion has been spent on the program. Our current budget rules and accounting principles make it nearly impossible to give the program, each year, the appropriation it deserves and requires. For example, in fiscal year 1996, the President asked for $640 million for DOE's Yucca Mountain program. Congress appropriated $315 million, less than half of that. 
   As a result, the program had to abandon a comprehensive program plan that was less than 2 years old and go through yet one more strategic planning exercise to figure out how to cope with the inadequate funding they had been provided. 
   The result of all this is to create considerable concern on the part of many about this nuclear waste program, in particular the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, which has stated the program is not making adequate technical progress at Yucca Mountain in order to make a defensible determination of its suitability in the next few years. 
   I think that is a concern we need to take seriously in the Senate. Not surprisingly, the utilities themselves and the public utility commissions and the States that are paying in $600 million each year and seeing only a fraction of that being spent, and the possibility looming there will be further delays because we lack the technical answers to questions about site suitability, are also upset by the state of affairs, and they have every right to be. 
   Let me go on to another reason why we need to address this issue in this Congress. The Department of Energy did not meet the January 31, 1998, deadline to which Chairman MURKOWSKI referred. That is a deadline to dispose of spent nuclear fuel. Not only did we not meet that, we are way behind the original schedule in building the repository.  Utilities and ratepayers are beginning to make plans to pay for onsite storage for spent fuel in addition to what they would otherwise have needed if the Department of Energy had met its deadline. 
   While many thought the 1998 deadline was unrealistic when it was first picked as a target date, nobody thought we would miss it by as wide a margin as we have. Lawsuits have been filed. The Department of Energy has concluded it does not have the legal authority to settle the suits by directly addressing the needs of utilities to do something with the fuel that is on their hands. So additional legislation is required to deal with that issue. Hopefully, we can come up with an agreement on that legislation before we conclude action on this bill. 
   We could choose to ignore the problem, but I believe we would do so somewhat at our own peril. Lawsuits are working their way through the Court of Federal Claims with contradictory results at the lower levels of the court, so no one can say how the courts will ultimately rule on the Department of Energy's contractual obligations--but the Federal courts have surprised the Government previously in recent years with rulings in favor of the utilities. 
   A third reason we need to deal with this in this Congress is the transportation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste is a legitimate concern to the communities through which it will travel on its way from the nuclear plants where it is located to any repository. This is true nationwide. It is true in my own State of New Mexico. The standards governing shipment of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste are currently below those for less radioactive waste streams, such as the waste going to the WIPP project in my own State. 
   This situation arises because Congress instituted higher standards for packaging and shipment of transuranic waste in the WIPP Land Withdrawal Act of 1992. The WIPP provisions have, so far, had some success. One could argue whether there are lessons learned that should be applied to spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste in the form of even stricter requirements than for WIPP, since spent fuel and high-level waste plausibly involve greater risks to the public, in case of an accident. It certainly does not make much sense, though, and it is not in the public interest to ignore the advances in standards and transportation procedures that have occurred since passage of the original Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. 
   These issues I mentioned speak for themselves. It is possible to build a good set of amendments to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, and to deal with these problems. The amendment we are going to vote cloture on does not do that. I hope the substitute we can come up with will. 
   Let me cite some areas where we have agreement because there are some. Clearly, those need to be mentioned. Anyone who looks at the substitute amendment and compares it to the original bill introduced in the Congress has to admit, and I readily do, that although there are still crucial flaws in the bill, major progress has been made on a number of topics--progress toward getting a decent bill. These include abandoning the plan to have interim storage in Nevada while the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is deliberating on the license application for the permanent repository. That was major progress for which I commend the chairman. 
   Second, embracing instead a plan to have the Department of Energy authorized to take title to fuel where it can work out settlement agreements with utilities, that is also major progress in my view. And making a significant move toward accepting the EPA's final rulemaking authority, that is important. I hope that is something to which we can finally agree. 
   But there are areas of disagreement. Let me mention those very briefly. They include restrictions on the EPA standard-setting process; second, inadequate transportation safeguards--these are concerns with the bill which we are voting cloture on; third, one-sided take-title provisions--I can go into detail on these; fourth, the support for foreign reprocessing of nuclear fuel which, to my mind, is not a good investment of taxpayer dollars. If there is research to be done, we should go ahead and do it, and there is clearly research to be done. And fifth, neglect for the pressing funding needs of the program, that also is not addressed. 
   Preserving the integrity of the EPA rulemaking process for the Yucca Mountain radiation standard is one of the threshold issues in this bill. The chairman's substitute dilutes both EPA's rulemaking authority for the remainder of this administration as well as changing the substantive standard of protection. Right now, the standard EPA has to follow is to protect public health and safety and the environment. Under the chairman's substitute, EPA, for the next 16 months, would be able to do so only to the extent that it would allow the agency to meet the standard of being ``attainable'' at Yucca Mountain. This effectively stacks the deck in the standard-setting process. It also, in my view, may create a more lasting problem of legitimacy for the standard and for the program as a whole in the minds of disinterested citizens. 
   In New Mexico, we have had experience with EPA standard setting for radioactive waste disposal facilities. EPA both set the compliance criteria for the waste isolation pilot plant, or WIPP, and certified that the faculty, as built, met those criteria. It was a long and arduous process. But in the end, the fact that EPA was able to do the job on the merits was important to the facility gaining legitimacy in the minds of most New Mexicans. 
   I believe that EPA can do a fair job of setting a standard for Yucca Mountain, and I will continue in that belief until someone shows me the record in this rulemaking that indicates the contrary. Surely, the draft rule published by EPA last August, which laid out a number of options for such a standard, cannot be characterized as arbitrary or capricious. DOE, the NRC, and the National Academy of Sciences have taken exception to a number of options and approaches in the rule, as is their right. They have put comments in the rulemaking file that EPA will have to grapple with honestly, if the agency wants to see its standard survive judicial review. 
   Given this, I would not favor either transferring the job of EPA to another agency, or giving some other Federal agency an effective veto over EPA's discretion. The bill reported from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did the former, and the chairman's substitute did the latter. This is a major reason for my opposition to this substitute. 
   A second major concern that I have with the substitute is its approach toward the transportation of nuclear waste. Transportation of nuclear waste is a matter of concern to many members of the general public. The chairman's substitute does not address these concerns adequately, in my view. There is no independent oversight of the design and manufacture of the shipping canisters in which nuclear waste will travel. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has testified before the Senate Energy Committee that it lacks adequate regulatory authority over DOE shipments. Unfortunately, this gap in regulatory authority is not addressed in the bill or the substitute. What is in the bill looks like an excessively ornate structure of plans that conflict with one another and probably give rise to lost of litigation. It is hard to see how that sort of extra bureaucracy protects public safety. 
   In addition to provisions that don't effectively protect the safety of citizens living along routes where nuclear waste will be transported, the chairman's substitute contains provisions that cancel out certain routes in certain states, by means of criteria such as maximum downgrade percentages. I would oppose 
    this sort of provision on principle, as I have consistently opposed carve-out amendments on prior nuclear waste bills. In this particular case, my own State of New Mexico is being particularly disadvantaged, as trucking routes in Colorado are canceled out, thereby shifting truck shipments through Wyoming on I-80 and New Mexico on I-25 and I-40. Speaking for New Mexicans, I can think of few worse places for a truck of nuclear waste than on the interchange, in the center of Albuquerque, of I-25 and I-40. New Mexicans call it the ``Big I,'' and it is legendary for its poor design. 
   A third major flaw in this bill concerns the ground rules that the bill  lays out for the Department of Energy in its negotiations with the utilities over taking title to spent nuclear fuel. The only reason to have a take-title mechanism is to respond to DOE's non-performance with respect to specific contracts. Yet, the language of the chairman's substitute contains several changes to what the committee reported last spring on these lines. All these changes are in the direction of clouding the issue of what DOE is responsible for. The probable result of this blurring of responsibility is that numerous utilities will claim that the Congress intends for DOE to go beyond making them whole for specific non-performance on specific contracts. The bill for this extra scope for DOE's relief of the utilities will be borne by either the general taxpayer or the Nuclear Waste Fund, and both sources of funds are a problem. In the former case, it is not fair. In the latter instance, the Waste Fund is already supposed to pay for the repository and the legitimate costs of taking title. It is not reasonable to create a scenario where utilities can claim that Congress intended DOE to pay more than those legitimate costs associated with contractual breaches. 
   A fourth major flaw in the bill is its authorization for DOE to spend taxpayer dollars to fund foreign reprocessing and transmutation activities in countries that are not willing to pay for such activities themselves. I do not know why we should have blanket authority for DOE to spread reprocessing technology worldwide in this manner. Most other countries that have looked at the sort of reprocessing and transmutation that would be supported by this bill have concluded that there are serious technical challenges that will take decades to resolve. Our own National Academy of Sciences agreed in its 1996 report on ``Nuclear Wastes: Technologies for Separations and Transmutation.'' 
   Finally, the fifth major flaw in the bill is its lack of attention to the most critical problem facing the Yucca Mountain program--the lack of funding to characterize the mountain properly, or to build the repository, if authorized. The chairman's substitute does nothing either to make the balances in the Nuclear Waste Fund more readily available to fund the work needed to demonstrate the mountain's suitability and licensability, or even to make a special one-time fee under current law for certain utilities directly available to the program. The latter provision would not score under our budget rules, since it is currently outside the 10-year scoring window. If DOE took title to fuel from certain utilities, it might be able to collect the one-time fee early, but without special legislation, the fee would vanish into the Treasury without a trace, and without helping the program. 
   Let me get to a conclusion so others can speak before we go into recess for our caucuses. I do think this issue of adequate funding so the program can go forward, so the site can be characterized, is absolutely crucial. I hope very much the Senate will address that before we pass a bill or before we conclude action on an amendment on the Senate floor in the form of a substitute. 
   Let me conclude my remarks by reiterating the basic principles behind my opposition to the substitute amendment. These are things which I hope very much can be resolved in the alternative that is now being prepared and is going to be available for us to review this afternoon. We ought to focus, in this legislation, on making the current program work. That means, No. 1, giving the Department of Energy the tools it needs to resolve current litigation over its failure to meet past contractual obligations. I hope we can do that in an effective way. 
   Second, it means upgrading transportation standards for spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste. Again, I hope we can do that in the legislation we finally act on. 
   Third, it means making the needed funds available to characterize Yucca Mountain, and to build Yucca Mountain if it is licensed by the NRC. I hope we can act on that. 
   The fourth item is, the program does not need to suffer a loss of public legitimacy by legislatively stacking the deck against EPA's ability to carry out its statutory authority on protecting health and safety. We can find a solution to that. I hope very much we do. 
   Finally, the fifth item I want to mention is the program does not need extra doses of paper-pushing bureaucracy and bureaucracy related to transportation of nuclear waste, accompanied with unrealistic deadlines for putting waste on the road. 
   We found that we, American taxpayers, have incurred substantial liability because of our writing into law deadlines which turned out to be unrealistic before. Let's not make that same mistake again in legislation on the Senate floor this week. 
   I did not support the chairman's amendment even though I appreciate his attempts to improve it. 
   He has been negotiating in good faith to improve this amendment, and I greatly appreciate that. We have not seen that alternative substitute provision, so I cannot say whether we have reached agreement or not on the various items I have identified, but I hope we have made progress on each of them. 
   It is important to move the process forward. It is important to come to closure on this bill in a bipartisan way. This is not a partisan matter. I hope all Senators will support the effort to invoke cloture so we can move ahead, and then I hope we can all work in good faith to improve the basic bill we are considering before we have to vote on a final bill. 
   Obviously, I could not support a vote in favor of the final bill on which we are invoking cloture, but I hope before the process concludes I can support a piece of legislation that will solve the problems I have enumerated. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman, Senator MURKOWSKI, yielding. 
   First, I compliment him and, of course, Senator AKAKA, who is the moving force behind this legislation on the Democratic side. I think this legislation, S. 1052, is a very important and overdue piece of legislation. 
   I know both Senator AKAKA and Senator MURKOWSKI have worked tirelessly and persistently to bring these issues to our attention. I compliment them on that. I will give a short statement, and then Senator AKAKA will be managing the bill on the Democratic side. I am sure he has much more information to provide on the legislation. 
   Both Senator MURKOWSKI and Senator AKAKA traveled to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and witnessed the problems there firsthand. I am very glad to join them as a cosponsor on this important piece of legislation. Our committee held several hearings over the years and established a record concerning the very serious problems that exist in the CNMI. Moreover, three successive administrations from both parties, beginning with the Reagan administration, have expressed concerns about the situation in the CNMI. Many problems have been identified, and they have been discussed over many years. 
   However, clearly the central problem relates to this immigration issue. S. 1052 only addresses immigration. This bill represents a modest step toward implementing the reforms that are long overdue. The current immigration system, administered by the local government, is inconsistent with longstanding U.S. immigration policy in several respects. Let me just detail some of that. 
   U.S. policy, first of all, does not allow the importation of temporary workers for permanent jobs. Second, it allows people coming into the United States for permanent jobs to have the opportunity to become participating members of society, including the right to vote and to be eligible for citizenship. Local CNMI immigration law not only allows large-scale use of temporary alien workers for permanent jobs, it also prohibits temporary alien workers from settling permanently in the CNMI and becoming U.S. citizens. 
   The most disturbing result of the CNMI's current immigration system is the documented, consistent and even increasing human rights abuses which these alien workers suffer. Moreover, despite promises of the American dream, alien laborers coming to CNMI often sign contracts waiving rights and freedoms guaranteed to U.S. workers. These include the right to change employers, the right to participate in religious and political activities, and in some cases even the right to marriage. 
   This bill before us is not a controversial bill. It should not be a controversial bill. It was reported from the Energy and Natural Resources Committee by a voice vote with no dissenting opinions expressed. Last Congress, the committee reported a similar bill. In order to address concerns by the local CNMI government that the bill will adversely affect their economy, the bill also contains many special provisions. Among these special provisions is one that requires the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Labor to provide financial and technical assistance to help them diversify their economy and train local workers. 
   I hope the Senate will act quickly and pass this bill. I again compliment Senator AKAKA and Senator MURKOWSKI for their leadership on this important matter. 
   I yield the floor. I know at some point Senator AKAKA wishes to speak to the matter as well.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I wanted to take a few minutes to talk about an exciting new project that was announced recently--Intel's ``Teach to the Future'' program. Intel has joined forces with Microsoft and a number of other companies to train 100,000 of our elementary and secondary school teachers in how to use information technology to improve what our kids learn. Intel will invest $100 million in this project and Microsoft will contribute more than $300 million in software, its largest donation ever. Intel and its partners deserve to be strongly commended by the Senate and the Congress for their forward thinking efforts. 
   The goal of Intel's Teach to the Future Program is to train 100,000 American teachers in 1,000 days. This year Intel will make grants to 5 regional training agencies in Northern California, Oregon, Texas, and Arizona that will each train 100 Master Teachers in a 40-hour curriculum on effectively applying computer technology to improve student learning. This award-winning curriculum was developed over the last two years by the Institute for Computer Technology; over 80% of the teachers who've been trained by it felt that it enhanced their student's learning. These 500 Master Teachers will return to their school districts, embedding the expertise locally by training an additional 20 teachers. By the end of this year, 10,000 teachers will be trained. Next year, the program will expand to include my home state of New Mexico, along with Washington State, Massachusetts, Utah, Southern California, Washington, DC, and elsewhere in order to train 40,000 teachers. Finally, the program will again expand to train 50,000 teachers in 2002. 
   We have been working hard on the federal, state, and local levels to provide schools with computers, software and access to the Internet. I authored several programs in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 1994 that have gone a long way toward these goals. Studies of the existing uses of technology in schools demonstrate, however, that these investments have not been optimized because teachers have not been adequately trained in its use--particularly its curriculum-based use. The availability of hardware is irrelevant if teachers are not properly trained, because it's teachers who teach, not technology. 
   Only 20% of today's teachers feel really prepared to use technology in the classroom. Given the dynamic nature of technology and the influx of new teachers we expect to enter the classroom in the next few years, it's easy to see how this problem could get worse if we don't focus on it. The average school spends less--often significantly less--than 1% of its technology funds on training. The Department of Education, the CEO Forum and other experts have determined that the appropriate investment should be closer to 30%. 
   In response to this need, I have worked closely with Senator Murray to secure funding for a pre-service technology training program in the education budget. As we approach reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, I also have made teacher training the centerpiece of my proposal for reauthorization of the Education Technology programs in ESEA--``S. 1604: the Technology for Teaching Act.'' Even with the continued commitment of companies like Intel, we must provide federal support and leadership for technology training for all teachers in all fifty states. 
   Intel's ``Teach to the Future'' project is an outstanding example of good corporate citizenship; one that should be instructive for politicians, educators, and corporations across the nation. Intel and its corporate partners clearly recognize that--just as information technology has revolutionized the workplace and the marketplace--it also promises to transform the schoolhouse. Perhaps, more importantly, however, these companies recognize that we must transform the schoolhouse in order to continue the economic revolution. We in Congress must support their efforts by increasing the federal commitment to educational technology and teacher training in this area.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, along with Senator DOMENICI, which will move us toward resolving a long standing issue of great controversy in my State of New Mexico. 
   Today marks the anniversary of one of the most significant dates in the creation of modern America. On this date one hundred and fifty-two years ago, our government and the government of Mexico entered into an agreement which ended a bloody war, and which brought a huge swath of territory into the United States. 
   The addition of this new territory, which became the American Southwest, forever changed the makeup of our nation, its place on the world stage, and its culture. The infusion of a large Hispanic population and a myriad of Native American communities into fabric of American society enriched the diversity of country and strengthened the dynamism of our culture. 
   It is day which should be one for celebration. A day in which New Mexicans should reflect on the confluence of cultures which make up our state. It is a day to remember the sweat and grit of the people who traveled north up El Camino Real (the Royal Road) passing through one area that was so arduous that it was known as La Jornada del Muerte (the Journey of Death), and those who came west over the Santa Fe trail to reach New Mexico and who, together with the Pueblo, Apache, and Navajo peoples who had already carved a life out of this arid land, built our modern culture. 
   It is a day for celebration, but unfortunately it is also a day which recalls great pain for many. For that agreement between nations which established the American Southwest, the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, also carried with it a promise to the new citizens of America. That promise was that their ownership of lands established under Spanish and Mexican law would be respected and validated by their new government. Many who would be celebrating today do not believe that that promise was kept. The serious questions that have been raised concerning the validation of Spanish and Mexican community land grant claims in New Mexico cast a cloud over this day, and a cloud over our national honor. 
   Given the long history of dispute over community land grant claims in New Mexico, and the large amount of disputed land, a credible neutral analysis of the United States' implementation of the Treaty has been needed. To that end, Senator DOMENICI and I have requested that the General Accounting Office review the United States' legal obligations under the Treaty and whether the Federal government met those obligations with regard to community land grant claims. 
   This will be the first national study of the issue, and it is overdue. Given how long it has taken for the heirs of these land grants to get a credible review of their claims, it is that important that this study not end up gathering dust on some shelf. If the GAO finds that the United States denied  these communities their rights under the treaty, then it is imperative that the Federal government develop a remedy to resolve this issue. 
   Therefore I, along with Senator DOMENICI, am introducing a bill today which will move us in that direction. This bill would require that, should the GAO find that the United States has failed to meet its Treaty obligations, the Justice Department prepare for the President a list of methods to remedy the problem, and that the President must propose to Congress his preferred remedy. 
   Unlike the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, which was an agreement between nations, this bill represents a promise directly to land grant heirs that their claim will be fully considered by the United States Government. I hope we can pass this measure, and make that promise to them.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the appropriation for the Department of Education includes an additional $134 million, added during final negotiations over the bill, to promote school accountability and improvement under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, which funds educational services to educationally disadvantaged children. These funds will provide critical resources to schools most in need--those in need of improvement and identified for corrective action under Title I. 
   Dedicated funds are necessary to develop improvement strategies and to hold schools accountable for continuous student improvement. The federal government directs over $8 billion dollars of federal funding to provide critical support programs for disadvantaged students under Title I, but the accountability provisions in Title I have not been adequately implemented due to insufficient resources. Title I authorizes state school support teams to provide support for schoolwide programs and to provide assistance to schools in need of improvement through activities such as professional development or identifying resources for changing instruction and organization. In 1998, only eight states reported that school support terms have been able to serve the majority of schools identified as in need of improvement. Less than half of the schools identified as being in need of improvement in 1997-98 reported that this designation led to additional professional development or assistance. Schools and school districts need additional support and resources to address weaknesses soon after they are identified, promote a progressively intensive range of interventions and continuously assess the results of interventions. 
   The money provided in this appropriations bill can be used to ensure  that school districts have necessary resources available to implement the corrective action provisions of Title I, by providing immediate, intensive interventions to turn around low-performing schools. The types of intervention that the school district could provide using these funds include:

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in celebration of American Indian Heritage Month I rise today to celebrate the accomplishments of one remarkable young man Notah Begay III. You may have heard of Mr. Begay as he was a two-time PGA tour winner this season with victories at the Reno-Tahoe Open and the Michelob Championship. This is a true accomplishment by any standard, but even more significant when you consider that he is only 27. I rise today to honor Mr. Begay because of the fact that he is the first full-blooded Native American to play on the Professional Golf Association Tour. 
   Notah's path to success is uncommon among his peers in the PGA. He didn't grow up in a privileged environment. While the Begay family was not poor, they did not have the resources to pay for costly private golf lessons for young Notah. In exchange for golf balls and practice time, Notah often woke up at 5:00 AM to move carts, wash range balls and serve as an all-around gopher at the city-owned course in Albuquerque. And when Notah visited his grandparents on the Navajo Reservation, the determined young golfer would hit golf balls off of the hard clay dirt of the reservation. Still today, the Navajo Nation does not have one golf course on its 25,000 square miles. 
   Despite his uncommon beginnings, Notah has been truly successful at every level of competition. During high school, Notah led his high school basketball team to back-to-back state championships. But more impressive, he was the No. 2 junior golfer in the nation. 
   After high school, Notah traveled west to Stanford University. Although Notah's teammate, Tiger Woods, is often spotlighted by the media, it was Notah and his Stanford teammates who won the 1994 NCAA Championship trophy, one year before Mr. Woods joined the team. Notah played an integral role by shooting a 62 in the second round of the Championship tournament, a tournament record that remains today. And while many great college athletes do not finish their studies, I am very proud to say that Notah is a fellow graduate of Stanford, earning a degree in economics. 
   Notah turned pro after college and has been quickly rising in the PGA ranks. At the Nike Dominion Open this year he became only the third player in history to shoot a 59 on a U.S. pro tour. He joins Al Geiberger and Chip Beck as the only players to score such a feat. Because of his outstanding success this year, Notah is a candidate for top rookie honors. 
   Notah has dedicated himself to providing new opportunities for young Native Americans. By working to raise money to establish golf programs at reservation schools and seeking donations of golf equipment for kids who could never afford the costly clubs, Notah is providing the tools that may lead to more great golfers with Native American roots. 
   In some ways, Notah Begay's success is not surprising. He is half Navajo and half Pueblo Indian and he follows a tradition of courage and strength, exemplified by his grandfather. Notah's grandfather, Notah Begay I, was one of the famous Code Talkers during World War II. The Code Talkers relayed sensitive information for the United States military through a code based on the Navajo language. They proved to be a critical component of the military intelligence during World War II. 
   Notah's unprecedented success has shown a generation of young Americans that with hard work and dedication, any dream is achievable. The success Notah has earned is equal only to the inspiration he provides for Native American youth in my home state of New Mexico and across the country. I commend him not only for his golf success, but also for his commitment to the youth of New Mexico. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation which will end the practice of charging States for costs the Federal Government incurs in managing Federal mineral leases. 
   The Mineral Revenue Payments Clarification Act of 1999 will eliminate net receipts sharing, allowing Federal agencies to more rationally and fairly apportion to States their share of Federal mineral revenues. 
   Since enactment of the Mineral Leasing Act in 1920, Congress has determined that it was fair and appropriate to share with States a portion of the money received by the United States for Federal mineral leases located within the State. Under current law, for most mineral leases the State share is 50 percent, except for Alaska which receives 90 percent. 
   In 1993, a permanent provision was added to the Omnibus Appropriations Act that requires the Department of the Interior to deduct from a State's share 50 percent of the Federal Government's costs of administering Federal mineral leases within that State. This new requirement substantially lowers the amounts States receive, but was added without either explanation or justification as to why such a deduction is either fair or appropriate. 
   Furthermore, the statutory procedures for figuring these deductions are cumbersome to the point of being unworkable. The Federal agencies charged with administering these requirements have found them difficult, and sometimes impossible, to implement in any consistent fashion. 
   In November of 1997, the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior found that the Department had inaccurately calculated the costs involved in administering the Federal onshore mineral leasing program, resulting in substantial overcharges to States. This issue has yet to be fully resolved by the Department of the Interior. 
   Needless to say, this complicated and unjustified provision has been controversial with the States and unpopular with the Federal agencies charged with administering it. It penalizes States while creating administrative nightmares for the Federal Government. It is time to do away with this unwieldy provision. 
   Therefore, I am introducing The Mineral Revenue Payments Clarification Act of 1999, which will eliminate this provision and provide that States' shares of payments under Federal mineral leases will not be reduced by administrative or other costs incurred by the United States. I believe that this will return a system that is both fair, and capable of being administered in a reasonable fashion.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will vote against the Wellstone-Dorgan agribusiness merger moratorium because I believe the solution to this problem is not a temporary moratorium. Instead, the Department of Justice should enforce the anti-trust laws that now exist to prevent the problems arising from industry concentration. That's why, last February, I signed a letter to the President, along with 22 of my colleagues, urging the administration to conduct a full-scale detailed examination of the impacts of market concentration on our nation's family farmers and ranchers. We requested that the study be completed within six months and the findings reported to Congress. We have yet to receive that study. I will continue to press the Department of Justice to exercise particular diligence in reviewing proposed mergers or acquisitions involving major agribusiness firms. 
   Our family farmers and ranchers need and deserve our full support. I have worked hard to provide emergency funding in times of natural disaster, and to address the economic disasters created by trade and world economic conditions. I am working to reform the federal crop insurance program to address the needs of specialty crop producers. And I will continue to advocate for full adherence to existing anti-trust laws, and the procedures for investigating market concentration in agriculture.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, along with my colleagues, Senators THOMPSON and KENNEDY, a bill to establish compensation programs for workers at Department of Energy sites, contractors, and vendors who are ill because they were exposed to severe chemical and radioactive hazards while on the job. This bill, the Energy Employees' Compensation Act, will recognize three of the more egregious workplace hazards that were allowed to exist over the years at DOE facilities. 
   The first of these situations was the exposure of workers at DOE sites and vendors to beryllium, a metal that has been used for the past 50 years in the production of nuclear weapons. Even very small amounts of exposure to beryllium can result in the onset of Chronic Beryllium Disease (CBD), an allergic lung reaction resulting in lung scarring and loss of lung function. The only treatment is the use of steroids to control the inflammation. There is no cure. Once a person has been exposed to beryllium, he or she has a lifelong risk of developing CBD. While only 1 to 6 percent of exposed people will generally develop CBD, some work tasks are associated with disease rates as high as 16 percent. Beryllium was used at 20 DOE sites, including sites in my state of New Mexico. An estimated 20,000 workers may have been exposed, including 1,000-1,500 in New Mexico. To date, DOE screening programs have identified 146 cases of CBD among current and former workers, although the number can be expected to grow. The people who are affected by this disease were typically blue-collar workers at these facilities. They are not covered by the federal workers' compensation system, and the various state workers' compensation programs are not well geared to deal with chronic occupational illnesses like CBD. I believe that, since these workers became exposed to beryllium while working in the defense of their country, the country owes them something in return, should they come down with Chronic Beryllium Disease. That is why I will fight to help the workers and their families in New Mexico and elsewhere through this part of the bill. 
   The second situation which this bill seeks to remedy occurred at the DOE Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Kentucky. Here, workers were unknowingly exposed to plutonium and other highly radioactive materials that were present in recycled uranium sent to the plant by the former Atomic Energy Commission. The AEC and the managers of the plant knew about this hazard in the 1950s, but enhanced protection for workers at Paducah was not implemented until 1992. This is an unbelievable and outrageous error. These workers deserve full compensation for the health effects of exposures that they were subject to without their knowledge. 
   The third situation that this bill addresses occurred to 55 workers at the DOE's East Tennessee Technology Park, who also suffered exposures to radiation and hazardous materials that have resulted in occupational illness. Through this provision, DOE can make a grant of $100,000 to each worker, if medical experts find that it is appropriate. 
   The Department of Energy, under Secretary Richardson's leadership, is facing up to some of its past failures to properly oversee worker health and safety at its facilities. It is a tragedy that we have to introduce and pass bills like this one, particularly in cases where it seems so clear that the problems could have been prevented. But this bill is the right thing to do for workers who served their country and expected that they would be kept safe from occupational injury. As the Congress considers this bill, I hope that we also remain vigilant to the ongoing challenges to worker safety and health at DOE facilities, particularly in the parts of the Department that are being reorganized as a result of legislation we passed earlier this year.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep disappointment concerning amendment 2771 to the Bankruptcy bill that we are voting on today. Earlier this year, I was an original cosponsor of S. 562, the methamphetamine bill introduced by Senator HARKIN, to implement a coordinated effort to combat methamphetamine abuse. I am very concerned about the abuse of methamphetamine in my home state of New Mexico, and I am very concerned about the rise in meth labs in my state. That is why I wholeheartedly supported the provisions aimed at: (1) combating the spread of methamphetamine; (2) treating abusers of meth; (3) developing prevention programs; and (4) researching meth. I was glad to see that Senator HATCH accepted the treatment, prevention and research provisions that were in S. 562 when drafting this amendment. 
   Meth is a highly addictive drug and I have supported efforts to stop the spread of meth in our rural communities. I support tougher penalties for meth lab operators and traffickers. I support resources to law enforcement to cover the cost of dismantling toxic meth labs. 
   However, because of the provision added to this amendment at the last minute, concerning school vouchers, I am unable to vote for an otherwise good meth bill. I regret that the drafters of this amendment felt it necessary to politicize this bill with issues like school vouchers that are unrelated to the methamphetamine issue. These attempts to undermine the bipartisan support for this meth bill are unfortunate. 
   While I support providing resources to law enforcement to battle the methamphetamine epidemic and have been a strong advocate for ways to improve school security, I cannot support the use of federal funds to send students to private or parochial schools under a legislative provision riddled with problems. 
   The provision allowing schools to use federal funds to send a student to a private school, including a religious school, if they become a victim of a violent crime on school grounds, will do nothing to make our schools safer and will only divert crucial funding from our public school system. In addition, the language is overly broad. If a student is injured on school grounds, at any time, the student will be entitled to attend the school of his or her choice anywhere in the state. This provision would allow the child who gets into a fight following a weekend basketball game to enroll in a private school--free of charge. The amendment would even allow federal funds to be used to transport the student to the private schools, even though federal funds could not be used to transport a student to a public school within the student's current school district. 
   Instead of pushing an overly broad voucher proposal which will damage our schools rather than improve them, we should focus on supporting violence and crime prevention programs for our youth. We should support community crime prevention activities that encourage parent and community involvement, and help communities and schools ensure that all children are safe all the time. For example, the juvenile crime bill--that has been sitting in Conference since this summer--properly addresses school safety in a comprehensive manner. My Republican colleagues have blocked final passage of that bill. 
   In addition, we should invest in initiatives such as the Safe and Drug-free Schools and after-school programs, since we know that most juvenile crimes occur between 3:00 and 8:00 p.m. As my colleague Senator HARKIN pointed out, the Republican leadership passed a bill that allocates only 50% of the amount that the President requested for this purpose. 
   Instead of draining much-needed resources from public schools, we should create conditions for improvement and reform--not in a few schools, but in all schools; not for a few students, but for all students. 
   By attaching these voucher provisions and issues unrelated to meth and the underlying bankruptcy bill, this entire amendment has been poisoned. If the Majority Leader was serious about passing a meth bill to aid law enforcement and reduce meth abuse, he could have offered a meth bill as a freestanding bill. However, by offering it as a non-germane amendment to the bankruptcy bill, this meth bill has little chance of surviving a bankruptcy conference committee and is a shallow attempt to help the groups fighting the spread of drugs in our states. Like many of my colleagues here today, I am angry that the poison pill, added to this meth bill at the final hour, converted a good piece of legislation into a bill that I cannot vote for.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, Airplanes, known as airtankers, play a critical role in fighting wildfires. They are used in the initial attack of wildfires in support of firefighters on the ground and, on large wildfires, to aid in the protection of lives and structures from rapidly advancing fires. 
   Today, Senators ALLARD, CRAIG and I are introducing legislation that will help ensure that Federal firefighters continue to have access to airtanker services. This technical amendment will extend the expiration date of the Wildfire Suppression Aircraft Transfer Act of 1996 from September 30, 2000 to September 30, 2005. The regulations under the act are still being finalized, so no aircraft have yet been transferred. Extending the 1996 act is critical to help facilitate the sale of former military aircraft to contractors who provide firefighting services to the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior. The existing fleet of available airtankers is aging rapidly, and fleet modernization is critical to the continued success of the firefighting program. 
   This bill will extend legislative authority to transfer or sell excess turbine-powered military aircraft suitable for conversion to airtankers. If we fail to pass this extension, airtanker operators will not have access to the planes they need to update the aging airtanker fleet. The Wildfire Suppression Aircraft Transfer Act of 1996 required that the aircraft be used only for firefighting activities. 
   I urge my colleagues to support our efforts to ensure that Federal firefighters have the resources they need to protect the public and their property from the threat of wildfires.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join Senators FRIST and MCCAIN today in introducing the ``Electronic Commerce Technology Promotion Act.'' This bill, which sets up a center of Excellence in Electronic Commerce at the National Institutes of Standards and Technology, or NIST, is a solid step towards adapting an important federal agency to the digital economy we see blooming around us. 
   NIST was established in 1901 as the National Bureau of Standards during a time of tremendous industrial development, when technology became a key driver of our economic growth. Making those technologies literally fit together reliably through standards became crucial, and Congress realized that one key to sustaining our industrial growth and the quality of our products would be a federal laboratory devoted to developing standards. The Bureau of Standards is a classic example of how the federal government can support technical progress that undergirds economic growth and enables the competitive marketplace to work. 
   Around ten years ago, Congress modified the Bureau's charter in response to the problems of the 1980's, increasing its focus on competitiveness, adding efforts like the highly regarded Manufacturing Extension Program (MEP), and changing the name to NIST. Turning to the challenges of today's growing digital economy, this bill makes NIST a focal point in the federal government for promoting electronic commerce throughout our economy by establishing a Center of Excellence in Electronic Commerce there. While the challenges of making things fit together in a digital economy are different--and now go under the un-melodic term ``interoperability''--they are just as crucial as they were in the industrial economy of 1901. And, NIST remains an excellent place to lead the work. 
   I'm particularly pleased that this bill includes the fundamental idea behind my bill S. 1494, the Electronic Commerce Extension Establishment Act of 1999. That is, NIST ought to lead an electronic commerce extension program or service to provide small businesses with low cost, impartial technical advice on how to enter and succeed in e-commerce. This service will help ensure that small businesses in every part of the nation fully participate in the unfolding e-commerce revolution through a well-proven policy tool--a service analogous to the Department of Agriculture's Cooperative Extension Service and NIST's own MEP. I believe such a service would help both small businesses and our entire economy as the productivity enhancements from e-commerce are spread more rapidly, and I recently asked Secretary Daley for a report on how such a service should work. So, I thank Senator FRIST for including my basic policy idea in his bill and look forward to working with him to flesh it out, particularly in light of the report we should get from the Commerce Department. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join Senators FRIST, MCCAIN, and myself in supporting this bill, as one step the Congress can take to make sure an important federal agency, NIST, continues its strong tradition of helping our economy--our growing digital economy--to be the most competitive in the world.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and very much appreciate the leadership he has shown on this important issue as well. This is a truly bipartisan effort we have made on behalf of New Mexico. This is not just an issue of the 106th Congress. This is an issue that our Sate has been pursuing for many decades. Back in the early 1960s, one of our predecessors in the Senate, Senator Clinton Anderson, made a valiant effort to bring the Baca Ranch into Federal ownership so the public could enjoy it and so its preservation could be assured for future generations. 
   After 3 years of effort in that direction, he abandoned the effort because of the infighting that occurred among competing interests. Then, Mr. President, over two years ago I rose in this chamber to introduce a bill to authorize the acquisition of the Baca Location #1, a ranch which comprises about ninety percent of the magnificent Valles Caldera. Today I rise to cosponsor a bill with Sen. DOMENICI that will not only authorize purchase of the Baca Ranch, but also a unique method of management for this property. 
   A world renowned volcanic caldera sweeping approximately fifty miles in circumference, the Valles Caldera is the ecological heart of the Jemez Mountains. It's unparalleled vast upland meadows broken by forested volcanic domes and intertwined with 27 miles of winding trout streams, are home to a stunning variety of wildlife including: mountain lions, black bear, whitetail deer, redtail hawks, eagles, and wild turkey. It has also been the breeding ground for one of the largest elk herds in the lower forty-eight states. 
   There has been a desire on the part of the Dunigan family, the current owners of that land, to see that it go into public ownership, and the father of the of the current owners made that attempt before he died. They have recently decided they want to carry through with that wish of his and accordingly, as Senator DOMENICI indicated, the negotiations between the Dunigan family and the Federal Government have proceeded and now have come to a good resolution. This presents us with an incredible opportunity for the American people. 
   The potential of this land is enormous: 
   It could be used as a grassbank to allow ranchers to rest and rehabilitate hundreds of thousands of acres of public range land in New Mexico without having to lose production in the process; 
   It could provide incredible opportunities for scientific study and education, in the geophysical and biological sciences; 
   It currently is, and could continue to be, one of the premier hunting and fishing destinations in the country; 
   It's scenic value makes it an ideal location for the film industry. In fact it has often been used as a backdrop for movies, TV series, and commercials; 
   It presents amazing opportunities for outdoor recreation including, hiking, camping, horseback riding, cross-country skiing, and photography; and 
   As with many of the scenic wonders in my home state of New Mexico, there are places within the caldera that are of tremendous cultural significance to various Native American tribes in the area. 
   Clearly if this property were to be brought into public ownership it should be managed to preserve its incredible natural condition, while maintaining a balance with the various ways it could be used and enjoyed. The experiment called for in this bill sets out broad policy goals for the land (to preserve its natural treasures and to make it financially self-sustaining) and establishes a nine member board of trustees that shall set management policy for what would become the Valles Caldera Preserve. By requiring that each trustee have experience from differing but critical perspectives, this trust may be able to reach a balance that will meet the needs of the land and the public. 
   The nine members of this board would include:

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that seeks to remove an inequity in retirement pay benefits for critical personnel in our National Guard and Reserve units who are Dual Status Technicians. They are called ``Dual Status'', Mr. President, because they serve both as military and civilian personnel. There are about 40,000 Dual Status Technicians covered by retirement requirements and restrictions contained in Title 32 of the United States Code. These men and women are the backbone of the National Guard and Reserve structure. They are the mechanics, pilots, engineers, equipment operators, supply and support technicians who keep things running so that the Guard is able to respond to natural disasters and national emergencies, as well as serve on active duty in accordance with the ``total force concept'' that integrates active and reserve forces in the military.  These hardworking men and women are often the first called to duty in an emergency. 
   As essential as Dual Status Technicians are, they suffer from the worst of two employment worlds. These technicians are by statute both military and civilian employees. Guard technicians must maintain their military job and grade in order to keep their technician status and remain a federal employee. In the event of separation from military service, however, they are denied the retirement benefits of those who serve in the same grade in the active military. Frequently, Dual Status Technicians who are separated from the military must wait years to qualify for their Federal Service retirement benefits. 
   The bill I am introducing in the Senate today is a companion bill already introduced on the House side by Representative ABERCROMBIE. It seeks to eliminate retirement inequities--a problem we just addressed head on in the Armed Services Committee when we included a provision in this year's Defense Authorization Bill the eliminate retirement inequities between active duty personnel who retired before or after 1986. We voted this year to effectively eliminate the ``Redux'' retirement benefit program because of the lower benefits it offered to personnel who retired after 1986. The action I am proposing in this legislation is somewhat similar. 
   This bill will permit Dual Status Technicians to retire at any age with 25 years of service or at 50 with 20 years of service. Those benefits are similar to benefits provided to Federal police and fire employees. They're similar to federal employees who retire from the Congress. 
   I am pleased to see, Mr. President, that this year's Defense Authorization bill took a step to provide equitable benefits to Dual Status Technicians, but in doing so, it crated an inequity within the Technician community itself. A provision in the bill provides for early retirement after 25 years at any age, or at age 50 with 20 years of service--but only for those employed as Dual Status Technicians after 1996. Those same benefits are withheld from those employed before 1996. In other words, Mr. President, we created a situation similar to the one the Senate dealt with regarding the ``Redux'' retirement program in the Defense Authorization bill. The bill I offer today would remove that inequity in the same way the Senate voted to remove the inequity for active duty personnel who retired under the ``Redux'' program. 
   Mr. President, the cost of equity is not high. An initial estimate by the Congressional Budget Office estimates that this bill could cost about $54 million over a five year period. That number will vary, of course, depending on the number of Technicians who would choose to take advantage of the change in the law when this bill is enacted. Of course, we're not only paying for equity here, Mr. President. We're paying appropriate, equitable compensation to the men and women who have devoted their careers to service for the nation both at home and abroad--our National Guard and Reserve who serve us all so well. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill and urge my fellow Members to support this effort through cosponsorship.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senator GRAHAM in introducing the ``Police Athletic League Youth Enrichment Act of 1999.'' 
   The Police Athletic League (PAL) is a national organization that has been teaming up law enforcement with our nation's youth for the past 55 years. New Mexico is fortunate to have a statewide PAL program. The New Mexico PAL provides New Mexico's youth with a variety of after-school and summer activities. Last year, the New Mexico PAL provided hundreds of New Mexico kids with alternatives to getting into trouble. For these reasons, I am very proud to introduce the PAL Youth Enrichment Act with Senator Graham. 
   In New Mexico, the PAL chapter has ten sites around the state: Santa Fe, Albuquerque, Gallup, Tohatchi, Bloomfield, Roswell, Dona Ana County, Clovis, Lordsburg and the Pueblo of Cochiti. The goal of the New Mexico PAL is to provide recreational, educational and cultural activities for at-risk youth ages five to eighteen with the intent of reducing negative behaviors and promoting healthy behavioral patterns. PAL aims to build self-esteem and resiliency in youth and provide positive alternatives to alcohol, drug use, delinquent behavior and violence. The New Mexico PAL sponsors sporting leagues throughout the year, participates in Sports Days during the summer, sponsors a one-week summer camp and offers ongoing mentoring opportunities for youth. 
   The PAL volunteers not only play sports with the youth, but they fight for the youth. In Albuquerque, the PAL chapter aided in preserving the use of a baseball field for the youth sporting leagues. 
   Last summer the New Mexico PAL held several Youth Sports Days that attracted between 40 and 150 kids in each community. In August, I attended the Youth Sports Day in Santa Fe. The daylong event provided the younger kinds in the community with a variety of sporting events, prizes and lunch. The kids and parents interacted with the law enforcement officers in a setting that allowed them to see the officers as community members, mentors and leaders. 
   The New Mexico PAL also sponsors a week long summer camp, Camp Courage, each year at the Cochiti Lake. It is a reward camp for kids that have said ``no'' to antisocial behavior. More than one hundred kids participate in this program annually. Because a camp requires a lower adult child ratio, the local FBI agents, DEA agents and the National Guard joined with the local police and sheriffs in organizing a week of intense sporting activities. They also offered themselves as mentors and reachers for the youth. The commitment of these law enforcement officers to the youth of New Mexico is truly admirable. 
   After seeing what the New Mexico PAL has accomplished, I have come to be a great supporter of PAL. I now want other communities around the nation to be able to benefit from the same programs and services and for more New Mexico communities to be able to start PAL programs. As I see it, a police officer's duty is primarily to protect a community. I look at PAL as law enforcement's way of helping protect the health of our kids--both the physical well being and the mental well being. 
   The PAL Youth Enrichment Act will enable existing PAL to expand their services and provide seed money for new PAL in distressed communities, including many Native American communities. The goal is to provide seed money for fifty new chapters each year for the next five years. By providing $16 million annually for new and existing PAL, youth around the country will benefit from a combination of academic assistance; mentoring assistance; recreational and athletic activities; technology training; drug, alcohol, and gang prevention activities; health and nutrition counseling; cultural and social programs, conflict resolution training; anger management; peer pressure training; and job skill preparation classes. 
   Although PAL chapters consist of local law enforcement, they do not receive direct funding from the law enforcement agencies, and instead rely on the efforts of volunteers and fund-raising proceeds. Because of this funding situation, in 1977 I urged Congress to appropriate funds for the New Mexico PAL. In 1998 I succeeded in getting $1 million appropriated through the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill for the New Mexico PAL program to expand the PAL services to communities around the State and to greatly enhance the current programs it offered. This money has enabled the New Mexico PAL to carry out its summer programs, its Camp Courage, and many other new activities. It also has allowed them to expand the program to tribal communities in northwest New Mexico, with the cooperation of the tribal police in those areas. The PAL Youth Enrichment Act will provide the funding needed to continue programs like the New Mexico PAL and will give other states the incentive to start up PAL programs in distressed communities. 
   Kids need healthy alternatives to crime and assistance in dealing with their anger. Athletics and recreational activities like dancing and drama greatly improves one's well being--both physically and mentally--and give teens an outlet for their energy and anger. PAL's sports and recreational activities also help kids learn the importance of teamwork and help boost their self-esteem when they accomplish more than they thought possible.  
   Many folks do not realize it but the PALs have produced some great athletes over the years. New Mexico is proud of its native son, Danny Romero Jr., a former two-time world boxing champion and an alumnus of the New Mexico PAL program. According to Danny's father, the PAL philosophy taught his son life skills that he could no have learned any where else and kept him out of trouble. 
   Mr. President, I encourage the Senate to take up and pass this worthwhile legislation that expands a program with proven positive results. Just ask the 1.5 million children in more than 3,000 communities that the PAL program over the past 55 years has served. The PAL programs will change our youth's attitude toward police, will provide a variety of alternatives to criminal behavior and will positively influence a child's mental and physical well-being. I hope that my Senate colleagues will join me in supporting this important legislation

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to address the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. 
   Let me begin by stating--as others have on this issue--that I believe strongly in the concept of free and fair trade, and I have always supported legislation that opens foreign markets, assures that trade agreements are enforceable, and provides the opportunity  for competitive U.S. firms to do business overseas. I support legislation of this type because I feel that in the long run it increases the economic welfare of our nation and leads to substantial and measureable benefits for Americans. Exports now generate over one-third of all economic growth in the United States. Export jobs pay ten to fifteen percent more than the average wage. Depending upon who you listen to, it has generated anywhere from two to eleven million jobs over the last ten years. Without expanded trade brought on as a result of globalization, we will end up fighting over an ever-decreasing domestic economic pie. Trade is inevitable, it is the terms of trade that we debate. 
   And this debate is important, because while many Americans are enjoying unprecedented opportunities as a result of the process of globalization, others are not so fortunate. Clearly, free trade has negative attributes, and the United States has not been immune to them. In my state alone over the last two years we have seen several thousand people laid off in trade-related plant closures--from high-tech to apparel to copper. Many more New Mexicans have been forced to find other work because they can no longer compete on an international basis. The vast majority of these people live in rural communities where there really isn't anything else for them to do in terms of employment. When I talk to these people, they ask me: Where am I supposed to work now? Where do I find a job with a salary that allows me to support a family, own a house, put food on the table, and live a decent life? Where are the benefits of free trade for me now that my company has gone overseas? What good are cheaper products when I no longer have a salary to pay for them? 
   These are tough questions, especially from someone who is trying to pay a mortgage, or get their children an education, or buy food for the table, and they deserve an answer. In my opinion, the answer does not lie in protectionism, as many would suggest, because it is no longer a legitimate option. It is impossible to go back in time and trade only within our own borders. Instead the answer lies in the development of programs that provide people with the skills to be gainfully employed and provide companies with the tools so they can become internationally competitive. It is through workforce development and technological innovation. Globalization is inevitable. It is not going to stop. Therefore, the question for us in this Chamber is: How we can manage it to benefit the national interest of the United States? How can we make it work for our people? How can we establish an environment where high-wage jobs can be obtained and communities sustained? 
   The Trade Adjustment Assistance program is supposed to do just that. As my good friend and colleague Senator MOYNIHAN has pointed out on the floor many times, this program and its component parts are part of a very reasonable agreement with American workers and companies: If Americans lose their jobs as a result of trade agreements entered into by the U.S. Government, then the U.S. government should assist these Americans in finding new employment with equivalent or better wages. If the U.S. government supports an open trading system, it is responsible to repair the negative impacts this policy has on its citizens. If you lose a job because of U.S. trade policy, you should have some help from the U.S. Government in getting unemployment benefits and retraining to get a new job that pays you as much or more as you were getting before. 
   And, since its inception, the Trade Adjustment Assistance program has attempted to do just that. It has over the years consistently helped individuals and companies in communities across the United States deal with the transitions that are an inevitable part of a changing international economic system. It helps people that can work and want to work to continue to work in productive jobs that contribute to the economic welfare of our country. 
   But, as good as the Trade Adjustment Assistance program is, it is not without flaws, and these flaws frequently make the program difficult to use for those that need it most. Even worse, in some cases, it is simply unavailable for those who need it most. 
   What are some concrete examples of these problems? In my state of New Mexico, we have over the last few years seen a serious lack of coordination between the federal and state agencies responsible for the provision of unemployment benefits and retraining, and we have seen a near complete incompatibility of application procedures. This lack of harmonization has made potential recipients run in circles to find information and advice that would help them find viable work. 
   We have passed legislation that provides benefits to some individuals that are not available to others. For instance, the NAFTA Trade Adjustment Assistance program provides unemployment benefits and retraining for those who have been negatively impacted by trade or shifts in production overseas, but the Trade Adjustment Assistance program only provides retraining in the case of former, not the latter. Furthermore, secondary workers--individuals who with their company provide direct inputs into primary manufacturing facilities--are not eligible for any support at all, this in spite of the fact that they too may lose their jobs when a primary facility is forced to close. How do you explain these programmatic differences to workers who need help, and need it now? 
   Another problem: Trade Adjustment Assistance provides assistance to workers in specific communities, but it does not provide assistance to those communities that have been significantly impacted by trade or shifts in production overseas. No evaluation of community needs, no strategic plan for economic development, no technical assistance to help a community recover from what has happened. Thus, while we provide federal funds so workers can retrain to find employment, in many cases there is no simply gainful employment to be had in the community. There is no work to retrain for that pays a living wage. In other words, there is no linkage between retraining programs and community workforce needs. Individuals thus have a choice: 
   stay in town on unemployment until it runs out, take a lesser paying job that disallows them from providing for themselves and their family, or relocate to a region that has employment to offer. In either case, the community loses. And this is happening with disturbing frequency not only in New Mexico, but in rural communities across the United States. Ask any of my colleagues, and they will tell you they have heard the same story. 
   I would argue that in some very specific cases foreign trade or the transfer of production overseas has had a such an impact on a community that it is analogous to a natural disaster. The impact on the community is so severe, pervasive, and painful that it is equivalent to a flood, tornado, or earthquake. In many cases, not just individuals, but an entire community has become dislocated, and is not prepared as a political or economic entity to take the steps needed to recover. Not only the individuals, but the community, needs help to get back on its feet. 
   So what must be done in these circumstances? In this country we have organized a unique approach to first anticipate, and then respond to, natural disasters--the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA--and it is designed to integrate the federal/state/local activities to obtain optimal recovery. Why not have this kind of coordinated program for trade? We organize this kind of response through the Department of Defense and the Office of Economic Adjustment when a military base closes in a community. Why not have such a program for communities affected by trade? I am not talking about giving funds to those in need in perpetuity. I am talking about establishing a coherent strategic plan with an entry and exit policy that helps individuals and communities develop a workforce plan, create good jobs for their citizens, and become viable economic competitors in the international marketplace. 
   The time is ripe to examine these issues, and in my view it is time to think outside the box. There are too many inconsistencies in existing unemployment and re-training benefit programs--Trade Adjustment Assistance, NAFTA Trade Adjustment Assistance, the Job Training Partnership Act, the Workforce Investment Act, and unemployment insurance--and they must be examined so we can make them efficient and effective mechanisms for our  workers. In my view, these problems are not necessarily the fault of the Department of Labor, which administers many of the programs I refer to today. The problems are indicative of an ad hoc approach to policy formation over the years, and it is time to align these programs so they will have the maximum benefit effect for those who need them. Trade Adjustment Assistance is an excellent idea and it has served us well, but it is time that it be refined to better fit the needs of an increasingly interdependent international political economy. 
   To this end, I offer a very straightforward amendment today, and an action that I see as a first, but very important, step to more comprehensive Trade Adjustment Assistance reform. The immediate goal of the amendment is to obtain the information necessary to make informed decisions on how to proceed in future legislation. My amendment asks that the General Accounting Office study this issue, and, within nine months, offer Congress specific data and recommendations concerning the efficiency and effectiveness of federal inter-agency and federal and state coordination of unemployment and retraining activities associated with the following programs: the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, the NAFTA Trade Adjustment Assistance program, the Job Training Partnership Act, the Workforce Investment Act, and the Unemployment Insurance Program. The report will examine the activities since the enactment of the NAFTA agreement on January 1, 1994, and will include analysis of many of the issues I mentioned previously: the compatibility of program requirements and application procedures related to the unemployment and retraining of dislocated workers in the United States, the capacity of these programs to assist primary and secondary workers negatively impacted by foreign trade and the transfer of production to other countries, and the effectiveness of the aforementioned programs relative to the re-employment of United States workers dislocated by foreign trade and the transfer of production to other countries. This is an unambiguous and uncomplicated amendment, and it will help us chart a course for the future. 
   Trade Adjustment Assistance is a necessary part of our national trade policy toolbox, and I believe it has done an admirable job over the years. But we all know it will become even more important as our country becomes more integrated into the global economy. For this reason, it is time that it be made more effective, and that its goals be better defined. I believe this amendment will assist us in this effort, and I hope that my colleagues will support the passage of this bill when it comes to a vote.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, on September 9, 1999, I had the pleasure to be one of the keynote speakers at the Sixth Annual Scholarship Awards Banquet sponsored by the Hispanic College Fund, Inc. The Hispanic College Fund selects a student among the group of scholarship recipients to convey remarks on their behalf at the Annual Awards Banquet. Mr. Luis Robles, who attends Stanford University, where I attended Law School, spoke to the crowd of over one hundred people which included Members of Congress, Hispanic Business Leaders, friends of the Hispanic College Fund and family members of the award recipients. 
   Even though Louis is not from my home state of New Mexico, I feel that it is important to recognize the dedication, hard work, and commitment that this young man has undertaken in his academics and in his life despite great adversity. The remarks that Luis made to those in attendance that night left the room in utter silence. His remarks, and those of the teacher who nominated him for the scholarship, show that nothing in life is unattainable. This young man serves as an example that if you believe in yourself, believe in hard work, and believe you can achieve your goals, you can do anything and be anyone you want to be. 
   Mr. President, I respectfully ask that the attached statement which Mr. Robles made to the Sixth Annual Scholarship Awards Dinner and that of his teacher, Mr. David Layton, be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to commemorate the 30-day period from September 15 through October 15 which was designated by the President as Hispanic Heritage Month. 
   Around the country, and in my home state of New Mexico, Hispanics have been making outstanding contributions to public service, business, education, and to our communities. Hispanic Heritage Month signals a time of recognition and celebration of an enriched legacy, tradition, and culture that has been present in our country for over 400 years. 
   We in New Mexico are well familiar with the fact that the Hispanic presence in the United States reaches far back to 1528, and in New Mexico to 1539. We also know that Hispanics have influenced greatly our architecture, food, clothing, literature, music, and certainly our family values. Many of our landmark cities have grown from early Spanish settlements; cities such as Los Angeles, San Antonio, San Francisco, and Santa Fe, to name only a few. 
   Although we know that Hispanics make up the fastest-growing minority group in this country, and by 2025 will be the largest minority group in our national population growth, too many Americans still are not aware of the historic significance and contributions of Hispanics in American life. That is why Hispanic Heritage Month is important as a recognition of the accomplishments and contributions of Hispanics in our country. 
   There are countless, New Mexicans who have contributed greatly to our Hispanic community through hard work and the belief that one can accomplish what one sets his or her mind to do. Today I'd like to mention two of these individuals from New Mexico, who have contributed to their communities and have made a difference in my home State.  
   At the age of 5, Mike Lujan was already contributing to his family's household income to help support his parents and 14 siblings. Mike encountered difficulties in high school and graduated with a 1.7 grade-point-average. However, because of his determination Mike enrolled in college, sought tutoring, and this year, he will be celebrating a quarter century of teaching in the Santa Fe Public Schools. 
   During his time as a teacher and head wrestling coach, Mike Lujan has been honored with USA Weekend's ``Most Caring Coach'' award and the national Jefferson Award given to ``a citizen who cares'' which is presented by a three-star general at the Pentagon. 
   This past August, Mike's story was told in ``Vista'' a magazine which discusses Hispanic Issues and salutes Hispanics in a variety of areas. The article about Mike closes with a quote from him which says, ``One of the secrets for success is to remember your roots. Once you forget who you are, you can't help others.'' 
   The second individual I would like to recognize is Tony Suazo, a native of Canjilon, located in northern New Mexico. Tony was recognized as 1 of 10 northern New Mexicans, by the Santa Fe New Mexican, for their volunteer and professional achievements in the community. Every Christmas, Tony Suazo walks through the streets of Espanola, NM, in a Santa Suit, with a bag of toys thrown over his shoulder. He plays Santa Claus at the ``Put a smile on a Child's Face'' annual children's Christmas party. This party draws about 3,000 people, and every child who walks through the door receives a gift. Every year leading up to this event, Tony closes his business 6 weeks before the Christmas party. He then runs around town faxing fliers about the event and collects the toys, to be given as gifts, in front of local shopping centers. 
   You see, Mr. President, Tony Suazo and his wife close their business down 6 weeks prior to this event and live off their savings during that time. He does not miss his lost income because, as his wife puts it, ``His dream is to see every child, whether they are needy or not, have a toy.'' Tony has been awarded the Espanola Valley Chamber of Commerce's Man of the Year. 
   These two individuals serve as an example of Hispanics who have been making contributions to our communities--believing in themselves, believing in hard work, and believing that they can achieve their goals. 
   Mr. President, at this time let me just say a couple of sentences in Spanish because that is a very important part of the Spanish tradition in my State. 
   Sr. Presidente, conozco s&#243;lo una manera de rendir tributo a una cultura cuyo idioma es tradicionalmente sin&#243;nimo de identidad. El idioma espan 6ol imparte un sentido de conciencia, historia y tradici&#243;n que en ingle 2s, mi lengua materna, es a veces imposible expresar. 
   Sin idioma no habr&#237;an ane 2cdotas, y sin las ane 2cdotas del dirigente Luja 2n, Tony Suazo y de un sinnu 2mero de hispanos-americanos, nuestra naci&#243;n sin duda alguna experimentar&#237;a un vac&#237;o en la m&#233;dula misma de su identidad. 
   Let me just summarize that or translate it: 
   Mr. President, there is only one way I know to pay full tribute to a culture for which language is often synonymous with identity. The Spanish language imparts a sense of feeling, history, and tradition, which my own native tongue of English often fails to convey. 
   Without language, there would be no stories, and without the stories of Coach Lujan, Tony Suazo, and countless other Hispanic-Americans, our nation would surely suffer from the great void at the very heart of its identity. 
   Mr. President, it is with great pride that I call on all my colleagues and on all Americans to join me even though I am a little late with this, in celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month and to come together as individuals, families, and communities to learn more about this extremely important culture in our country.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important legislation, of which Senator HOLLINGS and Senator CLELAND are also sponsors, recognizing the heroic contributions of American soldiers who served in Bataan and Corregidor during World War  II. This legislation will provide a one time honorarium to those veterans who survived the notorious Death March and were made to work as slave labor in support of the Japanese war effort. Compensation awarded these heroes for their imprisonment has never approached the value of their sacrifices on behalf of our nation's liberty. As these legendary heroes approach the final chapters of their lives, if is fitting that the nation pay them special homage for their heroic deeds heretofore unrewarded. That's why I am introducing this legislation today--to salute these Americans in recognition of the great sacrifices they made for this nation. 
   From December 1941 to April 1942, American military forces stationed in the Philippines fought valiantly against overwhelming Japanese military forces on the Bataan peninsula near Manila. Under severe combined attack of the Japanese forces, General Douglas MacArthur ordered U.S. troops to withdraw to the Bataan peninsula to form a strong defensive perimeter to protect the eventual evacuation of troops from the island. The U.S. forces fought for 3 months, considerably longer than the unfavorable troop balance would have suggested was possible. As a result of extending Japanese military resources during that crucial initial phase of the war in the Pacific, U.S. forces in Bataan and Corregidor prevented Japan from accomplishing critical strategic objectives that would have enabled them to capture Australia. Had the Japanese been able to accomplish their plans, their victory in the Philippines could have doomed Allied efforts in the Pacific from the very outset. 
   On April 9, 1942, Major General Edward King, Commander of U.S. forces on the Bataan peninsula, ordered the troops to surrender rather than face certain slaughter on the battlefield. What followed was the tragic, infamous ``Death March'' of American prisoners from the Bataan peninsula to Camp O'Donnell of Manila. Some experts estimate that more than 10,000 Americans died on the 85-mile march to the prison camp. Many died of starvation or lack of water; some were executed on the spot by their Japanese captors. 
   In June 1942, following the surrender of American troops of the Corregidor garrison, prisoners held at the O'Donnell Prisoner of War (POW) camp were joined with those captured at Corregidor and transferred to the Cabanatuan POW camp. In the fall of 1944, the Japanese transferred more than 1,600 prisoners from the Cabanatuan POW camp to ``hell ships'' destined for Japan, where prisoners were used as slave laborers working in mines, shipyards, and factories. In some cases, because the ``hell ships'' weren't marked, they were attacked and sunk by U.S. military aircraft. 
   Mr. President, the heroic performance of our soldiers at 
    Bataan and during incarceration in POW camps earned them well-deserved citations following the war. The 200th and 515th Coastal Artillery units from New Mexico that served to defend the retreating troops at Bataan received three Presidential Unit Citations and the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation for their heroism. New Mexico is particularly proud of these men whose heroism I seek to salute through this legislation today. Of the 25,000 American servicemen stationed in the Philippines at the outbreak of World War II, less than 1,000 are living today. These heroes deserve special recognition and gratitude from the American people beyond the symbolic recognition and remuneration they have heretofore received. 
   In December, 1998, the Canadian Government approved a legislative measure to compensate their military veterans who had been captured by the Japanese during the fall of Hong Kong, and who subsequently provided slave labor in Japanese POW camps. The measure awarded approximately 700 qualified veterans and surviving spouses $15,600 each ``as an extraordinary payment to extraordinary individuals who suffered extraordinary treatment in captivity.'' The payment to Canadian veterans will total $11.7 million from Canadian federal funds, not from the Japanese Government. The Japanese Government considers their liability for treatment of POWs to have been settled by the treaty signed in 1952, compensating each prisoner of war for their time in captivity, but not for any slave labor that was performed. Last fall, Japan's high court rejected a compensation suit seeking redress filed by a coalition of former Allied prisoners on the basis of the 1952 treaty protecting Japan from further liability in post-war settlements. 
   Mr. President in agreeing to provide their veterans with compensation for slave labor performed while in POW camps, the Canadian Government recognized that lengthy legal proceedings appealing the decision of the Japanese high court would likely be too drawn out to be beneficial to their aging veterans. As a result, the Canadian Government concluded that it was appropriate and honorable to recognize the heroic contributions of veterans who were made to perform slave labor simply out of recognition of the debt of gratitude owed to the veterans by the Canadian people. 
   Our American veterans who served in Bataan and Corregidor and performed slave labor in Japanese mines, shipyards, and factories are in a similar predicament as their Canadian colleagues. These men have never been fully compensated for their heroism and sacrifices made while serving as slaves to their Japanese captors. The Japanese government has concluded that it is no longer liable for compensating such claims. Appealing the decision of the Japanese high court to further authority would take more time than many of our veterans have. Consequently, Mr. President, I believe that the American Government, just as the Canadian Government has done, should choose to recognize the contributions of the war heroes of Bataan and Corregidor. 
   The legislation I am introducing today calls on the Congress to authorize payment of $20,000 to each veteran of Bataan or Corregidor who performed slave labor during World War II. The honorarium would also be extended to surviving spouses. This small token of appreciation would mean a great deal to these heroes and their families. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill. I hope we can enact it in the near future.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Thomas Bureau McDonald who died as a result of a tragic car accident on October 9, 1999 in Albuquerque, New Mexico at the age of 35. His parents, family, and friends have lost a very special person. New Mexico has lost a young and dedicated public servant whose passion was working with college students, strengthening and expanding higher education, and stressing the importance of attending college. 
   Tom was a rising star among those interested in public service in New Mexico. He will be missed for his cheerful personality, his keen sense of humor, his political savvy, and his devotion to empowering students at the university and state level when it came to their education. Tom was never concerned with how much he could accomplish or who he could influence but, rather how he could live his life so when he was no longer serving in his appointed or elected capacities his ideas, dreams, and goals would be a reality. That reality was for children and their families living throughout New Mexico to have the opportunities in place to attend college to better themselves and to better their community. In life there are individuals who are concerned about being remembered for what they have done or still can do; Tom's only concern was being remembered for who he was--an outspoken leader on higher education and its students, a good son to his parents, a loving grandson to his grandmothers, and a trustworthy and loyal individual to his friends. 
   Tom attended the University of New Mexico and graduated from Western New Mexico University in Silver City, New Mexico where I grew up as a child. During his years at Western, Tom was elected by his peers not just once but twice to serve as their student body president (1990-1992). It was during this time that he eloquently presented a plan to the Board of Regents to build a new $3.5 million Student Union Building utilizing only student fees. Tom was fortunate to go back a few years ago to the dedication of this new building. While at the dedication ceremony he realized that what started as a vision, a risk, a challenge, turned into structure of unity where students, administrators, and community members could learn, work and just be together. 
   Mr. President, from 1990 to 1992 Tom was appointed to two one year terms as the student member on the Governor's Commission on Higher Education by former Governor Bruce King. During his tenure, Tom transformed the way members of the Commission viewed student participation and input on higher education. Through his optimism, determination, and presence he created an identity for students around the state who were concerned about the quality of their education. That identity which Tom helped form not only exists before the Commission today, but before the State Legislature and Office of the Governor. 
   From 1992 to 1993 Tom was elected by student representatives from New  Mexico's two-year and four-year institutions as executive director of the Associated Students of New Mexico (ASNM). ASNM is a non-profit student organization that represents the interests of 100,000 students members enrolled in two-year and four-year institutions of higher learning before the New Mexico Commission on Higher Education, State Legislature and Office of the Governor. This organization has brought forth some of New Mexico's current and former state legislators, county commissioners, and public servants. Two of my current Washington DC staffers and one of my state staffers are former executive directors of this association. While serving as executive director, Tom always encouraged those he met to reach for their goals, pursue their dreams, and turn any rejection into motivation. He believed that what one does now to enhance their life will impact others in the future. He lived what he preached and what he did to enhance his life has left a lasting impact for students and their education throughout New Mexico. 
   Tom received his Masters of Criminal Justice from New Mexico State University in 1996. He was also appointed by Governor Gary Johnson to serve a two-year term from 1994-1996 as the first voting student regent in the history of New Mexico State University. One year later in 1997, he was appointed by Governor Johnson to serve a full six-year term on the New Mexico Commission on Higher Education where he served until the time of his death. 
   Mr. President, I would like to extend my condolences to his parents Clyde and Eileen and the entire McDonald family. I ask that my colleagues in the Senate join me in honoring the achievements and contributions in the life of this young and outstanding New Mexican.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize TPL, Inc. in Albuquerque, NM who is a 1999 Tibbetts Award recipient and will be honored by the U.S. Small Business Administration at a congressional reception on Tuesday, October 26, 1999 here in Washington DC. 
   The Fourth Annual Tibbets Award is presented by the Small Business Administration to firms that have attained high levels of success in research and development under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program and to organizations and individuals who have supported technological innovation. Moreover, those groups are judged on the economic impact of their technological innovations and overall business achievements. 
   I feel that it is fitting that I recognize the 1999 Tibbetts Award recipient TPL, Inc. and its CEO Mr. H.M. (Hap) Stoller for their hard work that has led them to receive this prestigious national award. TPL, Inc. is a leading contractor for the Army and Navy in the demilitarization of conventional munitions as well as the development of economically viable processes for the commercial reuse of recovered energetic materials. TPL, under sponsorship of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency in the Military Capacitor Program, has developed the state-of-the-art in high energy density dielectric materials for capacitive devices and has begun their manufacture for advance weapons system programs. The technologies underlying these accomplishments were initiated under the SBIR Program. 
   TPL was recently awarded a $38.4 million sub-contract from General Dynamics Ordnance Systems as part of their five-year, $145 million operational demilitarization contract from the U.S. Army's Industrial Operations Command. TPL will be totally responsible for three out of nine families of conventional munitions contained in the largest demilitarization program ever funded by the Army. Concurrently, through the Tri-Services Demilitarization Technology Office, the Navy is supporting three Phase III efforts to transition energetic materials resource recovery and reuse processes to pilot plant facilities, such processes designed to lower the cost of demilitarization activities as well as protect the environment by allowing demilitarization material reuse. These contracts reinforce TPL's position as an  innovator in demilitarization processes, an activity that is essential in the rapidly changing international system. Additionally, the work associated with these contracts will be performed at Fort Wingate, New Mexico, bringing critically needed jobs to one of the more disadvantaged parts of the State. 
   Mr. President, as you can see TPL, Inc. reflects the very best in SBIR achievement and has established itself as a strong national leader in technological innovation. In addition, TPL, Inc. was recognized in 1997 as one of the fastest growing technology companies in the State of New Mexico and in 1995, and again in 1996, was recognized as one of the fastest growing, privately held companies in the United States. Again, let me congratulate TPL, Inc. and its staff of their hard work, dedication, and commitment. They are a tremendous asset to their community and New Mexico, and we are extremely proud of their accomplishment.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I believe that late-term abortion procedures should be used as sparingly as possible, when all other options have been ruled out. But I do believe that it should be permitted as a last resort, and that when doctors judge it necessary to save a woman's life or to avert grievous injury to the physical health of the mother, they should not be subject to criminal prosecution. That is why I cosponsored the Durbin amendment. This amendment outlaws all post-viability abortions, regardless of the procedure used, except to save the life of the mother or avert grievous injury to her physical health. It also requires that both the attending physician and an independent non-treating physician certify in writing that, in their medical judgment, the continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health. Grievous injury is defined as (1) a severely debilitating disease or impairment specifically caused or exacerbated by the pregnancy or (2) an inability to provide necessary treatment for a life-threatening condition, and is limited to conditions for which termination of the pregnancy is medically indicated. 
   The underlying legislation, on the other hand, would not prevent a single late-term abortion as it is written. It only seeks to outlaw one procedure, which is broadly and vaguely defined. The term partial birth abortion is a political term, not a medical one. In fact, this legislation is written so vaguely that it is highly likely to be declared unconstitutional. In 19 of 21 states considering legislation similar to this legislation, courts have partially or fully enjoined the laws. These decisions have been made by judges who have been appointed by every President from President Reagan on. 
   Further, Mr. President, the Constitution protects a woman's right to make decisions about her pregnancy up to the point that the fetus is viable. The bill before us, and similar state bills, are vague and broad enough that this basic right is not protected, according to the vast majority of judges ruling on these laws. 
   For these reasons, I support the Durbin amendment and oppose the underlying bill.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I'm pleased to be joined by Senator MURRAY in introducing the ``National Laboratories Partnership Improvement Act of 1999''. This bill will make it easier for our national labs to collaborate and build strong technical relationships with other technical organizations, particularly universities and companies right near the labs. That will yield two major benefits. It will improve the labs' ability to do their missions, and it will promote high tech economic growth around the labs, thus, helping the labs as it helps the labs' communities. 
   Many of you know that making it easier to work with our national labs is a cause I've pursued for many years. And we've made solid progress. The labs are now involved in an array of technical collaborations, usually under cooperative research and development agreements or CRADAs, that would have been impossible a decade ago. In 1989, there were no CRADAs with the Department of Energy's national labs; in 1998, the number was over 800. 
   So, we've come a long way. But there's still work to be done. It's still not as easy to collaborate with the national labs as it should be, nor are collaborations as common as they need to be to keep our labs on the cutting edge of science and technology. This legislation takes the next steps in that direction. 
   There are three fundamental ideas running through this bill. The first is that scientific and technical collaboration with the national labs is good for our economy and essential to the future of the labs. The labs will be unable to succeed in their missions unless they can easily work with other technical institutions. Why? Because that's where the bulk of cutting edge technology is today. Consider the following. Real federal spending on R&D peaked in 1987, but from 1987 to 1997, national R&D grew by 20%. The federal government was responsible for none of that growth, and now accounts for only about a quarter of national R&D spending. In the same period, industrial R&D grew by over 50% and accounted for around 95% of the growth in national R&D. As Nobel laureate Dr. Burt Richter stated during his testimony on DOE's reorganization, ``All of the science needed for stockpile stewardship in not in the weapons labs.'' That's why I was so concerned with the ability of the labs to collaborate during the reorganization debate. 
   I emphasize how collaboration helps the labs because it's a point that's often missed in our discussions of tech transfer, CRADAs, and other such things. When legislation making it easier to work with the labs was passed in 1989, we were in the midst of a ``competitiveness crisis'' and looking for ways to use technology to improve our economic performance. After all, innovation is responsible for 50% or more of our long term economic growth. With these roots, people usually focus on how collaborating with the labs helps US industry by giving it access to a treasure trove of technology and expertise. For example, over a 100 new companies were started around DOE technology in the last four years. And, the fact that industry has been collaborating with the labs and recently paying for a greater share of those partnerships is good evidence that its getting something of value. The economic benefits from these collaborations are real and a primary reason I've pushed them for many years. 
   But the benefits back to the labs are real too. A recent letter from Los Alamos to me stated, ``Working with industry has validated our ability to predict ..... changes in materials ....., improved our ability to manufacture ..... replacement parts with greater precision and lower cost, and enhanced our ability to assure the safety and reliability of the stockpile without testing.'' 
   As an example, Sandia's collaboration with Goodyear Tire has helped Goodyear produce computer simulations of tires--an extremely complex problem--and helped Sandia improve its modeling and production of neutron generators, a critical component of nuclear weapons. Technical collaborations with our labs that have a clear mission focus by the lab and a clear business focus by the company are good for our economy and good for the labs' missions. 
   The second fundamental idea flows from the first. If collaborations with the labs are beneficial, we should keep working to make them better, faster, and more flexible--much like the collaborations we see sprouting throughout the private sector. Hence, this bill includes provisions to: 
   Establish a small business advocate at the labs charged with increasing small business participation in lab procurement and collaborative research; 
   Establish a technology partnership ombudsman at the labs to ensure that the labs are known as good faith partners in their technical relationships; 
   Authorize DOE to use a very flexible contracting authority called ``other transactions,'' which was successfully pioneered by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to manage some of its collaborative projects in innovative ways; and 
   Significantly streamline the CRADA approval process for government owned, contractor operated laboratories like Sandia, allowing the labs to handle more of the routine CRADAs themselves, and allowing more flexibility in the negotiation of intellectual property rights--all to make CRADA's more attractive to industry. 
   The third fundamental idea that runs through this bill is that if collaboration is important to our economy and to the success of the labs, then the local technical institutions near the lab--the universities and companies that might work with the lab--matter a great deal. We know that the environment inside an institution, how it's managed, will help determine how innovative it is. Managing innovation is more art than science, and that's why people are always visiting places like 3M. 
   Well, just as the internal environment affects how innovative an organization is, its external environment, the organizations near it that might collaborate with it, also help determine how innovative it is. When the technical institutions in a region form a high quality, dynamic network, they can meld into what's been called a ``technology cluster'' that dramatically boosts innovation and economic growth throughout the region. We see this most famously in places like Silicon Valley, or Route 128, or Austin, TX. In most of these places, there is a large research university that serves as the anchor innovator seeding the cluster. 
   With that phenomena in mind, this bill seeks to harness the power of technology clusters for the benefit of the labs' missions and the labs' communities, with the labs as the anchor innovator. The bill authorizes the labs to  work with their local communities to foster commercially oriented technology clusters that will help them do their job. Projects under this ``Regional Technology Infrastructure Program'' would be cost shared partnerships between a lab and nearby organizations with the clear potential to help the lab achieve its mission, leverage commercial technology, and commercialize lab technology. This is not about outsourcing a lab's functions, but about promoting technical capabilities near the lab that are commercially viable and useful to the lab. Thus, the lab gets highly competent collaborators nearby and the region gets high tech economic growth. 
   Let me give an example. Imagine a lab that does research in optics that has optics companies nearby. The lab and the companies discover they both need better training for their machinists and skilled workers. So they agree to set up and share the cost of an advanced training program for their workers at the local community college. This is good for the workers, good for the companies, good for the lab. Other types of projects this program might fund include: 
   Local economic surveys and strategic planning efforts; 
   Technology roadmaps for local industry; 
   Personnel exchanges among local universities, firms, and the lab; 
   Lab based small business incubators or research parks; and 
   Joint research programs between a group of local firms and the lab. 
   We have some real life examples of this kind of thinking in the research parks Sandia and Los Alamos are setting up to collaborate with industry and promote economic growth. And Argonne, Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, and Sandia have programs to link their technology with venture capital, to get it into the marketplace, which can only help advance the lab's mission. This bill will encourage the labs to systematically experiment with more projects like those. 
   Now, some might think that the Internet will make proximity irrelevant to collaboration. But that's not the case, as simple observation of Silicon Valley shows; it's not been dissipating, it's been growing. Close collaboration will remain easier among close neighbors, because it partly depends on people who know each other and are rooted in a community--which is why one provision of this bill is a study on how to ease employee mobility between the labs and nearby technical organizations. The Internet complements and strengthens collaborations, but is not a complete substitute for having collaborators nearby. Thus, even as the Internet grows in influence, it will still make sense to harness the power of technology clusters to help our labs do their jobs and to promote high tech economic growth in their communities. 
   Mr. President, for many years I've pushed for and supported efforts to make it easier for our national labs to work with industry, universities, and other institutions. I've done this because I think it's good for the science and security missions of our labs, good for our economy, and good for my home state of New Mexico. I think this bill is a comprehensive package that will yield more of those benefits, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, on Sunday William C. Gordon was installed as the 16th President of the University of New Mexico. 
   A psychologist by training, Dr. Gordon came to New Mexico by way of Wake Forest University, and Rutgers, where he earned his Ph.D. He taught at the State University of New York before moving to Albuquerque more than twenty years ago. Serving as a Professor of Psychology, then as chairman of the department, he became Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. From there he became the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs and then assumed the job of interim president. It was during that period, and after a national search had been conducted, that he himself was named President in March of this year. 
   Distinguished and well respected, Dr. Gordon has worked diligently throughout his administrative career to improve the university not only for the students and faculty, but for the staff and the wider community. He has sought to improve both the education people are getting, and the way they are getting it. The University of New Mexico is our state's largest institution of higher learning. The potential this represents is not lost on Dr. Gordon, and we look to him for leadership well into the 21st century.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware, Mr. BIDEN, for yielding time and also for his eloquent statements in opposition to going to a vote on this treaty. 
   First, I know everyone says we shouldn't talk about the process, that the process is history. But I think we should talk about the process and talk about the fact that next Tuesday is not the time this Senate should dispose of this issue. The reality is that there is a lot of uncertainty and a lot of confusion. 
   I learned early in my career that when you are uncertain, the best thing to do is sleep on it, take a little time, and let the issue resolve itself in your mind before you move ahead. And clearly there are a lot of unknowns out there that we need to know before we finally vote on this issue. 
   I hope that leadership--particularly the majority leader--will find a way to step back from this vote and give the Senate time to get the newest estimate from the intelligence community about what the capabilities of Russia are with regard to low-yield weapons development and also to get other expert advice. 
   Clearly, this is an issue of monumental importance. As we start a new century, we should not rush to judgment before we have given every Senator an opportunity to learn the issue and to understand the implications of it. 
   Our nuclear arsenal was developed, and has been maintained, because we believe having a safe and credible and reliable nuclear arsenal has improved and continues to improve U.S. security. I believe that. I am sure we will continue to maintain that nuclear arsenal as long as we still have that judgment. 
   The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which is the issue now before us, raises the question of whether we can continue to maintain our nuclear deterrent and maintain our national security through having that nuclear deterrent under a regime of no additional nuclear testing. I believe we can. 
   I believe the benefits we derive from going ahead with this treaty and in slowing the spread, and the improvement, of nuclear weapons around the world by others make this treaty very much in our national interest. 
   Some have argued that without the ability to test nuclear weapons, we cannot have 100-percent confidence that those weapons will work as intended. I agree with that. I think it is undoubtedly true that an unlimited testing regime will give us a higher degree of confidence in our own nuclear weapons than no testing at all. Clearly, that is true for all of our potential adversaries as well. They will do better at developing weapons, and they will have a more capable, reliable nuclear arsenal to point at us--potential adversaries will--if we go ahead and have them pursue unconstrained testing. 
   But we can, in my view, have sufficient confidence in the reliability of our weapons through the work we have labeled the Stockpile Stewardship Program. This is a program that has been discussed frequently on the Senate floor. It is one I have spent many hours studying and trying to understand in the nuclear weapons laboratories in my State--Los Alamos and Sandia. 
   I think we need to balance against this concern about lack of 100-percent confidence. We need to balance against that the consequences that would result from a rejection of this treaty by the Senate. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN spoke about the likely reaction of a 
   rejection of this  treaty in India and Pakistan, both countries which have demonstrated their nuclear capability already and are on the way toward developing a real nuclear arsenal that can be used against each other or other countries. 
   Other Senators have talked on the floor about the likely effect of a rejection of this treaty on China or on Russia. The simple fact is that the United States is far ahead of any other country in the world in our ability to maintain our nuclear deterrent under a no-testing regime. 
   Our allies--and that includes our allies who have nuclear weapons--believe it is in their interest and in the interest of the world for us to go forward with this treaty and believe that, on balance, their security will be enhanced if we go forward with this treaty. If that is their judgment--those nuclear-capable countries depend much more on testing than we do--that a no-testing regime will, on balance, improve their national security, then I have trouble seeing how entry into a test ban treaty can put us at a comparative disadvantage when we have tremendous capability to determine the reliability and safety of our weapons without testing--not 100-percent capability, but we have great capability and capability that far exceeds that of any other potential adversary. 
   Let me say, in closing, I would like to go back to this issue of procedure and where we go. Since it is clear to me, and I think to all Senators and all observers of the Senate, that the two-thirds votes necessary under our Constitution to ratify this treaty are not present today in the Senate and are not likely to be on Tuesday, I think it would be a tragic mistake for us to go ahead with that vote next week. I hope very much that cooler heads prevail, as the Senator from Virginia said earlier in the discussion. I hope cooler heads prevail and we find a way to put this off to a time when we can approach it with more knowledge and better judgment. 
   In the final analysis, the question we must decide is whether this treaty will reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons, reduce the number of states with nuclear arsenals, and lessen the likelihood of nuclear weapons being used in the next century. That is the issue before us. I believe it will accomplish each of those end results. I believe the treaty will have that effect. When it does come to a vote, I hope very much that two-thirds of the Members of this Senate have the good judgment to support the treaty. 
   Mr. President, I see there is another Senator wishing to speak. I yield the floor, and I yield the remainder of our time.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first let me yield myself 6 minutes off of my time at this point. 
   I am offering this amendment on behalf of myself, Senator JACK REED from Rhode Island and JOHN KERRY from Massachusetts, and I believe they will both be here, I hope, to speak on behalf of the amendment as well. 
   This amendment is intended to ensure greater accountability in our educational system and in the expenditure of title I funds. Let me make it very clear to my colleagues at the very beginning of this debate, this amendment does not add money to the bill. Instead, it tries to ensure that a small portion of the title I funds that we are going to appropriate in this bill are spent to achieve greater accountability and improvement in the schools that are failing, about which we are all so concerned. 
   I think we can all agree that greater accountability in our schools is an imperative. It is particularly important to have this accountability where high concentrations of disadvantaged students are in order to ensure that all students have some semblance of equal educational opportunity. Although most States have adopted statewide standards, they have not directed adequate resources to schools that are failing to meet those new standards. Dedicated funds are necessary in order to develop improved strategies in those schools and create rewards and penalties that will hold schools accountable for continuous improvement in their students. 
   The Federal Government directs over $8 billion, nearly $9 billion, in Federal funding to provide critical support for disadvantaged students under title I. But the accountability provisions in title I have not been adequately implemented due to insufficient resources. Title I authorizes State school support teams to provide support for schoolwide programs and to provide assistance to schools in need of improvement through activities such as professional development or identifying resources for changing the instruction in the school or the organization of the school. 
   In 1998, however, only eight States reported that school support teams have been able to serve the majority of the schools identified as needing improvement. Less than half of the schools identified as being in need of improvement in the 1997-1998 school year reported that this designation of being a school needing improvement led to additional professional development or assistance. 
   Schools and school districts need additional support and resources to address weaknesses soon after those weaknesses are identified. They need that support to promote a progressively intensive range of interventions, continuously assess the results of those interventions and implement incentives and strategies for improvement. 
   The bill before the Senate does not identify specific funds for accountability enforcement efforts. I believe we need to ensure that a significant funding stream is provided to guarantee these accountability provisions are enforced. 
   This amendment seeks to ensure that 2.5 percent of the funds appropriated to LEAs under title I--that is $200 million in this year's bill--is directed toward this objective. This money is to be used to ensure that States and local school districts have the necessary resources available to implement the corrective action provisions of title I by providing immediate and intensive interventions to turn around low-performing or failing schools. 
   The type of intervention that the State and the school district could provide using these funds includes a variety of things. Let me mention a few: 
   One would be purchasing necessary materials such as updated textbooks and curriculum technology. 
   The second would be to provide intensive, ongoing teacher training. Inadequate training of teachers has been a problem in many of the failing schools. 
   A third would be providing access to distance learning where they don't have the teachers on site who can provide that instruction. 
   Fourth, extending the learning time for students through afterschool or Saturday programs or summer school programs so students can catch up to the grade level at which they should be performing. 
   Next, providing rewards to low-performing schools that show significant improvements, including cash awards or other incentives such as release time for teachers. 
   Sixth, intensive technical assistance from teams of experts outside the schools to help develop and implement school improvement plans in failing schools. The teams would determine the causes of low performance--for example, low expectations, an outdated curriculum, poorly trained teachers or unsafe conditions--and provide assistance in implementing research-based models for improvement. 
   One example of the type of research-based school improvement model that needs to be introduced in failing schools and can be introduced in failing schools with the resources we are earmarking in this amendment is the Success for All Program. This program is a proven early grade reading program in place now in over 1,500 schools around the country, some in my own State of New Mexico. At the end of the first grade, Success for All Program schools have average reading scores almost 3 months ahead of those in matching controlled schools. By the end of the fifth grade, students read more than 1 year ahead of their control group peers. This program can reduce the need for special education placements by more than 50 percent and virtually eliminate retention of students in the grade they have just completed. 
   This Success for All Program incorporates small classes, regular assessments, team learning, and parental involvement into a comprehensive reading program based on phonics and contextual learning techniques. In order to implement this program, however, schools need resources, particularly in the first year. The estimated costs is about $62,000 for 500 students in that first year; that decreases substantially  to about $5,000 per year in the third year the program is in place. They must provide the initial training for the school's principal, the facilitators, the teachers, and 23 days of onsite training and curriculum materials. 
   This is the kind of program of which we need to see more. It is the kind of program for which the funds we would earmark in this amendment would be made available. In my view, this is the type of thing the American people want to see. Instead of just sending another big check, let's try to attract some attention to the strategies we know will work so the failing schools can move up and the students who attend these schools can get a good education. 
   I see my colleague, Senator REED. I reserve the remainder of my time and yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. REED.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment, as I have said before, should not be a partisan issue. I know many of the amendments that have been brought to the Senate floor in recent days and weeks and even months have been voted along partisan lines. This amendment should not be. The need for accountability is not a partisan issue. 
   Just yesterday, Governor Bush from Texas talked about his plan for improving accountability in title I schools. Under his plan, school districts and schools would have to show improvement in test performance. If schools improved, they would be rewarded with additional funds. If schools did not improve in 5 years, those funds would be taken and given to parents or students in vouchers of $1,500 each. 
   The problem with this proposal is it provides the stick, a very big stick with dire consequences for schools that do not perform, but it does not provide resources to help those schools avoid that failure. This proposal says if you can figure out how to turn your school around with the meager resources you have, fine; if you cannot, then we will let the clock run out and then take the money away, so your odds against succeeding become insurmountable.  
   What this amendment will do is provide that assistance to those schools immediately when the failing nature of that school is recognized. I think this is an extremely important amendment. It is something we ought to do. I hope this is considered by each Senator as a good-faith effort to better use the funds we are spending in this bill. 
   Once again, I remind all my colleagues, this amendment does not add money to the bill. This is not a question of whether we are going to spend more or less on education. It is a question of how effectively we can spend the funds we are going to spend. 
   Mr. President, I gather my time is up. I yield the floor at this time and wait for the response, if there is any opposition to the amendment, which I certainly hope there is not.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me read a few sentences from it. This is addressed to me, Senator BINGAMAN.  
   On behalf of the nation's Governors, I write to express our strong support for your amendment to provide states with additional funds to help turn around schools that are failing to provide a quality education for Title I students.  
   It goes on to say:  
   Earlier this year, the National Governors' Association (NGA) adopted an education policy that recognizes the important role of the states in providing technical assistance to local school districts to help them implement federal education programs.  
   It goes on to say:  
   ......the policy calls on the federal government to provide states with sufficient funds to enable states to provide school districts with the tools to meet federal program requirements. Your amendment would provide such funding. Therefore, NGA supports your amendment and will urge other Senators to support the adoption of it.  
   This is a good amendment. The States support it. It will help dramatically in improving our schools. We should not postpone this. We should not kick this down the road and say we will deal with it sometime in the future. We should do it today. 
   I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment that Senator DOMENICI and I are offering to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a study of and the appropriateness of the geographic adjustment factor that is used in Medicare reimbursement calculations as it applies particularly to our State of New Mexico. 
   We have a very serious problem in our State today; many of our physicians are leaving the State. The reimbursement that is available under Medicare, and accordingly under many of the health care plans in our State, is less for physicians performing procedures and practicing medicine in our State than it is in all of our surrounding States. We believe this is traceable to this adjustment factor, this geographic adjustment factor. 
   This is a system that was put into place in 1992. It now operates, as I understand it, such that we have 89 geographic fee schedule payment areas in the country. We are not clear on the precise way in which our State has been so severely disadvantaged, but we believe it is a serious problem that needs attention. 
   Our amendment directs that the Secretary conclude this study within 90 days, or 3 months, report back, and make recommendations on how to solve the problem. We believe it is a very good amendment. We recommend that Senators support the amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. I rise today in strong support of the use of dental sealants for children for purposes of oral health promotion and disease prevention. They have been proven to be safe and effective in the prevention of dental caries in children, and when coupled with fluoridated water systems can virtually eliminate dental decay and reduce tooth loss. I believe that the most successful dental sealant programs for our children covered in the EPSDT programs in Medicaid could be those that are school linked and community based. Analyses show that an amount of $1,000,000 is a reasonable amount to begin a demonstration project such as this.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to join with my colleagues from Arizona, California, and Texas in introducing the ``State Criminal Alien Assistance Program II and Local Medical Emergency Reimbursement Act of 1999.'' 
   The purpose of the bill is to expand to scope of the current SCAAP law to allow counties and states to be reimbursed not only for the costs of incarcerating illegal aliens, but also for the costs of prosecuting them, defending them and detaining them. Currently, SCAAP only pays for the costs of incarcerating illegal aliens convicted of a felony in the United States. This means that counties and states do not get reimbursed for the indirect and direct costs leading to such a conviction. Because many illegal aliens arrested for drug smuggling or alien smuggling by federal agents are prosecuted by the county prosecutors, this has put an enormous strain on the county's prosecution budgets and has burdened the already struggling indigent defense programs. With the expansion of SCAAP, the counties will finally get some relief. 
   Another positive change to the SCAAP law is the addition of juvenile incarceration as a reimbursable expense. Many drug traffickers are using teenagers to transport drugs across the border, knowing that we do not currently have a good system for dealing with criminal illegal juvenile aliens. Because these teens' parents are not living in the United States, the county jails are required to detain the teens pending adjudication. The other option is to let the teens go. Neither option is good from a law enforcement perspective, but the cost of detaining a juvenile places an enormous burden on the counties' juvenile detention facilities. I am pleased that this bill considered the counties' concerns and included the costs of detaining juveniles as a reimbursable expense. 
   In 1994 I supported the original SCAAP bill. Between 1996 and 1999, the federal government has reimbursed the State of New Mexico $4.5 million for costs incurred in incarcerating criminal illegal aliens under this program. New Mexico counties have been reimbursed more than $1.4 million for similar costs. However, this $6 million reimbursement represents but a small fraction of the actual costs expended by New Mexico jails and prisons. This bill seeks to increase the amount available for reimbursement by raising the amount authorized to $200 million between 2002 and 2005. 
   The second part of this bill addresses another problem facing the border states. Because many towns near the US-Mexico border are a mere stones throw away from much larger Mexican towns and cities, many Mexican nationals often cross the border illegally in search of emergency medical services due to the lack of adequate facilities in Mexico. This bill will reimburse the health care providers required to provide emergency medical services to illegal aliens. 
   The border counties in New Mexico have repeatedly expressed their concern about the lack of federal assistance for emergency medical services provided to undocumented immigrants. Yet, under current law, New Mexico border communities are not eligible to be reimbursed for providing such emergency medical services. This has placed a significant financial burden on the public and private hospitals who are just trying to do what they think is right--provide emergency treatment to those in need. This lack of federal assistance has been very detrimental to New Mexico because the number of undocumented immigrants seeking medical attention in New Mexico is very high compared with the population of the New Mexico border community. 
   Between January 1, 1999 and August 31, 1999, Mimbres Memorial Hospital in Deming, New Mexico reported that 22 percent of its patients that were unable to pay for their medical care were residents of Mexico. These individuals accounted for $379,311 in charges that had to be absorbed by this hospital. In a town of roughly 10,000 people, this is a sizeable amount for a local hospital to write-off as uncollectible. 
   With the passage of this bill, New Mexico will be eligible to participate in this federal reimbursement program. Because the authorized amount for this program will be increased to $200 million between 2002 and 2005, this change will not affect the reimbursements to other states. This increase in funding is sorely needed to adequately address the financial burdens that illegal immigration imposes on the border communities. 
   I commend my fellow members of the Senate Southwest Border Caucus for working together on a bill what will make these necessary changes to the SCAAP program and address the financial hardship that illegal immigration imposes on our border communities. 
   I thank Senator KYL for introducing this bill and I encourage the Senate to take up this bill and pass this worthwhile legislation.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce two education bills for consideration in the context of reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (``ESEA''). Two weeks ago, I introduced two education bills related to raising standards and improving accountability for our public school teachers. Last week, I introduced three bills related to raising standards and accountability in our schools. The two bills that I introduce today focus on raising standards and accountability for student performance. One bill continues our commitment to provide support for the standards-based reform movement taking place in virtually every State by reauthorizing the National Education Goals Panel. The other bill, the Access to High Standards Act, which I introduce on behalf of myself and Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, will provide our high school students with greater access to rigorous, college level courses through advanced placement programs. 
   I think most people would agree that in order to compete and continue to prosper in our global economy, it is imperative that our students are provided with a world-class educational program. To that end, we owe it to our students to define high academic standards, monitor their progress and provide them with the resources they need to succeed. The National Education Goals Panel has played a crucial role in achieving these objectives by focusing attention on the need to raise standards and effective methods for achieving higher performance on the local level. As a founding and current member of the National Education Goal Panel, I am pleased to introduce a bill that would reauthorize the Panel so that it can continue its efforts to provide leadership and track progress for local efforts to raise standards for student performance. 
   The Goals Panel is a bipartisan body of federal and state officials made up of eight governors, four members of Congress, four state legislators and two members appointed by the President. The Panel is charged with reporting national and state progress toward goals set initially by the nation's Governors during a National Education Summit meeting with President Bush and expanded during the 1994 ESEA reauthorization Summit meeting with President Bush and expanded during the 1994 ESEA reauthorization process in the Educate America Act. The Panel also identifies promising practices for improving education and helps to build a nationwide, bipartisan consensus to achieve the goals. The eight National Education Goals call for greater levels of: school readiness; student achievement and citizenship; high school completion; teacher education and professional development; parental participation in the schools; literacy and lifelong learning; and safe, disciplined and alcohol- and drug-free schools. 
   We need to continue the Panel's work, because we are not yet where we need to be with respect to meeting the goals or with respect to supporting state and local efforts to put in place standards-based educational programs. Data collected by the Goals Panel has helped and can continue to help State and local officials to formulate comprehensive school improvement policies. The Goals Panel also has provided and can continue to provide guidance to federal, state and local policy-makers by providing a national picture for student performance. We have made good progress towards developing more competitive, high quality educational systems in our states and localities, but we must not leave the task incomplete. We must continue to focus attention and resources on incorporating high standards into public education. As Secretary Riley stated before the nation's governors and President Bush met in 1989, ``Significant educational improvements do not just happen. They are planned and pursued.'' I hope that my colleagues will support continuation of the Goals Panel so that we can continue to use the Panel as a tool for setting and achieving high standards for student performance. 
   Building on the successful expansion of the Advanced Placement Incentive Program achieved in the last Congress, the Access to High Standards Act is intended to help foster the 
   continued growth of advanced placement programs throughout the nation and to help ensure equal access to these programs for low income students. Advanced placement programs already provide rigorous academics and valuable college credits at half the high schools in the United States, serving over 1.5 million students last year. Many States that have advanced placement incentive programs have already shown tremendous success in increasing participation rates, raising achievement scores, and increasing the involvement of low-income and under-served students. Nevertheless students--particularly low-income students--continue to be denied or have limited access to this critical program. 
   Despite recent growth in state initiatives and participation, AP programs are still often distributed unevenly among regions, states, and even high schools within the same districts. Just a few months ago, a group of students filed a complaint in federal court against the State of California seeking equal access to advance placement programs. Over forty percent of our nation's public schools still do not offer any Advanced Placement courses. The  Access to High Standards Act is intended to take additional steps in fostering the continued growth of advanced placement programs throughout the nation and to help ensure equal access to these programs for low-income students. This bill creates a $25 million demonstration grant program to help states build and expand advanced placement incentive programs giving priority to districts with high concentrations of low-income students and to State programs targeting low-income students. In addition, the bill authorizes a pilot grant program for States seeking to provide advanced placement courses through Internet-based on-line curriculum to students in rural areas or areas where the lack of available advanced placement teachers make it impossible to provide traditional courses. The bill also make AP a part of other federal education programs such as the Technology for Education Act programs that I helped author in 1994. In this way, federal initiatives will be encouraged to incorporate the high standards and measurable results of the AP program. 
   As many of my colleagues know, college costs have risen many times faster than inflation over the last decade, making attendance more difficult for high school graduates and creating tremendous financial burdens. Advanced placement programs address this issue by giving students an opportunity to earn college credit in high school by preparing for and passing AP exams. In fact, a single AP English test score of 3 or better is worth approximately $500 in tuition at the University of New Mexico, and the credits granted to students nationwide are worth billions each year. 
   By promoting AP courses, we also address the need to raise academic standards. Many states and districts are struggling to develop and implement rigorous academic standards and concrete measures of achievement--an approach that is advocated by many experts, lawmakers, and the public. By implementing high academic standards and providing standardized measures for achievement through AP programs, we can help prepare students for college. This is clearly a necessary goal. Almost 33 percent of all freshmen fail to pass to pass basic entrance exams and are required to take remedial courses. And, at least in part due to academic difficulties, over 25 percent of freshmen drop out before their second year. 
   In addition, expanding AP programs improve students' academic performance in college. And because the vast majority of AP teachers teach several non-AP classes as well, AP programs also have a tendency of raising schoolwide standards and achievement among the 400 new schools adopting the program each year. As Secretary Riley has said, expanded AP will ``help fight the tyranny of low expectations, which tragically hold back so many of our students.'' 
   Of course, there is no single remedy or federal program that can hope to address all of the issues that public education must face in order to improve the achievement and preparation of our students. However, I believe that high college costs and low academic standards deserve our closest attention, and I am confident that expansion of advanced placement programs will help states address these issues effectively. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues to incorporate the two bills I am introducing today, as well as, the education bills introduced in recent weeks into the ESEA. I believe that they will go a long way towards improving education in the United States by focusing on raising standards and ensuring accountability for teacher, school and student performance.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in introducing the ``Medicare Beneficiary Access to Care Act of 1999.'' I want to commend the leadership in the development of this legislation and hope  that the Congress will act upon this now, before we adjourn. 
   The bill is designed to modify some of the many, unforseen consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Daily I receive letters and calls citing the negative impact of the Balanced Budget Act on access to patient care and to the delivery of quality care in an ongoing and coordinated fashion. In my State of New Mexico, the health care delivery system has been particularly hard hit. Essentially, the system for delivery of health care that we have worked so hard to attain is being eroded and must be bolstered before patients face a crisis. 
   I represent a state where 21 out of 33 counties are designated as health professional shortage areas. I represent a state that has seen an exodus of physician specialists and rural doctors this past year. Over the last year, New Mexico had 70 home care agencies close despite yeoman's efforts to keep these agencies open and serving our citizens. This represents closure of over 40 percent of our home health care agencies. We currently have one county, Catron, that has no home care entity available for serving patients. Failure to deal with the additional 15-percent cut that is slated to go into effect in October of 2000 would be the end of numerous other home health agencies throughout my state. It would be inexcusable not to address this issue this session. 
   Additionally, the system is further under stress in the nursing home arena. We have seen one nationally based entity declare bankruptcy and face the demise of others. Long term care facilities must be reimbursed at a level that reflects the acuity of the residents for whom they care. Long term care is key not only for the residents but for their families near and far. 
   Mr. President, several of my colleagues have addressed the issue of GME and the plight of our teaching hospitals. Hospitals have a multitude of services that they provide and which we should bolster. I must note, for example, that in New Mexico, declining Medicare reimbursement is forcing the only acute care hospital in Dona Anna County to close a 15 bed skilled nursing unit because of mounting financial losses. Realities such as this must make us mindful of the far reaching and adverse effects the BBA of 1997 is now having on communities and their residents. We want to ensure that no other facilities face closure. 
   Finally, I must add that rural and frontier clinics are critical components to care for seniors and others in the community with limited resources and serve to allow for timely, geographic access where there otherwise would be no health care available. I am pleased that some redress of their needs is provided in this legislation. 
   Others have outlined the components of this legislation and I will not repeat the specifics. It is sufficient to say, that these changes are needed to avert a crisis in the health care delivery system of this country, to maintain access to quality care for our seniors and to rectify problems for the system that were created inadvertently. We must act now to provide for easy access to quality, continued health care for our citizens. 
   I look forward to working with all of my colleagues here in the Senate to see that this legislation is passed prior to adjournment.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments today to offer some remarks on a matter of extreme importance to this Nation and to the world--the matter of preventing the further proliferation of nuclear weapons among the nations of the world through ratification and implementation of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   Two weeks ago--September 10--was the third anniversary of the United Nation's overwhelming vote to approve a treaty banning the testing of nuclear weapons. The General Assembly voted 158 for to 3 against the treaty, with a handful of abstentions. 
   Last week, on September 24, the United States observed the third anniversary of signing that treaty and, on September 22, marked the second anniversary of its receipt by the Senate for our advice and consent. 
   In accordance with article 14 of the treaty, preparations are now underway to convene an international conference of states which have ratified the treaty to negotiate measures to facilitate its implementation. I'm sorry to say, Mr. President, that unless the Senate acts immediately to ratify this treaty, the United States--an original signatory to the treaty and a leader in the global movement to stop the testing of nuclear weapons--will not take part in that conference. 
   Our absence sends a troubling message to the international community looking for our leadership. 
   Mr. President, I am very sorry to say that essentially nothing has happened since President Clinton signed the treaty on behalf of the United States on September 24, 1996, and sent it to the Senate for consideration on September 22, 1997. 
   There have been no hearings, there has been no debate on the Senate floor, there has been no vote on ratification. This is an extremely important treaty that I believe, and the great majority of Americans agree, would help to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons during the coming millennium. And yet the Senate has not even begun the debate. 
   Mr. President, I believe the United States and the nations of the world have come to a historic crossroads--a crossroads that symbolizes America's view of the future and the potential direction of the international system regarding the control and eventual eradication of nuclear weapons. 
   The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty lies at the center of the crossroads, and provides us with two basic options. 
   We could elect to ratify the treaty and seek its broadest implementation in order to prevent the further proliferation of nuclear weapons; 
   Or, we could elect not to ratify the treaty, having decided as a body that permitting the testing of nuclear weapons by all current and future nuclear powers is in the interest of safety and security of the United States and the world. 
   If we chose not to ratify the treaty, that choice would permit us to pursue future avenues for nuclear superiority in response to nuclear weapons developed by our real or potential adversaries. 
   Mr. President, I believe that our Nation has already been down that road. It was called the nuclear arms race. It cost the Nation over a trillion dollars according to a recent study by the Brookings Institution. And that's just money. It doesn't include the opportunity cost of brainpower and skills not used to address other national problems such as medical and environment science or education. 
   The fact is, Mr. President, that the way things stand, we are not being permitted to make either choice. Despite repeated requests by Members of the Senate to address this vital national and international security issue, the  Senate has done nothing to move this treaty forward and debate it. 
   The Foreign Relations Committee has taken no action with respect to the treaty and is preventing the Senate from debating and voting in this most critical issue to the future of world peace. By his actions, the chairman of the committee is preventing the Senate from carrying out its constitutional duties and obligations to give advice and consent regarding the CTBT. 
   Mr. President, I support the call to hold hearings and bring this treaty to the floor for a debate and a vote. The American people strongly support this treaty and deserve to have that view represented and debated in the Halls of Congress. 
   Will the treaty be an effective means to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons? Let's debate the point. 
   Will the treaty be verifiable? Let's hear from the experts on that crucial issue. 
   Will the CTBT serve America's national security interest? Let's examine that from every angle. 
   As I mentioned at the outset of my remarks today, Mr. President, I believe the Nation and the world stand at a historic crossroads with respect to the spread of nuclear weapons. I believe it is our duty and obligation to the American people to choose the proper road to take. The key word, Mr. President, is ``Choose.'' The Senate is currently being prevented from making a choice--and in so doing, a choice is being made for us--by a few individuals seeking to advance an unrelated political agenda. 
   I'm certain I share an abiding faith in our democratic system with the Members of this body. If that's so, a debate, discussion, and vote on perhaps the most critical security issue facing our Nation today should be placed before the Senate as soon as possible. Failure to permit such a debate and vote suggests to me either a lack of faith in the democratic process or a disdain for its importance or validity. 
   Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to support efforts to bring the CTBT to the floor.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, last week I introduced two education bills related to raising standards and ensuring accountability for the teachers in our schools. Today, I am pleased to introduce three bills that relate to raising standards and ensuring accountability for the performance of our schools--the Small, Safe Schools Act, the National Dropout Prevention Act and the School Improvement Accountability Act. Next week, I will introduce two bills which relate to raising standards and ensuring accountability for student achievement. All of these bills, which I hope to incorporate into the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, form the foundation for a comprehensive plan to improve the quality of our public education system. The three bills that I am introducing today focus on improving school performance. 
   The Small, Safe Schools Act would help to ensure that children have a sense of belonging in their school by providing incentives for the construction of smaller schools and providing resources to create smaller learning communities in existing larger schools. In this way, we can create school environments that keep our children safe and make it easier for them to meet high standards for achievement. Research demonstrates that small schools outperform large schools on every measure of school success. 
   In the wake of the tragedy at Columbine High School, one of the most important concerns regarding school quality is school safety. Issues of school safety can be effectively addressed by creating smaller schools or smaller learning communities within larger schools. Behavorial problems, including truancy, classroom disruption, vandalism, aggressive behavior, theft, substance abuse and gang participation are all more common in larger schools. Teachers in small schools learn of disagreements between students and can resolve problems before problems become severe. Based on studies of high school violence, researchers have concluded that the first step in ending school violence must be to break through the impersonal atmosphere of large high schools by creating smaller communities of learning within larger structures, where teachers and students can come to know each other well. 
   School size also can have a critical impact on learning. Small school size improves students grades and test scores. This impact is even greater for ethnic minority and low income students. Small institutional size has been found to be one of the most important factors in creating positive educational outcomes. Studies on school dropout rates show a decrease in the rates as schools get smaller. Students and staff at smaller schools have a stronger sense of personal efficacy, and students take more of the responsibility for their own learning, which includes more individualized and experimental learning relevant to the world outside of school. 
   Small schools can be created cost effectively. Larger schools can be more expensive because their sheer size requires more administrative support. More importantly, additional bureaucracy translates into less flexibility and innovation. In addition, because small schools have higher graduation rates, costs per graduate are lower than costs per graduate in large schools. 
   The Small, Safe Schools Act would establish three programs designed to promote and support smaller schools and smaller learning communities within large schools. Schools or LEAs could apply for funds to help develop smaller learning communities within larger schools. The bill also authorizes the Secretary to provide technical assistance to LEAs and schools seeking to create smaller learning communities. In addition, the bill would provide funding for construction and renovation of schools designed to accommodate no more than 350 students in an elementary school, 400 students in a middle school, and 800 students in a high school. 
   On behalf of myself and Senator REID, I also offer the National Dropout Prevention Act, which is a bill designed to reduce the dropout rate in our nation's schools. While much progress has been made in encouraging more students to complete high school, the nation remains far from its goal of a 90 percent graduation rate for students by 2000. In fact, none of the states with large and diverse student populations have yet come close to this goal, and dropout rates approaching 50 percent are commonplace in some of the most disadvantaged communities during the period from ninth grade to senior year. The bill is based on many of the findings of the National Hispanic Dropout Project, a group of nationally recognized experts assembled during 1996-97 to help find solutions to the high dropout rate among Hispanic and other at-risk students. In addition to widespread misconceptions about why so many students drop out of school and lack of familiarity with proven dropout prevention programs, one of the main factors contributing to the lack of progress in this area is that there is currently no concerted federal effort to provide or coordinate effective and proven dropout prevention programs for at-risk children. In fact, there is currently no federal agency or office that is responsible for the multitude of programs that include dropout prevention as a component.  
   The Act makes lowering the dropout rate a national priority. Efforts to prevent students from dropping out would be coordinated on the nation level by an Office of Dropout Prevention and Program Completion in the Department of Education. The Office would disseminate best practices and models for effective dropout programs through a national clearinghouse and provide support and recognition to schools engaged in dropout prevention efforts. In addition, this bill provides funds to pay the startup and implementation costs of effective, sustainable, coordinated, and whole school dropout prevention programs. Funds could be used to implement comprehensive school-wide reforms, create alternative school programs or smaller learning communities. Grant recipients could contract with community-based organizations to assist in implementing necessary services. 
   The School Improvement Accountability Act, the third bill I am introducing today, sets more rigorous standards for States and LEAs receiving Title I funds by strengthening the accountability provisions in Title I. The Title I program provides supplemental services to disadvantaged students and schools with high concentrations of disadvantaged students. These students and these schools are often short-changed by our educational system. The bill seeks to ensure that all schools are often short-changed by our educational system. The bill seeks to ensure that all schools receiving Title I funding achieve realistic goals for student achievement and that all students reach those goals, narrowing existing achievement gaps. Recipients will be required to set goals for student achievement which will result in all students (in Title I schools) passing state tests at a ``proficiency'' standard within 10 years of reauthorization. The bill also requires States, LEAs and schools to focus on elimination of the achievement gap between LEP, disabled & low-income students and other students and to ensure inclusion of all students in state assessments. 
   The bill also modifies the corrective action section of the bill, which is the section that is triggered when schools identified as being in need of improvement, have not made sufficient gains towards the goals set out in the schools Title I plan. The School Improvement Accountability act would require schools failing to meet standards must take one of three actions affecting personnel and/or management of the schools: (1) decreasing decision-making authority at the school level; (2) reconstituting the school staff; or (3) eliminating the use of noncredentialed staff. Students in failing schools also would have a right to transfer to a school which is not failing. 
   In order to ensure equal educational opportunities for all our children, we must ensure that schools are safe, welcoming places. We also must ensure that students in danger of dropping out of school are not lost, but instead graduate high school with the skills that they need to be productive members of our society. We must provide special support to students with greater obstacles to learning, such as disadvantaged students, students whose first language is not English, and disabled students. We must ensure that schools serving these students can provide high quality educational programs and that those schools are held accountable for the success of all students. The bills I offer today will do much to achieve these goals. I hope that my colleagues will support these efforts.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to express my support for more section 8 housing vouchers to help local housing agencies meet local housing needs. Although many Americans have benefited tremendously from the current economy, many others have not shared in that wealth. In my state, housing costs in communities like Santa Fe and Albuquerque have risen faster than the incomes of low- and middle-income workers. 
   Many working families can no longer afford housing in the cities where they work, and many are forced to commute long distances just to stay employed. Section 8 vouchers fulfill a very great need in the communities where entry level housing costs are seven to eight times the annual income of its residents. 
   The need for vouchers in New Mexico far exceeds the number of vouchers currently available. The waiting list for section 8 vouchers is 14 months in New Mexico. The waiting time is even higher in places like Albuquerque and Santa Fe. Mr. President, the elderly, disabled and working families with children cannot wait 2 years to get into decent, affordable housing. Those on the waiting list do not have many alternatives in New Mexico as the waiting time to get into public housing is 9 months. Voucher recipients are not asking for free housing, they are asking for assistance in obtaining one of the most basic needs we have--shelter. 
   Although Congress authorized 100,000 new vouchers for fiscal year 2000, this bill failed to fund those new vouchers. Mr. President, I hope we can pass an amendment today that will adequately address the housing needs of our working families, disabled, and elderly.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. The Chairman may be aware that as part of last year's Higher Education Act, working with thirteen of our colleagues, I was able to get a program in East Asian Science, Engineering, and Technology authorized at NSF. This new program, which is a successor to a program at the Defense Department, will teach American scientists and engineers about East Asian languages, technological developments, management techniques, and research institutions. It will improve our understanding of East Asian research and train a cadre of American researchers who can effectively cooperative with their East Asian counterparts.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Well, unfortunately the program was authorized too late in the year to make it into the President's budget request for FY 2000. But NSF, including the top leadership is quite enthusiastic about the program. They've had a day-long workshop to help design the program, and I understand may even release the report from that workshop soon. My point is I think that they could be ready to get the program started this coming fiscal year. 
   Would the Chairman agree that to the extent there is some discretionary money available at NSF in FY 2000 and that NSF's leadership believes they have a solid program plan, they can and should begin the East Asian Science, Engineering, and Technology program in FY 2000? Moreover, that NSF should budget for the program in FY 2001 and beyond? I think that would be consistent with your interest in seeing more international cooperation in science and engineering.

   I understand the tight budget situation the committee finds itself in and the many requests the Chairman and Ranking Member face for water and wastewater funding from the EPA's State and Tribal Assistance Grant Program. Unfortunately, the committee could not find sufficient funding for a critical wastewater treatment project in Bayard, New Mexico. This community, along with the Village of Santa Clara and the Fort Bayard State Hospital, face a loss of their wastewater treatment plant. Three years from now, the Cobre copper mine will no longer accept wastewater from these communities and an alternative must be found. If not, these communities will essentially return to the days of the outhouse. 
   May I ask the Chairman if he is aware of the critical wastewater situation facing the citizens of Bayard and Santa Clara?

While this moratorium was established to address the growing shortfall between allowable contract support costs and the amounts appropriated for such costs, the practical effect of the prohibition has been to prevent many Indian tribes from providing their members with the most basic of services, whether it involves health services, social services, law enforcement or road maintenance.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer my views on this year's Defense authorization conference report. I plan to vote for the conference report. It is a bill that, like other defense bills of the past, contains a great many excellent provisions that enhance our military capability and the quality of life for our service personnel and their families. My normal enthusiasm for the Defense bill this year is tempered, though, by a number of provisions that, in my view, do not serve the interest of national security well. I would like to review the positive aspects of the conference report first, though, before discussing its troubling aspects. 
   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have worked very hard to see that issues and programs that I care about were addressed in this conference report. I am pleased to say that many of the concerns that I raised in subcommittee, full committee, the floor, and finally, in conference have been met. 
   A few examples are worth emphasizing: 
   This conference report does a lot of very good things for the men and women in the military and their families. The services reported difficulties in recruiting and retaining key personnel during the past year--raising concerns that this might grow more serious in years to come. 
   In response, the conference report includes a 4.8 percent pay raise for military personnel, and raises the annual increase for service people by a half a percentage point above increases in the cost of living over the next five years. That's good news. 
   The conference report extends, and, in some important instances, increases special pay and bonuses for key skill categories that were due to expire at the end of this year. 
   Of particular interest to many New Mexico families at our Air Force bases at Holloman, Kirtland, and Cannon, junior and mid-career Air Force aviation officers could qualify for additional bonuses of $25,000 for each year they promise to extend active duty service. That is good news in our State and for the Nation. 
   The conference report also increases authority for re-enlistment bonuses from $45,000 to $60,000. 
   For retirees and folks in the military contemplating retirement, the conference report fixes the inequity that penalized those who came under the Redux system after 1986. Those military personnel may now elect to transfer to the old system, or to accept a $30,000 bonus while remaining under the Redux program. Recent retirees and those soon to retire in New Mexico enthusiastically welcome this provision. 
   Veterans and their families will also benefit from a very important measure in this year's conference report--a change that have been advocating for the last couple of years. Any veteran's family seeking an honor guard at the funeral of one of our veterans is now guaranteed to have one. Uniformed personnel, the presentation of an American flag, and the playing taps will be provided in recognition for service to the nation whenever requested. That is good news for our veterans community. 
   There is another initiative for veterans that I strongly support in this conference report. It could lead to authorization for veterans to use National Guard armories to receive services and counseling regarding a wide spectrum of veterans' benefit programs. This measure could go a long way toward making it easier for our veterans to receive the benefits that they are due. 
   That is a bit about the ``people part'' of the conference report--an area where I think it has quite a bit to offer. 
   The conference report also makes some important contributions on key policy matters--for example, programs that have to do with preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, particularly through cooperative programs with Russia and other countries of the Newly Independent States. 
   The conference report includes, for example, $475 million for the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program to accelerate the disarmament of Russian strategic weapons, assist in chemical weapons destruction, and support efforts to increase security for Russian nuclear materials in order to prevent them from being smuggled aboard. I urge the Congress to fully support this program through authorization and appropriation of the necessary funds. It remains fully in our own security interests to do so. 
   There is also funding for programs to prevent Russian weapons scientists from selling their skills to the higher bidder. The Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention and the Nuclear Cities Initiative will help us to keep that from happening, while at the same time building important people to people relationships that we hope will sustain improved relations between our nations during coming decades. 
   Again, although I believe these programs are worthy of more funding than they received, I am pleased that funding has been authorized and I urge the Congress to appropriate those funds as well. 
   This conference report also authorizes funds for another important cooperative program that will serve our security interest well--the Russian-American Observation Satellite 
   program (RAMOS). RAMOS is being designed to take the uncertainty out of early warning of missile attacks. It is meant to ensure that in case a missile firing is detected, a military order to respond with nuclear missiles is not made in error. Fully funding a robust RAMOS program will greatly serve our nation's nuclear security. I urge the defense appropriators to ensure that those funds are available. 
   Looking toward the future of the Nation's military capability, this conference report includes funding for basic science and technology research in accordance with my hopes and intentions to increase that level of funding by 2 percent in real terms. That level of funding was not won without a fight, however, and I remain concerned that future defense budgets may fall short in this area. If that happens, the technological advantages that we have witnessed in the Persian Gulf and in the Balkans will erode quickly, and international military challenges could result in significant casualties and losses of expensive military equipment. 
   As you know, the conference report also authorizes funding for defense programs within the Department of Energy (DOE). This bill authorizes $4.5 billion for DOE weapons programs including the science-based stockpile stewardship that enables the Department to certify the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons without having to test them. 
   Stockpile Stewardship is providing challenging science to a new generation of scientists employed at the labs that will not only certify the stockpile, but assure the nation that the best scientific talent available continues to  support science programs at our national laboratories such as those in my State, Sandia and Los Alamos. 
   These aspects of the Defense conference report are all very favorable, and normally I would vote for such a report with the greatest enthusiasm. My enthusiasm, though, is diminished by the provisions of the conference report dealing with the management of the Department of Energy. These provisions cause me deep concern, as I believe they will be damaging to our national security in the long term. 
   These troublesome provisions are largely found in Title 32 of the conference report. This is a wholly new Title that was inserted in conference. It was not part of the original Defense bill passed by the Senate or by the House. It differs substantially, in a few crucial respects, from the DOE reorganization proposals considered and agreed to by the Senate in the intelligence authorization bill. 
   Title 32 contains the most sweeping revisions in DOE organization since the founding of the agency in 1977. Yet, there was not a single Members' meeting throughout the entire conference to discuss its provisions. When you consider the importance of our nuclear arsenal, the lack of a role for Members in fixing the terms of its reorganization is striking and very hard to justify. 
   The result is a statute that, in my view, will be exceptionally difficult to implement. Coping with the ambiguities and internal contradictions of Title 32 will needlessly distract the new administration and the Department of Energy from the mission of maintaining the safety and reliability of the nuclear stockpile. This is not just my personal view. The ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee commissioned a study of title 32 from the experts in law and government organization at the Congressional Research Service (CRS), after the conference report was filed. The CRS produced a sobering assessment of this new title, highlights of which my colleague has shared with us. I have also received an expression of deep concern from 43 State attorneys general about the impact of the changes that were made in Title 32 on the applicability of the Federal Facilities Compliance Act to the new administration. Their concern merits our attention, and I hope that the Armed Services Committee arranges for hearings at which they can present their views directly for our consideration. 
   In addition to these issues, the new title 32 creates what looks to me to be a complete muddle in the area of counterintelligence and responsibilities and authorities. The problems that the conference report create for DOE counterintelligence programs can best be described by looking at before-and-after organizational charts of counterintelligence responsibilities related to one of DOE's facilities, the Los Alamos National Laboratory. 
   Chart 1 shows the current flow of responsibility and authority for counterintelligence at DOE and Los Alamos. It is very simple, and Secretary Richardson is to be commended for putting it in place. The DOE Chief of Counterintelligence, Ed Curran, is in charge. He has hire-and-fire authority over the Chief of Counterintelligence at DOE facilities like Los Alamos. If we discover a loss of classified information at Los Alamos tomorrow, we know where to look for answers. 
   Chart 2 depicts the lines of authority that will exist under title 32. Secretary Richardson's reforms will be completely reversed. Under title 32, DOE will have two competing centers of control over counterintelligence in the nuclear weapons complex. Which of these individuals is in charge of counterintelligence? If you define ``being in charge'' as 
   being able to issue direct commands to the labs, where the counterintelligence threat exists, it would appear that neither person is in charge. 
   The Director of DOE-wide Counterintelligence is statutorily forbidden from exercising any direct control over the laboratories. He can issue policy pronouncements, and has to go up through the Secretary of Energy and then down through 4 layers of bureaucracy to get in touch with a lab like Los Alamos. 
   And the Chief of Defense Nuclear Counterintelligence is not in a much better position, either. He also has to go up through his boss and down through a lateral chain of command to impose his will on anyone at the laboratories. He can talk to everyone, hence the dotted lines, but he cannot tell anyone anything definitive on his own authority. 
   The lack of clarity for counterintelligence responsibility in title 32 is perhaps the most ironic and distressing aspect of the whole DOE reorganization scheme. Right now, these responsibilities in the Department are clear, thanks to Secretary Richardson's reforms. When we started debating changes to DOE organization, the one change that everyone seemed to agree on was the need to have clarity on matters of counterintelligence. Yet, after this Defense bill is enacted, we will be back to the days of diffuse responsibility for counterintelligence. 
   I have no illusions that we are going to vote down this conference report because of the defects in title 32. There are too many other important things that got done right in this bill. But we have created a real muddle at the Department of Energy in the area of nuclear weapons and their management. We will have to come back in next year's Defense bill to fix it. 
   There is one other issue that we will have to address next year. That is the issue of polygraphs. The section on counterintelligence polygraphs in the conference report is a slight improvement over the corresponding provision in the Senate-passed Defense bill. But there are still fundamental problems with what we are asking DOE to do. We are asking DOE to use polygraphs as a screening tool--the one application where the scientific validity of polygraphs is most suspect. I don't have a big problem with using some forms of polygraphs in the context of an investigation, where there is already evidence of wrongdoing. There is scientific support for that sort of polygraph test. But polygraphs as a screening tool have little or no track record in the scientific literature. We shouldn't be using them in the nuclear weapons complex. And the way that DOE has proposed to use polygraphs in its recent Federal Register notice goes beyond what we actually call for in this bill. I have taken a public position in opposition to this proposed DOE rule on polygraphs, because it is not based on sound science and does not represent reasoned decision making, in my view. 
   I hope that DOE will rethink its proposed rule. This conference report, although it encourages the use of screening polygraphs, also gives DOE the flexibility to study the matter further. I hope that DOE will seek review from the National Academy of Sciences on the reliability of the types of polygraph screening it plans to implement. I also recommend that the DOE reconstitute and reconvene the Chiles Commission to study the rule's likely impact on the critical human resources needed to ensure the safety and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile. The Senate could, in my view, profit from such studies in revisiting this issue in next year's Defense bill. 
   In the end, then this year's conference report is more of a mixed bag than in most years. What we have done through the normal committee and conference process, on a bipartisan basis, has been done well, and we can be justly proud of it. What was done in a rushed and less cooperative fashion is much less satisfactory. I support the conference report overall, and I expect that the problems that have been needlessly created will manifest themselves for corrective action in fairly short order. I hope that when they do arise, we are able to address them in a more bipartisan and thoughtful way.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, during the next couple of weeks, I plan to introduce a series of education bills for consideration in the context of reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). As you know, one of the most important issues facing America today is improving the quality of our public school system. Improving the quality of education in America requires a comprehensive approach. I believe the basis for that approach must be raising standards and achieving greater accountability. This approach cannot focus on any one facet of our education system but must address all facets. The bills that I will introduce address three key areas; these bills raise standards and improve accountability for our teachers, for our schools and for our students. Today, I am pleased to introduce two bills, which I believe will go a long way towards raising standards for teaching in America's schools--the Quality Teachers for All Act and the Technology for Teaching Act. 
   Improving teacher quality continues to be one of my top priorities in the Senate, because research demonstrates that teacher quality is the single most important factor in student achievement. The Quality Teachers for All Act will improve instructional quality by ensuring that teachers in Title I classrooms possess the subject matter knowledge, teaching knowledge and teaching skills necessary to work effectively in our nation's classrooms. The Technology for Teaching Act, which I introduce today on behalf of myself, Senator PATTY MURRAY and Senator COCHRAN, will improve the quality of instruction by providing teachers with necessary training in the use of technology in the classroom. 
   I am a strong supporter of the hard-working teachers in American classrooms. As the son of two teachers, I know that the profession is extremely challenging and meaningful. I also know that the vast majority of our teachers are dedicated, professional and competent. Far too many schools in America, however, allow classrooms to be led by teachers with insufficient training 
   and qualifications to teach. Unfortunately, it is the schools and classrooms with the neediest children who often have the greatest number of unqualified teachers. During a time when we are demanding increased levels of performance for our schools and our children, we also must set high standards for all our teachers, including those instructing students who will have the greatest hurdles to overcome in the learning process. 
   Improving teacher quality is one of the most important changes we need to make to our educational system--especially if we are serious about improving the education of low-income and minority children. Good teachers are so important that almost half of the achievement gap between minority and white students would be erased if minority children had access to the same quality of teachers, according to recent research published by the Education Trust. Parents, business leaders, and the public at large rank teacher quality as a top concern because it just makes sense that a student's teacher would have a dominant effect on his or her education. The need for further progress in improving teacher quality was recently highlighted in two 1999 studies--one from the Secretary of Education, the other from Education Week.  
   Over 30 percent of all math teachers are teaching outside of their field of academic preparation--with even higher percentages in other academic areas and in high-poverty schools. Almost 15 percent of the new teachers hired in high-minority districts lack full teaching credentials, which usually involve passing tests to demonstrate needed skills and knowledge. In my home State, during the past school year, 1,074 people were teaching in New Mexico's schools with substandard licenses. Another 737 of New Mexico's teachers were teaching subjects they weren't certified to teach. 
   The Quality Teachers for All Act addresses this problem by requiring that all teachers in schools receiving Title I funds be fully qualified. This means possessing necessary teaching skills and demonstrating mastery in the subjects that they teach. By ensuring quality teachers in every classroom, we will be empowering our children by providing one of the most important resources for academic achievement. Under the Quality Teachers for All Act, an elementary school teacher must have State certification, hold a bachelor's degree and demonstrate subject matter knowledge, teaching knowledge and teaching skills required to teach effectively in reading, writing, mathematics, social studies, science, and other elements of a liberal arts education. Middle school and secondary school instructional staff must have state certification, hold a bachelor's degree, and demonstrate a high level of competence in all subject areas in which they teach. This demonstration of competence may be achieved by a high level of performance on a rigorous academic subject area test, completion of an academic major (or equal number of courses, or in the case of mid-career professionals, a high level of performance in relevant subject areas through employment experience. 
   Recognizing that some areas have difficulty attracting qualified teachers, the Quality Teachers for All bill addresses this problem by allowing school districts to use funds authorized under the bill to provide financial incentives for fully qualified teachers, such as signing bonuses. In addition, the bill supports efforts to recruit new teachers by providing alternative means of certification for highly qualified individuals with college degrees, including mid-career professionals and former military personnel. The bill also provides support for State efforts to increase the portability of teachers' pensions, certification and years of experience so that qualified teachers can have greater mobility and districts can fill unmet needs for qualified teachers more easily. School districts also may use the funds to support new teachers to ensure that we retain the qualified teachers that start in the profession. 
   The bill also empowers teachers by providing financial support for programs designed to assist teachers currently working in the system to achieve the qualifications required under the bill. The bill will provide grants to assist States and LEAs to provide necessary education and training to teachers who do not meet the necessary qualifications. The forms of assistance can include tuition for college or university course work. 
   Recognizing the critical role played by parents and the need to make them a partner in our efforts to raise teaching standards, this bill requires districts and schools to provide parents with information regarding their child's teacher's qualifications. This effort builds on provisions I authored which became part of the Higher Educations Act of 1998. Those provisions require a national report card on teacher training programs. By reporting this information, the public as well as the schools can assess the strengths and weaknesses of teacher training programs. Likewise, the parental right-to-know provision in the Quality Teachers for All Act will empower parents by informing them of the strengths and weaknesses of their children's teachers and help them to provide support for increased teacher quality efforts. 
   If our educational system is going to prepare our children for the 21st Century, we must do a better job at preparing our teachers and our students to use the tools of the 21st Century--technology. We also must use this valuable resource to improve instruction and expand access to learning. Therefore, efforts to raise standards for teaching also must include greater incorporation of technology into our teacher training programs and our classrooms. In response to this need, I--along with Senators MURRAY and COCHRAN--are proud to introduce the Technology for Teaching Act. If enacted, this bill will build on existing efforts to improve teacher training in the use of technology in the classroom and provide resources to develop 
   innovative uses of technology in the classroom. 
   Education technology can enlarge the classroom environment in ways that were unimaginable only a decade ago and can empower students to develop as independent thinkers and problem-solvers. Teachers deserve the skills needed to bring these extraordinary resources and opportunities into the classroom. Without these skills, America's teachers will find it increasingly difficult to meet the rising international standards of educational excellence. We also must provide for research and development, as well as evaluation of existing uses of technology, in order to ensure that the most effective education-related technology is in place in our nation's schools. In addition, we must close the digital divide by making technology available to all students, during the school day and outside the school day. 
   The Technology for Teaching bill will provide federal support to: (1) provide training to teachers to assist them to integrate technology into their classrooms; (2) evaluate the role of technology in the classroom; (3) stimulate the development and use of innovative technologies to assist students to achieve high academic standards; and (4) narrow the ``digital divide'' by providing high-need communities and students with greater access to technology. 
   Experts say that we should invest at least 30 percent of our technology budget in training. Nationally, we are now investing less than one-third that amount. Only 15 percent of teachers had 9 or more hours of technology instruction in 1994. Trained teachers help make computers useful to students, connect school to the home and community, and help prevent misuses of technology. Most of all, trained teachers can improve student achievement by applying the technology to academic content areas. The Technology for Teaching Act establishes two teacher training programs, administered by the Office of Education Technology in the Office of the Deputy Secretary of Education, to make competitive grants to State Departments of Education. One program promotes the inclusion of education technology in the initial undergraduate preparation of new teachers; the other focuses on ongoing professional development of current teachers. 
   Schools of education that train new teachers will be eligible to apply to State Departments of Education for grants to improve their programs in education technology. Grant support would require and enable schools of education to work in collaboration with local K-12 school districts and the education technology private sector. Through these partnership activities, schools of education will improve and expand the ways in which they prepare future teachers to use technology in the classroom. 
   Local K-12 Education Agencies (LEAs) will be eligible to apply to State Departments of Education for grants to improve their professional development programs in education technology. In applying for grants, LEAs will be required to develop consortia that include one or more schools of education, education technology companies, and other partners able to help improve their professional development programs. These consortia will provide LEAs and teachers with access to the latest education research and the most current education technology available. The results of these partnership activities will be new and innovative programs for teacher professional development. 
   The question of whether education technology is an effective tool in the classroom is already being answered in part by solid peer-reviewed studies which show a significant improvement in student performance and attitude in all age groups and all subject areas through better use of technology. This research demonstrates what advocates have believed all along: if 
   used correctly, technology in the classroom  produces measurable improvement in student achievement and enthusiasm. A new $25 million research and evaluation program at the National Science Foundation will provide even more insight into the positive impact of education technology. The need for a larger scale research and coordination initiative remains. The Technology for Teaching Act requires the Secretary of Education to evaluate existing and anticipated future uses of educational technology. The Secretary may conduct long-term controlled studies on the effectiveness of the use of educational technology; convene experts to identify uses of technology that hold the greatest promise for improving teaching and learning and to identify barriers to the commercial development of effective, high-quality, cost-competitive educational technology and software. 
   We also must continue to support research and development efforts to explore new uses for technology to improve instruction. The bill provides for grants to stimulate the development of innovative technology applications. The Secretary awards competitive grants to consortia of public and private entities developing innovative models of effective use of educational technology, including the development of distance learning networks, software (including software deliverable through the Internet), and online learning resources. For example, grants could be awarded to projects seeking to develop web-based instruction to provide access to challenging content such as Advanced Placement courses. 
   Reduces inequities in access to computers and the Internet must continue to be a main function of federal education technology programs. Education technology can engage students, provide much-needed employment skills, and open up a world of learning and experiences. But like well-trained teachers and new school buildings, these resources tend to flow to wealthier school districts. If we believe that no child should be too poor to have a quality teacher, a safe classroom or textbook, the same should hold true for access to computer technology. The federal government ha always been the great equalizer between the haves and have-nots. Therefore its main mission with respect to education technology should be to do what it does best--level the playing field so all students can acquire the computer skills to function in today's world. the bill targets existing technology grants and the new grant funds authorized by this bill to high-poverty, low-performing schools. The bill also supports the development and expansion of community technology centers to serve disadvantaged residents of high-poverty communities. The centers provide access to technology and training for community members of all ages. 
   By ensuring high-quality, well-prepared teachers in our classrooms, we empower our educational system and our nation to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex and challenging world. I know that most, if not all, of my colleagues agree that a critical first step in improving our nation's schools is to support efforts to raise standards for teaching in our poorest and most challenged schools and to prepare our teachers and our children in the use of technology, while also capitalizing on the benefits of technology as an educational tool. We made great progress in our efforts to improve the quality of instruction by raising standards for teacher quality in the higher Education Act last year and through existing program supporting the use of education technology in schools. I urge my colleagues to continue to support these efforts by supporting passage of the Quality Teachers for All Act and the Technology for Teaching Act.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the Wilderness Act. Specifically, I would like to speak about the invaluable contribution of New Mexico Senator Clinton P. Anderson in steering the wilderness legislation through Congress and securing final passage. I also will describe how the Gila Wilderness in New Mexico came to be created, the first such designation in the world, forty years prior to enactment of the Wilderness Act. Finally, in my remarks today, I will mention a related bill that I recently introduced, S. 864, the ``Earth Day'' Act. 
   On September 3, 1964, President Johnson signed the Wilderness Act into law creating the national wilderness preservation system. In order to assure that some lands will be protected in their natural condition, Congress declared a policy of securing for present and future generations of Americans ``the benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness.'' Certain provisions of the Wilderness Act are unique among the U.S. Code because they read more like poetry than the fodder of legislators and lawyers. For example, the Act defines wilderness as ``an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.'' 
   Why celebrate the anniversary of the Wilderness Act? Since its enactment, the national wilderness preservation system has grown from 9 million acres to 104 million acres--I believe these figures reflect the popularity of and support for wilderness. There are many compelling reasons for preserving wilderness. Wilderness areas protect watersheds and soils, serve as wildlife and plant habitat, and give humans the 
   opportunity to experience solitude in nature. I think Clinton Anderson best described the meaning of wilderness in this eloquent statement:  
   Conservation is to a democratic government by free men as the roots of a tree are to its leaves. We must be willing wisely to nurture and use our resources if we are going to keep visible the inner strengths of democracy. 
   For as we have and hold dear our practices of conservation, we say to the other peoples of the world that ours is not an exploitative society--solely materialistic in outlook. We take a positive position--conservation means that we have faith that our way of life will go on and we are surely building for those who we know will follow ...... 
   There is a spiritual value to conservation and wilderness typifies this. Wilderness is a demonstration by our people that we can put aside a portion of this which we have as a tribute to the Maker and say--this we will leave as we found it. 
   Wilderness is an anchor to windward. Knowing it is there, we can also know that we are still a rich nation, tending to our resources as we should--not a people in despair scratching every last nook and cranny of our land for a board of lumber, a barrel of oil, or a tank of water.  
   Senator Anderson's words are particularly meaningful because of his role as the tenacious and determined leader in Congress who secured passage of the Wilderness Act as many years ago. In fact, former Forest Service Chief Richard McArdle stated that, ``Without Clinton Anderson there would have been no Wilderness Law.'' 
   In his first substantive act as the new Chairman of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, on January 5, 1961, Clinton Anderson introduced a bill to establish and maintain a national wilderness system. Although similar wilderness bills had been introduced in previous Congresses, it was Senator Anderson's bill that was first reported by the Committee and, later that year, the first to pass the Senate. The vote on his bill was decisive, 78 to 8. Senator Frank Church wrote to Senator Anderson that:  
   The fact that you were chief sponsor of the bill was in large measure responsible for the big endorsement it received on final passage.  
   Unfortunately, the House was not yet ready to seriously consider a wilderness bill and the 87th Congress adjourned without enactment of the Wilderness Act. 
   In 1963, Senator Anderson introduced the Wilderness bill once again. Successfully steering the bill through Committee consideration, the full Senate overwhelmingly passed the bill three months into the term of the 88th Congress. He then crafted the legislative trade that ultimately resulted in House passage of the wilderness bill--key House members wanted legislation creating the Public Land Law Review Commission. Both pieces of legislation were signed in 1964. 
   Upon signing the Wilderness Act into law, President Johnson gave Senator Anderson special commendation by stating that he had been ``in the forefront of conservation legislation since he first came to the House in 1941.'' 
   In recalling the 35th anniversary of the passage of the Wilderness Act, it is fitting to observe that this year is also the 75th anniversary of Federal wilderness protection. 
   On June 3, 1924, the Forest Service designated 755,000 acres of national forest land in New Mexico as the Gila Wilderness. This unprecedented act took place forty years prior to passage of the Wilderness Act and was the first such designation in the world. It all began through the foresight and leadership of a young Forest Service manager in New Mexico named Aldo Leopold. He had worked for the Forest Service in the Southwest in a variety of different positions, including as a Ranger on the Gila National Forest. 
   Leopold felt that preservation had been neglected on the national forests. He foresaw the importance of preserving the biological diversity and natural systems giving way to development. 
   Leopold once wrote that ``a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community.'' 
   He argued against the proposed expansion of a road system into the back country of the Gila National Forest and proposed instead that a large area be left roadless and preserved for wilderness recreation. 
   Today the Gila Wilderness is inhabited by bear, deer, elk, beaver, bobcat, mountain lion, antelope, and wild turkey. It is a favorite destination for hikers, backpackers, and anglers who enjoy its 19 miles of fishing streams. 
   The Gila Wilderness contains the cliff dwellings of the ancient Mogollon civilization as well as the campsites and battlegrounds of the Apache and the U.S. Cavalry. In fact, John Murray wrote in his book, ``The Gila Wilderness: A Hiking Guide,'' that ``no other wilderness area in the Southwest so much embodies and reflects this national history and natural philosophy as does the Gila.'' He went on to note that ``many of the important events in the development of the region, from the first expedition of Coronado in 1541 to the more recent raids of Geronimo, occurred either directly in the Gila Wilderness Area or in the immediate vicinity.'' 
   Leopold would go on to become one of America's greatest naturalists. His accomplishments include publication of ``A Sand County Almanac,'' one of the most influential books ever written  about the relationship of people to their lands and waters. 
   Our nation continues to need opportunities to reflect on the importance of preserving our national world. The celebration of Earth Day each year on April 22nd is an effective way to remind us of the significance of the environment and of accomplishments such as the Wilderness Act. S. 864, the ``Earth Day Act'', is a bill that I introduced last April along with Senator CHAFEE. It has since gained nine additional bipartisan cosponsors. The purpose of S. 864 is to officially and permanently designate April 22nd as Earth Day. 
   The first Earth Day was 29 years ago, in 1970, and was first conceived of by our former colleague, Senator Gaylord Nelson. That first Earth Day involved some 20 million Americans. Since then, Earth Day has focused the attention of the country and the world on the importance of preserving and maintaining our environment. I believe the nation owes a great debt of gratitude to Senator Neslon for his leadership in creating Earth Day, and that we should recognize the importance it has assumed in our nation's life. 
   It is my sincere hope the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold hearings on S. 864, and that the Senate will pass the bill by the end of this year. It is my goal to have the President sign S. 864 into law by the time Earth Day 2000 arrives. I invite all of my colleagues to cosponsor this bill.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am supporting Senator HUTCHISON's amendment to extend the moratorium on the oil valuation rule of the Department of the Interior. I do this with some reluctance because like most of my colleagues from oil producing States, I believe strongly that this issue must be settled. Yet, after careful consideration, I cannot honestly conclude that the rule as currently proposed will achieve that. 
   I have worked hard with officials from the Department of the Interior and others to try to find the right approach to resolving the disputes involved in this rulemaking. I am very aware of the hard work and good faith efforts of many in the environmental and public interest community, within the States, and within the industry, to address the controversial issues raised  by this rule. I believe there has been progress. However, we are not there yet. 
   The way oil from Federal leases is valued for purposes of calculating royalty payments is complex to say the least. Nonetheless, it is also very important; it is important to those producing the Federal oil, it is important to the American taxpayers, and it is important to the States who receive up to half of the proceeds from Federal leases within their state boundaries. 
   My State of New Mexico is the second largest producer of onshore Federal oil and gas. In 1998, there were almost twelve thousand Federal oil and gas leases within New Mexico, covering over seven million acres of land. The majority of these leases are operated by small independent producers whose livelihood is greatly impacted by the manner in which Federal payments are calculated. 
   In 1998, the State of New Mexico received almost $168 million as its share of the revenues from Federal mineral leases within the State. My State uses these payments to help fund its public education system. 
   Given these circumstances, it is obvious to me that the method of valuing these Federal royalty payments is of deep concern to New Mexico, from a number of different angles. It is important to get it right. It is pointless to create rules that are unworkable, or unfair, or that will be mired in costly and nonproductive litigation. I owe it to the honest producers in my State, as well as to my State Treasury, to try to ensure that a final rulemaking on this subject will achieve the desired end of fairness to all, and creation of a clear set of standards that will not be plagued by endless controversy. 
   For this reason I am supporting an additional moratorium. I do not believe the rulemaking as it is currently proposed will work. The Department of the Interior has indicated that its latest round of comments has resulted in information which it has found helpful, and which could result in changes that would satisfy the concerns of industry and others, while ensuring that the United States receives fair market value for its oil resources. The Department has suggested that with this new information, it may be able to work out ways to resolve the issues that to date have proven so intractable. 
   I believe imposition of this moratorium will allow the Department the additional time it needs to re-propose this rule, and get to the elusive, but necessary resolution of this issue. 
   In comments I submitted to this rule, I recommended a number of areas for change, based on my conversations with New Mexico producers, and with other interested groups. These include ensuring that independent producers and others who engage in arms-length sales of their oil pay royalties only on the actual amount they receive; creating reasonable deductions for transportation costs; and resolving the treatment of marketing costs. I continue to urge the Department to consider these recommendations as it addresses the final rule.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, several weeks ago Cibola County in New Mexico lost one of its leading citizens when Clif Lear of Grants died of cancer. 
   A businessman, he took public service very seriously and served over the years as a city councilman and as the city manager. His contributions to economic development in an area hit hard when the mines closed made a huge difference to the people of Cibola County, as he worked tirelessly to attract new initiatives and new projects. 
   His wife and three daughters have the sympathy and appreciation of us all who are grateful for Clif's life and the effort he made to make his corner of New Mexico better.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. I rise in the hope that the Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the gentleman from Alaska, will engage in a colloquy with myself, Senator JEFFORDS and the Chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, the gentleman from Washington, on the Weatherization Assistance Program provision in the bill passed by the other body. 
   Mr. Chairman, as you are aware, the other body passed its version of the FY 2000 Interior appropriations legislation on July 14. That bill included a provision mandating States to provide a 25 percent state cost share, or state match, in order to receive their FY 2000 Weatherization Assistance grants. 
   Despite the potential ramifications of implementing a State match, no hearings have been held, and no input has been solicited from the States to determine if cost sharing is realistic or necessary for this program. 
   As many Senators are aware, state legislatures across the country simply cannot meet this deadline with such short notice. In fact, some legislatures are about to adjourn and will not meet again for another year or even two. 
   Currently, the only data we have regarding the impact of the proposed State match comes from an informal survey undertaken this month by the National Association of State Community Services Programs; it indicates that 25 states definitely cannot provide matching funds in FY 2000; another five large states are uncertain whether they can meet the requirement, and less than ten States currently provide state-appropriated funds to Weatherization and would be able to comply immediately. 
   It seems to me that consideration of such a fundamental change in the distribution of state Weatherization Assistance grants falls squarely under the jurisdiction of the authorizing committee. Wouldn't the Chairman agree?

   Mr. BINGAMAN. I am told that, nationally, Weatherization leverages about a 50 percent add-on from non-federal sources--but there is no study of this and it probably varies widely among states. In fact, the same informal state survey I just mentioned reported that many of the states have private partnerships between the utilities and the local community action Weatherization programs, brokered in many instances by the Weatherization programs, and that these partnerships are growing as utility restructuring moves forward. Many building owners in low-income communities also chip in for these services. 
   Further, I am told many states have excellent coordination among the federal low-income energy and the low-income housing and community development programs. However, the fact is that most of the states reviewed the terms of the match in the House bill and said they don't believe these public-private efforts would qualify under that terminology. 
   I believe we would really have to look into any requirement that didn't encourage private investment in these local programs; I hope the distinguished chairman of the Energy Committee would concur in opposing the inclusion of language authorizing a State match for Weatherization in the Interior appropriations bill or Conference Report.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to highlight an issue of growing concern, namely funding for the U.S. chemical demilitarization program. My concern is that the Congress has been cutting the funding required to eliminate our stockpile of chemical weapons and agents, despite the fact that we have a treaty commitment under the Chemical Weapons Convention to destroy that stockpile by April 24, 2007. 
   Simply put, if we in Congress do not provide the funds needed to meet that treaty commitment in time, we will be forcing the United States to violate an arms control treaty that we in the Senate approved with our vote of advise and consent to ratification. 
   Mr. President, this is a trend we should not be continuing. In fact, we should be providing the funds needed to ensure that the United States can and does meet its treaty obligations for all treaties to which we are an adherent, including the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
   Given the Senate's unique constitutional role in providing advice and consent to the ratification of treaties, I would hope this proposition would be self-evident to all our colleagues. Nonetheless, Mr. President, the Conference Report on the Military Construction Appropriations Bill, H.R. 2465, contains significant reductions from the funding requested for military construction of chemical demilitarization facilities needed to meet our treaty obligations. 
   The program is cut by $93 million dollars in fiscal year 2000 funds, including a reduction of $15 million dollars for planning and design work. This appears to be a technical mistake, Mr. President, since the budget request did not contain any funds for planning and design in the military construction projects for chemical demilitarization. This is deeply disappointing since neither appropriations subcommittee had reduced the military construction funding in their respective bills. On the contrary, each subcommittee had provided full funding of the budget request for military construction for the chemical demilitarization program. The conference, however, chose to ignore that and cut funding. 
   If, as I suspect, those funding reductions would jeopardize our ability to meet our CWC treaty obligations, I hope the Defense Department will take some remedial action, such as a reprogramming or a supplemental request to ensure that the necessary funds are available to do the work needed to ensure that we remain compliant with the treaty. I also hope that the Defense Appropriations Conference will provide the necessary funding for this program since there are reductions made by both House and Senate subcommittees that I believe are not warranted, and are based on incomplete information. 
   Mr. President, there was a preliminary assessment conducted by the Defense Department's Comptroller office earlier this year that looked at the rate of obligations and disbursements for the chemical demilitarization program. Unfortunately, before that assessment was completed, an internal DoD memorandum was leaked with preliminary and incomplete information. That internal memo was the basis for much concern among various congressional committees. The problem is that some of the Committees acted on the basis of that incomplete information, and it is now clear that the preliminary information was incorrect. Consequently, Congress cut funds for the chemical demilitarization program based on faulty information. 
   Since that internal memo was leaked, Congress has been looking into the financial management of the chemical demilitarization program, and we have been provided with more complete and accurate information. This information makes it clear that we should not be cutting the program funding based on the earlier information. 
   The Armed Services Committee, on which I serve as the Ranking Member of the Emerging Threats subcommittee that has responsibility for this program, asked the General Accounting Office to conduct a preliminary review of the financial management of the program. Their conclusion was that the funds requested are all needed and that there are plans for spending them at a reasonable rate. In other words, Mr. President, the worries about slow obligation or expenditure rates are not justified, and there is a good explanation for why the funds are obligated and expended at their current pace. In my  view, this means that Congress should not be cutting the funds based on the incorrect information, but should provide the needed funding.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, yesterday I was pleased to be joined by Senators ROCKEFELLER, SNOWE, and MIKULSKI in introducing the Electronic Commerce Extension Establishment Act of 1999. The purpose of the bill is simple--to ensure that small businesses in every corner of our nation fully participate in the electronic commerce revolution unfolding around us by helping them find and adopt the right e-commerce technology and techniques. It does this by authorizing an ``electronic commerce extension'' program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology modeled on NIST's existing, highly successful Manufacturing Extension Program. 
   Everywhere you look today, e-commerce is starting a revolution in American business. Precise e-commerce numbers are hard to come by, but by one estimate e-commerce sales in 1998 were $100 billion. If you add in the hardware, software, and services making those sales possible, the number rises to $300 billion. Another estimate has business to business e-commerce growing to $1.3 trillion by 2003. Whatever the exact numbers, an amazing change in our economy has begun. 
   But the shift to e-commerce is about more than new ways to sell things; it's about new ways to do things. It promises to transform how we do business and thereby boost productivity, the root of long term improvements in our standard of living. A recent Washington Post piece on Cisco Systems, a major supplier of Internet hardware, notes that Cisco saved $500 million last year by selling its products and buying its supplies online. Imagine the productivity and economic growth spurred when more firms get efficiencies like that. And that's the point of the bill, to make sure that small businesses get those benefits too. 
   Electronic commerce is a new use of information technology and the Ineternet. Many people suspect information technology is the major driver behind the productivity and economic growth we've been enjoying. The crucial verb here is ``use.'' It is the widespread use of a more productive technology that sustains accelerated productivity growth. It was steam engine, not its sales, that powered the industrial revolution. 
   Closer to today, in 1987, Nobel Prize winning economist Robert Solow quipped, ``We see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.'' Well, it looks like the computer has started to show up because more people are using them in more ways, like e-commerce. Information technology producers, companies like Cisco Systems who are, notably, some  of the most sophisticated users of IT, are 8% of our economy; from 1995 to 1998 they contributed 35% of our economic growth. There are also some indications that IT is now improving productivity among companies that only use IT. 
   But here is the real point. If we are going to 
   sustain this productivity and economic growth, we have to spread sophisticated uses of information technology like e-commerce beyond the high tech sector and companies like Cisco Systems and into every corner of the economy, including small businesses. Back in the 1980's, we used to debate if it mattered if we made money selling ``potato chips or computer chips.'' But here is the real difference: consuming a lot of potato chips isn't good for you; consuming a lot of computer chips is. 
   I emphasize this because too often our discussions of government policy, technology, and economic growth dwell on the invention and sale of new technologies, but shortchange the all important topic of their use. Extension programs, like the electronic commerce extension program in my bill, are policy aimed at precisely spreading the use of more productive technology by small businesses. 
   With that in mind, the e-commerce revolution creates both opportunities and challenges for small businesses. On the one hand, it will open new markets to them. On the web, the garage shop can look as good as IBM. On the other hand, the high fixed costs, low marginal costs, and technical sophistication that can sometimes characterize e-commerce, when coupled with a good brand name, may allow larger, more established e-commerce firms to quickly move from market to market. Amazon.com has done such a wonderful job of making a huge variety of books widely available that it's been able to expand to CDs, to toys, to electronics, to auctions. Moreover, firms in more rural areas have suddenly found sophisticated, low cost, previously distant businesses entering their market, and competing with them. Thus, there is considerable risk that many small businesses will be left behind in the shift to e-commerce. That would not be good for them, nor for the rest of us, because we all benefit when everyone is more productive and everyone competes. 
   The root of this problem is the fact that many small firms have a hard time identifying and adopting new technology. They are hard working, but they just don't have the time, people, or money to understand all the different technologies they might use. And, they often don't even know where to turn to for help. Thus, while small firms are very flexible, they can be slow to adopt new technology, because they don't know which to use or what to do about it. That is why we have extension programs. Extension programs give small businesses low cost, impartial advice on what technologies are out there and how to use them. 
   What might an e-commerce extension program do? Imagine you're a small speciality foods retailer in rural New Mexico and you see e-commerce as a way to reach more customers. But your specialty is chiles, not computers; imagine all the questions you would have. How do I sell over the web? Can I buy supplies that way too? How do I 
   keep hackers out of my system? What privacy policies should I follow? How do I use encryption to collect credit card numbers and guarantee customers that I'm who I am? Can I electronically integrate my sales orders with instructions to shippers like Federal Express? Should I band together with other local producers to form a chile cybermall? What servers, software, and telecommunications will I need and how much will it cost? Your local e-commerce extension center would answer those questions for you. And, you could trust their advice, because you would know they were impartial and had no interest in selling you a particular product. 
   This bill will lead to the creation of a high quality, nationwide network of non-profit organizations providing that kind of advice, analogous to the Manufacturing Extension Program, or MEP, network NIST runs today, but with a focus on e-commerce and on firms beyond manufacturers. MEP demonstrates that NIST could do this new job well. 
   Similarly, this bill is modeled on the MEP authorization. It retains the key features of MEP: a network of centers run by non-profits; strict merit selection; cost sharing; and periodic independent review of each center. In addition, it emphasizes serving small businesses in rural or more isolated areas, so that those businesses can get a leg up on e-commerce too. In short, this legislation takes an approach that has already been proven to work. 
   Practically speaking, if this bill becomes law, I assume NIST would begin by leveraging their MEP management expertise to start a few e-commerce extension centers and then gradually build out a network separate from MEP. I also want to note that this is a new, separate authorization for an e-commerce extension program because it will have a different focus than MEP and because I do not want it to displace MEP in any way. 
   Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this important, timely, and practical piece of legislation. Just as a strong agricultural sector called for an agricultural extension service, and a strong industrial sector called for manufacturing extension, our shift to an information economy calls for electronic commerce extension.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for their fine work on this agricultural appropriations bill. I also want to take this opportunity to thank Senator LEAHY and his staff for their work on this amendment. It will mean a great deal to Tribes all over America. 
   Mr. President, I am sure all Senators recognize the important contributions that the Rural Utilities Service is making in every state. RUS has been especially effective in the rural portions of New Mexico. The RUS's grant and loan programs are making tremendous progress in improving the quality of life of our small towns and in Indian Country. The basic health of rural people in New Mexico, as well as their economic future, are being greatly improved by RUS's programs. 
   I'd like to take a few minutes to explain what our amendment does. Under current rules RUS can provide no more than 75 percent of the cost of a project in the form of a grant. The remaining 25 percent can be in the form of a loan or from some other local source of funds. This program works well throughout most of rural America. Communities generally have access to taxing or bonding authority or to state funds that they can use for the required matching funds or to guarantee a loan. 
   However, there are some cases where a community doesn't have the means to provide the required matching funds. Congress has recognized this problem and has created special rules to address these unique situations. One example are colonias, where Congress allows RUS to provide 100 percent of the cost of a project so that the local community isn't burdened by these immigrant settlements, and this bill provides up to $20 million for projects in  colonias. Mr. President, the funding authorization for colonias is a good program, and I thank the Chairman and ranking member for their continued support of it. 
   Very simply, our amendment would create a parallel program for Indian Country. Currently, RUS is already providing loans and grants to tribes using its standard funding rules. However, some tribes can't take advantage of RUS's programs simply because they don't qualify for the loans required to cover 25 percent of a project's cost. Tribes generally lack taxing or bonding authority to provide these required matching funds. 
   Mr. President, our amendment would allow RUS to provide 100 percent of the cost of a project for the most economically disadvantaged tribes that can't otherwise provide the required matching funds. The amendment allows up to $12 million for water and wastewater projects for this purpose. The funds come from within RUS's existing appropriation. Without our amendment, a few of our tribes will continue to suffer from a lack of basic water and sewer systems. 
   Mr. President, our amendment is not a substantial portion of RUS's total appropriation of $630 million, and the funds would not be used unless a tribe did not qualify for any of the RUS's other programs. I think this is an important program to help deal with the critical infrastructure needs of our tribes.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I'm very pleased to be joined by Senators ROCKEFELLER, SNOWE, and MIKULSKI in introducing the ``Electronic Commerce Extension Establishment Act of 1999.'' The purpose of this bill is  simple--to ensure that small businesses in every corner of our nation fully participate in the electronic commerce revolution unfolding around us by helping them find and adopt the right e-commerce technology and techniques. It does this by authorizing an ``electronic commerce extension'' program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology modeled on NIST's existing, highly successful Manufacturing Extension Program. 
   Everywhere you look today, e-commerce--the buying, selling, and even the delivery of goods and services via computer networks--is starting a revolution in American business. Being so new, precise e-commerce numbers are hard to come by, but by one estimate business to business and business to consumer e-commerce sales in 1998 were $100 billion. If you add in the hardware, software, and services making those sales possible, the number rises to $300 billion. That's comparable to adding another entire automobile industry to the economy in the last few years. Another estimate has business to business e-commerce growing to $1.3 trillion by 2003. Whatever the exact numbers, an amazing change in our economy has begun. 
   But the shift to e-commerce is about more than new ways to sell things; it's about new ways to do things. It promises to transform how we do business--how we design products, manage supply chains and inventories, advertise and distribute goods, et cetera--and thereby boost productivity, the root of long term improvements in our standard of living. A recent Washington Post piece on Cisco Systems, a major supplier of Internet hardware, notes that Cisco saved $500 million last year by selling its products and buying its supplies online. On sales of $8.5 billion, that helped make for some nice profits. Imagine the productivity and economic growth spurred when more firms get efficiencies like that. And that's the point of this bill, to make sure that small businesses get those benefits too. 
   Electronic commerce is a new use of information technology and the Internet. Many people, including Alan Greenspan, suspect information technology is the major driver behind the productivity and economic growth we've been enjoying. The crucial verb here is ``use.'' It is the widespread use of a more productive technology that sustains accelerated productivity growth. It was steam engine, not its sales, that powered the industrial revolution. In 1899, only about 5 percent of factory horsepower came from electric motors, even though the technologies had been around for two decades. But by 1920, when electric motors finally accounted for more than half of factory horsepower, they created a surge in industrial productivity as more efficient factory designs became common. 
   Closer to today, in 1987, Nobel Prize winning economist Robert Solow quipped, ``We see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.'' Well, it looks like the computer has started to show up because more people are using them in more ways, like e-commerce. Information technology producers, companies like Cisco Systems who are, notably, some of the most sophisticated users of IT, are 8 percent of our economy; from 1995 to 1998 they contributed 35 percent of our economic growth. There are also some indications that IT is now improving productivity among companies that only use IT, though economists continue to debate that. 
   But here's the real point. If we are going to sustain this productivity and economic growth, if this is to be more than a one time boost that dies out, we have to spread sophisticated uses of information technology like e-commerce beyond the high tech sector and companies like Cisco Systems and into every corner of the economy, including small businesses. Back in the 1980s we used to debate if it mattered if we made money selling ``potato chips or computer chips.'' But here's the real difference: consuming a lot of potato chips isn't good for you; consuming a lot of computer chips is. 
   I emphasize all this because too often our discussions of government policy, technology, and economic growth dwell on the invention and sale of new technologies, which are crucial, but shortchange the all important, but not terribly glamorous topic of their adoption and use. Extension programs, like the electronic commerce extension program in this bill, are policy aimed at precisely spreading 
   the adoption and use of more productive technology by small businesses. 
   Now, with that in mind, the e-commerce revolution creates both opportunities and challenges for small businesses. On the one hand, it will open new markets to them and help them be more efficient. Many of us have seen that cartoon with a dog in front of a computer saying, ``On the Internet no one knows you're a dog.'' Well, on the web, the garage shop can look as good as IBM or GM. On the other hand, the high fixed costs, low marginal costs, and technical sophistication that can sometimes characterize e-commerce, when coupled with a good brand name, may allow larger, more established e-commerce firms to quickly move from market to market. Amazon.com, perhaps the archetype e-commerce firm, has done such a wonderful job of making a huge variety of books widely available that it's been able to expand to CDs, to toys, to electronics, to auctions. Moreover, firms in more rural or isolated areas have suddenly found sophisticated, low cost, previously distant businesses entering their market, and competing with them. Thus, there is considerable risk that many small businesses be left behind in the shift to e-commerce. That would not be good for them, nor for the rest of us, because we all benefit when everyone is more productive and everyone competes. 
   The root of this problem is the fact that many small firms have a hard time identifying and adopting new technology. They're hard pressed and hard working, but they just don't have the time, people, or money to understand all the different technologies they might use. And, they often don't even know where to turn for help. Thus, while small firms are very flexible, they can be slow to adopt new technology, because they don't know which to use or what to do about it. That's why we have extension programs. Extension programs give small businesses low cost, impartial advice on what technologies are out there and how to use them. 
   Extension programs have a long, solid pedigree. They started in 1914, with the Department of Agriculture's Cooperative Extension Service to ``extend'' the benefits of agricultural research to the farmer. That extension service has played no small part in making the American farmer the most productive in the world. More recently, the competitiveness crisis of the 1980's prompted the creation of the Manufacturing Extension Program, or MEP, at NIST to help small manufacturers find and use the technology they need. NIST has done a good job building and managing MEP's network of more than 70 non-profit centers, in all 50 states, with 2000 experts on call, that has helped over 60,000 manufacturers. 
   Today, the United States is the international leader in e-commerce, but other nations are working to catch up, just like they did in manufacturing. Thus, the time is ripe to solidify our lead in e-commerce and extend it to every part of our economy in every corner of the nation. An electronic commerce extension program will help us do that. 
   So, what might such a program do? Imagine you're a small specialty foods retailer in rural New Mexico and you see e-commerce as a way to reach more customers. But your specialty is chiles, not computers; imagine all the questions you'd have. How do I sell over the web? Can I buy supplies that way too? How do I keep hackers out of my system? What privacy policies should I follow? How do I use encryption to collect credit card numbers and guarantee customers that I'm who I say I am? Can I electronically integrate my sales orders with instructions to shippers like Federal Express? How might I handle orders from Japan or Holland? Should I band together with other local producers to form a chile cybermall? What servers, software, and telecommunications will I need and how much will it cost? Can I do this via satellite links? Your local e-commerce extension center would answer those questions for you. And, you could trust their advice, because you'd know they were impartial and had no interest in selling you a particular product. 
   This bill will lead to the creation of a high quality, nationwide network of non-profit organizations providing that kind of expert advice, analogous to the MEP network NIST runs today, but  with a focus on e-commerce and on firms beyond manufacturers. NIST, as part of the Department of Commerce, is a logical choice to run an e-commerce extension program because it's about promoting commerce via technology and standards; recall that the Internet is based on standards for how computers can talk to each other. But the best reason for NIST to do this is that MEP shows they can do it well; that expertise will prove invaluable in getting this new network up and running. 
   Similarly, this bill is directly modeled on the MEP authorization. It retains the key features of MEP: a network of centers run by non-profits; strict merit selection; cost sharing where the federal government's share decreases from one half to one third over time; and periodic independent review of each center. In addition, it emphasizes serving small businesses in rural or more isolated areas, so that those businesses can get a leg up on e-commerce too. In short, this legislation takes an approach that has already been proven to work. 
   Practically speaking, if this bill becomes law, I assume NIST, together with its headquarters organization, the Technology Administration, would begin by leveraging their MEP management expertise to start a few e-commerce extension centers and then gradually build out a network separate from MEP. They could also use the study of e-commerce extension resulting from my amendment to the Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations bill the other week. I also want to note that this is a new, separate authorization for an e-commerce extension program because it will have a different focus than MEP and because I do not want it to displace MEP in any way. MEP is a great program. Let's keep it going strong while we build this new e-commerce extension system. 
   Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this important, timely, and practical piece of legislation. Just as a strong agricultural sector called for an agricultural extension service, and a strong industrial sector called for manufacturing extension, our shift to an information economy calls for electronic commerce extension.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the amendment I presented yesterday and that we are going to vote on first this morning is a simple statement that we should reduce the size of the tax cut that is proposed by $132 billion so that we will have funds available to maintain the current level of effort in support of education. It, I grant you, is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It does not ensure that the money is spent there, but to my mind it at least reserves those funds so we can maintain the current level of effort in support of education. In other words, I believe we should be on record for funding education at least at current levels before we settle on the size of the tax cut that we can afford. 
   Some might ask why am I singling out education. Well, S. 1429 is more  than just a tax bill; it is a reconciliation bill, which means, at least in rough form, it purports to set national priorities for the next 10 years. I believe that a very top priority should be providing quality education to the young people of this Nation. Our future depends more on that investment than it does on virtually any other investment we might make. 
   So if education is a priority, what is the relationship of this tax cut bill to education? Now, as I understand the estimates for the next 10 years, the tax cut bill is so large that it will require us to make significant cuts in discretionary spending, including education, in this coming decade, and that is the concern I have and that is what has prompted this amendment. 
   Yesterday, as I was describing the amendment, I was informed that my concern is unfounded; that in fact even after the tax cut--and I know people do not like to have it referred to as a massive tax cut; I notice that is what the Wall Street Journal called it this morning in their headline--there will be plenty of discretionary funds for education. That was the information I was given. 
   So let me look at the figures I have and see where I am confused on this and where I have misunderstood the situation. 
   First of all, we all expect a surplus, and that is why we are having this debate and talking about cutting taxes in the first place. So we all agree to that. We also all agree that the portion of that surplus attributable to Social Security should be left for Social Security. And that is about $1.9 trillion. There is no dispute about that that I am aware of, at least in this debate. 
   So after we take that out, what is left? At the beginning of the debate, the Congressional Budget Office came out with the figure in the range of $1 trillion, the non-Social Security-related surplus. So that is represented here. This chart shows CBO, Congressional Budget Office. This column represents the non-Social Security surplus as it was understood by me when we started the debate. 
   Now I am informed that we have a new estimate and that the surplus is not going to be $2.8 trillion over the next 10 years; instead, it is going to be over $3.3 trillion. So there is going to be substantially more money. The question is, Where did we find this additional $400 to $500 billion? 
   Mr. President, let me yield myself 1 more minute.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. It was arrived at by assuming that less money is going to be spent on discretionary spending during the 10 years. The Congressional Budget Office assumed that $595 billion would be cut in discretionary spending. The new claim is that there is going to be $1 trillion cut, and that by cutting discretionary spending by $1 trillion instead of by $595 billion, we are going to have extra money that we can turn around and spend on discretionary accounts. 
   Mr. President, that doesn't add up in my mind. I believe discretionary accounts are important. I believe education has to be at the top of that list. I do not see where we can expect to find the money to maintain current levels of effort on education if we vote for this very large tax cut. That is why the size of the tax cut should be reduced so that education programs will not have to be cut. 
   How much time remains?

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we have a historic opportunity before us. For the first time in my nearly two decades in the Senate, we are presented with predictions of a growing surplus. We made the tough choices in 1993 and again in 1997 to bring spending under control, to reduce the deficit, and to restore the federal budget to balance. 
   We are at a crossroads now and must decide how to respond to this opportunity. Will we invest it wisely and prudently, or will it be squandered? Will we return to the disastrous policies of the 1980's, or can we stay on the path of fiscal discipline? The American public is deeply cynical about government. Now is our chance to prove we can come together in our national interest. 
   I am deeply concerned about the Republican plan for using this surplus. In my opinion, they are squandering an opportunity we won't have again to extend the solvency of Medicare and Social Security, to invest in key priorities like education, the environment and medical research, and to pay down our national debt. We shouldn't go off on a spending or tax-cutting spree when we have this huge debt to repay. 
   Unfortunately, the Republicans have chosen to focus single-mindedly on cutting taxes. I believe we should have a tax cut--I would favor tax relief for working families, such as easing the marriage penalty and increasing the per-child credit--but this bill goes much too far. Instead, we need to balance the money among several key priorities. 
   There is almost no single policy that is more important to the long-term health of our budget, to the sustainability of the surplus, and to our overall economy, than paying off some of our three-and-half trillion dollar national debt. We cannot leave this burden to our grandchildren. 
   With a single voice, economists have told us of the benefits of and importance of paying down that debt. It will lead to lower interest rates. It will produce higher surpluses, because we will be paying less interest. And it will be of tremendous benefit to the economy, because it will free up private capital for productive investment that makes our economy grown, and raise the standard of living for us all. 
   Alan Greenspan himself has said repeatedly that the most important thing to do with the surplus is to pay down the debt. He has said it over and over and over again. And he's been saying it for quite some time now. Some of my Republican colleagues have seized on another statement he made--saying that if paying down the debt is not politically feasible, then he prefers tax cuts to spending. 
   My colleagues, there is no one here but us. We are in charge. We are free to vote for what's right, and to define what's possible or what's not. We can vote to reduce the debt, or to irresponsibly spend this one-in-a-lifetime surplus on an excessively large tax cut that would damage our economy and endanger Medicare and Social Security, education, law enforcement, defense--just about any important national program. 
   Paying off the debt today will also leave us in a much stronger position to afford the cost of the baby boom's retirement. As other speakers have pointed out, the cost of the Republican tax cuts begin to rise dramatically just at the same time the pressures on the budget begin to grow as the baby boomers start to retire. 
   But Republicans have rejected our attempts to pay down the debt. They claim they are doing plenty to pay down the debt--and that this is enough. 
   They may even talk about a Congressional Budget Office report that purports to show how their plan reduces the debt. But that analysis is based on a fiction; the fiction that Republicans will be able to cut spending dramatically--by nearly one-fourth. And if defense is funded at the level the Administration has requested, other important domestic programs would face cuts of nearly 40 percent. This means less medical research, dramatic cuts in the number of children participating in Head Start, substantial reductions in the number of law enforcement personnel, no new environmental cleanups, closures at national parks. The list goes on. 
   However, as we all know, Democrats and Republicans both, there is really no support for cuts of that magnitude, either in Congress or among the public. A story on the front page of the Washington Post on July 27, 1999 puts the lie to Republican assertions that they will be able to cut spending. They can't even pass this year's appropriations bills without resorting to smoke-and-mirrors gimmickry to hid the cost of their bills. 
   Without those cuts, they need to raid the Social Security trust fund to pay for their tax cut. And they will increase, rather than reduce, our national debt. 
   The truth is, they want their excessive, risky tax cut so badly that they are willing to put the health of our economy at risk, to endanger the security of retirees, and to short-change important national priorities like investments in education, medical research, the environment and even national defense. 
   Republicans want to spend 97 percent of the available non-Social Security surplus on tax cuts--tax cuts whose cost explodes in the future, overheat our economy, and disproportionately favor the rich and special interests. 
   Democrats have offered reasonable alternatives that balance tax cuts with Medicare solvency, debt reduction and investments in key domestic priorities. But these have all been rejected. 
   So I am making this last, very modest attempt to avoid wasting surplus--asking that $100 billion of this excessive tax cut be used instead for paying off more of our national debt. This would leave about 86 percent of the surplus for tax cuts--this is less than 97 percent they want to spend, but is still a substantial amount. We could do more to reduce the debt. I would like to do more. But this is a starting point. 
   My motion would instruct the Finance Committee to report the bill back in 3 days, with an amendment to reduce the tax cut by $100 billion, and use the savings to pay down more of our national debt. It also instructs the Committee to find the savings by reducing narrowly-targeted special interest tax breaks in the bill, and tax relief that disportionately benefits the wealthy. 
   Last week, just days after Republicans passed their tax bill out of committee, the Washington Post ran a  story detailing the special-interest giveaways in the Republican tax bills. These include special breaks for seaplane owners in Alaska, barge lines in Mississippi, and foreign residents who use frequent-flyer miles to purchase airline tickets. Since then, we have also learned just how skewed the bill is toward families with the very highest incomes. The top 1 percent of all taxpayers would receive a whopping 30 percent of the tax cuts. Overall, the top one-fifth of taxpayers would receive 75 percent of the tax relief. It seems to me there is plenty of room in this bill to reduce the tax cut by $100 billion for the sake of reducing our national debt. 
   The Republicans have rejected our balanced alternative to a huge, imprudent tax cut, and they have rejected our lockbox that would set aside money for Social Security and Medicare--but can't they even reduce their enormous, risky tax cut by $100 billion in order to further reduce our nation's indebtedness? That's only about 10 percent of the available surplus. Only 10 percent for prudence and responsibility, the rest to fulfill their agenda.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment has a very simple purpose. The purpose is to protect the current investment that we are making in education. 
   The amendment seeks to decrease the tax breaks that disproportionately benefit upper-income taxpayers in order to sustain the current level of funding for education with an increase, a small increase for inflation. If the Republican tax bill we are considering is accepted as written, Congress must cut discretionary spending by more than $775 billion over the next 10 years. When we say discretionary spending, of course, we are talking about domestic discretionary spending, which includes education, but we are also talking about national defense, what we spend on our military. 
   If we say the portion of discretionary spending that is spent on our military is likely to be funded at the level requested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which is very likely--in fact, we usually do better than the Joint Chiefs' request--then domestic programs have to be cut 38 percent. By those ``domestic programs,'' in this amendment I am talking about education. If these cuts are spread across the board, it would result in very substantial reductions in current educational programs. 
   Let me show to my colleagues a chart that tries to make the point. I think it makes it pretty well. 
   It shows with this red line, starting in the year 2000 and going to the year 2009, we are spending nearly $34 billion on education in the Federal budget. That includes what we spend on education through the Education Department but also Head Start. We have included Head Start because we consider that a program that assists greatly in preparing students for school. So we are spending a little below $34 billion this year. 
   If you take the Republican plan, as I understand it, and take the logical assumption that we are going to have the kind of cut in domestic programs we have to have in order to get enough room for this size tax cut, then you see that go from $34 billion down to a little over $19 billion by the year 2009. 
   An education freeze, of course, would keep it right at 34 billion, but that would not make any provision for inflation. What we are doing in this amendment is saying that the Senate should go on record as requesting that the tax cut be reduced by $132 billion so that we have room not only to maintain Federal funding for education where it is today but also to allow it to increase as inflation increases. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts made a very good point a few minutes ago: The cost of buying services, of paying utility bills, of doing everything goes up for the government as it does for everyone else. It certainly goes up for the schools. 
   Now, we have not built into this amendment, I should point out, any provision for the fact that we are going to have tens and hundreds of thousands of new children coming into our school system in the next 10 years, and we are not proposing increases in education funding to account for that. We should be, quite frankly, but we are not. We are also not proposing increases for any new education programs. I have been hearing Mr. Greenspan's testimony, as I am sure all of my colleagues have, and he says: Start no new spending and cut no taxes. That is his basic position, to let the surpluses run and let's get our fiscal house in order. 
   I don't agree with that position. I believe there are some areas in our Federal budget where we should increase spending. Education is the first priority, as I see it. But if we were to take the Republican plan as it is proposed, it would mean that 430,000 of the 835,000 children who would otherwise be served by the Head Start program would lose services by the time we get to the year 2009. It would mean that more than 5.9 million of the 14.6 million children who live in high-poverty communities would lose essential education services under title I. The title I program is the largest education program we fund here in Washington. It would mean that 480,000 of the 1 million students who currently are served by the Reading Excellence Program would lose the opportunity to learn and to have that additional help by the time they complete the third grade. It also means that the chance of increasing the Federal share of the cost of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, IDEA--the line item that we try to fund each year--the stated goal of many in this body has been that we should at least go to 40 percent of what it costs to implement IDEA. But that would be clearly impossible under what I understand the Republican tax bill is to provide. Instead, we would be forced to cut special education by $3.4 billion by the time we get to the 10th year of the Tax Code. 
   Pell grants, which currently benefit nearly 4 million students--if we assume we are going to continue to provide a grant to 4 million students, then you have to slash that from $3,850 per year, which is today's level, down to $2,175 by the year 2009. Nearly 500,000 disadvantaged students who need extra guidance and support through the TRIO Program and the GEAR UP Program would also lose that extra help. 
   In my home State, these statistics could be brought down to a very concrete level. One example would be Head Start. We have about 8,000 young people in our Head Start Program in my State today, which is about half of what we should have; that is, half of those who are eligible. We would have about 3,000 fewer if this tax bill were agreed to. 
   I hope very much that we can get a strong vote of support. I believe the American people do not want to see a tax cut adopted at the expense of continued support for education as we go into this new century. Everyone realizes that our future depends upon how well we can prepare young people for the opportunities they will have in their lives. It is not responsible for us to be proposing tax cuts that are going to prevent us from at least maintaining the level of effort we have today in education. That is the difference. That is what we are trying to fix in this amendment. I hope very much that we will have a strong vote in favor of it. 
   Before I yield the floor to my colleagues to speak in favor, I hope, of  this amendment, let me also say a couple of 
   words about another motion I am going to propose and which will be voted on when we get into the long list of motions. It is a motion to do something which is very modest, as this amendment is very modest. This only involves $132 billion. We have been talking about trillions for the last 2 days. This other motion would be to have the bill go back to the Finance Committee with instructions to report back with an amendment providing that an additional $100 billion be applied to debt reduction. That is a small thing to ask. I think of it more as a tithe than anything else. 
   If we are talking about nearly $800 billion in tax reduction over the 10 years, we ought to say let's go back and at least take $100 billion of that, which is surplus that we can anticipate, and commit that to debt reduction. That will be another item that I believe is very meritorious. I think all Senators should support it. I think it is the responsible thing to do. I do it because, in my State, whereas there is disagreement about new spending programs and whether we should fund those, and where there is disagreement about a lot of other items we are debating, there is a strong consensus that we need to make a downpayment on debt reduction as part of this reconciliation bill. This reconciliation bill is a blueprint for where we intend to go in the next 10 years. 
   I hope the blueprint we finally adopt shows that we intend to maintain funding for education, at least at current levels. I will be arguing each year I serve in the Senate that we should be increasing funding for education, not cutting. We should at least maintain the current level. I also hope we will adopt a roadmap for the next 10 years that contemplates substantial debt reduction. And I will propose this other motion, which we will vote on later in the debate, on that subject. 
   I see I have some colleagues who wish to speak. I know the Senator from Maryland does. Let me yield her 10 minutes to speak on this, or the bill, whichever she prefers.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes off of the amendment.  
   I want to respond to my colleague from New Mexico and indicate I do not in any way question his motives, and I certainly do not question his understanding of the budget. He is an expert in that. He has demonstrated that repeatedly since I have been in the Senate. 
   I do think there is a genuine misunderstanding or disagreement about what we are talking about in the size of this surplus. I hear my colleague say we have, over the next 10 years, $33.371 billion in surplus that we have to spend or we have to use for tax reductions. That is substantially more than the CBO indicated we had. They said we had $2.896 billion. There is a substantial difference there. Taking the figure I was given, $2.896 billion, I understand we are using by far the largest part of that for this proposed tax cut. 
   My colleague says that is not the case, that there is still $505 billion remaining for Medicare and discretionary programs. I am just not clear in my mind where that money comes from. The figures I have for the total of the surplus do not allow for that money to be available for discretionary programs and Medicare. The figures I have received lead me to conclude that there will be major cuts in discretionary programs if we are going to adopt a tax cut of this size. If there are cuts in discretionary programs, some of those, of course, will be defense. 
   I believe, based on the time I have spent in the Senate, we will not cut defense. I do not support the cuts in defense, and I do not believe my colleagues do either. I think we will fund defense and we will fund increases in defense in the next 10 years in many respects. That means the discretionary domestic spending such as education has to be cut even more. That is the concern that caused me to bring this amendment to the floor. 
   The point was made that I have just put together a sense of the Senate which is a wish list. That is in many ways true. I have said the Senate should go on record as not wanting to cut the current level of funding for education in this bill, and to the extent we need to reduce the tax cut in order to ensure we do not cut current levels of funding for education, then reduce the tax cut to that extent. 
   As I understand the figures, that means a $132 billion reduction in the tax cut. That is what I have urged Senators to support.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I'm not going to take a lot of the Senate's time, but I want to speak briefly about an amendment I have filed to this tax bill. My amendment, number 1391, promotes the use of small, efficient distributed electronic power generation  systems in residential, industrial and commercial applications. 
   I believe distruted generating technologies are the future of our electric power industry. Already, the first microturbines and fuel cells are being installed in homes and businesses. Renewable technologies, like wind and solar, are bringing power to isolated areas that are not connected to the electrical power grid. These remote applications are very common in my state of New Mexico. 
   Mr. President, my amendment has two parts. The first part provides a much needed tax clarification concerning small, distributed electric power technologies, such as high-efficiency microturbines and fuel cells. The current tax law discourages the use of these technologies in commerical buildings by requiring a straight-lined depreciation over a 39-year lifetime. However, the same technology, if used in different application, has a shorter depreciation schedule. My amendment would make clear that these advanced electric power systems would have a 15-year depreciation schedule when used for power generation. 
   The second part of my amendment provides an 8-percent investment tax credit for systems that produce both heat energy and electrical power. The tax credit would apply only to systems that meet a strict 60-percent overall energy efficient requirement. This provision will help increase the Nation's energy efficiency by encouraging investment in these highly efficient systems. 
   Last month the Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a hearing on distributed power generation. The hearing made clear that technologies such as microturbines, fuel cells, and the various renewable resources can provide many practical benefits, including reduced dependence on high-tension power transmission lines, higher energy efficiency, lower costs, increased reliability, and reduced emissions. Moreover, by combining the production of heat and electric power in one package, overall efficiencies of up to 90 percent can be achieved. 
   Though I believe my amendment is important and would provide significant economic, reliability, and environmental benefits, I am not going to call it up for one very simple reason: This tax bill isn't going anywhere. The Senate will soon pass this bill, but the President is not going to sign it. In a few weeks, when the Senate comes back with a more sensible package of tax legislation, I hope my amendment will be incorporated in a bill that we can pass and send to the President for his signature. 
   The incentives for distributed generating technologies in my amendment will go a long way to realizing the best future for electric power generation and efficient use of energy. I hope we can pass them in the next tax bill.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today as a cosponsor of the Manufactured Housing Improvement Act. This Act has come about as a result of much negotiation between buyers of manufactured housing, the Housing and Urban Development Agency and manufacturers and dealers of manufactured housing. I commend the industry for coming to Congress with its plan to modify the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974. Over twenty years has elapsed since we comprehensively addressed the topic of safety and manufactured housing. Manufactured housing has changed significantly in the past twenty years. With the rise in the number of buyers of manufactured housing, it is time we ensure that safety standards are up-to-date and adequate to address consumers' concerns. 
   The Senate bill has eleven sections that cover everything from the establishment of a Consensus Committee to a section encouraging secondary market securitization programs for FHA manufactured home loans and other loan programs. The new Consensus Committee will consist of 25 voting members and one non-voting member representing the Secretary of HUD. The Committee will represent a wide spectrum of interested parties, including but not limited to, home producers, retailers, lenders, insurers, consumers, consumer organizations, local public officials, and fire marshals. The Committee will be responsible for recommending amendments to the current safety standards and enforcement regulations to HUD. 
   Most notably, there is no funding being authorized in this bill. The Secretary of HUD is authorized to use the industry label fees to carry out the responsibilities under the Act and to administer the Consensus Committee. 
   Not only does manufactured housing provide an affordable housing option for New Mexicans, the overall economic impact of the manufactured housing industry on New Mexico is significant. In 1998, the total economic impact on the state was over $264 million. Although most New Mexicans are familiar with the 157 retailers in the state, many are not aware that we also have two manufacturers located in the state. Last year, these manufacturers produced over 1,000 homes and the entire industry was responsible for employing more than 2,000 people. Anyone driving the highways of New Mexico is familiar with the site of a manufactured home moving across Interstate 40 or Interstate 25. However, many New Mexicans may not know that almost 7,000 homes were shipped into the state in 1998 alone. 
   Manufactured housing serves an important role in New Mexico. With the rising cost of homes in the metropolitan areas, and even in the smaller northern communities, manufactured housing that have an average cost of only $42,900 enable many more individuals and families to become homeowners. Currently, 41.8% of the housing in New Mexico is manufactured housing. 
   I think this bill is important not only to New Mexico but to all owners of manufactured housing. With a focus on construction safety standards, consumers will be safer and more secure in their new homes. Both the manufactured Housing Industry and the Congress need to take the concerns raised in the survey conducted by the American Association of Retired Persons seriously. The Consensus Committee created by this bill will play an important role in raising the standards for construction and safety. I hope the Committee thoroughly evaluates the construction concerns and safety issues raised by those responding to AARP's survey. It is critical to the success of this program that the owners, the builders and the regulators work together to achieve a higher level of safety and consumer satisfaction. 
   I thank Senator SHELBY for introducing this bill and I encourage the Senate to take up this bill and pass this worthwhile legislation.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak about what I see as a funding shortfall for the 2000 census. 
   First, I compliment Chairman GREGG and Senator HOLLINGS for their work on this bill. I fully appreciate the very tight budget constraints under which they have been working. However, I want to make sure all Senators also know that, even though we will soon pass this appropriations bill, our work is not yet finished. 
   Census day, which is April 1 of the year 2000, is less than 9 months away. Still today, at this late date, this bill lacks sufficient funding to adequately conduct the 2000 census. 
   The Founding Fathers recognized the importance of a fair and accurate count of the population. Article I, section 2 of 
   the Constitution provides that Congress is to conduct a decennial census ``in such Manner as they shall by Law direct.'' In fact, the census is one of the few actions that is mandated by the Constitution. 
   Let me take a few minutes to discuss the importance of a full and accurate census for all Americans. 
   Data from the 2000 census will be used to apportion House seats among the States for the 108th through the 112th Congresses. The States also use census data to draw legislative districts for congressional seats as well as for State and local representatives. In addition, Federal, State, and local governments use census information to guide annual distribution of the $180 billion of Federal funds for critical services such as child care, Social Security, Medicare, education, and job training. 
   By now, we have all heard details of the serious shortcomings of the 1990 census. In fact, at the time of the 1990 census, many of us spent many days and hours trying to ensure that a fair census was taken. Mr. President, 8.4 million people were missed in that census, and 4.4 million were counted twice. 
   In my State of New Mexico, we suffered the highest undercount of any single State. There were nearly 50,000 New Mexicans left out of the census in 1990 and 20,000 of them were children. The worst undercounts were among our Native American and Hispanic communities. A recent General Accounting Office estimate found that the 1990 census shortchanged my State of New Mexico at least $86 million in much-needed Federal grants. 
   The Census Bureau has made substantial efforts to avoid a repetition of the undercounts that have hurt my State in the past decade. I applaud the Bureau's efforts to reach out to every resident in New Mexico, particularly the extra efforts they have made to count everyone in the Hispanic and the Native American communities. In Spanish, the motto is: ``Hagarse Contar!''--``make yourself count.'' For Native American communities, I cannot give you the Navajo or Taos version of that, but clearly the slogan is ``generations are counting on this; don't leave it blank.'' 
   So I think everyone agrees that a full and fair census must be our goal. Congress must appropriate all of the funds necessary to produce that full and fair census. The census is not a place where we should be cutting corners. It is time to put partisan politics aside to give the professionals in the Census Bureau the resources they need to get the job done. 
   Indeed, the appropriations bill on the floor today does provide nearly $2.8 billion for the 2000 census. This is the full amount in the President's original budget. I thank the chairman for providing the Census Bureau's full initial request. 
   However, as all Senators know, the Supreme Court ruled that under current statutes only a traditional head count may be used for apportionment of House seats among the States. In response to the ruling, the Census Bureau requested an additional $1.7 billion to provide the best census possible using only the traditional method. 
   The additional funds were requested to cover the Bureau's additional workload, advertising, staffing, and data processing required to perform this actual head count which the Supreme Court has interpreted the Constitution to require. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a detailed list of the additional costs for a head count be printed in the 
   RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, at this point this appropriations bill does not provide any of the additional funding that the Census Bureau has requested in response to the Supreme Court's January ruling. In fairness to the chairman and the ranking member, and the members of the committee, the Census Bureau's revised request did not arrive until very late in the process. Consequently, the subcommittee may  not have had sufficient time to review the supplemental request and conduct the normal oversight hearings. I understand the subcommittee intends to consider the Census Bureau's supplemental funding request in the near future. I thank the chairman for moving forward promptly and for working on this issue in a spirit of bipartisanship. 
   What worries me is that even with the additional funds required for a head count, in all likelihood we will still fall well short of counting everyone and, as in the 1990 census, the undercount will hurt certain population groups the most. However, I have not come to the floor today to debate which enumeration method the Census Bureau should use. Except for apportionment, the Bureau will alleviate the undercount problem by using modern scientific methods. This is the only way to assure that States such as New Mexico will not be shortchanged again. 
   The Supreme Court ruled the 2000 census must include a full head count. I believe Congress has an obligation to provide all the funds required. 
   I appreciate the very tight budget situation in which we find ourselves. Time is getting short. Again, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their continued bipartisan work on this appropriations bill, and I hope that they can move quickly to provide the supplemental funds required for the 2000 census.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the life of a legendary figure in New Mexico sports history. 
   Ralph Tasker, the dean of New Mexico high school boys basketball, died earlier this week at the age of 80. 
   In New Mexico, you didn't have to refer to Ralph Tasker by name; you only had to say ``Coach'' and everyone knew who that was. 
   He coached in Hobbs for decades, and was known throughout our state as a superb teacher of the game of Basketball. 
   Ralph Tasker leaves behind an enduring legacy forged with the Hobbs Eagles, coaching 52 seasons in Lea County. 
   During that time, he amassed 1,122 wins with only 291 losses. That's almost an 80% winning record; a record difficult to achieve in any sport, at any level. 
   His teams won 12 state championships. 
   He was also recognized as the National Coach of the year. 
   He retired in 1998 as the third winningest head coach in the history of boys high school basketball in the United States and was elected to the National High School Coach Association Hall of Fame. 
   With all those accolades, if you asked Ralph Tasker what he was most proud of, he would tell you he was most proud of the hard work, dedication, and educational achievements of the young men on his teams. 
   When opposing teams prepared to play a Ralph Tasker-coached team, they knew they would face a disciplined and well-motivated team. 
   Coach Tasker knew the value of team work and inspired young men to respect one another as they worked together toward a common goal. 
   Coach Tasker coached and stood for the kind of ideals that we as state and country aspire as we work to motivate and teach young people. 
   I extend my condolences to his three children, Nancy, Diane, and Tim and to his four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. 
   New Mexicans appreciate Coach Tasker's life, and we will always remember his great achievements on and off the court.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself and my cosponsors, Senator DOMENICI and Senator REID. 
   The amendment does two things. The first sentence of the amendment says:  
   Such supervision and direction of any Director or contract employee of a national security laboratory or of a nuclear weapons production facility shall not interfere with communication to the Department, the President, or Congress, of technical findings or technical assessments derived from, and in accord with, duly authorized activities.   
   That sentence makes clear that communication which presently occurs is intended to continue. The clarification is necessary because in the underlying amendment officers and employees of contractors, including the Directors and employees of the three National Laboratories, are referred to as ``personnel of the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship'' and all personnel of the Agency are subject to the supervision and direction of the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship. 
   We want to be sure if they have information of a technical nature or based on their technical assessment that they believe should be directly communicated, that communication occur. 
   The Directors of the three nuclear weapons laboratories are responsible for certifying the adequacy of the nuclear weapons stockpile. Their independence and the integrity of their judgments are critical to the national security of the Nation. It is important that the legislation recognize and protect that independence and integrity by ensuring that these lab Directors and employees can communicate these technical findings and assessments to the Department, the President, and the Congress. 
   The second sentence of the amendment simply provides that the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship may use field offices for the programs and activities of the Agency. This is a departure from one of the recommendations of the Rudman report. The Rudman report proposed streamlining the reporting chain for the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship by cutting the ties between the weapons labs and the Department of Energy field offices. 
   We had a hearing in the Energy Committee last week, and I asked Dr. Vic Reis, who is the Assistant Secretary of Energy for Defense Programs, whether he agreed with that Rudman report recommendation. He said he did not. He said we certainly need weapons ties in the field office because ``we cannot run the operation entirely from Washington.'' 
   All we are saying is the Secretary has authority to use the field offices in an appropriate fashion--we are not dictating how but in an appropriate fashion to carry out the policies of the Department. 
   As I understand what Dr. Reis was saying, the important point is to clarify the lines of authority between the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship and the labs. The underlying amendment does that. But he said the new Under Secretary will still need field offices to help them oversee and run the complex of weapons laboratories and production facilities, and this gives the Under Secretary that option. 
   I believe this amendment is straightforward. My colleague on the Republican side, Senator DOMENICI, is the prime cosponsor of this amendment. I hope it is acceptable. I believe it is acceptable to all Senators, and I hope the Senate will adopt it.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that we could get agreement to offer this amendment. It is a joint amendment that Senator DOMENICI, Senator REID, and I have participated in drafting. It tries to ensure that our national laboratories, particularly those that are focused on defense-related activities and our nuclear weapons capability, are open to do other work, work for other parts of the Department of Energy, work for other agencies of the Government, and work with industry, where appropriate. 
   We provide what the Secretary needs to ensure that this is the case, and that the Under Secretary, working under the direction of the Secretary, shall make the capabilities of the national laboratories available to these other entities that want to perform work there, and that these entities shall be able to do so in a manner that continues to provide them with direct programmatic control of the activities they are sponsoring at the laboratories. 
   Mr. President, this concern has been for the future of civilian research and development at the DOE laboratories that carry out defense-related research. I was concerned that the Kyl amendment was setting up an architecture for these laboratories that well may make it more difficult to carry out civilian-related research. We don't want to wake up, 5 years from now, and discover that this architecture dictated the destiny of those laboratories in unfortunate ways.  
   I don't quarrel with the notion that these labs have, and should continue to have, nuclear weapons as a core mission. But it seems to me that the task of science-based stockpile stewardship cannot succeed unless these labs are fully integrated into the larger world of science and technology. 
   I believe that the civilian R&D programs at Sandia, Los Alamos, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories play a critical role in attracting and keeping the best people in those laboratories. By civilian R&D, I am talking about the work funded at the laboratories by DOE programs other than the defense programs, programs funded by other civilian agencies of the government, and technology partnerships with industry. 
   There have been numerous cases where this civilian R&D has provided new ideas for defense-related technical activities. In other cases, this civilian R&D has helped maintain core competencies at the labs needed for their defense missions. Our national security, in my view, would be damaged in the long run if these institutions stopped being national laboratories and just had a weapon focus. 
   My colleagues and co-sponsors agree with this assessment. It is basic to a number of provisions of law that we have enacted in past Congresses, particularly the National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989, which I sponsored with Senator DOMENICI. The findings of that bill are as relevant today, 10 years later, as they were when we passed that bill as part of the Defense Act that year. 
   Last week, before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, we heard testimony from one of DOE's most distinguished laboratory directors, Dr. Burt Richter. He's the head of a civilian DOE laboratory, but has a long acquaintance with the defense side of DOE. He stated, ``one has to face the fact that maintaining the credibility of a nuclear deterrent is not the most exciting job in science these days'', underlining the issues of attracting and retaining personnel. But he says, ``it needs some of the best people to do it''. 
   He then went on to say, ``The scientists at the weapons labs have to be able to interact with the rest of the scientific community, because all of the science needed for stockpile stewardship is not in the weapons labs, and the best people will not go into isolation behind a fence in today's world.'' He concluded by reminding us, ``This is not World War II.'' 
   I think that he's right. In creating this new Agency, we need 
   to make sure that we are not damaging one of the most precious assets for which the Department of Energy is the custodian. 
   I think this is an important clarification, an important provision to add to the bill. I appreciate the cooperation of my colleague in getting agreement on the amendment. I hope the Senate will adopt it. 
   Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank my colleague, Senator DOMENICI, for yielding. I thank him for his willingness to accommodate despite the concerns he just described. 
   Of course, all of us have intended from the very beginning that all environmental laws be complied with. My concern has been that the Secretary, who is ultimately responsible for the entire Department and for the conduct of the entire Department, Secretary have the wherewithal and the legal authority to be sure that all of these environmental, safety, and health requirements be met. 
   I believe this amendment adequately meets that concern. I think it is a compromise between a provision I earlier drafted and one that Senator DOMENICI drafted. I think it is a good resolution of this issue. I think it does clarify for all Senators what we intend in this regard. 
   I am very pleased to cosponsor it. I urge all my colleagues to vote for it.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the legislation being introduced today. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of the Specialty Crop Insurance Act of 1999 with my colleagues, Senators GRAHAM, MACK, BOXER and FEINSTEIN. The outcome of this legislative effort will have a profound effect on the economic health and well-being of specialty crop producers in my state of New Mexico, as well as for farmers across the country. 
   Today's crop insurance program does not provide sufficient risk management protection to many specialty crop producers, leaving the growers vulnerable to risk. Specialty crops in New Mexico include chiles, pecans, lettuce, and pistachios. In fact, Dona Ana County ranks as the number one pecan-producing county in the nation according to a recent USDA census. And we produce 50% of the chiles used in the United States. However, at present, viable crop insurance policies which offer valid risk management protection are available for only a limited number of specialty crops. Many policies which are available fall short of reflecting the needs of producers. This means that the great majority of specialty crops farmers in this nation are without appropriate, adequate and affordable risk management protection. This legislation addresses the needs of those farmers who produce our fruits and vegetables, nuts, and greenhouse and nursery plants for affordable crop insurance policies.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act, a bill that has been reported from the Finance Committee and was filed on July 16th. I believe this bill is critical for American workers, companies and their communities. The bill as written would extend authorization for trade adjustment assistance for two years, and would allow workers and companies that are negatively impacted by international trade to receive the assistance currently allowed by law. If we do not pass this legislation, trade adjustment assistance will expire this October, and workers and companies that are presently receiving benefits will be completely cut off from government support. In specific terms, this  means over 340,000 workers across the country, and several thousand workers in my state of New Mexico, will be without support needed to maintain their lives and re-train for the future. These are real people and real lives we are talking about, and we simply can't let this happen. We must act now to ensure the programs continue. 
   Let me briefly explain what this legislation is about. In 1962, when the Trade Expansion Act was under consideration, the Kennedy Administration came up with a very straightforward proposition concerning international trade and American workers and companies: if and when Americans lose their jobs as a result of trade agreements entered into by the U.S. government, then the U.S. government should assist these Americans in finding new employment. If you lose a job because of U.S. trade policy, you should have some help from the federal government in re-training to get a job. 
   I find this a reasonable and fair proposition. It suggests that the U.S. government supports a open trading system, but recognizes that it is responsible to repair the negative impacts this policy has on its citizens. It suggests that the U.S. government believes that an open trading system provides long-term advantages for the United States and its people, but that the short-terms costs must be addressed if the policy is to continue and the United States is to remain competitive. It suggests that there is a collective interest that must be pursued, but that individual interests must be protected for the greater good. 
   This commitment to American workers and companies has continued over the years, and should not be ended now. The reason for continuity is obvious: globalization is only moving at a faster pace, with the potential for ever more significant impacts on our country. In my opinion, the process of globalization is inevitable. It is not going to stop. Therefore, the question for us in this chamber is not whether we can stop it, but how we can manage it to benefit the national interest of the United States. 
   The picture we see of globalization is that of a double-edged sword, with some individuals and companies gaining and others losing. The gains are clear-cut. Exports now generate over one-third of all economic growth in the United States. Export jobs pay ten to fifteen percent more than the average wage. Depending upon who you listen to, it has generated anywhere from two to eleven million jobs over the last ten years. For those who dislike globalization, I say look in your kitchen, your living room, your driveway, your office, and see the products that are there as a result of a more open and interdependent trading system. Without expanded trade brought on as a result of globalization we will end up fighting over an ever-decreasing domestic economic pie. 
   But in spite of these obvious benefits we cannot ignore the problems involved with globalization. Every day we hear disturbing stories about what this has meant for people across the country. In my state we have seen over the last year a large number of lay-offs and closings in small rural towns that cannot afford to have this happen. The closing of three plants in Roswell, Las Cruces, and Albuquerque meant 1,600 people lost their jobs. Next came lay-offs in the copper mines in my home town of Silver City. These people cannot simply go across the street and look for new work. They are people who have been dedicated to their companies and have played by the rules over the years. What they deserve when they lose their job is an opportunity to get income support and re-training to rebuild their lives. What they deserve is a program that creates skills that are needed, that moves them into new jobs faster, that provides opportunities for the future, that keeps families and communities intact. 
   TAA offers the potential for this outcome. Although in need of revision in several key areas--and I am focusing on these areas at this time--it has over the years consistently helped individuals and companies in communities across the United States deal with the transitions that are an inevitable part of a changing international economic system. It helps people that can work and want to work to continue to work in productive jobs that contribute to the economic welfare of our country. We have made this promise to workers in every administration, both Democrat and Republican, and we should continue to do so. Although TAA is not without its flaws, it remains the only program that allows workers and companies to adjust and remain competitive. Without it, in my opinion we are saying unequivocally that we don't care what happens to you, that we bear no responsibility for the position that you are in, that you are on your own. 
   Senators ROTH, MOYNIHAN, and others think otherwise, and I agree wholeheartedly with them. I believe that this commitment to individuals and companies and communities must be kept. I urge all my colleagues to support the passage of this bill when it comes to a vote on the floor.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, over the past few days, my Democratic colleagues and I presented a number of arguments which clearly laid out the need for managed health care reform. 
   The ability to hold insurance companies accountable for their decisions is a critical element in ensuring the overall quality of patient protections. 
   While we will continue to present our case in a variety of ways, I would like to take this opportunity to relate a story that was shared with me just a few weeks ago about a young girl from Albuquerque, New Mexico. 
   Anna, 6 years old at the time, was a very active and energetic young girl and excited about entering first grade that year. One evening, Anna went with her parents and her brothers and sisters to a softball game. She and other children went off to play in an area near the softball field. Suddenly, some of the children came running towards the adults, screaming for help. Anna had caught her foot in a gate. Her foot was bleeding profusely and she was in agonizing pain. She was immediately rushed to the local emergency room. 
   After Anna was examined by her doctor and after a conversation with her family's HMO, it was determined that Anna would not be admitted to the hospital that night. 
   Anna's family reluctantly took her home that night where she was in pain throughout the evening. Her family was forced to watch their small, frail daughter lay in bed in agony. 
   The next morning, her mother was worried because Anna's foot was purple, swollen, and cold. Anna was in tremendous pain and had a fever. Her parents did not hesitate any longer and Anna was rushed back to the emergency room. 
   This time she was admitted immediately and treated on an emergency basis, but it was too late and her family's worst fears were realized. Anna had a raging infection that had already destroyed half of her foot which had to be amputated. 
   Anna had two surgeries and spent 6 weeks in the hospital. She will live with this deformity forever. 
   Unbelievably, her family's HMO has delayed paying for the 6 weeks she was in the hospital to have her foot amputated and grated at a cost of $23,000.00. 
   Anna's family paid for the protection of health insurance. What they received in return was a possible delay of critical medical service which has left Anna disfigured and has ruined her family's credit. 
   To the amazement of anyone who hears this 
   story, under current law, Anna's HMO will not be held accountable for their decisions. 
   Under the Democratic plan, Anna and her family would have legal recourse like any other American has in this country when they are wronged by a business. 
   The Democratic plan simply states that if a patient is injured or killed as a result of an insurance company's decision, the insurance company can be held liable under state law. 
   Let me be clear. This will not open the flood gates to more litigation and raise the cost of health insurance. 
   It doe not override states' rights. It simply says that whatever rights a given state chooses to grant shall not be blocked by federal legislation. 
   Without adoption of the Democratic plan, stories like Anna's will continue to be told. I understand Anna is quite a young girl and she will go on. But she and her family will struggle with this nightmare. 
   The Democratic plan is not about lawyers--it is about people like Anna and protecting their rights. 
   Anna, her family and millions like them in this country are waiting for us to do just that.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. 
   I strongly support the effort my friend from Oregon is making to ensure that there is a provision in this bill that is finally passed prohibiting these gag provisions. I think that is very important. 
   I want to speak about a different aspect of this larger amendment. This is a provision that Senator HARKIN has taken the lead on, that I am cosponsoring with him. It deals with the problem of discrimination against nonphysician providers of health care services. 
   What am I talking about when I talk about ``discrimination against nonphysician providers of health care services''? I am talking about the people whom everyone, on occasion, wind up going to for high-quality professional health care. I am talking about nurse anesthetists, about speech and language pathologists, nurse practitioners, physical therapists, nurse mid-wives, occupational therapists, psychologists, optometrists, and opticians. These are health professionals who are licensed to provide particular medical services. 
   All we are providing in Senator HARKIN's amendment, which I cosponsor, is that a health maintenance organization cannot arbitrarily prevent a whole category of health care providers from providing that health care they are licensed and qualified to provide. 
   This is an extremely important issue for a State such as New Mexico where we have a great many rural and underserved areas. That is where the impact is the greatest because we have too few physicians in my State. The reality is that if a person is limited in obtaining their health care from a physician, in many cases in many parts of our State they either have a choice of driving a great distance or going outside their health plan and paying out of their pocket for something that ought to be covered by the premium they are already paying. 
   It is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. In my State, the estimate is that we are losing 30 physicians. I believe it was 30 physicians in 1 month, according to the estimate. So we have a shortage of physicians. We are losing many of the ones that we have. We need to be sure people have access to the nonphysician health care providers who are very qualified to provide some of these services. 
   Let me show a chart on one of the specialties I am talking about. This is on anesthesia providers. 
   As I indicated before, nurse anesthetists are covered as one of the groups of health care providers. In our State, if you want anesthesia services, if you have to have anesthesia provided to you, your ability to get that strictly from a physician occurs in only one small area of our State. That is the area in blue. In all of the rest of our State, you are forced to rely upon someone other than a physician to provide that service. 
   All we are saying is, in the case of anesthesia services, a health maintenance organization should have to allow those services to be provided by another qualified person other than a physician, where that person is available. This is a simple matter of fairness to patients in rural areas. It is something that does not involve significant costs. In fact, the estimate of the Congressional Budget Office is less than half a percent change in cost over a 10-year period. 
   The reality is that many of these nonphysician health care providers provide these services at a much lower cost than the physician does. So, in fact, it is not a question of increasing the cost. In many cases, it is a question of decreasing the cost. 
   We offered this amendment in committee when this bill was considered in the Health and Education Committee. I offered this exact language. Senator HARKIN did. Several of our Republican colleagues at that time expressed their support--not with their votes but with their statements--for providing this type of guarantee. So it is nothing radical. This is a simple fairness issue, and it is one that makes all the sense in the world as far as the economics of health care is concerned. 
   If we are really concerned about getting adequate health care to the rural underserved areas of our country, such as I represent in New Mexico, such as Senator HARKIN represents in his State, it is essential we have this amendment as part of what we pass out of Senate.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator. In relation to Medicare managed care plans, and in relation to Medicaid, it has worked extremely well in those cases. As far as I know, there has been no objection raised to it. 
   So I believe what has worked there makes good sense in this area as well. I believe it is very important we have this provision included in the bill we finally pass. 
   One other example. In my State, certified registered nurse anesthetists are the sole anesthesia providers for 65 percent of our rural hospitals. If our rural hospitals are going to continue to function, as they must, then we need to be sure the nonphysician providers who are able to provide services in these smaller communities are able to do so and be compensated through these health maintenance organizations. 
   I think this is an important provision. I hope very much Senators support it and we can get this adopted as part of a bill we finally pass. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill. 
   Let me add one other thing. We need to ask, who are the 48 
   million people who are covered under the Republican plan and under this amendment they have offered on nondiscrimination against providers? They are people who work for large employers primarily who are self-insured. The employers have their own insurance programs. 
   Unfortunately, in my State, there are very few of those large employers. You have to have over 100 employees, essentially, before it makes any sense to be self-insured. 
   In New Mexico, people work for small employers, by and large. Even those who work for larger employers generally are not working for self-insured employers. Essentially, the folks I am representing in the Senate are not going to be covered by the amendment as it is offered. I think this is a serious defect. 
   There is one other thing I want to say in relation to Senator DODD's point. The American Cancer Society does not support an amendment or provision that does not apply to all insured individuals, that requires a commission to determine routine patient costs, and delays access to clinical trials until the year 2001. The American Cancer Society maintains that all patients with a serious and life-threatening illness should have assured access and reimbursement for clinical trials. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the chance to speak about the pending amendment, particularly about the specialty care provision of the pending amendment. 
   I read it recently, but I think there are some serious concerns that need to be addressed. The Senator from North Carolina has raised them. I know others have as well. 
   As I understand the amendment now, there is no provision in it to restrict an HMO from charging additional for a patient if they need to go outside the plan to get specialty care. One of the things we have tried to do in the amendment we drafted on specialty care is to ensure not only that a person has the right to specialty care but that they cannot be charged whatever the HMO determines in additional charges they want to tack on in order to get that access. 
   I think this is important. Clearly, if a person has signed on to a health care plan, they expect to be able to access the care they need without incurring additional costs, particularly when there is no restriction in this legislation or this pending amendment, that I am aware of, which would in any way restrict the amount of the additional cost that might be added. That is a very real concern which I think we have to bear in mind. 
   Another concern is, the amendment we intend to offer on specialty care tries to specify that if a person has a chronic illness that requires the care of a specialist, that specialist could be designated as the primary care provider. For example, someone who is diabetic and who needs to see a specialist, an endocrinologist--which I believe is the specialty that is focused on dealing with the problems of diabetics--a person could have that endocrinologist designated as their primary care physician so they could go directly to that person and not have 
   to go through a primary care provider in each case. 
   As I read this amendment, it says nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a plan from requiring the authorization of a case manager--that is, the person working for the insurance company--or the primary care provider each time you go to see a specialist. 
   I think that is another defect in the bill, as I understand it. Now, I could be corrected on any of this if the author of the amendment can point to other language that I am not aware of. 
   The third point I want to make is the same question the Senator from North Carolina raised. He referred to it as ``gaping hole No. 3.'' That is the question about what do you do when the health maintenance organization says no, we will not allow you to access a specialist. That is a real-life circumstance that many people face. 
   In the amendment we intend to offer, we provide if you are denied access to a specialist, you can get an independent reviewer to review that decision on a very timely basis and then abide by that decision. There is nothing in the pending amendment I can see that would provide for any such appeal if the HMO turns down a patient's request for specialty care. 
   We had a very good opportunity earlier today to hear from a mother of a 4-year-old boy about the problems she encountered in trying to get access to specialty care for him. That circumstance is one that many people face. She was delayed and delayed and delayed by the health maintenance organization constantly saying they would not allow her to see anyone but her primary care physician for the various ear infections her 4-year-old son was having because they believed those should be treatable by that primary care physician. After more than 2 years of being delayed, she finally did get access to a specialist. The specialist did a surgical operation which corrected the problem. 
   Unfortunately, because this situation existed at this time in her son's life, her son now has a speech impairment and is having to go through therapy for that. Again, she is encountering problems getting access to that speech therapy for her son through the HMO. 
   I don't believe the specialty care provision in this amendment that is pending solves the problem for most Americans. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding this time. 
   Mr. President, this is a very important amendment. This is the amendment that I believe is the most significant for many Americans in this entire debate. This is the amendment that 
   relates to the question of whether they are going to have access to speciality care as part of their arrangement with their health maintenance organization. 
   Often, if speciality care is denied or if access to speciality care is delayed for a substantial period of time, it can involve a real health risk and even death for a patient. This is not an insignificant matter. This is a very important matter which is essential we deal with if we are going to put in place some protections for patients in this legislation. 
   The amendment that Senator KENNEDY has sent to the desk on my behalf establishes, first of all, a general right to speciality care if it is medically necessary. If a plan cannot provide such care within its own network, then it must allow the patient who needs that care to go outside the network at no extra cost to the patient. This is in sharp contrast to the amendment we were talking about before which the Senator from Maine sent to the desk. In that case, there was no restriction on the HMO in its ability to charge additional amounts to the patient if they went outside the plan. 
   We provide that no additional charges can be imposed. This is a procedure which is in place in many of our managed health care plans, but unfortunately not in all. 
   What we would do is say that this is a basic right that people in this country are entitled to if they have health care through health maintenance organizations. 
   The second thing this amendment does is it allows people who have a  chronic or a serious ongoing illness that requires specialty care to receive that care either through a standing referral to a specialist or by designating a specialist as their primary care provider. 
   This is very important. This is an important protection for disabled people, for individuals with serious chronic illnesses, such as diabetes. In my comments a few minutes ago, I referred to the fact that a person with diabetes clearly needs access to a specialist on an ongoing basis. They receive most of their care from a specialist who understands their condition, and that specialist is in the best position to coordinate their care. 
   The plan which the Republican Members offered a few minutes ago does not guarantee access to that specialty care without additional cost. It does not guarantee access to that specialty care for all patients. And it does not guarantee access to that specialty care on an ongoing basis with that specialist being designated as a standing referral or as a primary care provider. 
   So there is a very great difference between what we are offering in this second-degree amendment and what was earlier discussed. 
   This amendment I think is absolutely crucial for people who suffer from these ongoing chronic diseases. This is an issue which we heard very dramatically described earlier this morning in a press conference that occurred outside the Capitol. 
   We had a woman attend who talked about the problems--she is a nurse herself, so she knows a great deal about providing medical care to individuals--and she talked about the problems she and her husband had in gaining access to specialty care for their young child, their 4-year-old son Matthew. What she said I think rings true to a lot of Americans. 
   Let me just go briefly through her story. She talked about Matthew having a significant speech delay that had been directly linked to his repeated ear infections. She said for the first 2 years of his life Matthew suffered 14 ear infections. In most cases this is a normal childhood illness that is treatable by antibiotics, but in the case of Matthew it was not a normal childhood illness. 
   The doctor who treated Matthew repeatedly used antibiotics instead of granting the request, which the parents made, for a referral to an ear, nose, and throat specialist. As a nurse, this mother, Beth Gross, knew the risks of the chronic condition. She grew frustrated at how a simple surgical procedure called an ear tube placement could have immediately corrected this problem, and eventually her frustration grew to a level where she made the decision to change her primary care physician. 
   She called the insurance company at that point. She said when she explained the dilemma she was in, she was outraged by the response she received from the insurance company. 
   This is a quotation from her statement. She said:  
   We could not get a referral for Matthew because it was their policy [the policy of the insurance company] to impose monetary sanctions on the physician for giving a referral for something that he is able to treat.  
   It was the view of the insurance company that he was able 
   to treat this. They were going to impose monetary sanctions on him if there was a referral made. On that basis, they would not allow the referral. So she had to fight for another year to get the referral that Matthew needed. 
   By that time, Matthew was 18 months old and was still not speaking. Although she had changed doctors, she could not change insurance companies. When they finally did see the specialist they needed, the specialist immediately knew the right procedure and performed it to correct the problem. So Matthew finally did receive this ear tube surgery that he desperately needed. After that, his hearing cleared up; the problem was solved. 
   Unfortunately, though, if Matthew had only been treated earlier he would have been able to avoid the speech problem he now has as a 4-year-old. She said in her statement:  
   Now our family must work to correct his speech problem. Our insurance company has changed since then, but it has been another fight with another HMO to cover speech therapy. They denied coverage for that service until the National Patient Advocate Foundation stepped in and won that battle for Matthew.  
   We have a serious problem in gaining access to specialty care in the case of many of these HMOs. The amendment we have prepared has the support of a tremendous number of groups: The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the Patients Access Coalition, the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, the Coalition of Cancer Organizations, the Oncology Nursing Society, the American Thoracic Society, and on and on. 
   So there is a very long list of organizations that believe very strongly we need to have this protection built into the law. I believe very strongly in that. 
   When I travel through New Mexico and talk to people about their health care problems, of all the issues that I am told about, probably this issue of gaining access to specialty care is the most significant. 
   People are very concerned that if a circumstance befalls them or their child or their parent, they will be denied access to specialty care unless we do something to ensure that that access is there. The amendment we are offering will provide that access. It will ensure that access is there. It is a basic right that we ought to ensure. 
   Let me mention one other thing because I think this is a point that was made several times this morning. 
   We spend billions and billions of dollars in this country, and we vote for those dollars right here on this Senate floor, to support the very best medical research in the world. At the National Institutes of Health, I think their budget this year is somewhere in excess of $13 billion. We do have the specialists that the rest of the world envies. People come here from all over the world to gain access to these specialists.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Unless we put some of these protections in the law, we are denying our own citizens, in many cases, access to the specialists their tax dollars have paid to train in the specialty care their tax dollars have gone to develop. So we need to put these protections into place. The great research and the great health care that is developed at NIH needs to get to the patient, and that is what this amendment will try to do.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the amendment that myself, Senator HARKIN, and many of my colleagues are offering today guarantees American families the right to access medical specialists. Our amendment is fair. It is what working families pay for each month, and very simply put; this amendment can literally save lives. 
   Let me briefly outline the fundamental components of this amendment. 
   First, our amendment says that if you pay for health insurance, you are guaranteed the right to see a specialist if medically appropriate. 
   Second, if a plan cannot provide such care within its network, it must allow the patient to go outside the network to an institution or individual competent to provide the care, at no cost to the patient beyond what would be required if the patient were treated in network. 
   Third, this amendment allows people with chronic or serious ongoing illnesses that require continued specialty care to receive that care either through a standing referral to a specialist or by designating the specialist as their special care coordinator.  
   The current requirement that patients must go back to a primary care doctor whenever they need to see a specialist or when additional care is ordered is at best an inconvenience, and at worst, a real detriment to timely, appropriate medical services. This is especially critical for the disabled and for people with chronic disorders and serious or complex medical conditions. 
   Our Republican colleagues have said that they cover access to specialists in their bill. In fact, their bill does not guarantee access to specialists. Under their bill, patients could actually be charged more for out-of-network specialty care--even if the plan is at fault for not having access to appropriate specialists within the plan. 
   Our amendment will have a profound effect on the lives of American children and the families who care for them. 
   For example, our amendment would allow a child with leukemia to go directly to a pediatric oncologist instead of being hauled from doctor to doctor. 
   A sick child should not have to go through such an additional ordeal. This makes perfect sense to me and the American people overwhelmingly agree. People who are fighting to stay healthy should not have to battle their HMO as well. 
   This amendment has other common sense effects. The access provisions in this amendment, when combined with a right to a meaningful and speedy independent appeal, will help minimize the need for litigation by helping ensure patients get the benefits they need from appropriately qualified providers in a timely fashion. The guaranteed right to have access to a specialist should not be a controversial issue. This is a simple matter of allowing working Americans to get what they pay for--the best medical health care available. 
   Mr. President, I believe this amendment is fair. The current system wasn't fair for Henry, a 40-year-old man from Albuquerque, New Mexico who had what the doctors refer to as ``lymphocytic lymphoma'' a form of cancer. 
   Henry was not responding to conventional therapy and quickly required a specialized procedure. This was not an experimental procedure and he would most certainly die without it. His doctor immediately applied for the referral. 
   Since there were no facilities for such a procedure in Henry's managed care network, his doctor requested a referral to a specialist out of network, a right he would have guaranteed under our amendment. 
   Even knowing exactly what kind of speciality procedure was necessary, where that specialist was, and that time was critical, the managed care company held multiple meetings which dragged on for more than a year. 
   Under our amendment speciality care is guaranteed to be available and accessible because we recognize the importance of providing timely, appropriate medical services. 
   A final meeting was held between Henry's doctors and the managed care company personnel. During that meeting, the managed care company required that Henry's doctor explicitly relate descriptions of what would happen to Henry without the referral for the necessary procedure. 
   Henry's doctor writes:  
   I had to sit in front of this patient and his wife and explain in graphic detail just exactly how he would die, how that would be, and how little hope there actually was that anything else would occur.  
   Henry's doctor continues, ``Henry had been pretty strong until that time, but this broke him and after that point he lost any spirit to fight.'' 
   After one year of requests and delays, the managed care company did, in fact, approve the referral, but by that time Henry's condition had deteriorated and it was too late. Henry died. 
   In a final, sad epilogue to this story, the managed care plan is on record as having approved the referral to the specialist for the procedure. 
   We are fortunate to live in a country that has seen so many medical advances. We all have family or friends who have benefited from the knowledge and expertise of specialists. Blocking access to these health care professionals is wrong and it is well past time to address this issue.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. As I understand the bill you are referring to, you say it provides this access. There is no requirement that access to the specialist be provided at the regular amount that is being paid. Whatever the HMO determines the additional cost should be to go to the outside specialist would be charged, is that correct? That is my understanding. I have read the bill fairly carefully, and that is a major difference between the amendment I have offered and the amendment that you are referring to.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I rise to discuss managed care reform, an extremely important issue which we are finally getting to a debate this week. We have an opportunity this week to substantially improve the  quality of life for 161 million Americans, including 900,000 New Mexicans, many of whom have contacted me through letters and phone calls and faxes, telling about their desire for some reform of the managed care system. 
   Our goal this week seems to me very clear. The American people--and I believe every family who spends their hard-earned dollars on health insurance--need to receive nothing less than the finest of medical care available. We are trying to ensure that through this legislation. That is the task we have set, to guarantee the people of this country critical patient protections. 
   It is clear the reasons are valid, why we should do this. First, survey after survey reports the American people are demanding the passage of patient protections such as those contained in the Democratic bill that I supported, which Senator KENNEDY offered in the committee. In my State, there are 350,000 New Mexicans who will not have critical patient protections if the bill we pass at the end of this week leaves medical decisions up to non-medical insurance personnel. There are 200 patient groups and health care provider organizations, physicians, workers' unions, and employee groups, that stand behind the need for these patient protections. There are 30 million Americans who have had trouble seeing a specialist, women and children with special needs who either had critical care delayed or, worse, had that care denied. I heard my colleague from Wyoming just now say providing this access to specialized care will dramatically increase premiums. 
   The statistics are clear. The Congressional Budget Office did an analysis and determined that the increase in premium costs would be, at the most, 4.8 percent over a 10-year period. Providing this specialized care or access to specialists would be a one-tenth-of-1-percent increase in cost, less than $2 per patient per month for the entire array of patient protections about which we are talking. This is a very modest amount which Americans are willing to pay. 
   Americans who live in rural areas, such as my State and the Senator from Wyoming was talking about his State, have to travel an hour or more to get to a doctor when there is an appropriate health care provider just down the road. We are trying to ensure those other appropriate health care providers also be made available to those patients. 
   Even if you put aside all of these particular reasons for passing the bill, clearly the main reason we should pass it is that it is the fair thing to do. 
   There was a very good editorial in this morning's Washington Post which I believe all Members should read. Let me refer to it for a moment. It talks about the managed care debate coming up in the Senate this week. It says:  
   The objective is, or ought to be, to legitimize the containment of these costs by giving the public a greater guarantee that the process will be fair. Republicans resist the increased regulation this would entail. In the past they have tried to deflect the bill; now they offer weak legislation that is mainly a shell.  
   My colleague from North Dakota said the Republican proposal is an empty vessel. The Washington Post says it is ``mainly a shell.'' 
   It goes on to say:  
   The stronger Democratic bill is itself fairly modest. Much of it is ordinary consumer protection. Patients would have to be fully informed about the costs and limits of coverage, including any arrangements a plan might have with physicians or other providers that might give them an economic incentive to cut costs. No gag orders could be imposed on physicians to keep them from disclosing the range of possible treatment, without regard to cost. A plan would be required to have enough doctors to meet the likely needs of the enrollees. Patients could not be unfairly denied access to emergency care or specialists.......  
   It goes on:  
   The Republican bill professes to provide many of the same protections, but the fine print often belies the claim.  
   Madam President, the debate is going to be very constructive this week. The distinctions between the Democratic bill, which contains real protections, and the Republican bill, which the Washington Post refers to as ``mainly a shell,'' will be made clear to the American people. I hope very much we will step up to the challenge and pass something that contains some substantive protections for the people of my State. We will have other opportunities to debate specific amendments in the future. 
   I see the Democratic leader is ready to speak. I yield the floor, and I appreciate the chance to speak.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to call the attention of my colleagues to an important day for one of our former colleagues; and that is, Senator Jim Sasser, who is returning from China where he has served this country very well as our Ambassador for the last 3 1/2 years. He was confirmed in this Senate on December 19, 1995, and with an overwhelming vote. 
   We are proud of the service he has performed, particularly in recent months, because of the strained relations we have had and the genuine misunderstanding which has existed concerning the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.  
   I think all of us were proud to see the way former Senator Sasser, Ambassador Sasser, conducted himself, and how all of the American Embassy personnel conducted themselves in that circumstance. I think that is typical of the service he provided throughout the time he was in China. 
   We are glad to see him back in the United States. We, of course, look forward to many years of friendship with him in the future. 
   I think it is worth noting, because I understand he is returning today from China and has distinguished himself in that position and deserves recognition. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a bill that I have sent to the desk. It relates to a very serious problem faced by a large number of Navajo people in my State. The issue is referred to as ``fractionated lands.'' 
   Around the turn of the century, the Federal Government attempted to force Indian people to assimilate by breaking up traditional tribal lands and allotting parcels of the land to individual tribal members. In New Mexico, this policy created what is known as the ``checkerboard,'' because alternating tracts of land are now owned by individual Navajos, the state, the federal government, or private landowners. A Navajo allotment was generally 160 acres. Under the allotment system, the Navajo owner was granted an undivided interest in the entire parcel. The heirs of the original owner also inherit an undivided interest, geometrically compounding--or fractionating--the number of owners of the original 160 acres. 
   This allotment policy, coupled with other federal laws governing Indian land ownership, land management, and probate, have not served the Navajo people well during this century. I am introducing legislation today to help address this problem. 
   Mr. President, I'd like to take a few minutes to illustrate why the legislation I am proposing is needed. If a Navajo was allotted a 160-acre parcel and had four heirs, the heirs did not inherit 40 acres each when the original owner died. Rather, each heir inherited a 25 percent undivided interest in the full 160-acre allotment. Going forward, when the current four owners died, assuming again four heirs each, sixteen heirs inherited a 6.25 percent undivided interest in the allotment. The next generation would result in 64 heirs each with a 1.5625 percent undivided interest. And so forth. 
   What makes this situation so unique is that each heir inherits an undivided interest in the allotment. Over time, individual owners may inherit tiny fractions in many different allotments around the reservation. In my state, there are about 4,000 individual allotments covering nearly 700,000 acres. At this point, these 4,000 Navajo allotments have a total of 40,000 listed owners, and the number grows every day. It doesn't take a Ph.D. in math to figure out what's wrong with this policy. 
   Mr. President, in April I held a town meeting with Navajo allottees in Nageezi, New Mexico, a small chapter house in the Northeast section of the Navajo Reservation. The allottees talked about the serious problems that fractionated ownership has caused. Over 100 members of the Navajo Nation came from as far away as Aneth, Utah, to speak at the meeting. As you know, the Navajo Nation extends into three states, New Mexico, Arizona and Utah, and there are allottees living in all three states. 
   Record keeping of individual land ownership has become a nightmare. In many cases, owners can no longer be located. Also, ownership can be clouded when an owner dies without a legal will--a common situation in Indian Country. 
   Some individuals do not even realize they own one or more of these allotments. Often, individuals are surprised to find out that they are an heir to an allotment on another reservation. 
   Mr. President, we all recognize there are serious problems with BIA's management of its trust responsibilities for allotted lands in New Mexico. The management problems were brought out very clearly at a joint Senate hearing in March. The hearing also revealed the extent to which the government's allotment policy contributed to BIA's current trust management problems. 
   On the Navajo reservation, a three-year pilot project is underway in Farmington, New Mexico, to try to unravel some of the management problems with allotted Navajo lands. This project, called the Farmington Indian Minerals Office, or FIMO, is trying to cut through the red tape created by three different Bureaus in the Department of Interior, BIA, BLM, and MMS, which share responsibility for management of allotted lands. The FIMO has worked hard to assist Navajo allottees determine who their fellow allottees are and what land each allottee owns. I support the efforts of FIMO. If this legislation is passed, FIMO could accomplish even more on behalf of the Navajo allottees in the three states. 
   Mr. President, over the years, Congress has tried to deal with the problem of fractionated lands, and has failed every time. The long history of trust management problems is not going to be corrected quickly. Developing and implementing a comprehensive solution is going to take time. The Indian Land Working Group is one of  the leaders in this area and has submitted a proposal for Congress to consider. I applaud the efforts of Senators CAMPBELL and INOUYE and the members of the Indian Affairs Committee for taking on this difficult issue. Some of the proposals include improved record keeping, probate and estate planning programs, and new processes for consolidating fractionated lands. I look forward to working with the Committee to craft a comprehensive solution. 
   While the larger issue of fractionated ownership is being considered by the Senate, I believe it is appropriate to consider a stop-gap measure to help stimulate near-term economic development on fractionated Navajo lands. There is an abundance of oil and gas beneath the Navajo allotments, yet the allottees are unable to benefit from this wealth because of federal laws that make it very difficult for Indian allottees to lease their land. To illustrate, during the last 12 years, $7 million in leasing bonuses has been paid to the state and federal government for leases in the checkerboard region of New Mexico, while only $27,000 has been paid to owners of Navajo allotments. 
   The problem lies in the 1909 Mineral Leasing Act. The Act requires all persons who have an undivided interest in any particular parcel to consent to its lease. In the case of Navajo allottees, 100 percent of the allottees must consent to a lease of their land. Because of the fractionated land problem, obtaining 100 percent consent is often impossible because many owners cannot be located. Consequently, the Navajo allottees are precluded from the beneficial use of their land. 
   The bill I am introducing today will facilitate the leasing of Navajo allotted land for oil and gas development. In the case of non-Indians, most states already allow mineral leases with less than 100 percent consent of the owners as long as all persons who own an interest receive the benefits from the lease. My bill simply extends similar benefits to Navajo allottees. The bill would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to approve an oil or gas lease connected to Navajo allotted land when less than 100 percent of the owners consent to such a lease. A similar bill was passed in the 105th Congress to facilitate mineral leasing of allotted lands on the Ft. Berthold Reservation in North Dakota. 
   My bill proposes a graded system for lease approval. In situations where there are 10 or fewer owners of an allotment, 100 percent of the owners must consent to a lease. However, where there exists 11 to 50 owners of an allotment, only 80 percent of the owners need consent. And, with more than 50 owners, 60 percent consent would be required. This graded system was suggested by the Navajo allottees. 
   Mr. President, unemployment on the Navajo Reservation now exceeds 50 percent. The opportunities for economic development on this land are few. It is not appropriate for the federal government to continue to deprive the legal owners of Navajo allotted lands the option to develop their land as they choose. This bill is a small step toward correcting the mistakes of the past and a bigger step towards providing economic prosperity for future generations of Navajo allottees. 
   The bill has the support of the Navajo Nation and the Shii Shi Keyah, the principal Navajo Allottees' Association.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this sense-of-the-Senate amendment is being offered on behalf of myself, Senator ROBERTS, Senator BOB SMITH, and Senator MAX CLELAND as well. 
   It is, I believe, an important amendment. It is also an amendment that will be accepted. That is my expectation. We don't have a final decision on that, but we hope that is the result. 
   This year's foreign operations appropriations bill designates $20 million in foreign military financing grant assistance to Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, the Baltic States. I am not concerned about the fact that we are designating funds for those states. I am concerned about the provision because of the intent that appears to lie behind the funding. 
   Let me quote from the committee report. It says in the committee report:  
   The assistance accelerates Baltic states integration into NATO and supports these democracies as they enhance military capabilities and adopt NATO standards.  
   This amendment I have offered, with the help of the three other Senators I mentioned, would state that nothing in this bill concerning the foreign military financing intended to support the legitimate security needs of the Baltic States should be interpreted as also expressing the intent of the Senate to accelerate the membership of those countries into NATO. 
   We recently observed the 50th anniversary of NATO, welcomed three new members into the alliance: the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary. I voted for the admission of those three into the alliance on this historic occasion. No other nations were admitted to the alliance, nor was there a commitment made to extend an invitation to any particular nation to join in the future. 
   The language contained in the Senate report accompanying the bill suggests that the military financing authorized in the bill would be for the express purpose of accelerating the integration of those states into NATO. I believe that language is premature. I believe it is ill-advised at this time. Let me try to give a few indications as to why. 
   Many of my colleagues share the concern, which we have heard on the floor, about the future of the NATO alliance. We, obviously, value NATO and its contributions to peace. We fervently intend that it continue to be a force for peace in the future. 
   Recent events within the alliance have raised some concern. Despite the recent military victory in Kosovo, there is some evidence that the alliance may not be totally healthy at this stage. 
   While the bombing campaign continued in Yugoslavia, for example, there were divisions among NATO members. Those were worked through. 
   In addition, there is a major debate now underway concerning the equity of the burdens that different members of NATO have, both financial burdens and military burdens. 
   I am not suggesting we debate the future of NATO today, although I do believe the Senate should soon review the Strategic Concept that is being proposed to guide future NATO potential military involvements. 
   I am suggesting, however, that legislative provisions, such as the one I have called attention to today in this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, could prematurely complicate the very difficult problems the alliance is facing. I don't believe anybody here would deny that a debate concerning the membership of the Baltic nations in NATO is likely to be a spirited one. This bill is not the appropriate venue for that debate to take place. 
   I have reviewed, by the way, the Baltic charter that was signed in January 1998 to determine if I missed something with respect to the membership of the Baltic nations in NATO. There are many affirming words in the charter about cooperation between NATO and the Baltic nations, and there are several encouraging references with respect to possible future membership of those countries in the alliance. But there are no words that commit NATO to offering membership or to accelerating their integration of those nations into the alliance. 
   The provision in the bill that would provide military assistance to the Baltic nations for that specific purpose is not grounded in a policy that I believe we should embrace at this time. 
   The sense-of-the-Senate amendment I offer would permit foreign military financing to meet the security needs of the Baltic nations, but it does not commit the Senate, as a result of that assistance, to commit itself to approval or acceleration of the membership of the Baltic nations into NATO. 
   I hope my colleagues will support the amendment. I believe it is in our national interest and in the security interests of Europe as well. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President I rise today to introduce the Community Forest Restoration Act of 1999. This legislation provides incentives for collaborative forest restoration projects on National Forest System and other public lands in New Mexico. 
   The densely stocked stands of small diameter trees in New Mexico present an increasing danger of catastrophic wildfire that endangers peoples' lives and livelihoods. These conditions dramatically reduce plant and animal biological diversity, decrease watershed productivity, and provide fewer benefits to people. Healthy, productive watersheds minimize the threat of catastrophic wildfire, provide diverse wildlife habitat, and produce a variety of timber and non-timber products including better quality water and increased water flows.  
   My goal is to promote healthy watersheds and reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfire, insect infestation, and disease in the forests in New Mexico. To do this we must restore and maintain the forest ecosystem by reducing the unnaturally high number of small diameter trees on Federal, State, and tribal forest lands, and improve the utilization of small diameter material. 
   This legislation directs the Secretary of Agriculture to create a program that provides forest restoration demonstration project grants to community organizations. The intent of the program is to encourage innovation and collaboration on forest restoration projects among stakeholders at the local level, and provide for multi-party assessment of those projects. 
   Forest restoration activities that empower local organizations to implement activities which value local and traditional knowledge can help build ownership and civic pride, and can lead to healthy, diverse, productive forest ecosystems. This approach will encourage the development of industries which are based on the creation and maintenance of healthy forest ecosystems. This bill will encourage sustainable community development through collaborative partnerships that improve communication and joint problem solving. The objective of these partnerships is to restore the forests of New Mexico by reducing the density of stands that contain an unnaturally high number of small diameter trees and improving the use of those trees. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the text of the bill in the RECORD.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the electricity restructuring bill I introduced in the last Congress. I offer the bill today because the Energy and Natural Resources Committee will be holding two legislative hearings next week on the pending electricity restructuring bills, and I want this bill to be included in the discussions. With the exception of two typographical corrections, the text of the bill is identical to S. 1276, which I introduced in the last Congress. 
   The bill has three principal legislative objectives: (1) clarifying the line between state and federal jurisdiction, (2) strengthening the reliability of the transmission system, and (3) ensuring fair access to the interstate transmission grid. When I introduced the bill in the last Congress it received wide support as the nucleus of the most critical issues that Congress must address in any restructuring legislation. 
   As many Senators are aware, I am working with the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, my good friend Senator MURKOWSKI, on developing a consensus electricity bill that can be marked up and reported to the full Senate. Although I had expected that we would be further along in the process by now, I remain fully committed to following this bi-partisan course. My introduction of this bill should not impeded that process. 
   Much has happened in the electric utility industry since this bill was first drafted nearly two years ago. There are now six approved regional transmission operators, and several more are on the drawing boards. Twenty-two states, including New Mexico, have implemented some form of electric competition and two more may pass legislation this year. And there is now industry-wide consensus on the importance of federal legislation to assure the continued security and reliability of the nation's high-tension transmission grid. 
   Mr. President, I continue to see a strong need for federal electricity legislation so that states that have elected retail competition can fully enjoy all of the benefits that completion brings. In addition, improvements in federal regulation will streamline wholesale markets in every state. At the same time, I believe Congress should not enact federal legislation that disrupts existing state laws or that forces unwilling states to restructure. 
   I also have increasing concern about the mounting cloud of litigation pending in the federal courts that could frustrate the development of healthy wholesale and retail markets. Only Congress can clear up jurisdictional issues and let competitive markets fully develop. Interstate transmission must be a federal responsibility. 
   Mr. President, I believe we now have a consensus on the core issues that Congress must address. The Energy Committee held an oversight hearing last month on the status of restructuring in the states. There was nearly universal agreement among the witnesses on the need for federal legislation addressing interstate transmission and federal-state jurisdiction 
   I look forward to the legislative hearings next week on this and other bills and to reporting bi-partisan electricity legislation that can pass the Senate this year.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President. I take the opportunity today to call to the attention of Members of the Senate and to the American people a very important event that took place last week but was not widely publicized. On Wednesday, June 16, representatives from the Department of Defense and Russia's Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Yuri Ushakov, signed an agreement extending the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program sponsored in 1991 by our distinguished colleagues, Senator Sam Nunn and Senator RICHARD LUGAR. The agreement signed last week extends the Nunn-Lugar threat reduction programs for 7 years until 2006. That extension will build upon the critical work already accomplished that has reduced Russia's military threat to the United States and our allies more effectively than any other measures undertaken since the end of the Cold War. In the context of these uncertain times and Russia's uncertain future, the investments made through Cooperative Threat Reduction programs promise to yield dividends that are essential to long-term peace and stability throughout the world. 
   Indeed, the accomplishments of CTR are a more cost effective means to enhancing national security than any I know. Between 1992 and 1999, the Nunn-Lugar programs have eliminated the potential for nuclear threats from former members of the Soviet Union including Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Belarus, and Uzbekistan. For $2.7 billion that the United States has spent on CTR since 1992, a bit more than the cost of a single B-2 bomber, there are now 1,538 fewer nuclear warheads available for use against the U.S. or our allies. The Russians have eliminated 50 missile silos and 254 intercontinental ballistic missiles. In addition, we are in the process of dismantling some 30 strategic ballistic missile submarines that formerly threatened the United States from deep ocean sites. So far, U.S. and Russian teams have dismantled 148 missile launch tubes on those submarines and 30 sea-launched ballistic missiles. CTR programs have eliminated more than 40 Russian strategic bombers that used to be within hours of American military and civilian targets. Collectively, those actions under CTR have ensured that Russia has met and continues to meet its treaty obligations under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, START. More important, they have significantly cut back on the potential threat posed by those weapons to the United States, our allies, and our worldwide security interests. 
   The Cooperative Threat Reduction program extends beyond the elimination of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery. Funds for this program are allocated to ensure the safe transportation, storage, security, accounting, and monitoring of strategic and tactical nuclear weapons scheduled for destruction and for weapons grade nuclear materials from weapons that have been dismantled. I have visited Russia and personally observed implementation of the Department of Energy's Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting program which enhances day-to-day security at dozens of nuclear sites across Russia. I remain deeply concerned that without that assistance, the possibility of smuggling nuclear materials into the wrong hands is a serious possibility that could threaten the entire world. 
   Looking toward the future, funds from CTR are helping to convert Russia's reactors that produce plutonium to eliminate that capability. Ultimately, the cutoff of production of fissile materials is the tool by which we can help prevent the proliferation of nuclear materials from becoming an even greater problem than it is today. Conversion of Russia's nuclear production capability is a key part of addressing that problem. 
   The Cooperative Threat Reduction program also assists the Russians in meeting obligations assumed under the Chemical Weapons Convention we ratified in the Senate two 
   years ago. Under this program, the United States has assisted Russia in planning the construction of a chemical weapons destruction facility needed to destroy the large volume of aging chemical munitions in their inventory. Funds are essential to keep this program moving forward in order to ensure that we can reduce the threat of proliferation of chemical weapons and their use against our security interests. I am aware that some in the Congress believe that Russia has not shouldered its responsibilities under this and other CTR programs, but I prefer to consider such matters from our own selfish security point of view. To the extent that we are able to purchase or finance reductions to Russian military capabilities that directly threaten us, those are funds well spent. When Russians are able and agree to provide funding or support in kind for CTR programs, so much the better. 
   I would like to point out an additional benefit to the Nunn-Lugar programs that is not often recognized or understood. I am certain that the Members of this body can recall the perceptions shared by many Americans concerning the government and people of the Soviet Union during the Cold War. I need not remind us of the unbridgeable gap that existed between our governments, our political systems, and our cultures. In the wake of the Cold War, however, many of those gaps have been bridged and important bonds have been forged between our two countries and citizens. Thousands of American and Russian technical and support personnel have built a foundation of trust and understanding through their cooperative efforts under the CTR program. I firmly believe that those bonds will pay dividends and serve the long-term interests of peaceful relations between our two countries--particularly if we in the United States continue to hold the course in supporting CTR and other cooperative programs such as the Initiative for Proliferation Prevention, the Nuclear Cities Initiative, and the Russian American Cooperative Satellite program. Key Russian personnel in implementing those programs have come to know Americans with whom they frequently meet and vice versa. I have spoken personally with many Russians and Americans who are directly involved in these programs all of whom share the same conviction that cooperation is the key to a peaceful future. 
   These are very uncertain times. We are at a crucial juncture in our relations with Russia that could determine  the direction of the global political climate for many years to come. No one is certain what the future of Russia will bring once President Yeltsin leaves office. Everyone is aware that a deep reservoir of distrust and fear exists among Russian citizens, officials, and military personnel concerning the United States and NATO. We have done much in the past couple of years to feed those fears and anxieties, thereby generating hostility that could threaten to reawaken Cold War tensions. On the other hand, we have established critical relationships that could weigh against such a reprise through programs such as CTR. The impending post-Yeltsin debate within Russia regarding its future direction must include the voice of cooperation rather than confrontation as the way to peace and stability. The Cooperative Threat Reduction program has built a constituency in Russia to articulate that voice. I salute its sponsors, Senators Nunn and LUGAR for their visionary contribution, and celebrate its extension into the next millennium. I strongly encourage my colleagues to continue to support CTR and related programs through the ebbs and flows of U.S.-Russian relations. The prospects for long term global peace and stability will be the better for it.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to today to ask my colleagues to consider several intriguing questions. What would we do if I told you that Americans were deliberately being denied access to our country's greatest technologies and developments? What if I told you that there is a business in this country that is permitted to make any kind of business decision they want and potentially adversely effect millions of consumers' lives and not be held accountable? What if I told you that Congress has had the answer to these questions and, most importantly, the solutions to these problems but because of a few people and a great deal  of money from one special interest group, the American people have been denied a substantially better quality of life? Well, unfortunately, all this is true. 
   Over 200 organizations representing doctors, nurses, patients' right advocates, consumer organizations and labor groups and American people everywhere have all spoken loud and long: The time is now to pass a meaningful patient's bill of rights. My Democratic colleagues stand ready, once again, to engage in a discussion with our Republican colleagues so that we can finally put the American people's interest before health insurance company profits. 
   Over 100 million workers who labor hard and pay health insurance are being denied critical medical services. We are led to believe by some that the health care system under managed care is working just fine. In our own circles of friends and family, we know that this is simply not true. The numbers are staggering. I have a chart here that will not surprise anyone. 
   In 1998, 115 million Americans either had a problem or knew someone who had a problem with managed care and that number is dramatically on the rise. Let me say that again. At least, 115 million people in this country are experiencing difficulties obtaining medical services for which they pay for every month. The issue is clear. Managed health care reform is long overdue. 
   First and foremost, we need a managed health care system that is inclusive, providing the best health care for everyone that spends their hard earned dollars on health insurance. The Republican managed care bill leaves out over 100 million Americans: two-thirds of those that have private health insurance. Let me be even more specific using my own State, New Mexico, as a example of what I am referring to. 
   There are approximately 900,000 privately insured patients in the State of New Mexico. Without passage of the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights, look at the list of major patient protections that over 900,000 New Mexicans will not have. 
   Under the Republican bill, almost 700,000 New Mexicans will not have substantive protections and 350,000 will not be covered at all if the Republicans pass their bill. The Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights will assure that 900,000 New Mexicans will receive all these protections that I have listed on this chart. 
   These numbers represent real people with real health concerns. These numbers represent people who expect Congress to put the health interests of Americans first. 
   Let me address just a few of the basic protections that I believe a managed care system should provide and that, in fact, the Democratic Patient's Bill of Rights includes. 
   We need a managed care health system that does not financially penalize health care professionals who try to provide the best care for their patients. We can no longer permit managed care companies to fire providers who report quality concerns or who speak up on behalf of their patients and assist their patients when their HMO denies care. 
   We need a managed care health system that does not allow HMO's to operate with few providers and long waiting periods for appointments, and that force patients to drive long hours to get needed care, even if there are qualified providers nearby. Where you live in our country should not be reason enough to exclude you from the best medical care available. In a state such as New Mexico this is a critical concern. 
   We need a managed care health system that does not prohibit health plans from excluding non-physician providers such as nurse practitioners, psychologists, and social workers from their networks. Under the Republican bill, patients, especially those in rural and other areas without an adequate supply of physicians, could be left out in the cold. Once again, in the State of New Mexico these are critical concerns. 
   Simply put, we need a managed health care system that puts patient protections first before insurance company profits. 
   Let me also address one other issue. I have heard concerns from some of my Republican colleagues regarding the impact that reforming health insurance might have on small businesses. I too have long been concerned with the effect of federal policy on this part of the business sector. New Mexico relies significantly on the innovation and hard work of the small businessperson and I have consistently worked to protect their interests. But instead of trying to scare small businesses with inadequate information that seemingly threatens their livelihoods as some might do, let's take a look at the facts. 
   In a recent study by the Small Business Alliance and the Kaiser Family Foundation, the overwhelming majority of small businesses would continue to provide health insurance after managed care reform and the majority of these business endorsed key elements of the Democratic Patient's Bill of Rights including real independent appeals, access to speciality care, and direct access to OB/GYN services, as well as the patient's right to hold insurance companies accountable for their decisions. 
   I began my comments asking several fundamental questions about consumer rights. I would like to conclude by encouraging all of my colleagues to consider the issues which I have raised and I look forward to substantive debate on these critical matters that have such a profound effect on the health of this Nation. 
   We have an opportunity to stand up for American families, protect American children and respond to the needs of American workers. I urge all of my colleagues to stand together with the overwhelming majority of the American people and begin a discussion that will ultimately lead to the passage of a meaningful patient's bill of rights for all Americans. The American people have waited long enough.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished colleagues, Senators DORGAN and BYRD, in introducing the Standardized School Report Card Act. This bill would require States and schools to distribute an annual, easy-to-read report card to parents, taxpayers, educators, and the public. One of the top issues facing the nation's education system is the need for greater accountability and the need for greater parent involvement in schools. The bill we are introducing today will go a long way in helping to achieve these goals. 
   In our efforts to make schools accountable for the resources they are given, we must develop better means for measuring and communicating progress in our schools; if we cannot measure progress, we cannot attain it. Our bill would require each school to report several key measures of progress. The bill would require reports of student performance in language arts and mathematics, as well as any other subject areas in which the State requires assessment. The report cards would breakdown student data by gender, major racial and ethnic groups, English proficiency, migrant status, disability status, and economic status. In this way, we can ensure that our schools are meeting the needs of all students and that all students are being taught to the same high standards. I also requested that the bill require reporting of dropout rates, because our educational system needs to do everything possible to keep our children in school until graduation. Many States with report cards do not currently report this measure of educational progress. Obviously, we are not making much progress if our children are giving up prior to graduation. We need to target our efforts to ensure that our children stay in school and an important step in achieving that goal is to monitor and raise awareness of the problem. 
   The report cards required in this bill also would provide parents and taxpayers with valuable information regarding the resources available and environment at each school. Our bill would require schools to report average class sizes and student access to technology, including the number of computers for educational purposes, the number of computers per classroom, and the number of computers connected to the Internet. In addition, schools would be required to report measures of school safety, including the safety of school facilities and incidents of school violence, and measures of parental involvement. Based on this information, parents--as consumers of public education--can make informed decisions about their children's education and monitor how public resources are being used in their community. 
   Last session, I introduced an amendment to the Higher Education Act--which was ultimately passed and signed into law--which requires colleges of education to report their performance in producing qualified teachers. That effort will help to ensure that teachers coming into a school system have been properly prepared to teach. The bill we are introducing today will build on that legislation, by holding states and schools district accountable for the training, level of preparation, and proper placement of new teachers as well as teachers already in the system. Under the Standardized Report Card Act, schools would be required to report the professional qualifications of its teachers, including the number of teachers teaching out of field and the number of teachers with emergency certification. 
   I have spoken with many parents in my home state of New Mexico about their role in the public education system. These parents are eager to support their local schools and participate in their children's education. But in  order to do this, they need to be better informed about how schools are performing and what resources are being devoted to each school. 
   With over $350 billion spent each year on education, parents and taxpayers deserve to know how their schools are performing. We owe it to them and to ourselves to provide public measures of progress which will assist our communities in their efforts to improve our systems of education. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me by supporting the standardized School Report Card Act.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I cosponsored the oil and gas loan guarantee program on the emergency supplemental because I believe this is an important and necessary program to ensure independent producers are able to continue operating in the United States. This program is available only to small producers who do not own refineries of any size. No major oil company is eligible. 
   We are currently importing well over 50 percent of our oil needs. The Energy Information Administration projects that by 2020 we will be importing 65 percent of the oil we consume. The independent oil and gas producers, those companies eligible for this program, have remained committed to domestic production. They are the backbone of our domestic oil supply. They do not import oil, and they do not sell gasoline. Every barrel these independents produce generates jobs, tax and royalty revenues and eliminates another barrel of imports. 
   Oil prices were as low as $7 per barrel in New Mexico a few months ago. Although prices have recovered somewhat, small producers were devastated. In addition to the pending loan guarantee program, I believe we need to implement other policy changes to protect our domestic production. Our tax and royalty policies need to be changed to ensure independent oil and gas producers have enough cash flow so they can avoid shutting in production again when prices fall as low as they were recently. 
   I urge support for this bill.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to state my concern about a provision in the Military Construction Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2000 that the Senate is considering today. I am very concerned about the potential effects of Section 129 of the bill relating to the chemical weapons demilitarization program planned for the Bluegrass Army Depot. 
   My concern, simply stated, is that Section 129 could delay the chemical demilitarization process beyond the deadline for destroying all our chemical weapons under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). This provision, which would levy additional requirements before demilitarization work can begin at the depot, could prevent the United States from complying with its obligations under the CWC. 
   The Administration shares my concern and strongly opposes this provision of S. 1205. In fact, their opposition is stated in the first item listed in the  Statement of Administration Policy regarding this bill. Here's what the Administration has to say about this matter:  
   The Administration strongly opposes Section 129, which would require the demonstration of six alternative technologies to chemical weapons incineration before construction of the Chemical Demilitarization facility at Bluegrass, Kentucky could begin. Prompt construction of the Bluegrass site is critical to ensuring U.S. compliance with the deadline for chemical weapons destruction agreed to under the Chemical Weapons Convention. The Department of Defense has demonstrated three alternative technologies, one more than required by P.L. 104-208, the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997. This provision would delay construction of the Bluegrass site by at least one year, resulting in a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention deadline.  
   The President of the United States signed the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Senate provided its advice and consent to ratification of that treaty. The treaty is now in force and the United States is a party to it, so we are bound by its terms and requirements. I am very disturbed and dismayed that the United States is not in compliance with this treaty, a situation that could worsen if legislation such as contained in Section 129 is enacted into law. 
   I remind my fellow Senators that the United States has still not gathered and declared information regarding U.S. industrial chemical facilities that is required by the treaty. In addition, the U.S. has not complied with treaty provisions governing inspections of military facilities authorizing the use of treaty-approved inspection equipment. Finally, the implementing legislation for the CWC contains provisions that are antithetical to treaty provisions. Should the President exercise the option approved in the implementing legislation to refuse a challenge inspection, such action would directly contravene both the intent and the letter of the treaty that entered into force. I urge my fellow Senators to be aware of these problems and to support efforts to resolve them so that the United States can become compliant with its international treaty obligations and assume the leadership needed in order to make this treaty effective. 
   One of the central requirements of the Chemical Weapons Convention is that parties must destroy their chemical weapons stockpile within 10 years of the date of entry into force of the treaty. That means that the United States must destroy all its chemical weapons by April 29, 2007. I am concerned that Section 129 of this bill would prevent the United States from meeting its legal obligation to destroy all its chemical weapons before this deadline. I believe it would be both unwise and unnecessary to enact legislation that would have the effect of preventing the United States from meeting one of its treaty obligations. 
   To be specific, Section 129 would prevent the obligation or expenditure of any funds made available by the Military Construction Appropriations Act or any other Act for the purpose relating to construction of a facility at Bluegrass Army Depot in Kentucky for demilitarization of chemical weapons until the Secretary of Defense reports to the Congress on the results of evaluating six alternative technologies to the current baseline incineration process for destroying chemical weapons. 
   While this may sound quite reasonable, it poses a problem that I want to highlight. It would effectively delay the chemical demilitarization process at Bluegrass to the point that we would likely not be able to meet the Chemical Weapons Convention. This is because it would add a new requirement to demonstrate and evaluate three additional alternative destruction technologies, and for the Secretary of Defense to report to the Congress on those additional technologies before any demilitarization construction funding could be used at the Bluegrass Depot. 
   There are currently three alternative technologies being considered by the Defense Department under the Assembled Chemical Weapons Assessment (ACWA) program. This program was established in law several years ago, but the law required the Department to evaluate at least two alternative technologies---not six. Section 129 would add the requirement to evaluate four additional technologies which will take additional time and money. That will result in a one-year delay in starting the chemical demilitarization process at Bluegrass which would prevent the U.S. from destroying all the chemical weapons there before the CWC deadline. 
   I note that the Armed Services Committee, of which I am a member, has no provision in the Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2000 that places any restriction on the chemical demilitarization program. In fact, the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, on which I serve as the Ranking Member, included report language that emphasizes the importance of meeting our CWC Treaty obligation to destroy all of our chemical weapons by the treaty deadline. Moreover, the Defense Authorization bill which passed the Senate on May 27, 1999, fully funds the Defense Department's request for funds for the chemical demilitarization program. 
   I do not believe that it is the intent of this provision or of its sponsors to prevent the United States from meeting its treaty obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, or to force the U.S. to violate the treaty. Therefore, I urge my fellow Senators during the forthcoming conference on the Military Construction Appropriations bill to support modifications to Section 129 so that the bill will not have this unintended effect. I'm certain that my colleagues agree that it is essential for the Senate to take all actions necessary to ensure that we uphold our treaty obligations just as we would demand of other states. Modification of Section 129 would constitute such an action.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, renewable energy is a win-win. Renewable technologies such as wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass are domestic and clean. Many renewable applications are especially suited to remote rural locations where construction of electric transmission facilities are prohibitively expensive. The federal government has had a very successful program installing 122 photovoltaic systems in place of diesel generators at remote locations of the National Park Service, Forest Service and BLM. (Chart) These systems produce electric power without any noise or emissions. Photovoltaics are also well-suited for use on remote areas of Indian Reservations. 
   Collaboration between the National Labs and U.S. industry has made huge strides in photovoltaic efficiency and cost-competitiveness. The cost of photovoltaic systems have declined 10 fold since 1980. Ongoing work in system reliability and long-term performance is crucial to continued development of U.S. leadership in this area. The Department of Energy's proposed budget is barely 40% of what Japan and half of what Germany spend on photovoltaic research.  
   Another important technology is concentrating solar power, where the sun's energy is first converted to heat then used to generate electricity in a conventional generator. The federal research program, centered at Sandia, has been a true success. Further work in advanced trough technology and dish based systems, which can be dispatched into the electricity grid, promise to dramatically lower costs. Based on World Bank estimates of capacity installation for these technologies, up to $12 billion in sales of U.S.-manufactured products and up to 13,000 new jobs could be created by U.S. industry by 2010. 
   Since the 1980's the cost of wind power has declined 80% (from 25 cents to 4.5 cents per kilowatt hour.) With the necessary support, the cost of wind will be down to 3 cents per kilowatt hour or lower within five years. This amendment will fund U.S.-based turbine certification, international consensus standards, wind mapping to assist in targeting key areas, and support to industry on solving near term problems. The export opportunities for U.S. industry are large, but the U.S. must compete against the highly subsidized European manufacturers. 
   The opportunities for economic development of geothermal power in the U.S. west are vast. The Department of Energy has an initiative underway to cut the cost of drilling for geothermal resources by 25% within the next two years. Geothermal, especially using non-drinking water sources and treated wastewater, can become an important energy source for arid states. This research with commercial development could result in development of 30,000 jobs in the U.S. and open up significant international marketing opportunities for U.S. manufacturers. 
   The research programs funded by this amendment are making important contributions to the ongoing restructuring of the electric utility industry. For example, many experts believe the future of electric power generation will be in the form of small, so-called ``distributed'' generation technologies. Smaller power plants offer advantages in terms of improved efficiency and reliability as well as reduced environmental impacts. Solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and other generating technologies such as fuel cells and micro-turbines are all likely approaches to distributed generation. The Energy Committee will hold an oversight hearing on distributed generation next week. Finally, research in this bill is also helping assure the continued security and reliability of the nation's high-tension transmission grid. Sandia Labs in New Mexico is a key partner in DOE's transmission research program. 
   I think it is critical to maintain our momentum in renewable energy research. The proposed budget cuts in the bill are unfortunate and unnecessary. I am pleased to support the amendment and I thank Senator JEFFORDS for his efforts.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am aware of the very tight budgetary constraints under which this bill is being considered and I commend the chairman and ranking member for their good, hard work. One concern I have, however, is that the fiscal year 2000 Energy and Water Appropriations bill does not fund the Department of Energy's Scientific Simulation Initiative (SSI). The SSI is not only an integral part of the President's Information Technology Initiative for the 21st Century, but also a key element in the Department's effort to keep the United States at the leading edge of scientific discovery. It is only through scientific modeling on computers 10-100 times more powerful than those now available to civilian scientists that we can address many scientific problems with an enormous potential payoff for the Nation. The SSI will build on DOE's successful history of making leading edge computers available for scientific modeling to provide us with reliable, quantitative and regional information about changes in climate, and help us design more efficient internal combustion engines. It will also help us create more effective drugs and materials, and contribute to our understanding of basic scientific problems in a wide range of disciplines. I hope that, should more funding become available during this year's congressional appropriations process, the Senate will work with the House of Representatives to fully fund this important program.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have been concerned that the extension and improvement of the Troops-to-Teachers program recently authorized in the FY 2000 National Defense Authorization bill, S. 1059, Section 579, might not be funded this year. As my colleagues are well aware, this program will provide excellent assistance to retired military personnel in obtaining teaching credentials to enable them to make the transition from the military to the classroom in an expedited way. Retired military personnel are highly trained professionals, particularly in scientific and technical fields--an area in which the nation's school systems are in dire need of trained professionals. Troops-to-teachers offer stipends to personnel retiring from the military to obtain teaching credentials or vocational instruction certificates needed for primary through secondary schools. It's program by which everyone wins. 
   I am advised that the President's budget requests $18 million in funding for FY 2000 under the jurisdiction of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Since the Defense Authorization bill would extend Department of Defense management over the program until it transfers responsibility to the Department of Education at a date not later than October 1, 2001, it is essential that the funding be maintained during this period of transition.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I do not object to my colleague's amendment to renew the public land withdrawal for the McGregor Range in New Mexico, however, I believe the preferable course of action is to follow the process the Senate agreed to just last month, and allow the Defense and Interior Departments the opportunity to jointly develop a legislative proposal. 
   The McGregor Range in southern New Mexico was one of several military ranges that was last withdrawn for military purposes in 1986 under Public Law 99-606. The withdrawal period for McGregor and the other ranges is for 15 years, and does not expire until November, 2001. 
   Last month, language was included in the Committee-reported version of S. 1059, the DOD Authorization bill, that would have extended public land withdrawals at four of the six military installations covered by Public Law 99-606: the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range in Arizona, the McGregor Range in New Mexico, and Fort Wainwright and Fort Greely in Alaska. During the consideration of the bill on the Senate floor, I offered an amendment which replaced the withdrawal language with a ``sense of the Senate'' statement urging the Administration to submit legislative proposals for these four military withdrawals by July 1. I understand that both the Defense and Interior Departments are currently working on such a legislative proposal and that we still anticipate being able to incorporate legislative language in the conference report for the DOD Authorization bill. 
   With respect to the proposed amendment for the McGregor Range, I want to be clear that I recognize the critical role the range serves for our national defense training needs and I support their continued use for these purposes. In my opinion, however, I think it makes much more sense, and will result in less controversy in the long run, if we allow the normal process for the renewal of the public land withdrawals to be completed. In short, this means allowing the Interior Department the opportunity to review the Army's environmental impact statement, which I understand has only just been completed, and that following that review, the Administration has the opportunity to submit its legislative proposal for our consideration. 
   The McGregor withdrawal encompasses approximately 608,000 acres of land in New Mexico. The renewal of the withdrawal and future uses of the range are of interest not only to the Army, but also to area residents and other public land users. Although the amendment is not clear, I am concerned that it materially changes some of the withdrawal terms from the 1986 Act. 
   For example, the 1986 Act authorized a withdrawal period of 15 years. This amendment provides for a 50-year withdrawal. I understand that the military desires a longer withdrawal period than the current 15 years, and I am not opposed to considering a longer term. But meaningful periodic reviews and environmental analyses serve an important purpose. They provide local communities with an opportunity to raise issues about the way these lands are managed, and they allow us to consider new land management issues which may not have been present when the original withdrawals were made. I think it is a mistake to significantly change this policy without at least the opportunity for public hearings. 
   Another aspect of the amendment that seems to be a significant departure from past management practices is a requirement that the Secretary of the Army manage the withdrawn lands. Under current law, the lands are managed by the Bureau of Land Management for a variety of multiple use purposes, subject to the limitations of the military uses. For example, the 1986 Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to manage the lands in a manner permitting the continuation of grazing, the protection of wildlife and wildlife habitat, the control of predators, recreation, and the suppression of brush fires. 
   This amendment now provides for management by the Army, under the terms of a new agreement to be developed between the Army and the Interior Department, which is to provide for the proper management and protection of natural and cultural resources. It may very well be that such an agreement will adequately provide for other non-military uses and protect sensitive natural and cultural resources. However, there is no requirement that the lands be managed under existing law, including the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The amendment also appears to leave very important land management questions unanswered. For example, the BLM currently manages the Culp Canyon Wilderness Study Area within the McGregor Range, as well as an ``Area of Critical Environmental Concern.'' Under this amendment, is the Army required to manage those areas to the same degree of protection as required of the Secretary of the Interior? Again, at the very least, I think it is important that all interested parties should be heard on these issues before we decide how to proceed. 
   Mr. President, I would like to conclude by again urging the Administration to expeditiously complete its legislative proposal by the end of this month. Although I would prefer to hear  the Administration's proposal, I am committed to seeing that the McGregor range renewal is enacted this year. If, however, a timely proposal is submitted by the Administration, I hope that we will be able to include appropriate legislative language to renew the withdrawal for McGregor and the other affected ranges as part of the conference report for the DOD Authorization bill.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a bill, S. 1093, which I introduced on May 20 of this year for the protection of various historic sites in the Galisteo Basin in my home State of New Mexico. The basin is located in Santa Fe County, NM. As shown on this map--it is very hard for anyone to see this map I understand--this is Santa Fe and the Galisteo Basin is this area south of Santa Fe where the various dots are shown. These dots identify the location of the various historical sites that are talked about in the bill. To understand the importance of these sites, it is important to understand a little history about this basin. 
   When the Spanish Conquistadors arrived in New Mexico in 1598, they found a thriving native pueblo culture with its own unique traditions, its own religion, and its own architecture and art, which was enriched and influenced by an extensive system of trade. The subsequent history of conflict and coexistence between these two cultures--the pueblo Indian culture on the one hand and the Spanish culture--shaped much of the language and the art and cultural world view of the people in my State today. 
   The initial history of cultural interaction in New Mexico encompassed a period of a little over 100 years from 1598 through the pueblo revolt in 1680 and also the period of recolonization by the Spanish in the early 1700s. Among these sites, which are shown on this map and which are discussed in the bill, are examples of both the stone and the adobe architectural styles which typified Native American pueblo communities prior to and during early Spanish colonization, including two of  the largest of these ancient towns, San Marcos and San Lazaro Pueblos. Each of these large towns had thousands of rooms at their peak. 
   Also included in these sites are spectacular examples of Native American petroglyph art, as well as historic missions which were constructed as part of the Spaniards' drive to convert the native populace to Catholicism. The 26 archaeological sites addressed in this bill provide a cohesive picture of this crucial nexus of New Mexican history depicting the culture of the pueblo people and illustrating how it was affected by the Spanish settlers. 
   Through these sites, we have an opportunity to truly understand the simultaneous growth and the coexistence of these two cultures. Unfortunately, this is an opportunity we may soon lose. Most of these sites are currently not part of any preservation program, and through weathering, erosion, vandalism, and amateur excavations, they are losing their ability to be interpreted at a later date. 
   This legislation creates a program under the Department of the Interior to preserve these sites and to provide interpretive research in an integrated manner. While many of these sites are on Federal public land, many are privately owned, and there are a few on State trust lands. The vision behind the legislation is that an integrated preservation program at sites on Federal lands could serve as a foundation for archaeological research that could be augmented with voluntary cooperative agreements with State agencies and with private landowners. These agreements will provide landowners with the opportunity for technical and financial assistance to preserve the sites on their property. Where the parties deem it appropriate, the legislation would also allow for the purchase or exchange of property to acquire these very valuable sites. With such a program, we should be able to preserve the history embodied in these sites for future generations. 
   I add that this legislation is supported by the Cochiti Pueblo, which is culturally and historically tied to these sites. I have received a letter from Isaac Herrera, the Governor of Cochiti Pueblo, expressing his support and that of the tribal council for the legislation. Governor Herrera notes that this tribe has already donated $10,000 to the preservation of one of these sites. So this legislation has the support of the pueblo. It also has the support of our State land commissioner, Ray Powell. 
   I conclude by showing some examples from these magnificent sites. The first two charts are from the Comanche Gap site. They are outstanding examples of petroglyph art, of which we have a lot in our State of New Mexico. These are examples of very intricate work that has been done by the pueblo Indians on the rock formations. 
   The next three charts are of the various pueblo sites. The first is Pueblo Blanco. As you can see, the drywash at the top of this picture and the road at the bottom are the types of erosion threats which I mentioned earlier. 
   The next picture is Arroyo Hondo. Again, you have a drywash at the top. This is probably the most extensively excavated of the various sites. The School of American Research in Santa Fe has done a tremendous amount of work to try to interpret and understand this site. 
   Finally is the Pueblo of Colorado which, once again, shows the threat of erosion from the drywashes above the site. 
   So these are examples of what we are trying to preserve through this legislation. 
   I did have a chance this Saturday--2 days ago--to visit the San Marcos site and saw the damage that is being done there by erosion. I also saw the value of preserving the site to show where the Spanish conquistadors came in and built a church right on a part of that pueblo. Trying to understand the interaction of the two cultures at that site is a very worthwhile endeavor. 
   I also particularly thank Jessica Schultz who has been an intern in my office this past year. She has done yeoman work providing research for the bill and helping to get the bill drafted. 
   I feel strongly that it will be a major contribution if we can pass this legislation and make it law.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me first just say that I have had a chance now to read the amendment. We received it at about 1:15, about 10 minutes into the description of the amendment by the Senator from Arizona. 
   I have had that chance to read it. It is really three separate provisions. I just want to briefly point out that two of them are totally acceptable to this Senator, at least as I see it. 
   The first, of course, would put into statute the provision establishing an Office of Counterintelligence in the Department of Energy. This is something which was done as a result of Presidential Decision Directive 61 in February of 1998. It is something which the previous Secretary of Energy has done administratively. This Secretary has carried through on that. Clearly, this is a good thing to do, and putting it in statutory form is also helpful. 
   So I have no problem with that part of the amendment at all. I would support that. In fact, I point out that those provisions, with very few changes, are in the underlying bill. But I can certainly agree to whatever changes the authors of this amendment would like to see in that section. 
   The second part of the three parts in this bill is establishing the Office of Intelligence. Again, I believe this is totally appropriate. Again, this is something that the administration has already done administratively, but clearly there can be a good argument made that we should put this in statute. I have no problem with that. Again, the underlying bill which we are considering has in it the establishment of the Office of Intelligence. So if this version of that legislative provision has some improvements in it, that certainly is appropriate. I do not oppose that. 
   The third part of the amendment is the part which I find very objectionable. Let me use the rest of my time to just describe the nature of my concern about the rest of it. 
   The third part of the amendment is the part designated ``Nuclear Security Administration.'' This sets up a totally new organizational structure within the Department of Energy which is, as my good friend and colleague from Nevada said, by far the most far-reaching reorganization of the Department of Energy since that Department was created 22 years ago in 1977. 
   The reasons I object to this provision, as it now stands, are several. Let me start by saying that I object to it because of the procedure we followed in getting to where we are today. 
   This is an important proposal. It has far-reaching ramifications. Much of what we do here in the Senate is impacted by the law of unintended consequences, and this is a prime example of something that is going to produce substantial unintended consequences, in my opinion. 
   We have had many studies about the problems in the Department of Energy. Some of those have been very useful. None of those studies have suggested that we solve the problems with this solution. 
   The last time we had a hearing on the problems of organization in the Department of Energy was in September of 1996. That was nearly 3 years ago. I sit on the committee, as does my colleague from New Mexico, as do many of us involved in this discussion, I sit on the committee that has jurisdiction over this Department, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. In that committee, we have had a great many hearings on the Chinese espionage problem. We have had six hearings in that committee alone. We have had one joint hearing with the Armed Services Committee, which I also sit on. That is seven hearings. 
   In none of those hearings have we considered any of this set of recommendations. In none of those hearings have we asked the Secretary of Energy to come forward and explain what changes he thinks might be appropriate or whether or not these kinds of proposals might be appropriate as a way to fix the problem. 
   My friend, the Senator from Arizona, said it would be a derogation of our duty if we didn't go ahead and pass this this afternoon. I say it is almost a derogation of our duty if we do pass it this afternoon, because we will not have given the administration a chance to react. We will not have given the administration a chance to explain why they oppose this. I think that is the only reasonable course to follow. 
   Another suggestion was made by my colleague from Arizona that although Secretary Richardson had objected to an earlier draft, he was fairly confident that those problems had been resolved in the latest bill, which is the one we received at 1:15.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. So procedurally, we should not be here on a Thursday afternoon, where the very distinguished manager of the bill, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, has said we need to finish this bill in the next hour and a half. We need to leave town. Everyone has their plane reservations. We have to fly out. And by the way, before we leave, let's reorganize the Department of Energy. 
   This is not a responsible way for us to proceed. Accordingly, I do object to the procedure. 
   Let me talk about the substance. My friend from Arizona, who is a prime sponsor on the bill, described the bill fairly accurately when he said, this bill, this provision, the third part of the amendment that I have said is objectionable, the establishment of this Nuclear Security Administration, says this bill creates a stovepipe. That is his exact quote. I agree that that is what happens. 
   Let me use this chart beside me here to describe very briefly how the Department of Energy functions now. 
   The Secretary of Energy is in charge of the Department of Energy. There are, under the Secretary, various subdepartments. We have defense programs. We have environmental management, energy efficiency, nuclear nonproliferation, fossil energy and science. 
   With regard to each of those, the Secretary has established--and much of this has been done by Secretary Richardson in the 6 months he has been there--some crosscutting responsibilities. Some people with crosscutting responsibilities are directly answerable to the Secretary. One is the director of counterintelligence. This was a major step forward, and I think everybody who sat through these hearings would acknowledge that this was a major step forward. This was one of the actions that was taken, really, by Secretary Richardson's predecessor, when Ed Curran, who is the gentleman who has been put in the Office of Director of Counterintelligence, was hired. This was in April of 1998. 
   That individual, the director of counterintelligence, under the administrative procedure now in place, and under the provisions of this bill, has crosscutting responsibility for counterintelligence in each of the parts of the Department of Energy; in fact, in each laboratory. Mr. Curran has testified to various of the committees up here that he will have a person who is responsible to him and who has authority by virtue of his position to demand certain actions on the issue of counterintelligence in each of our National Laboratories. That is as it should be. That is putting accountability into the counterintelligence system. It is a good step forward. That is a step in the right direction. 
   A second crosscutting responsibility is the security czar on security policy. A third is this independent Safety and Security Oversight Office that Secretary Richardson has established. 
   So at the present time there are those three entities that report directly to the Secretary of Energy on these issues related to security. 
   These are the reforms that Secretary Richardson has been trying to put into place. These are the reforms that are called for under Presidential Decision Directive-61, and then additional administrative steps that have been taken by this Secretary of Energy. I believe the system is structured in a way that makes some sense. 
   Let me now show the stovepipe organizational chart, because we have one of those as well. This, as Senator KYL indicated, is a major change, this third part; the establishment of this Nuclear Security Administration is a major change in the way the Department operates. 
   What essentially is done is you eliminate the defense programs portion of the Department of Energy and you rename that the ``Nuclear Security Administration.'' You put that in the so-called stovepipe. You say there will be no independent counterintelligence authority over how that agency functions. There will be no independent security oversight over how that agency, that independent agency or administration functions. There will be no environmental oversight, through the Department, on that. And there will be no oversight regarding health and safety factors relating to workers. 
   Under that we put all of the facilities that relate to nuclear weapons. One reason why I am particularly concerned, frankly, about this, is that the two National Laboratories in my State would be in this stovepipe. I do not know that that is good for them long term. I have great doubts that that is good for them long term. I really do have doubts as to whether that is a wise course for us to follow. 
   One problem--and I think the Senator from Nevada referred to this--is that under this new arrangement, it makes it very clear with very specific language here; it says the administrator of this new stovepipe agency, who shall report directly to and shall be accountable directly to the Secretary, ``the secretary may not delegate to any department official the duty to supervise the administrator.'' 
   Presumably, what that means is that Secretary Richardson could not ask his Under Secretary, in this case Dr. Moniz, to take on any of the responsibility for supervising what is going on in this so-called stovepipe agency. 
   Regardless of the experience or the qualifications of Secretary Moniz, or any other Under Secretary, Secretary Richardson would have to personally exercise that oversight, or it would not be exercised. That is clearly not a good management arrangement. 
   This stovepipe agency, as it is contemplated in this Nuclear Security Administration, eliminates the ability of the Secretary of the Interior to integrate important work on nuclear weapons with other important scientific work going on in the Department of Energy. 
   I believe very strongly that our laboratories and our nuclear weapons program are strengthened by the interaction that scientists and engineers in that nuclear weapons program have with other scientists and other engineers working elsewhere in the Department of Energy. That would be stopped. That would be much more difficult under this kind of a stovepipe arrangement. There is no prohibition  against it happening here, but it is very clear that the head of this Nuclear Security Administration has all authority, and exclusive authority, for what goes on in his department, and there is very little incentive for anyone else to try to put work in those laboratories or interact necessarily with those laboratories on nonnuclear weapons activity. 
   As a result of this, I fear very much--and I know my good friend and colleague from New Mexico, Senator DOMENICI, who is a cosponsor of this amendment, says he believes that something like this amendment should be adopted by the Senate because it will keep the Congress, ultimately, after we conference with the House, from going even further and taking a step toward shifting some of this nuclear weapons responsibility to the Department of Defense. 
   My fear is somewhat different. My fear is that this is a first and sort of a logical step toward going in that direction, and that if you are going to set up all of this nuclear weapons activity in a stovepipe and it is going to be cordoned off from the rest of the Department of Energy, as is proposed in this bill, I think it is very easy to go from that point to the point of saying let's just cut this loose entirely from the Secretary of Energy and make it responsible to the Secretary of Defense. 
   I think that would be a serious mistake. That is a mistake that our predecessors had the wisdom to avoid. President Truman had the wisdom to avoid that. Those who set up the nuclear weapons program in this country decided early on that it should be in a civilian agency, it should not be in a Department of Defense agency; and, clearly, the closer we move toward making this defense-specific, defense-only, I think we would be making a mistake. 
   Creating the stovepipe, in my view, does threaten the long-term vitality of our laboratories. I believe it threatens the long-term ability to attract people we need to these laboratories, to keep them world-class, cutting-edge scientific institutions. 
   I may be overdramatizing, but my own view is that we have seen the stovepipe model in action. Two years ago, I went to the Soviet Union and visited Chelyabinsk-70, also referred to as Shnezinsk. Shnezinsk is one of the nuclear cities, one of the secret cities. When you go there, you see how stovepipe organizations function. There is nobody there doing any research on solar energy. There is nobody there worrying about environmental problems that might be a result of research or work going on at that facility. There is nobody there 
   interacting with much of anyone. 
   That is one of the big problems. That is why we have the nuclear cities initiative in this bill that we are trying to get going, to help these laboratories in Russia break out of the stovepipe and begin to interact with other elements in the society, with other scientists, and begin to apply their talents to other activities. 
   So I am sure this is well intentioned. I am sure this proposal is well intentioned, and I would like very much to have some hearings and bring in some experts to tell us what they think of this and allow the administration to give us their point of view. I think that is an appropriate course for us to follow. But my initial reaction, after reading it here for the last hour and a half, or 2 hours that I have had this, is that it does not do what the sponsors intend. It does not solve the problem of Chinese espionage. It does create or result in many other unintended consequences that will be long-term adverse to our nuclear weapons program. 
   Mr. President, I have great problems about it. I have a series of questions I was going to raise about it. I see my colleague from New Mexico wishing to speak. Maybe he would like to speak and I could ask him a few questions about this. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I do not know if the other proponents of the amendment want to speak at this time. I gather they do not since they are not on the floor, so I will take a very few minutes of our time and make a few moments. 
   First of all, I think this is a good result we have come up with that allows for a reasoned and deliberate consideration of this proposal. I certainly repeat what I said earlier today, which is, I question nobody's motives. I am sure everyone's motives are the same as mine, and that is, how do we improve the security of our nuclear weapons program and, at the same time, maintain the good things about our nuclear weapons program in our National Laboratories in our Department of Energy. 
   I, for one, started this from the proposition that the Stockpile Stewardship Program, which is the program that is essentially responsible for maintaining  our nuclear deterrent, has been a success. That is my strong impression, and the suggestion that it has been fettered and burdened--I believe that is the language that was used--by other activities in the Department, I do not believe is true. 
   My strong impression is that the Stockpile Stewardship Program is alive and well, that our nuclear deterrent is secure and reliable, and that in fact there is a lot we can point to with pride in that regard. Clearly, there have been security lapses. Clearly, classified information has been stolen, and we need to put in place safeguards against that ever recurring. I favor that, and I believe we have some strong provisions in this underlying bill which will accomplish that and will move us in the direction of accomplishing that. 
   Maybe there should be more. I am not totally averse to considering reorganization in parts of the Department of Energy. That may be a very constructive suggestion for us to look into. But I do believe that the way to do it is through hearings. 
   Hopefully, we can have hearings in the Armed Services Committee. This is the appropriate committee, I believe. I serve on that committee. Perhaps Senator WARNER can schedule some hearings as early as the week after next when we return, if there is a sense of urgency, and I share a sense of urgency about doing all that is constructive to do. 
   I am not in any way arguing that we should not look into this issue. I believe if we have hearings, we should give the Secretary of Energy the chance to testify. I do believe that if we are going to embark upon a major reorganization of the Department of Energy, the logical thing to do is to ask the Secretary of Energy his reaction to our proposed reorganization. That is the kind of responsible, deliberate action that our constituents expect of us. That is what the Secretary of Energy has a right to expect. That is what the President expects. I hope that is the course we follow. 
   I will briefly respond to the point my colleague, Senator DOMENICI, made about a 1990 report by the Clark task force. I am not personally familiar with that report, but I point out to my colleagues that in 1990 the Secretary of Energy was Admiral Watkins. That was not a Democratic administration; that was a Republican administration. Admiral Watkins was a very, very qualified individual to be our Secretary of Energy. His credentials for line management and command and control and maintaining military security cannot be questioned. 
   Admiral Watkins, of course, evidently did not think the recommendations from that Clark task force alluded to should be followed up and implemented, and did not do that. There have been a lot of capable people in the Department of Energy, some in the position of Secretary, who have spent substantial time looking at this problem. They have made some improvements. Perhaps more are needed, and I certainly will embrace additional improvements if that is the case. 
   I do, once again, make the point I made earlier today, and that is that we do not want to do something that has not been thoroughly discussed, has not been thoroughly analyzed, and which can have very, very adverse consequences, unintended adverse consequences, on the strength of our National Laboratories, on our ability to retain, to maintain, and to recruit the top scientists and engineers in this country to work on these programs and to work in these laboratories. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time to see if other of my colleagues wish to speak on this issue as well.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me respond to a few of the points that have been made. Then I will yield, because I know the Senator from Arizona, who is the prime sponsor on the amendment, is here and wishes to speak. 
   The suggestion that we are leaving without knowing anything about security in our National Laboratories in the Department of Energy is just wrong. 
   I am on the Armed Services Committee. I participated in the drafting of the language that is included in this bill. We have 24 pages in the defense authorization bill which is the best--the best--we could come up with in the Armed Services Committee to deal with this problem of security and put in place more safeguards. 
   We start on page 540, establishing a Commission on Safeguards, Security, and Counterintelligence at Department of Energy Facilities. 
   We go on; that commission is established. We move on to increase the background investigations of certain personnel at the Department of Energy facilities. We move on to requiring a plan for polygraph examinations of certain personnel at the Department of Energy facilities. We then go on to establish civil monetary penalties for violations of the Department of Energy regulations related to safeguarding and security of restricted data. 
   We have a moratorium on lab-to-lab and foreign visitors and assignment programs unless there is a certification made by the head of the FBI, the head of the CIA, the Secretary of Energy himself as to the fact that safeguards are in place. 
   We increase penalties for misuse of restricted data. We establish the Office of Counterintelligence in statute, which is essentially a third of the amendment that the Senator from Arizona is proposing. So two of the three parts of the amendment the Senator from Arizona and my colleague from New Mexico are proposing are included in this amendment. 
   It is just not accurate to say we are leaving here without having done anything. We also provide for increased protection for whistle-blowers in the Department. We provide for investigation and remediation of alleged reprisals for disclosure of certain information to Congress. We provide for notification to Congress of certain security and counterintelligence failures at the Department of Energy facilities. All of these provisions are in the bill the way it now reads. 
   I say again what I said before: Maybe there should be more. I hope very much we will have some hearings in the Armed Services Committee, perhaps on the Energy Committee. I know my colleague from Alaska, the chairman of  the Energy Committee, expressed his great concern that we are not moving ahead this afternoon on this. Since we have already had seven hearings on this China espionage issue, we should go ahead and have an eighth hearing, hopefully the week after next, and we should look at this proposal or similar proposals to see what can be done. 
   One other minor item: There has been reference made to the failure to implement the recommendations that Charles Curtis, our former Under Secretary, made with regard to security. I agree, this was a failing. The information was not properly passed from one group of appointed officials to the next group of appointed officials when they came into office. That is a very unfortunate lapse. Under this amendment, Secretary Curtis would have been stripped of any authority over the nuclear weapons program. It would be prohibited for the Secretary of Energy to allow the Under Secretary any authority over that program under this proposal. 
   One of our outstanding Secretaries of Energy, since I have been serving in the Senate, has been Secretary Watkins. He is known for his attention to the detail of management and administration. During the time he was Secretary of Energy, he issued a great many management directives or ``notices,'' as he called them. I have here a notebook containing 37 of these management directives that Secretary Watkins issued. They are all related to the organization and management of the Department of Energy. None of them contain the provisions or anything like the provisions that are contained in here. 
   I hope when we have hearings in the Armed Services Committee, in the Energy Committee, in whatever committee the 
   majority would like to hold hearings, let's call Secretary Watkins, Admiral Watkins, to come and explain to us his view of this proposal. Surely we cannot question his commitment to dealing with safeguards and security and with the problem of Chinese espionage. If some of my colleagues want to imply that Members on the Democratic side are less than concerned, let us call Secretary Watkins and see whether he is less than concerned about some of these issues. 
   I am persuaded that he is very concerned. I am persuaded that all of my colleagues in the Senate, Democrat and Republican, are very concerned. We need to do the right thing. We need to be sure that whatever we legislate helps, rather than hinders, our ability to deal with this problem. 
   I yield the floor at this point and reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I agree that there was substantial bungling by various officials and, clearly, that computer should have been investigated. Maybe we ought to have an amendment out here to reorganize the FBI. Maybe that is the solution to this problem, and we can consider it tonight before we leave town. Clearly, there is no disagreement between Democrats and Republicans about the fact that serious problems exist and they need correcting. 
   The question is, Should we do a major reorganization of the Department of Energy with no hearings, no opportunity for the Secretary of Energy to come forward, and do so here as everyone is trying to rush out to National Airport and fly home? In my view, that is clearly not the responsible way to proceed. Accordingly, we did object to that portion of the amendment. I think that is the right thing to do. After hearings, after consideration and meaningful discussion with the Department and with other experts about how to proceed, we may well find some ways to improve that Department through changes in its organization. If we do find those, I will certainly be the first to support such a proposal. But I do think it is appropriate for us, at this stage, to stay with what we know will help and continue to look for other ways to help in the weeks and days ahead. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me make some comments, and then I will be prepared to yield the remainder of our time. Perhaps I will not be able to with my colleague from Nevada here.  
   But let me just make a few comments at least, and then return the remainder of the time over to him for any comments he has. 
   I think that trying to characterize this problem which exists in our Department of Energy and in our National Laboratories as this ``administration's problem'' rather than all of our problem is just a rewriting of history. 
   I have a list that, once I have completed my statement, I will offer or ask unanimous consent to add to the RECORD. It is called ``Security Concerns at America's Nuclear Facilities,'' excerpts from GAO Reports, 1980 through 1993. 
   When you go through this and look at just the titles of these reports, you see that the problems we are debating--the problems of adequate safeguards for nuclear secrets, and for these facilities--have been with us a long time--long before I ever came to the Senate. 
   From a GAO report, March of 1980: Adequate safeguards to prevent the theft or diversion of weapons usable material from commercial nuclear fuel reprocessing plants have not yet been deployed. 
   May, 1986: DOE has insufficient control over nuclear technology exports. 
   March of 1987: DOE reinvestigation of employees has not been timely. 
   August of 1987: Department of Energy needs tighter controls over reprocessing information. 
   December of 1987: DOE needs a more accurate and efficient security clearance program. 
   June of 1989: Better controls needed over weapons-related information and technology. 
   These are the titles of GAO reports. These are all GAO reports that were issued in the 1980s before this administration ever came to town, before this administration was ever heard of. 
   To try to say this is a problem that this administration created and that now, this afternoon, we have to get this problem solved because otherwise we would be in derogation of our duty, I think is just clearly wrong. 
   There are significant improvements in security and safeguards of secure information and classified information in this bill and there are additional safeguards put in place in the Lott amendment which we all agree to. 
   I was at the Armed Services Committee markup. I can say without qualification that the Democrats did not object to the provisions that were offered and that are now included in this bill. I believe that we Democrats--and I was one of them in that committee markup--substantially improved the provisions which wound up in the final bill. I think we worked with the majority, we tried very hard to be constructive and to come up with proposals that were workable and that were effective in improving security. I think we have done that. 
   I look forward to going through the very same process on this question of reorganization of the Department of Energy. We should consider the provisions in this amendment which relate to reorganization of the Department of Energy and we should do so with hearings. We can have them as soon as the week after next. I am happy to stay next week and have them, if the Senator is suggesting we are trying to leave town without doing our duty to the country. I am happy to have them next week in the committees I serve on. If the Energy Committee and the Armed Services Committee schedule hearings next week, I will be there and I will do all I can to help make whatever legislative provisions we propose out of those committees be constructive and effective in improving the security of our National Laboratories and our Department of Energy, generally, and improving the organization of that Department. 
   It is highly improper, in my view, to try to legislate something here without allowing the Secretary of Energy to testify, without allowing him to give his input into it, and without looking at how other Secretaries of Energy feel about some of these major, far-reaching changes as well. 
   We should do this right. We should do it quickly. We should take whatever action we determine makes sense for the country's good, and we should not play politics with this issue. This is not a Democrat or Republican issue. We are all very concerned about our national security. We are all anxious to do the right thing--Secretary Richardson as much as anyone in this body, and we need to ask his advice. We need to talk to all the experts we can find. I hope we can come up with some good solutions here. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment that promises to extend to the Nation's veterans an improved, more accessible way to submit and process claims for benefits and other services. Recently, in my state of New Mexico, complaints about processing claims for veterans benefits reached high volume. Billboards appeared around the city of Albuquerque that the Albuquerque regional office of the Veterans Administration was the ``worst VA office in the country.'' I was very concerned about those charges and looked into the situation. Information provided by the Albuquerque office essentially confirmed the accusations I read on the billboard. Statistics show that the system is broken and needs fixing. Compensation for completed claims in New Mexico takes 301.6 days on average; the nationwide average is 192.9 days. Pension compensation claims average 149.9 days in Albuquerque versus 108.8 days nationwide. ``Cases Pending Over 180 Days'' in Albuquerque are about 31 percent of the total. Nationwide, only about 22 percent fall into that category. 
   The system appears to be broken and the situation is ripe for creative new ways to solve our beleaguered veterans' problems. 
   I recently received a briefing that I thought might go a long way to serving veterans' needs, particularly in rural States such as New Mexico. The proposal suggested that veterans be permitted to use National Guard armories and communications infrastructure to receive counsel on a wide range of veterans problems and programs. As you are aware, National Guard armories are typically used during weekends for exercises and training, but often are underutilized during the week. The proposal suggested that the National Guard and the Veterans Administration coordinate ideas and concerns into a program which could take advantage of the considerable resources already in place at the armories. The wide dispersion or armories, particularly among rural communities, would provide a considerably more convenient venue for receiving veterans services than the long commute to major metropolitan areas such as Albuquerque that is now required. 
   My amendment requires the National Guard in consultation with the Veterans Administration to examine this idea, and to report their findings regarding costs and benefits to the Secretary of Defense, who, having reviewed the report, would submit it and any additional findings to the Congress. I am optimistic that the analysis will show that investing resources in this project would pay major dividends to the veterans community which is experiencing considerable difficulty in settling benefit claims under the current process. 
   I am pleased to introduce this idea to my fellow Senators and appreciate its acceptance as an agreed amendment in this year's defense bill.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. I have been pleased to support the BQM-74. This target drone plays an important role in Navy air-to-air and surface warfare training, representing enemy fighters, bombers, and cruise missiles during live-fire training operations. The Chief of Naval Operations has a requirement that at least 240 of these drones be kept in the active inventory. We have maintained this number in the past, and I hope that the Navy will be able to continue to do so.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. As my colleagues may be aware, the Navy had allocated 435 million for procurement of 135 BQM-74 drones in fiscal year 2000. This funding was zeroed out by the Office of the Secretary of Defense prior to submission of the budget request to Congress.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to clarify a provision, section 3136(b), of the National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2000, concerning the Nuclear Cities Initiative (NCI). The Nuclear Cities Initiative is a Department of Energy cooperative effort with Russia to assist Russia in downsizing its nuclear weapons complex. The report accompanying the Defense Bill, Senate Report 106-50, states that Russia has not agreed to close or dismantle weapons-related facilities at the nuclear complexes receiving U.S. technical and financial assistance. As a result, Section 3136 of the Defense Authorization bill contains a provision the would prohibit the obligation or expenditure of funding until the Secretary of Energy certifies to the Congress that Russia has agreed to close some of its facilities engaged in work on weapons of mass destruction. 
   Because of several past interpretations by the Department of Defense of the wording similar to that in section 3136(b), I believe that the wording of this provision would effectively prevent the implementation of the Nuclear Cities Initiative. 
   While I share the goal of Senator ROBERTS, to ensure that the Russian weapons complex is downsized, I am concerned that the specific certification is unachievable. Russia has publicly committed to shut down or downsize some of its nuclear weapons complexes or related facilities. Even if the certification is achievable, the logistics of the required certification process could delay the program for a very long time. 
   The Nuclear Cities program is just getting started, but has already made some real progress. To stop the funding in fiscal year 2000, particularly since Russian officials have already announced their intent to close some facilities seems to me to be counterproductive. If funding were suspended, program activities would be halted and the cooperative program itself placed in jeopardy. Given the shared concerns that Senator ROBERTS and I have with respect to prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons technology and information, I would like to ask my esteemed colleague whether that is the intent behind this provision in the bill.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate a truly historic event that took place in my state of New Mexico last Saturday--the nation's largest act of Native American repatriation. The ``Jemez-Pecos Repatriation'' resulted in the reburial of nearly 2,000 human remains and artifacts unearthed from what should have been their final resting place over 70 years ago. 
   On the Wednesday before the reburial, over 300 people started the 120 mile walk from Jemez Pueblo in northern New Mexico to the ruins of the Pecos Pueblo. The journey is a long one in the dry New Mexico sun. The group, both young and old, traveled across three counties and through the beautiful Jemez Mountains before arriving at the former site of the Pecos Pueblo. But the journey of their ancestors is much more remarkable. 
   Prior to the 1820's, the Pueblo was a thriving community and center for trade. The Pecos interacted extensively with the Plains Indians to the east, the neighboring Pueblos to the west and the nearby Spanish communities. However, years of disease and warfare eventually decimated the population. In 1838, the remaining residents of Pecos Pueblo relocated to the Pueblo of Jemez, in order to protect their traditional leaders, sacred objects and culture. This decision reflects the fact that Jemez and Pecos cultures were intricately linked by blood, language and spiritual beliefs as well as through their ``origin stories''. In 1936, Congress formally merged the two tribes into one, with the Pueblo of Jemez named as the legal representative of the Pecos culture and administrative matters. 
   When the Pecos Pueblo was abandoned in 1838, it likely did not occur to the few surviving members of the Pecos that their burial site would be disturbed during the next century. However, the famed archaeologist Alfred V. Kidder unearthed the remains and artifacts during ten excavations between 1915 and 1929. The remains were housed at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology in Cambridge,  Massachusetts and the artifacts were held at the Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. On May 18, 1999, Harvard University turned over the human remains and artifacts of nearly 2,000 people formerly buried at the Pecos Pueblo to the Pueblo of Jemez. 
   Last Saturday, in a solemn private ceremony, the thousands of human remains and artifacts were reburied in the Pecos National Historical Park in a grave that was 6 feet deep, 600 feet long and 10 feet wide. The current burial site is near the former Pecos Pueblo. 
   The historical event last Saturday reflects the close relationship of the Jemez and Pecos people and the strong commitment the Pueblo of Jemez has to the beliefs of their ancestors. Some of the remains and artifacts that were reburied date back to the 12th century. 
   With the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act in 1990, the current members of the Pueblo of Jemez were able to fulfill the dreams of many of their ancestors who longed to have the remains of their people returned to their homeland. NAGPRA was drafted to protect burial sites on tribal and federal land and to enable tribes to obtain the return of human remains and associated funery objects to the culturally affiliated tribes. 
   I commend the Pueblo of Jemez, and particularly the Governor, Raymond Gachupin, and the many governors before him, who worked tirelessly to get to this day of repatriation. It took eight years of negotiations and persistence to achieve the final goal of repatriation. In a private tribal ceremony on May 22, 1999, the remains and artifacts of the Pecos ancestors were returned to their rightful place. Many people would be angry or resentful if their ancestors were unearthed and relocated. But for the descendants of the Pueblos of Jemez and Pecos, May 22, 1999 was looked upon as a day of unity and healing. By focusing on the future, the descendants truly honored their ancestors. I understand that at the end of the ceremony, the New Mexico sky turned dark and the rain began to fall. Mr. President, rain in May is not a common occurrence in New Mexico, but neither is the repatriation of 2,000 Native Americans. I want to convey my respect and admiration to the members of the Pueblo of Jemez, past and present, for their commitment and dedication to the Jemez-Pecos Repatriation.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill designed to provide for the protection of various historical sites in the Galisteo Basin. The Basin is located in and around Santa Fe County, New Mexico, as depicted by this map. (See, map) To understand the importance of these sites, it's important to understand the history of this Basin. 
   Mr. President, when the Spanish Conquistadores arrived in New Mexico in 1598, they found a thriving native Pueblo culture with its own unique traditions of religion, architecture, and art, which was enriched and influenced by an extensive system of trade. The subsequent history of conflict and coexistence between these two cultures, Pueblo Indian and Spanish, shaped much of the language, art, and cultural worldview of New Mexicans today. 
   That initial history of cultural interaction in New Mexico encompassed a period of a little over one hundred years from the 1598, through the Pueblo revolt in 1680, and the recolonization by the Spanish in the early 1700s. Among these sites are examples of both the stone and adobe pueblo architectural styles which typified Native American pueblo communities prior to and during early Spanish colonization, including two of the largest of these ancient towns, San Marcos and San Lazaro Pueblos, which each had thousands of rooms at their peak. Also included in these sites are spectacular examples of Native American petroglyph art as well as historic missions which were constructed as part of the Spaniards' drive to convert the native populace to Catholicism. The twenty six archeological sites addressed in this bill provide cohesive picture of this crucial nexus in New Mexican history, depicting the culture of the pueblo people, and illustrating how it was affected by the Spanish settlers . 
   Mr. President, through these sites, we have an opportunity to truly understand the simultaneous growth and the coexistence of these two cultures. Unfortunately, this is an opportunity we may soon lose. Most of these sites are not currently part of any preservation program and through weathering, erosion, vandalism, and amateur excavations are losing their interpretive value. 
   This legislation creates a program under the Department of the Interior to preserve these sites, and to provide interpretive research in an integrated manner. While many of these sites are on federal public land, many are privately owned and a few are on state trust lands. The vision behind this legislation is that an integrated preservation program at sites on Federal lands could serve as a foundation for archaeological research that could be augmented with voluntary cooperative agreements with state agencies and private land owners. These agreements would provide landowners with the opportunity for technical and financial assistance to preserve the sites on their property. Where the parties deem  it appropriate, the legislation would also allow for the purchase or exchange of property to acquire these very valuable sites. With such a program in place, we should be able to preserve the history embodied in these sites for future generations. 
   Mr. President, I would also like to add that this legislation is supported by Cochiti Pueblo which is culturally and historically tied to these sites. I have received a letter from Isaac Herrera , the Governor of Cochiti Pueblo expressing his support and that of the tribal council. Governor Herrera notes that the tribe has already donated $10,000 to the preservation of one of these sites. This legislation is also supported by the State Land Commissioner. 
   Let me conclude by showing you some examples of these magnificent sites. These first 2 charts are from the Comanche Gap site, they are outstanding examples of petroglyph art. The next three charts I have show three of the various pueblo sites. The first, Pueblo Blanco. As you can see the drywash at the top of the picture and the road at the bottom, these are the types of erosion threats which I mentioned earlier. The next picture is Arroyo Hondo. Again, you have a drywash at the top, a major road along the site, and development around the site, which shows the threats posed. Finally is the Pueblo of Colorado, once again showing the threat of erosion from the drywashes above. 
   Mr. President, I want to especially thank Jessica Schultz who has been an intern in my office this past year, and has done yeoman work in providing research for this bill and in helping to draft it.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, at the request of the administration, I am today joining with my good friend Senator MURKOWSKI, the Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, to introduce the president's electricity restructuring legislation. 
   The administration has presented Congress a fully comprehensive set of legislative proposals. For the first time we have detailed provisions on every major issue affecting the electricity industry as it moves into the new world of competition. Significantly, the president's comprehensive proposals include a framework for the transition of the Bonneville Power Administration and the Tennessee Valley Authority into the new competitive arena. 
   In considering the administration's proposals, Congress should look to areas that complement the states' ongoing restructuring activities, while leaving the key decisions on retail competition to state and local authorities. Let me mention three areas for federal concern. First, I believe Congress should remove federal impediments to states that chose to implement retail competition. Second, we should take steps to improve the regulation of interstate transmission and assure the continued security and reliability of the nation's grid. And third, Congress should ensure that fair competition can operate at both the wholesale and retail levels. These are the issues that only Congress can address. 
   Mr. President, Congress should not dwell any longer on whether retail competition is good or bad, or whether or not it will benefit all consumers--the states are already making these decisions. It should be clear to all senators that retail competition for electric power generation is quickly becoming a reality. Nearly half of the states have now enacted restructuring legislation. Last month, New Mexico enacted restructuring legislation that will soon bring retail competition in electricity to my state. 
   The consensus is growing on the need for federal legislation focused narrowly on wholesale transactions, interstate transmission, and reliability. Mr. President, this is not a simple question of ``de-regulation'' versus ``re-regulation;'' this is about keeping America's high-tension grid system secure, reliable, and economical. The federal role in regulating interstate commerce in electric power is clear. I hope we will move forward soon to resolve, at a minimum, the critical federal issues. 
   Rather than commenting here on the pros and cons of any particular provision in the president's bill, I will wait until the administration has a fair opportunity to explain the bill to the Energy Committee in a legislative hearing. I know the committee already has a very full plate, but I hope the Chairman will find time to hold a hearing soon on this important topic. 
   Mr. President, Congress still has time to pass vital federal electricity legislation, but we've got to get the process underway promptly. I hope the administration's proposals will help fuel interest in the Senate. Today America has the world's best electric power system. Let's not wait until serious problems develop to begin making the needed changes in federal regulation. Electricity is too important to the nation to leave critical federal issues unresolved.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my co-sponsors, Senators DOMENICI, LIEBERMAN, FRIST, and SNOWE in introducing the Private Sector Research and Development Investment Act of 1999. This bill will finally make the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit permanent, a provision of the federal tax code that was first enacted in 1981, and has been extended 9 times since. 
   In addition to the provision of permanence, our bill has other improvements that I believe will address many of the shortcomings of existing law, and will bring the code more in synch with the ways industry is performing R&D today. But before I speak to some of those provisions, I would like to spend a little time discussing why I think we need to enact this legislation now. 
   I think it is fair to say that the nation's economy owes much of its resurgence to the increases in productivity attributable to the infusion of high technology products and services. Our nation is today in the enviable position of not only having the greatest access to these products, but also being the primary provider of these products for the rest of the world. 
   These capabilities have enabled American businesses to be in a position of world leadership in areas as diverse as medical and bio technologies, microelectronics, and financial services. 
   In order for us to insure that the economic engine continues to run at peak form, we must assure that there is a continual infusion of new technologies  that will spawn the products and services of the future market. Many economists state that the best way to do this is to create a stable incentive for research investment and an environment where businesses have the flexibility to choose among all the options available to perform the research. A policy which achieves these goals will provide businesses with the long-term incentive to invest in both the research and the people that will create the next generation of commercially successful products. 
   That is exactly what the ``Private Sector Research and Development Investment Act of 1999'' does. First, it makes Section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code permanent, creating a stable long-term environment for investment. But it goes beyond that. 
   Present law does not allow all companies to benefit equally from the Tax Credit. Some companies, simply as a result of where they were in the business cycle in the late 80's, find that they cannot attain the full benefit of the credit. And, if the company did not exist at all in the 80's, as is the case with most of the Internet and many of the biotech start-up firms, there is simply no way at all for them to access the full credit rate. This is simply not fair. Our bill proposes to correct that inequity by making the 20% marginal rate available to all companies that are growing their research investment. 
   With much of the nation's research talent residing in our universities and federal laboratories, we are proposing to extend the full Tax Credit for research investments companies make in those institutions. 
   I am particularly pleased with the part of this 
   provision that provides a more cost effective way for companies to invest in the education of our future generation of scientists and engineers at our universities. If this bill becomes law, as many as 3000 additional masters and doctoral level engineers and scientists could be produced each year, with up to 1000 of these being women and minorities, all at no additional cost to businesses. 
   I fully expect that the ``Private Sector Research and Development Investment Act of 1999'' will accelerate business investment in universities, growing the number of trained scientists and engineers even faster. At a time when there has been much debate over providing additional employment visas to foreign engineers, this bill provides one mechanism for educating qualified Americans to fill these high tech jobs. 
   As the cost of doing research continues to escalate, and companies find it more difficult to go it alone, our bill proposes that the research investments companies make in research consortia with other businesses, universities, and federal laboratories be fully available for the Tax Credit. I have seen firsthand, at places like Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories, the results of consortia partnerships between industry and our national labs, and I believe that it is in our nation's best interest to promote these research arrangements. 
   All of our studies indicate that small businesses are the ``high test'' fuel of the nation's economy, producing more and highly paid jobs. Yet it is this group of companies that have the hardest time in accessing the Tax Credit under existing law. We propose to modify the law so that small businesses have greater benefit in their early years, when the value of the credit can have the greatest impact on a rapidly growing, but often cash-limited, company. 
   Finally, to assure that these small businesses are truly able to compete in the global market and to protect their intellectual assets, we are proposing that the full value of the Tax Credit be applied to their patent filing fees, both here and abroad. 
   In speaking with owners of small, high tech businesses in New Mexico, I hear that anything we can do to increase the capital funds available to these businesses as they are starting up is critical to their success. These two special provisions for small businesses are positive steps in that direction. 
   Mr. President, many of my fellow Senators and Members of the House have already endorsed the concept of a permanent R&D Tax Credit. With that base of enthusiasm already in place, I encourage my colleagues to seize the opportunity to move forward and complete the job. Let's make it permanent, and let's make it right.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure that is one cornerstone of a series of initiatives that are designed to help ensure that the fundamental needs of children in New Mexico and this country are met. This cornerstone, the Children's Dental Health Improvement Act of 1999, is built on the belief that children must have access to quality, affordable health care. A child who is sick cannot go to school, cannot be expected to learn, and cannot be expected to grow and thrive. For New Mexico, this is a particularly compelling need because according to the Children's Defense Fund, no state has a greater percentage of uninsured children than New Mexico. Specifically, the bill is designed to increase access to dental services for our children. 
   Some will say: ``Why care about a few cavities in kids?'' In reality, this is a complex children's health issue. Chronically poor oral health is associated with growth and development problems in toddlers and compromises children's nutritional status. These children suffer great pain and cannot play or learn. It is estimated that lack of treatment for these children results in missed school days: an estimated 52 million school hours annually. Their personal suffering is real. In reality, untreated dental problems get progressively worse and ultimately require more expensive interventions. 
   Medicaid's Early and Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment, or ``EPSDT,'' program requires states to not only pay for a comprehensive set of  child health services, including dental services, but to assure delivery of those services. Unfortunately, low income children do not get the dental service they need. Despite the design of the Medicaid program to reach children and ensure access to routine dental care, the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services reported in 1996 that only 18 percent of children eligible for Medicaid received even a single preventive dental service. The same report shows that no state provides preventive services to more than 50% of eligible children. Dentist participation is too low to assure access. We are falling short of our obligation to these children. 
   In the past few months, I have had the opportunity to speak to many of New Mexico's rural health care providers and have learned that for New Mexico, the problem is of crisis proportions. Less than two percent of New Mexico's Medicaid dollars are used for children's oral health needs. My state alone projects a shortage of 157 dentists and 229 dental hygienists. Children in New Mexico and elsewhere are showing up in emergency rooms for treatment of tooth abscesses instead of getting their cavities filled early on or having dental decay prevented in the first place. 
   Tooth decay remains the single most common chronic disease of childhood and according to the Children's Dental Health Project, it affects more than half of all children by second grade. Tooth decay in children six years old is five to eight times more common than asthma which is often cited as the most common chronic disease of childhood. 
   National data confirm that pediatric oral health in the U.S. is backsliding. Healthy People 2000 goals for dental needs of children will not be met. As this chart shows: 
   52% of our 6 to 8 year olds have dental caries or cavities compared to 54% in 1986. Our goal was to decrease this to 35% by the year 2000; we have succeeded in a mere 2% change in this area. 
   Additionally, we have slid backwards in some areas. The Healthy People 2000 oral health indicators show an increase in the percentage of children with untreated cavities. In 1986, 28% of our 6 to 8 year olds had untreated cavities compared to now when we find 31% of these children have untreated cavities. 
   Tooth decay is increasingly a disease of low and modest income children. A substantial portion of decay in young children goes untreated. In fact, forty seven per cent of decay in children aged 2 through 9, is untreated. 
   The Children's Dental Health Improvement Act of 1999 is designed to attack the problem from many fronts. First, the bill addresses the issue of provider shortage by expanding opportunities for training pediatric dental health care providers. It allows for the Secretary to look at the reimbursement rates for dental providers as an incentive for dentists to participate in the Medicaid program so that we work toward increasing the actual care provided under the Medicaid program. Additionally, I have looked at the need for pediatric dental research to facilitate better approaches for care and it will put into place greater measures for surveillance of the problem. The bill would lead to increased accountability in the area of actual treatment 
   once a problem is identified. Finally, I have included a section on health promotion and disease prevention to increase the number of children who have access to fluoridated water systems and dental sealants to prevent cavities. 
   I recognize that this is an ambitious bill and that the issue of access to dental care for children covered by the Medicaid program is a complex one. I want to thank the various groups that have worked on the formulation of this legislation. In particular, I want to thank Drs. Burt Edelstein and Heber Simmons of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry for their hard work and excellent information. I also want to thank the American Association of Dental Schools, the American Dental Hygienist Association, the American Dental Association, the Hispanic Dental Association, the National Dental Association, and the American Association for Dental Research for their valuable input and I look forward to working with them all to ensure that we achieve increased access to oral health care for our children. 
   I am committed to solving the problem of adequate access to dental care for our children and view this as a public health issue that has gone unnoticed for too long. I will welcome my colleagues to work with me to ensure that these children have healthy smiles instead of chronic pain from untreated problems.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to make a very short comment on two measures that comprise a basic cornerstone for the efforts that I made to ensure that the fundamental needs of children in my State of New Mexico and throughout the country are met. 
   The basic idea here is that children have to have, if they are going to grow into full and honorable adulthood, access to quality, affordable health care. A child who is sick cannot go to school, and cannot be expected to learn in school, and cannot be expected to grow up and thrive and go on to be a productive citizen. In New Mexico, we have a particularly compelling case because the Children's Defense Fund, this last year, identified our State as having a higher number of uninsured children than any other State in the Union--uninsured for health care insurance. Consequently, I have two measures that try to address this need. 
   The first deals with a problem that has sadly become an epidemic in New Mexico; it is the Youth Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. This is designed to increase access to drug prevention and treatment services for young people in the country. 
   Second is the Children's Dental Health Improvement Act, which is designed to increase access to dental services for young people, particularly young people who are eligible to participate in Medicaid. 
   Mr. President, I will be introducing both of those bills and I commend them to my colleagues. I hope they will also get a full hearing this Congress and that we can enact them into law and send them to the President as well. 
   Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this bill that I have sent to the desk is being introduced on behalf of myself and Senator CHAFEE. It is entitled ``The Earth Day Act.'' Its purpose is to designate April 22 as Earth Day. 
   Today, of course, is April 22. Let me provide a little history for my colleagues or anyone listening. 
   The first Earth Day was 29 years ago, in 1970, and I think we are all aware that Earth Day was first conceived by our former colleague, Senator Gaylord Nelson, who is universally considered the founder of Earth Day. 
   He has written a short summary of what brought Earth Day about, how it came about. In it he points out that in a speech that he gave in Seattle in September of 1969, he announced that there would be a national environmental teach-in in the spring of 1970. And the wire services picked up that story. And the next thing he knew, there was a movement afoot to actually have that happen. 
   That first Earth Day involved some 20 million Americans. Since then, the concept and the idea of Earth Day has focused the attention of the country, focused the attention of the world, in fact, on the importance of our environment and the importance of preserving and maintaining our environment. We have a great debt of gratitude we owe to former Senator Nelson for his leadership on this. 
   We also owe a great debt of gratitude to the person that did the nuts and bolts work of organizing that first Earth Day, and that, of course is Denis Hayes. He is now president of the Seattle-based Bullitt Foundation, but he has been recognized recently by Time magazine as one of their heroes of the planet. I think his instrumental role, his essential role in bringing about that first Earth Day, making such a success of it, has been recognized by all. 
   He is now, of course, trying to get in place the organization to make Earth Day 2000, which will occur exactly a year from today, an even greater celebration than we have known before. 
   Mr. President, I firmly believe that it is appropriate that we officially designate April 22 as Earth Day and that we permanently designate it as Earth Day. It has come to be known as Earth Day--April 22--for all of us. There are celebrations and teach-ins, and recognitions going on throughout our country today. As we hear the news about Kosovo, which is bad, and the news about Littleton, Colorado, and the terrible tragedy there, which is bad, and many of the other news stories that bombard us, it is good to know that there is one news story that we can all celebrate and rally around, and that is that today, again, we will be able to celebrate Earth Day. 
   Mr. President, it is my sincere hope that Senator CHAFEE and I can work in the next year to gain additional cosponsors and to obtain enactment of this, so that by the time Earth Day 2000 arrives, we will be able to have this in law, have it signed by the President. I am sure it will be supported by all of our colleagues. I think we all recognize the importance of this to many of the people we represent. I hope very much that the bill can be enacted.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I also thank my good friend from Vermont, the chairman of the committee that I serve on with him. I wanted to just take a few minutes to focus the attention of the Senate on this terrible tragedy that occurred yesterday in our schools. We all now know two students of Columbine High School in Littleton, CO, stormed into their school and began shooting at students and teachers, yesterday. The last that I heard, police believed that 16 people have been killed. Many of them were either just beginning their lunch or were studying in the library at the time they were assaulted. The details behind the violence are overwhelming, and the motivations leading to it are incomprehensible to all of us. But we are left wondering how this could happen in a suburban community like Littleton, CO.  
   I know we all grieve with the parents of those students and the families of the faculty who were killed yesterday. 
   Our Nation has witnessed five violent events in our schools during the past 17 months and we need to focus on that pattern of activity. Five communities have experienced this violence firsthand: 
   In Paducah, KY, in December of 1997, December 1, 1997, a 14-year-old boy shot and killed three girls at Heath High School in Kentucky and the shooter wounded five others. 
   On March 24, 1998, in Jonesboro, AR, two young boys hiding in the woods began shooting at their classmates and their teachers. 
   At Edinboro, PA, on April 25 of 1998 another 14-year-old student of Parker Middle School shot and killed a teacher and two other boys were wounded. 
   In Fayetteville, TN, less than a year ago, on March 19 of 1998, a senior at Lincoln County High School in Tennessee shot and killed a fellow student. And then in Springfield, OR, 2 days after the Tennessee incident, on May 21 of 1998, a 15-year-old student opened fire at Thurston High School in Oregon and killed two students and wounded 22 others. 
   We should not wait for another incident to happen before we take some action here in the Congress. These tragedies are the reason that last year I introduced a bill entitled ``The Safe Schools Security Act.'' The bill passed the Senate unanimously, I believe. Unfortunately, it was dropped in the conference. This year, a little over a month ago, on March 17, I again introduced the Safe Schools Security Act. In my view, we need to move ahead with that legislation. We have waited too long. 
   Yesterday the importance of this bill was made more evident by what we observed in Colorado. Recent studies show that our children fear they will be the victims of crime in school. Mr. President, 29 percent of our elementary schoolchildren fear that, 34 percent of our junior high, and 20 percent of our high school students fear they will be a victim of a crime while at school, according to a recent poll. 
   The schoolyard fight which I was familiar with when I was growing up is no longer the worst fear that students have. Mr. President, 75 percent of children ages 7 through 10 say they do worry about being shot or stabbed, and 13 percent of high school seniors report being threatened by a weapon between 1995 and 1996. 
   In 1997, a high school in my home State, Belen High School in Belen, NM, decided to improve school security. They did so in an effort to protect their students and their teachers and the school property. Belen partnered with Sandia National 
   Laboratories, one of our Department of Energy Labs in Albuquerque, to try to accomplish this security upgrade. The results have been impressive. After 2 years, Belen High School experienced a 75-percent reduction in school violence, a 30-percent reduction in truancy, an 80-percent reduction in vehicle break-ins in the school parking lot, and a 75-percent reduction in vandalism. 
   Most noteworthy, Belen realized a 100-percent reduction in the presence of unauthorized people on school grounds. This is an issue in more and more of our schools today. They implemented several security measures, including placing security officers on permanent patrol on the campus, fencing the property, and restricting access to a single entrance where students and visitors could be monitored. They installed cameras in the parking lots to monitor vehicles and student activities. Through cooperation with the local police, the high school in Belen secured a police officer to work with the campus security officers and to patrol the school grounds after school to prevent unauthorized access. 
   This Safe Schools Security Act, which I have introduced again this year, S. 638, will also establish a security technology center that Sandia would operate to provide security assessments of middle schools and high schools, and to offer advice to schools about the security measures that are needed to be implemented and improved. The act would provide money and grants to local schools so they could purchase the appropriate technology and hire the necessary personnel to beef up security. 
   Obviously, improving school security will not guarantee that violence ceases in our schools. 
   It is a start. By restricting access, we can reduce unauthorized persons coming onto school grounds. By installing cameras on some of our school campuses, schools can be forewarned of problems in certain areas of the campus, and law enforcement can utilize those cameras in situations like the hostage situation that occurred yesterday in Colorado. 
   By planning the construction of schools with security in mind, we can begin to minimize the risks of violence occurring in our schools. Teachers and administrators need to identify their schools' security weaknesses. The personnel who have been working on this issue at Sandia Labs, with Federal money I should point out, have developed some expertise that can be helpful to some of our schools in this regard. Because of yesterday's tragedy, parents, teachers, and community leaders are asking, what can be done to protect our schools, and all of us in America are debating what can be done. 
   This bill cannot ensure that our children will be safe in school, but it will provide schools with a course of action to follow and with some resources to begin addressing this problem in a meaningful way. 
   We all know that most schools do not have the financial resources to purchase security technology, and high schools and middle schools often lack the technical expertise to know what kind of technology will best serve their school. This bill could help to provide that expertise and help to give good advice, expert advice to schools on appropriate technology and on appropriate actions that could be taken to make our schools more secure. 
   Mr. President, with this terrible tragedy still very much in front of us, I urge that we consider the proposals that I 
    have set forth in this bill. I urge that we think about what action we can take to lessen the likelihood of these types of incidents in the future. Obviously, our children are our most important resource in this country, and I believe some additional effort in this regard would be well advised and strongly supported by all my colleagues. 
   I hope we can move ahead on this bill. I appreciate very much the chance to speak on it today. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. Bingaman. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Youth Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. This bill is designed to increase access to drug prevention and treatment services for our nation's youth. It also provides for critical training of health care professionals who work tirelessly with young people with drug problems. 
   Nationwide only 20% of the 648,000 youth with severe substance use or dependency receive treatment. The statistics tell the tale and it is an unacceptable story. 
   Heroin use has doubled among teenagers in the 1990's. 
   More than 50% of 12th graders have tried an illicit drug. 
   In senior high schools across the country, 25% of students use an illicit drug on a monthly basis, and by the 12th grade, more than three-fourths of students have used alcohol, and over 30 percent are binge drinkers (more than five drinks at a sitting). 
   By the time they are seniors, almost one in four teens are current marijuana users and 1 in 20 use every day and this number is on the rise. 
   Studies have also indicated that youth who have used marijuana and other drugs in the past year were more likely than non-users to report problem behaviors including running away from home, stealing, skipping school, selling drugs, drunkdriving, and considering suicide. 
   Over the past several months, I have had the opportunity to hear first hand about the drug problem in New Mexico and the barriers for providing services that confront health care professionals and families everyday. 
   Drug use seems to be more common among youth in New Mexico than nationally. In fact, most underage teens in New Mexico drink alcohol; over one-third of seventh grade students and over three-fourths of 12th grade student reported drinking alcohol. Eighteen percent of 8th graders in New Mexico used illegal drugs other than marijuana in the past year compared to 12% nationally. In my state, ninth graders' illicit drug use has been increasing. This trend is of great concern because we also know that the younger people begin to use drugs or alcohol, the greater the chance they will continue to use drugs as adults. 
   With drug and alcohol use come other problem behaviors, violence, property damage, and threatening behavior; and in New Mexico these behaviors occur at a greater frequency than the national rates. In fact, nationally, the majority of teens enter substance abuse treatment only after they have had contact with juvenile justice authorities. 
   There is another significant problem confronting our 
   nation. Illicit drug use among Native American youth is very high. According to Bureau of Indian Affairs officials, alcohol-related automobile accidents are the leading cause of death among Native American youth. We must address this issue. 
   The Youth Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act provides funds for: 
   School-based community after-school prevention programs; schools and health providers working hand-in-hand with students and families to assure early identification and referral for at-risk students. 
   This bill also provides funding for youth treatment and encourages the use of community-based wrap around services. 
   This measure also includes special provisions for youth who live in rural areas as well as for Native Americans. These two youth populations are particularly suffering from a serious lack of prevention and treatment services. 
   The Director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse, Dr. Alan Leschner has stated that addiction is a treatable disease. While there have been advances in the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, dissemination of this valuable and potentially life-saving information is not consistently getting out to grassroots health care providers. That is why this legislation also assists healthcare professionals in accessing the latest information on emerging drug threats and the most recent advances in prevention and treatment techniques. 
   I am especially concerned with rural and remote areas where health care professionals may have to travel hours to attend a conference, many times on their limited time off. 
   The evidence in support of prevention and treatment is overwhelming; both in social and economic terms. Several studies have demonstrated that for every dollar spent on drug treatment the community gets back anywhere from six to seven dollars in reduced crime, and other lowered social costs. For youth especially, we see improved school attendance, better grades, and a reduction in violent and other anti-social behaviors. 
   There is one other benefit that is derived from adequately treating young people; when we help these young people, they are healthier and happier. We cannot forget the personal and family tragedy associated when youth are involved with drugs. 
   I recognize that this bill does not provide the entire solution, but it is a necessary step in addressing this national problem. I am committed to solving the problem of inadequate access to drug prevention and treatment services for all young people. I welcome my colleagues to work with me to ensure that all American youth who need access to these services, have the opportunity to pursue their dreams and when they stumble, we are there as a community to help. That is what this bill is all about and I ask my colleagues for their support.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I'm very pleased to be joined by Senators from both sides of the aisle in offering this amendment regarding the Defense Science and Technology program. Senators DEWINE, KENNEDY, HUTCHISON, GRAHAM, SANTORUM, SCHUMER, CHAFEE, MOYNIHAN, and LIEBERMAN are all cosponsors, and I thank them for their valuable support. 
   This sense of the Senate amendment reemphasizes Congressional support for modest but needed increases in the Defense Science and Technology program budget. It reinforces that the Senate, honoring its responsibility for maintaining the long-term strength of our national defense, intends to see that the DoD places a greater priority on this high payoff investment in our national security. 
   A little background is in order. Technological superiority, coupled with outstanding training, remains a keystone of our military strategy and might. Undergirding that superiority has been the patient, long-term investment we have made in the Defense Science and Technology program--often known around here as ``S&T'' or ``6.1, 6.2, and 6.3'' funding. That investment gave us things like stealth and the advanced information systems that allowed us to totally dominate the battlespace during Desert Storm. It's sometimes said that the S&T of the 60's and 70's was used to fight and win the Gulf War of the 90's, at a relatively low cost of American lives. And, it's worth remembering that each time you use the Internet, you're using the results of Defense S&T. 
   Yet, despite the widely acknowledged and proven value of Defense S&T, despite the fact that new technology will help us counter the new threats we see emerging, despite the fact that overall Defense spending will significantly increase, the DoD plans to cut and continue cutting S&T. The fiscal 1999 S&T funding is $7.8 billion, whereas the budget request for fiscal 2000 is $7.4 billion, down around 15% in real terms since 1995. Moreover, that request includes the lowest level of S&T by the military services in 22 years. Worse yet, S&T is slated to decline to around $7 billion in constant dollars in the outyears--$1 billion less than the level recommended just last summer by the independent Defense Science Board. To my mind, that is just not consistent with maintaining the long term technological edge of our military. 
   Now, both Houses of Congress have recognized this problem. Last year, we included in the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act a sense of the Congress provision, Section 214, calling on the Secretary of Defense to increase the S&T budget request by at least 2% a year over inflation during fiscal 2000 through 2008.  That provision was designed to be a flexible way of urging the DoD to place a higher priority on S&T. It contemplated they would plan sensible, gradual increases in S&T, which would reach the Defense Science Board target in real terms by fiscal 2005 or so. 
   Unfortunately, the DoD may be falling into a classic trap that can catch the best of managers, that of focusing so hard on the short term problems that they shortchange the future. This year's plans continue to show declines for S&T in the outyears, and are largely unchanged from last year's plans. 
   That's where we come in. The Senate is perhaps uniquely suited to take the long term view, to look after those things that require patience, yet lie at the very foundation of our national security--like Defense S&T. We have the luxury of not being subject to the day to day pressures of DoD managers, but we have the responsibility to make sure they don't shortchange the future. 
   Hence, this amendment says that within the budgetary levels for National Defense, function 050, we assume the DoD will increase the S&T budget as called for in last year's Defense authorization act. This assumption, in turn, signals that we continue to be very serious about our long term investment in S&T, and will not just let the issue slide. Over time, I believe the DoD will hear our message and begin placing a higher priority on S&T and fix this problem. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join the ten of us and support this amendment.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to state that today marks the first anniversary since the tragic school shooting in Jonesboro, Arkansas. We all remember hearing about the gun shots fired by two young boys hiding in the woods--shots that led to the tragic death of four of their classmates and a Jonesboro teacher. March 24th will forever be ingrained in our memories as the day our children's safety at school was threatened in a way we could hardly imagine. 
   One of the bills I introduced recently was aimed at keeping our kids in school. But solving the truancy problem is only one of the issues we must work together to tackle. Not only do we need to keep our kids in school, we need to keep our kids in school safe! The Safe School Security Act I introduced last week is intended to do just that. 
   Children should not have to fear for their safety while attending our public schools. At a time when violent crime in the nation is decreasing, ten percent of our public schools reported at least one serious violent crime during the 1996-97 school year. Because of this level of violence, 29 percent of elementary, 34 percent of junior high and 20 percent of high school students fear that they will be a victim of crime while at school. The school yard fist fight is no longer a child's worst fear: 71 percent of children ages 7 to 10 say they worry about being shot or stabbed. In fact, 13.2% of high school seniors reported being threatened by a weapon between 1995 and 1996. We all know that a violent environment is not a good learning environment. 
   Educators and law enforcement know that technology is the key to preventing and reducing crime in our schools. Most of us understand the importance of protecting our assets, yet we have neglected to protect our biggest investment of all: our school children. The Safe School Security Act would establish the School Security Technology Center at Sandia National Laboratory and provide grant money for local school districts to access the technology developed and tested by the lab. Because Sandia is one of our nation's premier labs when it comes to providing physical security for our nation's most important assets, it is fitting that Sandia would be chosen to provide security to our school districts throughout our nation. 
   Increased school security not only reduces violent crime, it reduces truancy and property crime. The latest technology was recently tested in a pilot project involving Sandia Labs and Belen High School in Belen, New Mexico and the results were astounding. After two years, Belen High School experienced a 75 percent reduction in school violence, a 30 percent reduction in truancy, an 80 percent reduction in vehicle break-ins and a 75 percent reduction in vandalism. More important, Belen realized a 100% reduction in the presence of unauthorized people on the school grounds. Also, Belen saw insurance claims due to theft or vandalism at the high school drop from $50,000 to $5,000 after the pilot project went into effect. Clearly, the cost of making our schools safer and more secure is a good investment for our nation. 
   The School Security Technology Center will partner with the Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center in Georgia to facilitate the transfer of available security technology to schools that could benefit the most from such technology. The School Security Technology Center will also provide security assessments for schools so they do not spend limited school resources on security tools that do not work. This bill will authorize $10,000,000 for schools to access the technical assistance from Sandia and to purchase security tools that fit their needs. 
   This one year anniversary of the horrible tragedy in Jonesboro should make it clear to everyone that it is time to focus on making our kids feel safe in school and ultimately putting kids first.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about the amendment that Senator STEVENS just referred to. Senator MURKOWSKI's amendment related to Glacier Bay. Senator MURKOWSKI's amendment would prohibit the Secretary of Interior from expending any funds to implement closures or other restrictions of subsistence or commercial fishing or subsistence gathering within Glacier Bay National Park. This prohibition would continue under the language of the amendment. The prohibition would continue until the State of Alaska's claim to jurisdiction over ownership of the submerged lands in Glacier Bay were resolved, either by a final determination by the judiciary or by a settlement between the parties. 
   The amendment, as I understand it, would undo a compromise that Senator STEVENS entered into last year with Secretary Babbitt. Certainly it was understood by the Secretary of Interior as a compromise on last year's appropriation bill. In addition, Senator STEVENS has already included an amendment earlier this week in the supplemental appropriation bill which provides additional money to buy out commercial crabbing operations in Glacier Bay. 
   The issue of regulating commercial fishing in Glacier Bay is an extremely contentious issue. There were attempts in the last Congress to include an appropriations amendment that would have prohibited the Park Service from enforcing restrictions on commercial fishing in Glacier Bay National Park. The amendment was strongly opposed by the administration. The Secretary of Interior indicated that he would recommend the President veto the bill if the amendment was included. I have been informed that the Secretary of Interior will, if this amendment is included in the final version of this bill going to him, again recommend a veto. 
   The provision that was finally agreed upon last year between Secretary Babbitt and the Senator from Alaska, I understood, resolved the issue and provided the Park Service and commercial fishing operators with certainty as to future fishing operations in the park. If this current amendment is adopted, that certainty, of course, will be disrupted. 
   The amendment that is being offered this year would make major policy changes in the management of Glacier Bay. These changes should not be considered as part of this emergency spending bill. 
   As I am sure we all know, Senator MURKOWSKI is chairman of the appropriate committee to consider this legislation. I serve as the ranking member of that committee. What we should do is consider this matter in a hearing before that committee before bringing it to the Senate floor. 
   The amendment states that no funds may be expended by the Secretary to implement closures or other restrictions of subsistence or commercial fishing or subsistence gathering in Glacier Bay National Park. This would mean that the Park Service would be completely unable to regulate commercial fishing operations within the park. 
   The amendment would appear to override wildlife and resource protections required by other laws, including the Endangered Species Act. For example, fishing is currently prohibited for four fish species which provide critical food resources for the endangered humpback whale. No other park in the country is prohibited from protecting its resources as this amendment would prohibit this park from protecting its resources. 
   The amendment states that the funding and enforcement prohibition is to remain in effect until the claim of jurisdiction of the State of Alaska claim ``has been resolved either by a final determination of the judiciary or by settlement.'' 
   Last week, the State of Alaska filed a notice of intent to file a lawsuit, but it should be clear to all here, everyone should understand that there has not been a suit filed yet. 
   The amendment that has been offered would prohibit the Park Service from taking any actions to protect any of its resources from commercial or subsistence fishing or from subsistence gathering for the entire time period that this future lawsuit might be litigated. 
   Senator MURKOWSKI is claiming that the amendment simply allows local Native communities to gather seagull eggs from the park. However, unlike some other parks in Alaska, subsistence is not an authorized use in this park. If these types of fundamental changes to the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act are required, then it should be considered in the normal legislative process. This is not simply a Native issue. The amendment would allow all Alaskans to collect plant and wildlife resources in the park and with the Park Service unable to regulate any of these activities. 
   In short, Mr. President, this amendment makes far-reaching policy changes in the law that applies to this particular national park. It is contrary to the policy that applies in all other national parks. It is contrary to the action we took last year, and it is one which I am constrained to oppose.  
   I hope the Senate will not adopt this amendment as part of the bill. If it is adopted, I am advised that the Secretary of the Interior will urge the President to veto the bill. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medical Nutrition Therapy Act of 1999 on behalf of myself, my friend and colleague from Idaho, Senator CRAIG, and a bipartisan group of additional Senators. 
   This bipartisan measure provides for coverage under Part B of the Medicare program for medical nutrition therapy services by a registered dietician. Medical nutrition therapy is generally defined as the assessment of patient nutritional status followed by therapy, ranging from diet modification to administration of specialized nutrition therapies such as intravenous or tube feedings. It has proven to be a medically necessary and cost-effective way of treating and controlling many disease entities such as diabetes, renal disease, cardiovascular disease and severe burns. 
   Currently there is no consistent Part B coverage policy for medical nutrition and this legislation will bring needed uniformity to the delivery of this important care, as well as save taxpayer money. Coverage for medical nutrition therapy can save money by reducing hospital admissions, shortening hospital stays, decreasing the number of complications, and reducing the need for physician follow-up visits. 
   The treatment of patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease accounts for a full 60% of Medicare expenditures. I want to use diabetes as an example for the need for this legislation. There are very few families who are not touched by diabetes. The burden of diabetes is disproportionately high among ethnic minorities in the United States. According to the American Journal of Epidemiology, mortality due to diabetes is higher nationwide among blacks than whites. It is higher among American Indians than among any other ethnic group. 
   In my state of New Mexico, Native Americans are experiencing an epidemic of Type II diabetes. Medical nutrition therapy is integral to their diabetes care. In fact, information from the Indian Health Service shows that medical nutrition therapy provided by professional dieticians results in significant improvements in medical outcomes in people with Type II diabetes. For example, complications of diabetes such as end stage renal failure that leads to dialysis can be prevented with adequate intervention. Currently, the number of dialysis patients in the Navajo population is doubling every five years. Mr, President, we must place our dollars in the effective, preventive treatment of medical nutrition therapy rather than face the grim reality of having to continue to build new dialysis units. 
   Ensuring the solvency of the Medicare Part A Trust Fund is one of our most difficult challenges and one that calls for creative, effective solutions. Coverage for medical nutrition therapy is one important way to help address that challenge. It is exactly the type of cost effective care we should encourage. It will satisfy two of our most important priorities in Medicare: providing program savings while maintaining a high level of quality care.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me explain my amendment and then hopefully discuss with the two managers, the chief sponsor of the bill, my friend from Mississippi, and the manager on the Democratic side, my friend from Michigan, their understanding of what the underlying bill provides and the appropriateness of my amendment. 
   We had a hearing the other day in the Armed Services Committee. Mr. Gansler was there, and he testified that the administration's plan, with regard to this national missile defense program, is to handle this as they would handle other major weapons programs, weapons systems; that is, they would proceed with development, but they would not go the next step, they would not go into full production and deployment until they had done the necessary operations tests to determine the effectiveness of the system. 
   I have had some concerns, frankly, about this legislation. I opposed this in the last Congress because of those concerns, concerns that we were, in this legislation, changing those ground rules on the Department of Defense and saying to them, ``No, you should not do the appropriate testing. In this case, you should go ahead and proceed to deploy the system regardless of how ready it is for prime time.'' 
   I guess that has been the concern that has prompted me to offer this amendment. In private discussions with the manager of the bill, the sponsor of the bill, he has assured me that he does not see it that way. I want to just ask, if I could, the Senator from Mississippi if he could just respond to a question sort of directly on this. 
   I was encouraged, frankly, by the statements I just heard from the Senator from New Hampshire, where he said that it is 
   his understanding and his intention, clearly, by this legislation, that we would not be requiring the Department of Defense to do anything by way of full production or deployment until they were convinced that this weapons system was operationally effective. Is that the understanding of the Senator from Mississippi also?

   Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator from Mississippi very much for that explanation. I agree with him that clearly Congress needs to maintain its oversight of this program, as well as all other programs. And this is a very high priority for many of us here in Congress and everyone, I think, who is concerned about national security issues. So I would not want, by my amendment, to bring into question the ability of Congress to maintain that oversight. I do not believe the language of my amendment does that. 
   I am encouraged to hear that the Senator believes that operational effectiveness is an essential part of what has to be established before we go ahead and actually deploy something. 
   I want to just ask, in order to sort of complete the circle here, my good friend, the ranking member on the Armed Services Committee, which I have the privilege of serving on, Senator LEVIN, if he has any thoughts about the underlying bill. 
   Again, I guess the question is, Is there, in the language of the underlying bill, essentially a requirement that the Department of Defense treat this weapons system and this program the way it treats other major programs; and that is, to put them through the appropriate operational tests before they go forward with any deployment?

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce three measures that are linked together by a common theme--the desire to create a safer environment for young people to grow up in. 
   Two of these bills are designed to help communities better combat juvenile crime and the related problem of truancy. The third proposal will help better protect students from violence in the school building through the use of technology. 
   It's clear that in order to create a safer environment for young people, we must not only reduce the number of children who commit crimes, but also the number of children who are victims of crime. 
   Before I outline these specific bills, I'd like to put them in a larger context. Mr. President, I'd like to spend just a minute discussing the broader question of what children need--in addition to safe surroundings--in order to grow into healthy, productive adults. 
   Let me start by describing my own childhood. I grew up in a small mining town in southwestern New Mexico called Silver City. Both my parents were teachers, so naturally a top concern was that I got a solid education. Fortunately, the local schools were good, and when I graduated with my classmates from what is now Silver High, we felt we could compete with just about any other student in the country. 
   Silver City was also relatively safe. People tended to know their neighbors and while no town is completely crime-free, we felt secure in our homes, around town, and in school. 
   Finally, Silver City was by no means a wealthy town. But I'm sure I'm not the only one who grew up optimistic that a person could work hard, achieve a decent standard of living, and support their family without fear that one turn of bad luck would put them out on the streets. 
   In short, Mr. President, Silver City was a pretty good place to grow up. In fact, we used to feel sorry for people in neighboring states where the quality of life was not so good. 
   Even today, New Mexico is blessed with rich cultural diversity, tremendous natural beauty, strong families and a sense of tradition. All of these things make New Mexico a wonderful place to live. Each time I go home I'm astonished at the number of new people who are moving there, no doubt for some of these very reasons. 
   And yet, Mr. President, some things seem to have changed since I was a kid in New Mexico. I seem to hear more and more frequently from parents who tell me how hard it is to raise a child in a state where crime and unemployment rates are high, yet family income and school graduation rates are low. Where alcohol and drug abuse are widespread, but health insurance and treatment options are scarce. 
   Those of us from New Mexico know that a Washington-based study ranking our state as the worst place to raise children can not be taken at face-value. And yet, there is a troubling reality we must face. In many ways, our state is failing to provide what is needed to ensure all of our young people have the necessary foundation to grow into healthy, productive adults. In several key respects, New Mexico has fallen behind the other states we used to feel sorry for. 
   So, Mr. President, as we stand on the brink of a new century, I rise today to urge that we recommit ourselves--as elected officials, as community leaders, as parents, and as citizens-- to better meeting the needs of people growing up in our state and to setting higher goals for New Mexico's future. 
   I began by saying that a child needs to grow up safe from harm. That means safe from family violence, safe from gang warfare, and safe in school. But a child has other needs that must be met as well. I'd like to mention three other areas that I believe are cornerstones to strong foundation for any child. 
   The first of these is economic security. If a child is living in poverty, or on the edge of poverty, it is very difficult for anything else to fall into place. 
   A child should grow up in a family whose economic circumstances are stable. This stability comes first and foremost from parents with decent job opportunities. It also comes from a family's ability to successfully juggle numerous economic demands--and to adapt to change, the only certainty in today's global economy. Our efforts in this area should center on creating more high-wage jobs and on giving families the tools to manage the unpredictable forces that can throw them into financial turmoil. 
   The second cornerstone is education. In America, a quality public education has long been the great leveler between the haves and the have-nots. Children need access to a quality education that will give them the skills to achieve a good standard of living. 
   A quality education system is one characterized by accountability and flexibility. Accountability means that clear goals are set for things like student achievement and teacher quality, information is readily available on student progress toward these goals, and schools are held accountable for this progress. Flexibility means that schools have the resources and the ability to adapt to meet the needs of students--particularly students at risk of dropping out.  
   Third, children must have access to affordable, quality health care. A child who is sick cannot go to school--cannot be expected to learn. And yet according to the Children's Defense Fund, no state has a greater percentage of uninsured children than New Mexico. 
   We have to ensure that this health care is not only promised, but delivered--and that it is just as available to rural areas as it is to urban ones. 
   In the coming weeks, I intend to introduce legislation and pursue strategies in each of these remaining three areas--that I hope will begin to help parents provide a strong foundation for their children. All of us who grew up in New Mexico have fond memories of those days, and we want to assure that feeling for future generations of New Mexicans so that they can grow up, raise their families, and build a future in our state. 
   Mr. President, I'd now like to describe the three bills I am introducing today. 
   While adult crime rates are declining in many areas, the juvenile crime rate continues to rise--especially drug-related crime. But there is some hope, and there are good solutions out there. Not too long ago, I heard about the success the City of Boston had in getting control of their serious juvenile crime problem. In 1992, Boston had 152 homicides--a horrendous statistic. Realizing the community had to come together to work on a common solution, the City of Boston developed and implemented a collaborative strategy to address their crime problem. Boston's strategy was very successful, and between 1995 and 1997, their homicide rate dropped significantly. Most notably, they went two years without a single juvenile homicide. 
   Boston got law enforcement, community organizations, health providers, prosecutors, and even religious leaders working together to tackle different aspects of juvenile crime. 
   The Boston strategy worked because it got people from different organizations working together on a specific set of goals--like taking guns away from felons, using probation officers to help identify and apprehend probation violators, and providing alternatives to children to keep them from getting into trouble in the first place. 
   Boston recognized that juvenile crime affects the entire community, and a community that pulls together to address it will have a better chance of success. 
   The legislation I am introducing today, called the Safer Communities Partnership Act, is patterned after a bill authored by Senator KENNEDY. It provides funding for communities that want to implement this ``Boston'' strategy. And because there is no one-size-fits-all approach that works for every community, this bill provides the flexibility to integrate this strategy into the crime-fighting efforts already occurring at the local level. 
   The next two proposals have two goals: (1) to keep kids in school, and (2) to keep kids in school safe. 
   Although truancy is often the first sign of trouble in the life of a young person, this problem has long been overlooked. Truancy not only indicates a young person's disinterest in school, it often indicates that a young person is headed for a life of crime, drugs and other serious problems. 
   It is clear that truancy and crime go hand-in-hand--44 percent of violent juvenile crime takes place during school hours and 57 percent of violent crimes committed by juveniles occur on school days. Most of these crimes take place at a time when we expect young people to be in school. 
   In most cases, parents are not aware that their children are truant. We all have to do a better job of notifying parents when kids skip school. In fact, most studies indicate that when parents, educators, law enforcement and community leaders all work together to prevent truancy at an early stage, school attendance increases and daytime crime decreases. 
   The Truancy Prevention and Juvenile Crime Reduction Act I am introducing today authorizes $25 million per year for local partnerships to address truancy. The funds can be used for a variety of purposes. They can be used to create penalties for truants and parents when truancy becomes a chronic problem. They can be used by schools to acquire the technology needed to automatically notify parents when their children are absent without an excuse. 
   Not only do we need to keep our young people in school, we need to keep our students in school safe! Most of us understand the importance of protecting our assets, yet we have neglected to protect our biggest investment of all: our school children. The third and final bill I am introducing today is intended to do just that. 
   We all remember the horrible tragedies that struck Jonesboro, Arkansas, Paducah, Kentucky, and other communities within the last year. At a time when violent crime in the nation is decreasing, one in ten public schools reported at least one serious violent crime during the 1996-97 school year. The school yard fist fight is no longer a child's worst fear: 71 percent of children ages 7 to 10 say they worry about being shot or stabbed. A violent environment is not a good learning environment. 
   Educators and law enforcement know that one way to prevent crime in our schools is through the use of technology. The Safe School Security Act would establish the School Security Technology Center at Sandia National Laboratories and provide grant money for local school districts to access the technology. Because Sandia is one of our nation's premier labs when it comes to providing physical security for our nation's most important assets, it is fitting that they would be chosen to provide security to school districts throughout our nation. 
   The latest technology was recently tested in a pilot project involving Sandia Labs and Belen High School in Belen, New Mexico and the results were astounding. After two years, Belen High School reported a 75 percent reduction in school violence, a 30 percent reduction in truancy, an 80 percent reduction in vehicle break-ins and a 75 percent reduction in vandalism. Moreover, insurance claims due to theft or vandalism at Belen High School dropped from $50,000 to $5,000 after the pilot project went into effect. Clearly, the cost of making our schools safer and more secure is a good investment for our nation. 
   Mr. President, these three bills represent only a small fraction of what should be done to ensure that children grow up safe. There is much more I hope we can do this year. For instance, no discussion of the safety of children would be complete without acknowledging the problem of drug and alcohol abuse, which is not only a problem for many young people, but is often a source of family violence committed by addicted parents. 
   In recent weeks, we have seen the community of Espan 6ola in northern New Mexico begin to come to terms with a very serious heroin problem. In other parts of the state, federal, state and local officials are combating an increase in production and trafficking of methamphetamines, or meth. And of course, the problem of alcohol abuse continues to plague communities big and small, urban and rural. 
   All of these problems must be approached on two fronts--from the law enforcement side, and from the treatment side. Last year we obtained an increase of over one million dollars for New Mexico-based efforts to stop the drug trade along the Mexican border, and I recently joined in introducing a measure that will help local law enforcement crack down on the production and distribution of methamphetamines. 
   On the treatment side, Congress this year will update the budget for all federally-funded drug and alcohol treatment programs through the reauthorization of SAMHSA. I have already secured a commitment from the head of this agency to travel to northern New Mexico, and I plan to play a leading role in ensuring adequate funding for treatment facilities in underserved areas like our state. 
   Mr. President, in closing I'd like to say that I am not the only person interested in working to make New Mexico a better place to grow up. There are valiant efforts underway all across the state, and I commend those who are striving to make a difference. But this is not something that can occur overnight. This is a long term effort that requires cooperation between all levels of government, community leaders, average citizens, and of course, parents. 
   As we prepare to close the book on the 20th century, I'd like to suggest a  new horizon for our state that will give us the time to make the progress we all want to make. We are a little more than 12 years away from New Mexico's 100th anniversary as a state of these United States. This anniversary will occur on January 6, 2012. I say we set our sights beyond the turn of the century and focus on that year--2012. Then we can set high goals for New Mexico and the future of our children, knowing we have 12 more years to do all we can to meet them. New Mexico can still be a great place to grow up, if we all work together toward that goal.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of final passage of S. 280, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 and would like to take a brief moment to describe my reasons for supporting this legislation. Despite serious concerns about the amendments that will be offered here on the floor today, I am voting for this legislation as a strong supporter of both increased federal flexibility and additional federal funding for special education. 
   First and foremost, I am in favor of making federal education programs as flexible as possible. Over the years, requirements and regulations in many areas have crossed the line from responsible monitoring to redundant paperwork. Much has been done in recent years to lessen administrative burdens and eliminate federal regulation. However, I strongly believe that federal education programs need to go farther in to set clear goals and then provide as much flexibility as possible to local policymakers, as well as principals and classroom teachers. 
   To that end, this bill will allow schools in all 50 states to apply for waivers from a set of state and federal education laws. I voted for expanding Ed-Flex in 1998, and I am proud to have supported creation of the demonstration program that gave New Mexico this flexibility three years ago. 
   I am also supporting this bill because I am a strong advocate of increased funding for special education. Special education provides specialized services to students that can require significant additional costs to schools and local school districts. These services are essential to these students, and the federal government should do its part to support these efforts. 
   During the past 3 years, I have worked with my colleagues in the Senate to help increase funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act by billions of dollars. My goal, as stated in the IDEA statute, is that the federal government meet its commitment to IDEA funding by providing 40 percent of the costs of educating special education students. And this bill sends a strong signal that additional funding in FY2000 and beyond is required for IDEA grants to states. 
   For these reasons, I am voting in favor of final passage. However, I will carefully watch the final legislation that is produced by the conference committee on S. 280 before deciding how to cast my final vote before this bill is sent to the President. 
   For example, in my view it is unfortunate that the final version of this legislation could have the unintended and unnecessary effect of diverting funding from the new class size reduction program started last year. Under this program, New Mexico is slated to receive $9.6 million in FY99, which would allow schools around the state to hire more than 250 teachers. 
   There is no reason that the Senate cannot support this program as well as increased funding for IDEA. In fact it would have been preferable to have extended the authorization for the class size reduction program so that these efforts could continue into the future. I am concerned that, by merging two viable streams of funding into what is in effect just one source, the overall amount of funds awarded for education may not increase as much as is needed. 
   Because of these concerns I voted against several amendments to S. 280 that would make schools decide between the special needs of disabled students and the clear imperative to lower class size in the early grades. Ideally, there would be two strong programs that would both receive the funding they deserve. 
   I am also concerned that the Senate version of this legislation may not have sufficient accountability measures to go along with the expanded flexibility that is in the Ed-Flex bill. The taxpayers expect us to account for the roughly $15 billion per year that is sent to local schools, and in my view there should be stronger measures of performance and review in the final conference report. 
   Finally, it is extremely unfortunate that this version of the bill does not create the national dropout prevention program that I had offered as an amendment. This amendment, which passed last year by 74 to 26, would address the fact that 500,000 students drop out of school each year. There is no funded program to help lower dropout rates. And yet students in too many schools have just a 50-50 chance of graduating. Those that don't will earn less, be more likely to need public support, and more likely to get involved in crime. That affects all of us, not just the individual students. 
   It is my hope that some of these concerns can be addressed during the conference between the House and Senate.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is intended to commit the Federal Government to help local school districts deal with a very serious problem, the problem of students dropping out of school before they graduate. There is no Federal program that is intended to resolve this problem. I hear a lot of talk about how there are other Federal programs. There is no Federal program that is funded that is intended to solve this problem. This amendment would help us do this. 
   Clearly, this is a major issue in all of our States. 
   This is particularly an important issue in our States where we have large numbers of Hispanic students. The dropout rate is 30 to 50 percent among that community. 
   I yield the rest of the time to the Senator from Nevada who is a cosponsor on this amendment.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, before I start, let me just indicate my support for the amendment that the Senator from Minnesota is offering. I agree with him. I favor the Ed-Flex bill, and I intend to vote for the Ed-Flex bill. I also, though, believe we need to be sure the funds we provide at the Federal level get to the students who most need those funds, and to the programs that will benefit disadvantaged students. So I favor that amendment. 
   The amendment I have sent to the desk here and that I will speak on right now relates to what I consider perhaps the most severe problem facing the  educational system in this country today--at least in my State, and I believe throughout the country--and that is the problem that too many of our students are leaving school before they graduate from high school. 
   For an awful long time, this was a problem that people sort of ignored, and education policy wonks here in Washington and around the country essentially looked the other way and talked about other aspects of the educational issue. But more and more I have come to believe that this amendment I am offering on behalf of myself and Senators REID, LEVIN, BRYAN, and BOXER deals with a crucial issue for our young people and for our educational system. We can deal with the dropout problem. We can provide assistance to States and local school districts that want to reduce the dropout rate, and we can do that at the same time we are adequately funding special education. We can do it at the same time we are providing this additional flexibility in the Ed-Flex, which is what the Ed-Flex bill calls for. 
   Last week, when I offered the amendment, it was plain that there was some sort of contest between the proposal to adequately fund dropout prevention and the needs of special education. I do not see that as the case. That is a false choice. There is no rule and there is no limitation or requirement on those of us in the Senate to deal with one and not the other. We can deal with both of these issues. I favor dealing with both of these issues. 
   Special education is extremely important. In order to address this, I put a couple of provisions in the amendment that I just sent to the desk. Two key provisions relate to special education. 
   The first says that there is a sense of the Senate that there is a great need to increase funding for special education. I support doing that. And the amendment makes it very clear that that is what we intend to it. 
   A second provision I have added says that any funds that are appropriated for dropout prevention above the $150 million annual amount that is called for in this bill shall go to special education rather than to this dropout prevention need. 
   So it is not an either/or decision. And I don't think we should see it that way. 
   This legislation on dropout prevention was offered last year. It was adopted here in the Senate by a vote of 74 to 26. Its main provisions are very well known to the Members of the Senate. Let me just go through them. 
   There are five main provisions. First, it provides better coordination and streamlining of existing Federal programs which serve at-risk students. We have several programs intended to serve at-risk students. This bill would try to bring those together and coordinate them. 
   Second, it sets out a national plan to address the dropout crisis that exists at the State, local and national levels. 
   Third, there is $150 million authorized in grants to schools with high dropout rates in each State. 
   Fourth, there is a requirement for uniform dropout data to be provided so that parents will know where the problem exists most severely, and for policymakers to have that information so that we can make good decisions. 
   Finally, it calls for what we designated here as a ``dropout czar,'' or a person who will have a full-time job working in the Department of Education to try to work with local school districts and States to deal with this issue. We ought to have at least one person in the Department of Education who comes to work every day with the responsibility of trying to help solve this problem. That is not too much to ask in a country of our size. 
   So that is what the bill tries to do. 
   The problem is serious. It warrants our attention. 
   Since we have been debating this bill, there have been over 20,000 young people drop out of our schools. There are over 3,000 young people who drop out of our high schools and our middle schools before graduation each schoolday. So the problem is severe. There have been over 400,000 students who have dropped out since last April when we last approved this amendment here in the Senate. These new dropouts join a large pool of unemployed, most of them unemployed adults who lack high school degrees. 
   We have a serious problem here. I think many Senators and many people in this country would be shocked to know the extent of this problem. Let me give you some figures that came out of ``Education Week'' recently. According to ``Education Week,'' which is a very respected publication that does good research on education-related issues, according to their study, there are 30- to 50-percent dropout rates reported over the 4-year high school period in communities around this country. 
   Let me give you some specific statistics which they reported. 
   In Cincinnati, ``Education Week'' claims that 57 percent of students in Cincinnati's high schools do not complete high school, who drop out before the completion of high school; in Philadelphia, 54 percent; Salt Lake City, 39 percent. 
   Everybody, at least in my part of the country, in the Southwest, looks to Utah, and says: ``Oh, they have a better educational system than we do in New Mexico, and they always do everything right in Utah.'' The truth is that 39 percent of their students don't complete high school--in Salt Lake City, not in Utah, but in Salt Lake City--47 percent in Oklahoma City; in Dallas, according to ``Education Week,'' 61 percent of students do not complete high school. 
   I hope that Senators will come to the Senate floor and contradict these statistics and tell me that this is crazy, that they do not agree with these statistics. I hope they can do that, because, in fact, I find these statistics to be very startling. 
   But I know for a fact that in my State the percentage of people not completing high school is very high. It is particularly high among Hispanic students in my State. We have a great many Hispanic students in my State, and way too many of them leave school before they complete high school and middle school. There currently is no Federal program that is intended to help solve this problem. 
   We have a TRIO Program. People point to the TRIO Program. It is an Upward Bound Program. But less than 5 percent of the eligible students participate in those programs. 
   There is a program just now getting started called GEAR UP. This is for middle school mentoring. The unfortunate thing about this is that it doesn't reach ninth or tenth graders. That is where the problem really occurs most severely. 
   Then title I--title I, unfortunately, does not usually get any funds to the high school level. Most of the title I funding goes to elementary schools where the need is great. But what I am talking about is middle school and high school. And those schools see very little title I funding. 
   One of the main reasons this bill is needed is to restore some balance to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which, at present, is heavily weighted toward the younger grades. I favor the assistance to the early grades, but I believe we need to do something at the middle school and high school levels as well. 
   A lot of what needs to be done is reforming our high schools. Our high schools are too big. That is where the dropout problem is most severe. You get a 2,500-student high school, and, frankly, it is too anonymous. Too many of the young people come to that school; nobody knows whether they come in the morning or not. I have talked to high schools in my State, the large high schools, and I ask, ``What do you do if a student doesn't come to school?'' They say, ``After 3 days of them not coming to school, we send them a letter. We send a letter to their home address and ask them why they are not coming to school and complain to the parents.'' Well, the reality is you need a more personalized response and a more immediate and effective response when students start dropping out of school. This legislation can help us accomplish that. 
   United States graduation rates are falling behind other industrialized countries. When the Governors met and President Bush met in Charlottesville in 1989 and set the National Education Goals, the second goal was that we want to have at 
   least 90 percent of our students complete high school and graduate from high school. The reality is we have made virtually no progress towards achieving that goal since 1989. We are now in 1999, and we have made  virtually no progress. Clearly, we need to deal with this issue. 
   Some have said: ``Well, let's put it off. Let's deal with it later on in this Congress. This is a 2-year Congress. We are going to eventually get around to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization. We can deal with it then, maybe not this year. But surely next year we will get around to it. So just relax. We will get around to it.'' I believe we have a crisis with our high school dropout rates, and I believe we need to deal with it now. 
   There is no logical reason why we can't do the Ed-Flex bill, which I support, and do whatever this Senate wants to do with regard to special education, and do something to assist local schools in dealing with the dropout problem. We can do all three of these things. 
   As our former President, Lyndon Johnson, was famous for saying, ``We can walk and chew gum at the same time'' here in the U.S. Senate. This is not too much for us to take on. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I hope we get the same kind of strong vote this time that we got in the last Congress--at least have the 74 votes that we got in the last Congress. I hope we can get even a stronger vote. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Thank you very much. I thank my friend and colleague from Nevada for yielding me some time. 
   Mr. President, I agree with the sentiments that were just expressed by the Senator from Connecticut about his frustration about not being able to vote on some of the crucial issues that relate to education in this country. 
   I wanted to particularly draw attention to this issue of the Dropout Prevention Act that I offered last week, along with my colleague from Nevada, Senator REID. This is legislation which is not new to the U.S. Senate. It is legislation that passed in the last year. There were 74 votes in favor of this Dropout Prevention Act. What we are trying to do now is get this same legislation, identical legislation considered as part of this Ed-Flex package of legislation. We think that will be good for the American people. We think it would advance the handling of this very important issue. Otherwise, we will be put off for perhaps a year, perhaps 18 months into the new year. I believe very strongly that we ought to go ahead and deal with this. 
   In my State, when I go around my State and say what is the No. 1 concern that people have about education----

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator from Massachusetts yielding me some time to speak. 
   I strongly support the Ed-Flex legislation. In fact, New Mexico has seen the benefit of being one of the Ed-Flex States for the last 3-plus years. So we have seen there is some value in that. We certainly favor expanding that authority to other States as well. But I don't understand why we are in the condition or situation we are in here on the Senate floor today. I am not opposed to Ed-Flex. I am just in favor of going ahead and doing a few other things at the same time. 
   I proposed an amendment which incorporates the provisions of the Dropout Prevention Act, which passed this Senate by 74 votes in the last Congress. All we are saying is that is a bill which had 30 Republican Senators supporting it. It had, I believe, virtually all Democratic Senators, or nearly all Democratic Senators, supporting it. That is something we can agree upon. Let's go ahead with that. That is a priority. 
   We do not need to say, ``Look, it has to be Ed-Flex alone, or it can be nothing.'' That is the part of this debate that I don't really understand. The notion is sort of being left out there that somehow or other we are trying to stall a resolution of this issue or stall the final vote on Ed-Flex. 
   Nothing could be further from the truth. I would be happy to have a vote on this Dropout Prevention Act amendment which I proposed last week after 15 minutes of debate on our side and 15 minutes of debate on the other side. 
   So there is no effort by me or my cosponsors to slow down the consideration of this Ed-Flex bill. I believe that the other Senators who are interested in having amendments brought to the floor for consideration would also be glad to have short time limits so that those amendments could be considered and voted upon by the Senate. 
   Clearly, if the Senate believes that some of these proposals are too expensive, then we can vote against them. If the Senate believes that some of these proposals are not yet refined enough and need to be postponed until the Elementary and Secondary Education Act comes to the floor, that is fine; you can vote against the amendment at this time and explain that is the reason. But I do not understand why we can't at least have votes on the other important education proposals that people feel strongly about going ahead with. 
   My own State, as I said, has this Ed-Flex provision in law already. We have had it for over 3 years now. During that time, 1 of the school districts--we have 89 school districts in New Mexico--1 of our 89 school districts applied for a waiver 1 time during those 3 years. As you can see, we have not used the Ed-Flex authority to great advantage in our State, and I think that may be partly our fault. 
   But Ed-Flex is not a cure-all. I support expanding the authority to all States. I support putting it in permanent law. But I do not think we should be out here on the Senate floor leaving the impression that, once we pass this, all the problems of education are going to be resolved and the States are going to have this tremendous capability to resolve everything and the problems will go away. 
   During the 3 years we have had Ed-Flex authority in New Mexico, we have had 1 application by 1 of the 89 school districts for 1 waiver, and at the same time--and that waiver was granted --we have had 20,000 of our New Mexico students drop out of school before they graduate. 
   So I come to this from the point of view that it is at least as important with my State that we go ahead and consider the problem of students dropping out of school in the early part of this Congress. Some say we can deal with that later. Well, if later means a year and a half or 18 months from now, at the end of the 106th Congress, if that is as soon as we can do it, fine. But if it is important for the Senate to move ahead at this point on Ed-Flex, it is also important that the Senate move ahead at this point on this dropout prevention initiative. 
   A preliminary analysis of last week's fourth grade reading scores showed where the problem begins--or early indications of the problem. Between 1992 and 1998, the gap in reading skills between Hispanic students and non-Hispanic students in nine of our States widened, and only in four States did that gap decrease. So we are going in the wrong direction as far as heading off this dropout problem. I do not think Ed-Flex is going to solve that. I favor giving that authority to the States. I favor using it more effectively in my own State of New Mexico. 
   I certainly intend to vote for this bill, but I also think it is appropriate that Senators be allowed to offer amendments and get votes on them. As I say, if people want to vote against the amendments, that is fine. But I don't see why we cannot have a vote on an amendment unless that amendment somehow passes some kind of litmus test.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am proposing the National Dropout Prevention Act as an amendment to this Ed-Flex legislation. As I indicated, the cosponsors of this amendment are Senators REID, LEVIN and BRYAN. 
   In my view, the amendment would create a much-needed program to target those schools in our country that have the highest dropout rates in the Nation. There is at present very little help from the Federal level going to some of these most troubled high schools, and the amendment is a valuable necessary addition to this legislation to begin moving ahead in solving this problem. 
   Improving our schools, as we are trying to do through the Ed-Flex bill and through many other initiatives in Congress, is not going to make a whole lot of difference if half or a third--some substantial portion--of our students have already left before they graduate and they are no longer in those schools to receive the benefits of that assistance. Efforts to provide better teachers, more flexibility, computers in the classroom, higher standards--all of those efforts--will be diluted if we continue to ignore the dropout crisis we have in this country. 
   We do have what I refer to as a dropout drain. This chart makes the point very graphically showing that--the bucket represents our school system--we have students coming out of the school system in very large numbers and not gaining the benefit of the education we are trying to provide. 
   At too many schools, dropout rates reach 30 percent and even 50 percent, according to a 1998 Education Week report. Most States do not publish cumulative data, but Florida recently found that its 4-year dropout rate approached 50 percent when 
   they added the students who dropped out in the freshman, sophomore, junior and senior year. They got close to 50 percent in the State of Florida.  
   There are roughly 3,000 students who drop out on average each day in this country, according to the Department of Education statistics. About 500,000 students drop out of high school each year. 
   Let me indicate at this point, Mr. President, that the reason I am offering this legislation on the Ed-Flex bill early in this Congress is that if we go ahead and try to do this as part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will be talking about trying to do something 18 months down the road, because it is expected that the Elementary and Secondary Education Act will likely not become law until sometime late next year. 
   If that is the case, then we are talking not about 500,000 students per year, we are talking about a very large number of students who will, in fact, have left our schools with us sitting here trying to figure out what the right timing is to begin dealing with the problem. 
   These new dropouts will join about 4 million other young adults who are presently without high school degrees. There has been a lot of talk by the President and by many of us about ending social promotion, and we all favor ending social promotion. But if we pursue that, and pursue it with vigor, we may create an even greater risk for students dropping out of our school system. 
   Though dropout rates have not risen yet, higher standards mean more students become discouraged and fall through the cracks, unless there is some provision made to assist those students in meeting those higher standards. While some progress has been made for African American students, the real concentrated problem we have is in the Hispanic student population. Hispanic students remain much more likely to drop out. 
   Let me call people's attention to this chart called ``Status Dropout Rates for Persons Ages 16 to 24 by Race Ethnicity for the Period October 1972 through October 1995.'' What you can see here very clearly is that the rate of dropouts in the Hispanic community is up in the range of 30 to 35 percent. The rate for black non-Hispanic students and white non-Hispanic students is substantially lower, down in the area of 10 to 15 percent. 
   So we have a very serious problem and one that we have not been able to address, and it most directly affects the Hispanic students in our country and in our State. 
   One reason I became interested in this, Mr. President, which should be obvious--I am sure it is obvious to my colleagues--is that a very large percentage of our population in New Mexico is Hispanic and particularly in the school system. A great many of the young people in our State are Hispanic, and the problem affects us in a very real way. 
   The annual dropout rate is almost 5 percent each year for all States. And States, such as Nevada, where Senator REID, who is my cosponsor on this bill, and Senator BRYAN hail from, and Georgia and New Mexico, have a much more severe dropout rate. 
   Let me just say another word, before I go on to this chart here, about the issue of Hispanic students. The dropout rate for Hispanics has hovered near 30 percent for many years. That is more than three times the rate for white students, more than two times the rate for African Americans. The Hispanic population is the fastest growing population in our Nation, and many are being left behind in their educational opportunities while others are moving ahead. While the Hispanic students in our country make up 14 percent of all students now, they will comprise 22 percent by the year 2020. In large part due to differences in dropout rates, Hispanic workers earn only about 61 percent of what comparable non-Hispanic workers are earning. So you can see the problem is severe. 
   Referring again to this chart, unfortunately for Nevada, it is the State with the highest dropout rate. This is the dropout rate, on an annual basis, according to the Department of Education statistics. Twenty-nine States have provided annual dropout data. The other States have not provided that information. And, of course, they are not on this chart. But unfortunately, close behind Nevada and right behind Georgia is my own State of New Mexico, and the dropout rate there is 8.5 percent according to these statistics. 
   The National Goals Report--I serve on the National Education Goals Panel, Mr. President. And one of the discouraging things about serving on that panel has been that over the last several years--back in 1989, President Bush and the Governors met over in Charlottesville, VA, to set out national goals. And they had a very good vision of what they thought we ought to be trying to do as a Nation. 
   The second goal is that at least 90 percent of our students should graduate from high school before they leave school. Unfortunately, the reality is that we have not made progress on that. The National Goals Report, the latest National Goals Report, found that roughly 40 States have not made any progress in increasing school completion rates during the 10 years that we have had since that national education goal was agreed to. 
   Dropout rates affect more than just the students who leave school. Let me show another chart here which will make that point. While dropouts face a bleak future in terms of good jobs, communities that they live in are affected by higher crime, higher welfare rates, as well as very limited economic opportunity. Unemployment rates of high school dropouts are more than twice those of high school graduates. The probability of falling into poverty is three times higher for high school dropouts than for students who finished high school. The median personal income of high school graduates during the prime earning years, 25 through 54, is nearly twice that of high school dropouts. So we have a very serious problem here. 
   At the present time, there is no Federal program dedicated toward eradicating the problem. This $150 million that we contemplate in this legislation, this amendment, would allow us to help 2,000 schools with the highest dropout rates throughout the country. With funds that they could receive from the State, these schools could restructure themselves in ways that have proven to lower dropout rates. 
   We do know some of the ways schools can lower dropout rates. We need to get that information out better, and we need to give schools the resources to act on that information. This is necessary because most Elementary and Secondary Education Act programs, including title I, which of course is the largest program we authorize through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, do not reach significant numbers of high school students. 
   In our most troubled communities, this creates a very real dropoff in support services when students move from an elementary or middle school with a strong title I program. They get the assistance at the elementary level, and even at the middle school level, but when they get to high school, the assistance is not there. 
   Not even GEAR UP, which is a newly created tutoring program to help middle school students and provides real support to help schools make fundamental changes to the way they are organized and run, that program itself is not available to solve this problem. 
   Mr. President, this is not the first time that we have had a chance to act on this legislation. I offered this legislation last year to the bill which Senator COVERDELL had sponsored on education issues. It was adopted here in the Senate. We had 74 Senators who supported the exact legislation, identical legislation last year. It has been endorsed, this amendment, by 
   the Council of Great City Schools, by the Hispanic Education Coalition, and by the Education Trust. 
   Local schools need to decide how best to address the problem in their community. And we are not trying to dictate what any local school does to solve this problem. The legislation gives districts the power to choose from a broad array of proven, effective approaches to the dropout issue. 
   As in the Obey-Porter program, States would receive funds on a formula basis identical to title I, and districts would compete for grants of not less than $50,000 from the State. 
   The dropout problem can be addressed through school-based reforms. While many excuses are made for the dropout problems, in fact school-related factors are cited most often by the students themselves, the students who do drop out of school. When they are  surveyed and asked why they left school, in 77 percent of the cases, they cite school-related factors as the reason. These are students who are failing--who are failing--who do not like school--they do not get along with their teachers or their peers and basically have found that there is nothing there in the school to keep them there. 
   When you look at the top school-related reasons getting behind that other statistic, the top school-related reasons, the first or the most often cited top school-related reason is that they were failing or they could not get along with their teachers, and that is a reason for the students dropping out. They do not like school. They could not get along with students, felt they did not belong. They were suspended or expelled in 25 percent of the cases; and they did not feel safe in 10 percent of the cases. 
   These are school-related concerns which the schools themselves can begin to address, Mr. President. This is not something where we can say it is up to the parents. ``If the kids don't want to go to school, it's the parents' problem, it's not the school's problem.'' That has been the approach we have taken for decades in this country to this issue, and it has not gotten us where we need to be. 
   Let me also talk about the size of schools. Small schools, academy programs, challenging material, alternative high schools, all of these have proven effective ways of addressing the needs of at-risk students in large, alienating, boring high schools. 
   Mr. President, it is clear when you begin looking at this problem--and I see it in my State--the problem is most severe in our large high schools, in our large middle schools where students feel anonymous, where there is very little interaction between the student and the teacher. And that problem is severe. 
   In particular, this program that we have proposed here will allow us to make large schools smaller without building new school buildings. School size does matter. Yet we are still forcing our young people to go to very, very large schools. And in some places they have taken the very innovative step of breaking large schools into smaller schools where you have schools within schools. And that is part of the solution, I believe. 
   In New Mexico and throughout the Nation, fewer than one out of three high school students goes to a school that has 900 or fewer students. 
   That is the ideal size for a high school, according to studies that have been done nationally. 
   Part of the funding we are trying to obtain through this legislation would be made available to schools to restructure into smaller learning communities. More and more research is showing that large middle and high schools are alienating and anonymous places for children to learn. This contributes to their disinterest in school, their lack of contact with caring adults. This bill would help large schools revamp themselves into smaller academies, schools within schools. 
   There is a reason why our private schools are doing well. One of those reasons is that most of them are very small. Clearly, we need to learn from that in the public school system. Schools with high dropout rates receive little, if any, Federal assistance in turning themselves around. 
   The vast majority of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act programs are targeted to our elementary schools. We need to restore the ``S,'' which stands for secondary schools, in the ESEA legislation. ESEA stands for Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Unfortunately, we usually forget about the ``secondary'' education aspect of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   Addressing the dropout crisis in my State has become a real priority for me. We have made some progress in the last 2 years but we still have one of the highest dropout rates in the Nation, with over 7,500 students dropping out in the years 1995 and 1996. 
   In the most recent State-level report, New Mexico's annual dropout rate had fallen to under 8 percent, contrary to the statistic I had on the chart, but the rate is nearly 10 percent for Hispanic students and over 8 percent a year for Native American students. 
   There are innovative programs that will help us deal with this problem. In my State, we have a truancy prevention initiative in Clovis, NM. We have a Value Youth Program in Cobre High School in Grant County, NM. In Santa Fe we have a dropout prevention task force. We have a dropout czar who has been appointed in the Albuquerque schools. 
   Clearly, there is much more that can be done. This legislation will provide some of the resources to do that. I believe very strongly that this is something we should do now. 
   Before my cosponsor speaks on this issue, let me reiterate why we need to do this now. We should not be sitting around Congress biding our time and assuming that this is not a problem that deserves emergency attention. This is a problem that deserves emergency attention. It is in our best interests on a bipartisan basis to pass this legislation now, early in the session. I believe we can do that. I very much urge my colleagues to support the amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Visiting high schools, as I know the Senator has done a lot, you run into students on the verge of dropping out. You sit down with students who have dropped out and are back in school and talk to them about the reasons.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I agree entirely with the point. 
   I visited some of these very large schools in my State. The truth is, when they ring the bell to change classes, you almost have to get out of the way, because you are going to get knocked to the floor if you stay right out in the  middle of the hallway; there is such a rush of activity. 
   I do think there is a real problem in the size of our schools. Whenever you get a school that is so large that nobody really pays attention to whether or not a student comes to school in the morning, then the school is too large, in my opinion.

It is a great success story and it shows the value of a small school where you have teachers and administrators and students and parents, all taking ownership in the education process. That is what she was able to create.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is merely a sense-of-the-Senate resolution regarding an element of pay and benefits to service members, and particularly those service men and women who have already served their country or are retired from the military service. In all of our discussions about the need to provide greater incentives for young Americans to serve and to remain in the military, we can't forget how important it is for the Nation to follow through on the promises that we have made to our veterans; to know that the benefits that are promised will be delivered is a very important tool in recruiting and retaining quality personnel in our military. 
   I have been disturbed, as I am sure some of my colleagues have been, by the recent reports in the press that have indicated that getting claims by our Nation's veterans actually resolved and paid by the Veterans' Administration has become an increasing problem. Many veterans are having to wait an unconscionably long period of time before their cases have been resolved. I hear about this in my home State. I was there all last week and heard about it at several points. 
   I recently read of a case that originated in 1967 that has still not been conclusively resolved. Veterans in my State of New Mexico have complained that the time taken to process individual claims has grown considerably worse over the past year. We have a billboard that has been put up in our State by a veterans group complaining about this issue. We have had picketing at congressional offices to raise awareness of this issue. According to the press, the average VA claim has been pending for 151 days nationwide, while in Albuquerque the average has increased to 161 days. 
   I tried to look into the situation and from what I can tell, the prospects for improvement are fairly slim. We have significant staff cutbacks--at least in my State, in Albuquerque--that have made the problem worse. But there have been other factors such as limited training and lack of automation in the VA that have contributed to the situation.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me read a portion of the article which I think tells a lot of the story.  
   In the past, VA officials could deal with demands that the agency improve by redefining its work. Thompson [this is Joseph Thompson, at the VA administration] recalled with a laugh that his first VA boss told him it used to take his office six months to process new claims. ``Now we have cut that to 180 days,'' the official said.  
   Although that is semihumorous, I do think that kind of an evasion of the problem has characterized the VA for too many years. 
   The article pointed out that the Department of Veterans Affairs made significant progress in reducing the time it took to process veterans' claims between the years 1994 and 1997, but since then, the processing time has increased from 133 days on average to the current rate of about 160 days. The administration has called for steps to reduce that, to get it down to an average response time of 92 days, but I am concerned that the erosion of veterans' benefits, the difficulty that our veterans have in seeing those benefits delivered, will weigh against recruitment and retention of the quality personnel that we need in our Armed Forces today. 
   This amendment states that it is the sense of the Senate the Department of Veterans Affairs should conduct a thorough review of the programs, procedures, and policies that govern this processing of veterans claims for benefits, and by June 1 of this year report to Congress on measures to be taken as a result of such a review. 
   I hope by that time we can identify the measures that we need to include in the authorization bill and in the appropriations bill to assist in this effort. 
   My hope is that the result of this review will be that we can reduce this processing time to bring it down to this 92-day average time. This is the administration's goal under the National Performance Review, which has come up with that estimate of the length of time that can be achieved. Obviously, even 92 days is too long. Better training and technology and staffing would allow us to shorten that even more. But, first, let's get to the 92 days. 
   Mr. President, I have discussed this amendment with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. As far as I know, it is agreeable to all concerned. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. Chief Justice, colleagues, I will vote to acquit the President on the two articles of impeachment. I will vote ``no'' for two reasons. First, the House has failed to allege acts by this President which in the context of this case constitute high crimes and misdemeanors. And, second, the House managers allege that the President committed crimes, but they have failed to establish the elements of those crimes. 
   The illicit sexual affair which the President engaged in, and the President's efforts to conceal that affair, are permanent black marks on his Presidency. His actions were deplorable, indefensible, and immoral. 
   But however reprehensible these acts were, they are not impeachable offenses. They did not endanger the Government. They were not the ``stuff'' which the writers of the Constitution had in mind when they used the phrase ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' 
   I think we should act accordingly. Our duty, as I see it, is to look at the record, look at the arguments, judge our own authority as it has been given to us in the Constitution, and then vote either to remove the President or to acquit the President. 
   I want to spend just a minute on this issue of our own authority. As I hear some of the discussion, it seems to me we have lost sight of our own authority. Some have argued that if a university president were to have engaged in these acts, clearly the board of regents of the university would fire that president. Some have said if a chief executive officer of a corporation were to engage in a course of conduct like this, the board of directors of the corporation would fire the chief executive officer. 
   I was visiting the United Parcel Service facility in Albuquerque right before Christmas, and I was talking to various people there. One of the men said, ``I hope you throw the President out of office because if I did what he has done my boss would sure fire me.'' That is the way a lot of us tend to think about this issue. And the discussion here this afternoon has been consistent with that. So I think it is worth focusing on what is wrong with that argument. 
   What is wrong with that argument is that we are not the President's boss. We did not hire the President. The American people hired the President, just like the American people hired each one of us. And we have very limited authority under the Constitution to step in and interfere with the decision of the American people in that regard. I do not believe that the Constitution intended that we would set ourselves up as the judge of the President's character, or to determine whether we believe this President is trustworthy enough to remain in office. That issue is not for us to decide. That was decided by the American people. They have not delegated that decision to us. 
   I am reminded of a story from New Mexico politics. We had a mayor in Albuquerque many years ago named Clyde Tingley. He was very proud of the city zoo, which he had built with city funds. He was showing the zoo to a high official in the Catholic Church one day. And the official at one point said, ``Well, Mr. Mayor, this is an amazing project here. The people of Albuquerque ought to canonize you for this.'' The mayor shot back, ``A bunch of them tried during the last election. But they didn't get away with it.'' 
   I think a bunch of people tried to throw this President out of the White House in the last election because of questions about his character, but they didn't get away with it. These are not new questions about this President. These are questions which have been raised and raised and raised about whether this President is trustworthy, whether this President has demonstrated the character necessary to serve as President. And we really did already have a vote. Every one of us has already voted on whether to remove this President from the White House. Each one of us voted on that issue in November of 1996. I would assume a majority of us in this Chamber voted to remove him from the White House. But the American people chose to keep him there. The American people judged him to be worthy of the job and chose him to be their President for another four years. And they did not authorize us to second guess that decision.  
   So we need to look at our own job here, and say to ourselves, ``Are we here to pass judgment on the President's character, are we here to pass judgment on the President's trustworthiness, are we here to determine whether he is a proper example for young people, or instead are we here to decide whether he has committed high crimes and misdemeanors that would justify removing him from office?'' 
   Senator JOE BIDEN put it very well by saying that this branch of government--the House and Senate--should be very reluctant to reach across and remove the head of another branch of government. That is an extraordinary act. It has never occurred in the history of this country. For good reason it has never occurred. It would be a major mistake for us to take that action at this time. 
   The framers of the Constitution did not intend Congress to remove a duly elected President on the basis of facts such as these, and they were right to deny the Senate that authority. The stability of the executive branch must not be put at risk by Congress, contrary to the ``electoral will'', absent a clear showing of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' by the President. There is no such clear showing here. The proper remedy for this kind of improper conduct is in the voting booth, not here on the floor of the United States Senate. 
   In my view, the House misused the power of impeachment when it voted these articles of impeachment against the President. It would compound the misuse of power if the Senate were to vote to convict and remove. My vote will be to acquit.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the Congress has an important opportunity to provide the youth of America with knowledge and experience that will benefit their future and therefore the future of this country. The Troops-to-Teachers program in the Department of Defense brings the technical talents and experience of retiring military personnel directly to American classrooms to benefit our young people. Former military personnel who enroll in Troops-to-Teachers bring essential mathematical, scientific, and technological expertise that our schools need in order to provide the nation with the technical talent we will need to face the future. This is a ``win-win'' program that brings together age and experience with youth and energy. This program rewards those in uniform who have served the nation by providing them with valuable training assistance needed for the transition to a classroom, and it rewards our young people with service professionals' knowledge and information gained while developing and using the latest technologies. 
   Congress established Troops-to-Teachers in 1993. Since then, over 3,000 men and women retiring from the military have received training to enable them to enter classrooms as qualified teachers. These men and women bring some very important fresh perspectives to American classrooms. About three quarters of the ``Troops'' are males, compared with about 25 percent male teachers in the nation's public school systems. Almost a third of them have science, engineering, and technology backgrounds which are sorely needed in our schools at all levels. About a third of the ``Troops'' are minorities, compared to less than 10 percent minority instructors in our public schools. Many minority retirees and half of the ``Troops'' overall elect to teach in inner city or rural schools--the schools that are often most in need of additional teaching expertise. 
   This bipartisan bill introduced by my esteemed colleague, Senator MCCAIN, would provide the critical financial support retiring service personnel need to gain teacher skills and would assist them in obtaining employment as teachers. I am honored to be an original cosponsor of S. 389, the Troops to Teachers Program Improvement Act of 1999. If enacted, this bill will provide a $2,000 stipend to help offset the cost of earning teacher certification. It would also provide grants to school districts for each new teacher they hire, and would set up Troops-to-Teacher Centers to manage the program in various states. Major grants up to $825,000 would be awarded to Institutions of Higher Education located near military installations to establish teacher certification programs tailored to meet the needs of retiring military personnel. Placement and referral assistance would also be available to personnel who enroll in the program. 
   Mr. President, in 1993 Troops-to-Teachers was an important initiative to help meet the needs of military personnel leaving the military services during the drawdown of our military forces. The drawdown has been completed, but that no longer matters. During the past five years, I believe we now know how valuable this program is regardless of whether our military forces shrink or grow. Retiring military personnel who, by definition, are ``public servants'' have a valuable combination of skills and commitment to apply their public service in another venue--America's classrooms. America's youth and the nation's future will be the beneficiaries. I urge my colleagues to vote to enact the Troops-to-Teachers Improvement Act of 1999 and to extend the authority of this program for five more years. It's a great dividend from America's past and an important investment in America's future.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the ``National Materials Corridor Partnership Act of 1999.'' This bill will establish a comprehensive, multiagency program, led by the Department of Energy, to promote energy efficient, environmentally sound economic development along the US-Mexican border through the research, development, and use of new materials technology. I am also pleased to say that I developed this bill with Congressman GEORGE BROWN, the ranking member of the House Science Committee, who will introduce it in the House of Representatives. 
   As many of you are aware, NAFTA and the globalization of our economy have created a surge of economic  growth all along the 2000 mile US-Mexican border. The border region has become a major center for manufacturing and assembly in many industries, such as microelectronics and automobile parts, as well as a center for many materials industries, such as metals and plastics. However, with this economic growth have come serious problems. Pollution, hazardous wastes, and the inefficient use of resources threaten people's health and the prospects for long term economic growth. For example, there are numerous ``non-attainment'' regions for carbon monoxide and ozone along the border. If you've been down to the El Paso area, where New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico come together, your eyes and nose will tell you something's not as it should be. 
   However, solutions to some of these problems may lie close at hand--in new materials technologies. There are many research institutions along both sides of the border which have expertise in materials technology. In my state alone, Los Alamos and Sandia National Labs, New Mexico Tech, and the University of New Mexico, among others, are all involved in materials research. The importance of materials technology is often underappreciated, perhaps because it is so ubiquitous. But in many cases it is the very wellspring of technological revolutions. We have named various epochs of our history after new materials--the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, the Iron Age--because of how powerfully they can change our lives. Even today, materials science gave us the transistors and fiber optics lines that created the information age, the age of Silicon Valley. Materials technology can be a very powerful tool for improving people's standard of living. 
   Of course, the technologies coming out of this program are unlikely to create a new age, but they will be extremely helpful. For example, there are many family operated brick factories along the border which use very dirty fuels, like old tires, to fire their kilns. This fuel is, as you might guess, extremely polluting. In fact, brick factories are the third most significant source of air pollution along the border, after automobiles and road dust. Los Alamos has looked at redesigning the kilns, a materials processing technology, to use much less fuel and have a lower reject rate. This means less pollution and suggests the possibility of maybe even using natural gas to economically fire the kilns. The end result could be a major reduction in one pollution source. 
   Another well known problem is the solvents the microelectronics industry uses to clean its devices during assembly, which also contribute to smog. Los Alamos has developed a way to substitute supercritical carbon dioxide for these solvents within a closed system. This substitution of materials could reduce energy consumption, processing time, and an important source of industrial pollution. 
   The idea for a US-Mexican program to promote environmentally sound economic growth along the border via materials technology was originally suggested in 1993 by Hans Mark, then of the University of Texas, now the Director of Defense Research and Engineering. While Mexico's economic crisis of the early 90's stalled things, in 1998 the Mexican government revived the idea, proposing a ``Materials Corridor Partnership Initiative'' to the US-Mexican Binational Commission, and offering $1 million of funding for it if the United States would do the same. While an informal group with many research organizations, the ``Materials Corridor Council,'' has organized itself in response, the US government has yet to pick up on the Mexican offer. My legislation is meant to kick start the ``Materials Corridor Partnership Initiative'' inside the federal government. 
   So, what are the features of the program? It would be an interagency program led by the Department of Energy (DOE). An interagency program is a good way to bring various talents to bear on complex problems. DOE is a good choice to lead this program because its energy efficiency and national security missions, including nuclear cleanup, have led it to develop a large array of materials technologies to improve energy efficiency, reduce pollution, or handle hazardous wastes. In fact, in 1996, DOE was the largest civilian funder of materials research. Under DOE's leadership, the State Department, Environmental Protection Agency, National Science Foundation, and National Institutes of Standards and Technology will bring their complementary capabilities to the program as diplomats, environmental scientists, basic researchers, and standards experts. 
   The program will focus on materials technology to improve energy efficiency, minimize or eliminate pollution and global climate change gases, and use recycled materials as primary materials through three types of projects. First, there will be applied research projects aimed at showing the feasibility of a materials technology in order to hasten its adoption by industry. These projects will typically be led by companies, and to ensure the firms are really interested in the technology, the federal government will pay no more than 50% of the cost of such a project. Second, there will be basic research projects to discover new knowledge useful in creating these materials technologies; these will typically be led by an academic or other research institutions. Third, there will education and training projects to train border scientists, engineers, and workers in these new technologies. To cover this, the bill authorizes $5 million per year for five years. 
   Finally, this program will be a cooperative program with Mexico. Our border is, by definition, something we share. We share its opportunities and its problems, so it makes sense to share the solutions. Pollution needs no passport. Now, perhaps we will still be able to pick up Mexico's offer of $1 million for this program, but, in any event, the bill calls upon the Secretary of Energy to encourage Mexican organizations to contribute to it. And, to foster US-Mexican cooperation whenever possible, the bill allows US funds to be used by organizations located in Mexico provided Mexican organizations contribute significant resources to that particular project. Working closely with the Mexicans to solve our common problems will be much more effective than trying to go it alone. 
   Mr. President, I think the ``National Materials Corridor Partnership Act of 1999'' is an idea whose time has finally arrived. I hope my colleagues, particularly from the states along the US-Mexican border, will join me in supporting this important piece of legislation. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be placed in the RECORD.

    Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to amend the National Trails System Act to designate El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro as a National Historic Trail. Senator DOMENICI is once again a cosponsor of this legislation which enjoyed bipartisan support in both the Senate and in the House in the last Congress. I want to thank Senator DOMENICI for his continued support of this bill. 
   While we passed this bill last year in the Senate, it appeared that there just wasn t enough time for the House to go through its process on the bill at the end of the 105th Congress. My hope is that we will be able to move this bill through the Senate quickly this year and that the House will pass it as well. 
   While this legislation is important to my home state of New Mexico, it also contributes to the national dialogue on the history of this country and who we are as a people. In history classes across the country, children learn about the establishment of European settlements on the East Coast, and the east to west migration which occurred under the banner of Manifest Destiny. However, the story of the northward exploration and settlement of this country by the Spanish is often overlooked. This legislation recognizes this important chapter in American history. 
   In the 16th century, building upon a network of trade routes used by the indigenous Pueblos along the Rio Grande, Spanish explorers established a migration route into the interior of the continent which they called ``El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro'', the Royal Road of the Interior. In 1598, almost a decade before the first English colonists landed at Jamestown, Virginia, Don Juan de Onate led a Spanish expedition which established the northern portion of El Camino Real which became the main route for communication and trade between the colonial Spanish capital of Mexico City and the Spanish provincial capitals at San Juan de Los Caballeros, San Gabriel and then Santa Fe, New Mexico. 
   For the next 223 years, until 1821, El Camino Real facilitated the exploration, conquest, colonization, settlement, religious conversion, and military occupation of the Spanish colonial borderlands. In the 17th century, caravans of wagons and livestock struggled for months to cross the desert and bring supplies up El Camino Real to missions, mining towns and settlements in New Mexico. As with later Anglo settlers who travelled from St. Louis to California during the 1800s, the Spanish settlers faced very harsh conditions moving into what would become the American Southwest. On one section known as the Jornada del Muerto, or Journey of Death, they traveled for 90 miles without water, shelter, or firewood. 
   The Spanish influence from those persevering colonists can still be seen today in the ethnic and cultural traditions of the southwestern United States. 
   As we enter the 21st century, it's essential that we embrace the diversity of people and cultures that make up our country. It is the source of our dynamism and strength. The inclusion of this trail into the National Historic Trail system is an important step towards advancing our understanding of our rich cultural history.

   Mr. President, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA, was originally enacted in 1990 as a means of compensating the individuals who suffered from exposure to radiation as a result of the U.S. government's nuclear testing program and federal uranium mining activities. While the government can never fully compensate for the loss of a life or a reduction in the quality of life, RECA serves as a cornerstone for the national apology Congress extended to those adversely affected by the various radiation tragedies. In keeping with the spirit of that apology, the legislation I introduce today will further correct existing injustices and provide compassionate compensation for those whose lives and health were sacrificed as part of our nation's effort to win the cold war. 
   During the period of 1947 to 1961, the Federal Government controlled all aspects of the production of nuclear fuel. One such aspect was the mining of uranium in New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and Utah. Even though the Federal Government had adequate knowledge of the hazards involved in uranium mining, these miners, many of whom were Native Americans, were sent into inadequately ventilated mines with virtually no instruction regarding the dangers of ionizing radiation. These miners had no idea of those dangers. Consequently, they inhaled radon particles that eventually yielded high doses of ionizing radiation. As a result, these miners have a substantially elevated cancer rate and incidence of incapacitating respiratory disease. The health effects of uranium mining in the fifties and sixties remain the single greatest concern of many former uranium miners and millers and their families and friends. 
   In 1990, I was pleased to co-sponsor the original RECA legislation here in the Senate to provide compassionate compensation to uranium miners. I was very optimistic that after years of waiting, some degree of redress would be given to the thousands of miners in my state of New Mexico. Subsequently, I chaired the Senate oversight hearing on this issue in Shiprock, N.M. for the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee in 1993 and began to learn that while our efforts in 1990 were well intentioned they were not proving to be as effective as hoped. I additionally heard from many of my constituents that the program was not working as intended and that changes were necessary. To that end, I worked to facilitate changes in the regulatory and administrative areas. 
   Unfortunately, I have continued to hear from many of my constituents that the program still does not work as intended. I have received compelling letters of need from constituents telling of the many barriers in the current statute that lead to denial of compensation. Letters come from widows unable to access the current compensation. Miners tied to oxygen tanks, in respiratory distress or dying from cancer write to tell me how they have been denied compensation under the current act. Additionally, family members write of the pain of fathers who worked in uranium processing mills. They recount how their fathers came home covered in the ``yellow cake'' or uranium oxide that was floating in the air of the mills. The story of their fathers' cancers and painful breathing are vivid in these letters but the current act does not address their needs. 
   Their points are backed by others as well. In fact, my legislation incorporates findings by the Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) which has, since 1990, 
   enlarged scientific evidence about radiogenic cancers and the health effects of radiation exposure. In other words, because of their good work, we know more now than we did in 1990 and we need to make sure the compensation we provide keeps pace with our medical knowledge. The government has the responsibility to compensate all those adversely affected and who have suffered health problems because they were not adequately informed of the risks they faced while mining, milling, and transporting uranium ore. 
   Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today is a starting point for amending the current Act designed with specific elements to better serve the individuals who apply for compensation under the Act. The legislation is designed to simplify RECA and broaden the scope of individuals who are eligible for compensation. 
   Mr. President, I would like to cite several of the key provisions in the Radiation Exposure Compensation Improvement Act of 1999. Currently RECA covers those exposed to radiation released in underground uranium mines that were providing uranium for the primary use and benefit of the nuclear weapons program of the U.S. government. The legislation would make all uranium workers eligible for compensation including above ground miners, millers, and transport workers. I am very concerned about the need to expand compensation to the categories of workers not covered by the current  law, specifically those in above ground, open pit mines, mill workers, and those employed to transport uranium ore. There is overwhelming evidence that these workers have developed cancer and other diseases as a result of their exposure to uranium. While attempts have been made to get the scientific data necessary to substantiate the link between their work situation and their health problems, barriers have been encountered and I am told that data will not be readily available. I believe that it is necessary to move forward in this area and not deny further compensation awaiting study results that in the end may not be deemed to be statistically valid because of the difficulty in obtaining access to records and the millers themselves. 
   RECA currently covers individuals termed ``downwinders'' who were in the areas of Nevada, Utah, and Arizona affected by atmospheric nuclear testing in the 1950's. This bill expands the geographical area eligible for compensation to include the Navajo Reservation because, based on a recent report of the National Cancer Institute, Navajo children during the 1950's received extremely high Iodine-131 thyroid doses during the period of heaviest fallout from the Nevada Test site. In addition, the bill expands the compensable diseases for the downwind population by adding salivary gland, urinary bladder, brain, colon, and ovarian cancers. 
   Currently, the law has disproportionately high levels of radiation exposure requirements for miners to qualify for compensation as compared to the ``downwinders.'' My legislation would set a standard of proof for uranium workers that is more realistic given the availability of mining and mill data. The bill also removes the provision that only permits a claim for respiratory disease if the uranium mining occurred on a reservation. Thus, the bill will allow for further filing of a claim by those miners, millers, and transport workers who did not have a work history on a reservation. In addition, the bill would change the current law so that requirements for written medical documentation is updated to allow for use of high resolution CAT scans and allow for written diagnoses by physicians in either the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Indian Health Service to be considered conclusive. 
   In 1990, we joined together in a bipartisan, bicameral effort and assured passage of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA). Now we put forward this comprehensive amendment to RECA to correct omission, make RECA consistent with current medical knowledge, and to address what have become administrative borrow stories for the claimants. I look forward to the debate in the Senate on this issue and hope that we can move to amend the current statute to ensure our original intent--fair and rapid compensation to those who served their country so well.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak in support of this important legislation being introduced today by my friend from New York, Senator MOYNIHAN. This bill turns into law what we all recognize is the only practical way to count our citizens in the decennial census. There is no question--the science is unequivocal--sampling is the only way to assure an accurate census. 
   Not only does sampling provide a better census, it costs less than all other alternative methods--as much as $3 billion less. What could be clearer? Sampling gives a better answer at a lower cost. This bill ought to pass the Senate unanimously. 
   Mr. President, the Constitution says the census shall be conducted in a manner that Congress shall by law direct. The recent Supreme Court case found that under the current law sampling may be used for all aspects of the census except for the decision on how many representatives each state will have. In fact, current law says sampling shall be used for every other purpose of the census. 
   My state now has three House members and that number isn't going to change after this census one way or the other. However, we now know New Mexico had the second highest undercount rate in the 1990 census--3.1 percent, or nearly 50,000 New Mexicans were simply left out, including 20,000 children. Among New Mexico's native American community, the undercount rate was an astounding 9 percent. This undercount is literally costing New Mexico millions of dollars every year. 
   In Albuquerque, our largest city, 12,000 men, women, and children were left out. Nationwide, 4 million Americans were not accounted for. 
   Mr. President, this massive undercount is unacceptable to New Mexico and should be unacceptable to every Senator, especially when the Census Bureau has a solution that is tried, tested, and reliable. I believe every citizen counts, and every citizen should be counted. 
   Federal funding for education, transportation, crime prevention and other priorities is allocated to states based on population. The majority of people overlooked in the past census are poor, the very citizens we must assure are not being left out. If the existing undercount is repeated in future censuses, New Mexico will again be denied its fair share of critical federal funds. 
   Under current law we can have a two-number census, one without sampling for apportionment and one with sampling for all other purposes. I can appreciate why some people don't want a two-number census. The country would be better served with only a single-number census as long as it's the best number the Census Bureau can come up with. However, some in Congress would use the appropriations process to stymie the census. 
   Mr. President, the census is done only once per decade, it is too important to decide this issue as part of the annual appropriation process. This bill will assure that the Census Bureau has available the very best tools for this important task. Science-based sampling is the only way to give America the quality we demand in our census. It is inconceivable to me that anyone would support a second-rate census. 
   I am pleased to support this bill, and I hope the Senate will take prompt action on it. I also urge the House to move forward quickly to pass this important legislation. I thank Mr. MOYNIHAN for his efforts.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak in support of this important legislation being introduced today by my friend from Utah, Senator HATCH. The bill authorizes the construction of a much needed interpretive visitor center at the Four Corners Monument. An identical bill passed the Senate unanimously last September. 
   As I am sure all Senators know, the Four Corners is the only place in America where the boundaries of four states meet in one spot. The monument is located on the Navajo and Ute Mountain Ute Reservations and currently operated as a Tribal Park. 
   Nearly a quarter of a million people visit this unique site every year. However, currently there are no facilities for tourists at the park and nothing that explains the very special features of the Four Corners region. This bill authorizes the Department of the Interior to contribute $2 million toward the construction of an interpretive center and basic facilities for visitors. 
   Mr. President, the Four Corners Monument is more than a geographic curiosity. It also serves as a focal point for some of the most beautiful landscape and significant cultural attractions in our country. An interpretive center will help visitors appreciate the many special features of the region. For example, within a short distance of the monument are the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde, Colorado; the Red Rock and Natural Bridges areas of Utah; and in Arizona, Monument Valley and Canyon de Chelly. The beautiful San Juan River, one of the top trout streams in the Southwest, flows through Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. 
   In my state of New Mexico, both the legendary mountain known as Shiprock and the Chaco Canyon Culture National Historical Park are a short distance from the Four Corners. 
   Mr. President, Shiprock is one of the best known and most beautiful landmarks in New Mexico. The giant volcanic monolith rises nearly 2000 feet straight up from the surrounding plain. Ancient legend tells us the mountain was created when a giant bird settled to earth and turned to stone. In the Navajo language, the mountain is named Tse' bi t' ai or the Winged Rock. Early Anglo settlers saw the mountain's soaring spires and thought they resembled the sails of a huge ship, so they named it Shiprock. 
   The Four Corners is also the site of Chaco Canyon. Chaco was an important Anasazi cultural center from about 900 through 1130 A.D. Pre-Columbian civilization in the Southwest reached its greatest development there. The massive stone ruins, containing hundreds of rooms, attest to Chaco's cultural importance. As many as 7,000 people may have lived at Chaco at one time. Some of the structures are thought to house ancient astronomical observatories to mark the passage of the seasons. The discovery of jewelry from Mexico and California and a vast network of roads is evidence of the advanced trading carried on at Chaco. Perhaps, the most spectacular accomplishment at Chaco was in architecture. Pueblo Bonito, the largest structure, contains more than 800 rooms and 32 kivas. Some parts are more than five stories high. The masonry work is truly exquisite. Stones were so finely worked and fitted together that no mortar was needed. Remarkably, all this was accomplished without metal tools or the wheel. 
   Mr. President, 1999 marks the centennial year of the first monument at the Four Corners. An interpretive center is urgently needed today to showcase the history, culture, and scenery of this very special place. New facilities at the monument will attract visitors and help stimulate economic development throughout the region. 
   The legislation the Senate passed last year had wide-spread support from state, tribal, and local interests. 
   Mr. President, I hope the Senate will again take prompt action on this bill. I also urge the House to move forward this year to pass this important legislation. I am pleased to co-sponsor this bill with Senator HATCH, and I thank him for his efforts.

   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning the Military Recruiting and Retention Improvement Act introduced today by my  esteemed colleague, Senator CLELAND. During the last session, the Joint Chiefs testified to the need for improving pay and retirement for military personnel as a means to improvement recruitment and retention of service members. This bill proposes some important steps to implement those needs, including the extension of critical bonus and special pay authorities, and deserves careful consideration by the members of the Senate. It is generally acknowledged, however, that the way to improve recruitment and retention goes beyond a bigger paycheck. Senator CLELAND's bill includes an important provision directed toward other motivations to choose military service. I'm speaking of enhancements to the Montgomery GI bill for education benefits. 
   Mr. President, this bill will provide major new educational benefits to service members and their families that will serve as an incentive to attract high quality recruits to the military. By improving the educational attainment of service personnel and their families, the nation stands to benefit in the long term with a better educated workforce. Surely, we are now able to observe the benefits of full GI bill assistance for veterans of World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam war who were able to receive sufficient resource to complete college and postgraduate degree programs in compensation for military service. The nation as a whole has prospered by the talented and trained workforce who benefitted from the GI bill. 
   Senator CLELAND's bill goes beyond even those benefits which, I believe were only extended to service members themselves. According to the legislation proposed, the military services can choose to permit service members to transfer those educational benefits to immediate family members should they choose not to use them for themselves. Again, I believe the nation's labor force will benefit greatly from such flexibility, not to mention the families of our men and women in uniform. 
   Educational benefits provided by the Military Recruiting and Retention Improvement Act would be increased to reflect the rising cost of education. Monthly benefits would increase from $528 to $600 per month for member who serve at least three years, and from $429 to $498 per month for those who serve less than three years. Lump sum tuition assistance could also be provided under certain circumstances. 
   Mr. President, these matters are really matters requiring bipartisan cooperation in the Congress that will benefit our service personnel and the Nation. I understand that Senator WARNER, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, has introduced similar legislation to that offered by Senator CLELAND, myself, and others. I am hopeful that we will review these bills in detail in the Armed Services Committee to determine the best way to proceed to improve recruitment and retention that lies at the heart of both bills. As I indicated, recruitment and retention are affected by a wide variety of causes, only some of which may be financial. Senator CLELAND's bill calls for an annual report on the impact of the provisions of the bill on recruitment and retention. I believe such an assessment is required. I believe as well, that before the Senate approves legislation, however, it needs to have a more informed view of factors affecting recruitment and retention and of the potential impact of increasing assistance to military personnel on pay and benefits provided to defense and government civilian employees. A report is due soon from the Department of Defense addressing some of those issues. I urge my colleague to pay close attention to its findings and seek answers to the additional questions I have posed in determining how to proceed with legislation that meets national security and budgetary requirements. 
   By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself, Mr. MOYNIHAN, and Mr. MACK):
