   Mr. HELMS. As the Senator from Delaware knows, the Southeast High Speed Rail Corridor, designated in title 23 U.S.C., Section 104(d)(2), is a vital part of the national transportation system. Within the corridor the Charlotte-Greensboro-Raleigh segment plays a crucial and essential role in linking the Northeast Corridor with other corridors. 
   New modern world class stations in Raleigh and Charlotte as well as rail infrastructure investments linked to the Greensboro station will enhance the safety and efficiency of the system. It is my understanding that station investments are directly eligible projects under the proposed legislation.

    Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this conference report is a splendid example of Congress reasserting its moral underpinning in U.S. foreign policy. It will effectively combat the disgrace of women and children being smuggled, bought and sold as pathetic commodities--most often for the human beasts who thrive on prostitution. 
   The conference report deals with all aspects of sex trafficking, from helping victims to punishing perpetrators. 
   Significantly, the legislation calls on the executive branch to identify clearly the nations where trafficking is the most prevalent. For regimes that know there is a problem within their borders, but refuse to do anything about it, there will be consequences. 
   No country has a right to foreign aid. The worst trafficking nations must have such U.S. aid cut off. And if they don't receive U.S. bilateral aid, then their officials will be barred from coming onto American soil. Our principles demand these significant and important symbolic steps. 
   Some may complain that this is another ``sanction'' in the alleged proliferation of sanctions Congress passes. But denying taxpayer-supported foreign aid is not a ``sanction.'' Foreign aid is not an entitlement. 
   I commend Senator BROWNBACK for his unyielding efforts to help the victims of sex trafficking, which is nothing less than modern-day slavery. The inevitable controversies over differences between House and Senate bills were ironed out because of Senator BROWNBACK's leadership. 
   Time and again, Senator BROWNBACK personally intervened with conferees, with our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, and with the House and Senate leadership in order to obtain agreement on this important legislation.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it is clear that a fair vote count in this weekend's elections will result in victory for the candidate of the opposition forces. Mr. Vojislav Kostunica. The people of Yugoslavia clearly have voted for democratic change, and the time has come for Yugoslavia's brutal dictator, Slobodan Milosevic, to have the decency to accept the will of his people and leave office peacefully. 
   Not surprisingly, Milosevic has indicated he intends to do no such thing. I fully expect him to do everything in his power to steal this election to enable him to remain in power. 
   In order to support the majority of Serbs who voted for peace and democracy, I urge my colleagues to support the Serbia Democratization Act--legislation that I introduced more than 18 months ago--designed to undermine the murderous Milosevic regime and thereby support democratic change in Serbia. 
   The Serbia Democratization Act calls for the United States to identify and give aid to the democratic forces in Serbia opposing Milosevic's tyranny, including independent media and non-governmental organizations in Serbia. And it makes clear that unless and until there is a democratic government in Yugoslavia, the United States will maintain the sanctions that we have in place today. 
   When the Serbian people finally gain the government in Belgrade that they voted for this weekend--a government based on freedom, democracy and rule of law--I will lead an effort in Congress to ensure that the United States provides them with substantial support to assist their nation's democratic transition. I am hopeful that day will come soon. 
   I also commend the important role played by Montenegro in this weekend's elections. The decision by the vast majority of Montenegrins to boycott this election indicates the level of support in that republic for the course of democratic, free-market reforms proposed by President Djukanovic. 
   Montenegro deserves the support of the United States, and can serve as an example to the people of Serbia regarding the benefits they could enjoy in a post-Milosevic era.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, countless Americans will welcome the news that the Senate last night ratified the Treaty of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. This Treaty was approved by our Foreign Relations Committee in April. 
   In addition, the Senate also approved unanimous final passage of the Intercountry Adoption Implementation Act--which was likewise unanimously approved by the House of Representatives this past Monday. 
   I offered the Intercountry Adoption Implementation act a year ago--along with Senator LANDRIEU, because this legislation will provide, for the first time, a rational structure for intercountry adoption. 
   Mr. President, this significant legislation is intended to build some accountability into agencies that provide intercountry adoption services in the United States while strengthening the hand of the Secretary of State in ensuring that U.S. adoption agencies engage in an ethical manner to find homes for children. 
   In addition, Mr. President, both the Senate and the House agreed that sole responsibility for implementing the requirements of the Hague Convention, rests with the U.S. Secretary of State. Although, some advocated early on, a role for various government agencies, I believe that spreading responsibility among various agencies would have undermined the effective implementation of the Hague Convention. 
   Mr. President, passage of this significant legislation would not have been possible without the assistance from several talented people in both the Senate and House. 
   In particular, of course, I extend my sincere appreciation to Senator LANDRIEU (and her staff). Senator LANDRIEU and I have worked together on issues of adoption since her arrival in the Senate in 1997. 
   Senator BIDEN, ranking minority member of the Foreign Relations Committee, has been exceedingly helpful (as has his staff) in finalizing the Intercountry Adoption Implementation Act. 
   It's always a privilege to work with our colleagues in the House--and especially regarding passage of this Act. The Honorable BILL GILMAN, the distinguished chairman of the House International Relations Committee; Congressman SAM GEJDENSON, ranking minority member on the House International Relations; Congressmen DAVE CAMP and WILLIAM DELAHUNT; and, last but by no means least, my good friend, Congressman RICHARD BURR--who offered the original Senate companion bill in the House. 
   From my own Senate family, the former legislative counsel for the Foreign Relations Committee (now counsel for Senate Intelligence), Patricia McNerney; and Michele DeKonty, the very special lady who, in every sense, my right-hand lady. 
   Mr. President, this legislation now goes to President Clinton. I am hopeful that ratification and implementation of the Hague Convention will encourage more intercountry adoptions, while protecting all who are involved in the process.

   Mr. HELMS. Forty-eight years. I have only been here 28 years, and I have the same opinion the Senator does about the State Department. I have said many times how proud I am that the distinguished Senator from West Virginia is a native of North Carolina because he was born there. He moved at a very early age to West Virginia, a State which he has represented ably. But I admire the Senator for many reasons. We don't always agree. But I will tell you one thing. This Senator is dedicated. When I say ``this Senator,'' I mean Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. He is dedicated to the proposition that this Senate shall operate in an orderly way. He made some remarks today about the unusual character of the way the voting time on this measure was arranged, and I objected to it as he did. I think it ill becomes the Senate. I hope it never happens again.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate will reach the end of the debate on H.R. 4444, a bill to legislate permanent normal trade relations to and with the People's Republic of China. 
   The debate, yes, will end this afternoon. But I can assure you that just now beginning is a debate about the future of United States and China relations. 
   The outcome of today's vote was well known long before the first syllable of debate resulted. I recall the objection stated by Senator BYRD, and I objected to the procedure as well because it was a pro forma action about how the consideration of H.R. 4444 was going to be conducted and the concluding result was to be final passage without even one amendment to be added. 
   I don't think that is becoming of the Senate, but I shall not refer to the Senate's posture as a conspiracy, but it is a first cousin to one, and I remain exceedingly troubled by what has transpired. I fervently hope it never happens to the Senate again. 
   The outcome of this debate was decided before any Senator even sought to be recognized by the Presiding Officer to make his or her case for or against PNTR. But all that aside, the Senate will shortly vote, and I trust that all Senators' votes will be cast with the courage of their real convictions and not convictions determined by others for them. 
   I commend my friend, the Senator from Delaware, Mr. ROTH, and the Senator from New York, Mr. MOYNIHAN, for their defense of ``their'' bill. Both Bill Roth and Pat Moynihan have been exceedingly accommodating to me and to other Senators. 
   But there was a stacked deck that guaranteed approval of H.R. 4444. It was evident from the start. I shall always be grateful to Senators who endeavored to ensure a serious debate, and for their courage and resolve. 
   I express my admiration to, among others, Senator BYRD and Senator THOMPSON, Senators Bob Smith, John Kyl, Paul Wellstone. These Senators were Churchillian in their efforts. Sir Winston Churchill demonstrated seven or eight decades ago that there would be no stacked deck when he courageously called for a principled confrontation against the despotism of Nazi Germany. 
   In the course of the Senate's debate, we did succeed in making an indisputable record concerning the deplorable state of human rights in China. And we did succeed in exposing the heinous practice of forced abortion. And we did succeed in focusing the attention of our Nation, and I think of the world, on the peril of China's proliferation. 
   If I may again mention Mr. Churchill, the press paid him scant attention when he cast his warnings about the trip of the Prime Minister of Great Britain to Munich where he met with Adolph Hitler, and then came back to London for a big press conference proclaiming ``Peace in our time.'' Mr. Chamberlain proclaimed that that fellow Hitler was someone the British people could live with.  
   Mr. President, I sincerely fear that this bill will have serious consequences because of its profound implications for the future of U.S.-China relations, relations totally unlike the happy ones described by the bill's advocates. 
   The interests of various American businesses will, no doubt, be served, but to those of us who have worked in the Senate Chamber during this debate, it is highly questionable whether the national interests of either the United States or the interests of the people of China--the people of China--will be served. 
   As I mention ever so often, when I was a little boy I was interested in the Chinese people and their culture. That interst grew as the years went by. During my 28 years as a U.S. Senator, I have met with and worked with hundreds of Chinese students, delightful young people, bright and without exception having expressed profound hopes and prayers that their homeland can one day enjoy the freedom that the American people have by inheritance. 
   So clearly and without a trace of equivocation, I have the deepest admiration for the Chinese people--I repeat that for emphasis--and it is my fervent hope and my prayer that one day they will be freed from the brutal dictatorship that now controls their lives. 
   I sincerely believe that the majority of the American people share that feeling. I have had people stop me in the corridors. Just a few moments ago, I had the Commander of the American Legion from my State stopped me to say that he agreed with my position. I hear it over and over--in the mail we receive, in the e-mail, the faxes and letters. 
   Mr. President, there is unquestionably an enormous potential for a deep and lasting relationship of respect between the people of our country and the people of China. I have long been convinced that what separates us is not animosity between our peoples. 
   It is the Communist dictatorship in Beijing which neither speaks for, nor rules by, the consent of the Chinese people. 
   Today in China, millions of courageous people struggle for democracy and for religious freedom and for basic human rights. Because when they dare to do so, they are beaten and they are jailed; they are tortured and often murdered. It is for these freedom-seeking Chinese that I stand here today. 
   Their interests, not the interests of corporate America, are my priority. And that is why I have not been able to support H.R. 4444. Mr. President, there are many bureaucratic contacts and exchanges between the U.S. and the Chinese Government. Some of my good friends, and friends of many of us in this Senate, have traveled to China time and time again, exchanged toasts with Chinese Communist leaders, clinked glasses of wine; but the attitude of the Communist Government has never changed. 
   It still throws decent Chinese citizens in jail. It still denies the Chinese people the most basic political liberties. So giving permanent normal trade relations to the Government of China will indeed destroy an important lever that we now have, and have had, to influence Chinese behavior. We are tossing it aside. 
   The advocates of PNTR have repeatedly declared that this enactment will help the cause of democracy and human rights in China. Those declarations will now be put to the test and the ball will be in the court of Beijing. With today's vote, the Chinese Government is being given an historic opportunity to change the course of U.S.-Chinese relations for the good. 
   The Chinese Government has not confronted such a challenge since Beijing's tragic decision--remember--in Tiananmen Square, when a tank crushed a peaceful student protest, crushed that young man into paste. That was 11 years ago and nothing has changed since. 
   To seize upon this moment and make me be proven wrong, China must act quickly, not merely to open its markets as required under the agreement with the United States but open its society as well, to demonstrate a commitment to humane treatment 
   of its people at home, and a more benign and peaceful approach to its relationship with its neighboring countries. The Chinese Government must cease the suppression of religious liberties. 
   Even the Washington Post commented on that this morning in a well-written, well-thought-out editorial. The Chinese Government must put an end to the abhorrent practice of forced abortion. And with regard to the democratic Government of Taiwan, China must demonstrate that it is committed to peaceful dialog as being the only option for resolving differences between Taiwan and the Communist mainland. 
   Mr. President, I would be less than honest if I did not confess my great apprehension that there will be little if any real change by the Chinese Government as a result of our passing this measure. But if real change is to take place, the United States must more aggressively support the aspirations of the hundreds of millions of Chinese people who want their homeland to become a nation that is both great and good. 
   We must reach out to those people who are struggling for a freer, more open and more democratic China, and make clear to them that the American people stand with them. We must make clear to the Chinese Government that it will not be in their interests to continue their oppression of their own people, that in the long run totalitarian dictatorship cannot be tolerated. 
   So if the advocates of PNTR prove to be wrong, and if nothing changes in China in the wake of the Senate's final approval of PNTR this afternoon, I will devote whatever strength and influence I may possess to limit any and all conceivable benefits that this legislation may hold for the Chinese Communist Government. 
   I am nearly through, but I want to emphasize that, like many others in the Senate, I am a father and a grandfather. I am a grandfather who yearns for a peaceful world for my family and for all Americans. 
   Better relations with China are an important hope of a peaceful world, but not better relations at any price. Too often in history, some of the world's great democracies have sought to coexist with, even to appease, dangerous and tyrannical regimes. 
   I mentioned at the outset Winston Churchill, who took his stand against his country's Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain who had visited with Adolf Hitler in Munich, then returning to London proclaiming there would be ``peace in our time'' and that Britain need not fear Nazi Germany. 
   There was that one man who stood up and said no, Winston Churchill, who was to lead the free world into combat in one of the worst tyrannies history has ever known. 
   We must not repeat the mistake of Britain's Prime Minister seven decades ago. I have absolutely nothing against American business men and women making a profit. I want them to make a profit. I believe in the free enterprise system. I believe I have demonstrated that in all of my career. 
   But the safety and security of the American people must come first through the principles of this country which were laid down by our Founding Fathers. That safety and security will be assured ultimately not by appeasement, not by the hope of trade at any cost, but by dealing with Communist China without selling out the very moral and spiritual principles that made America great in the first place. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, during the course of the Senate's consideration of handing China the permanent most favored nation status--that is what it amounts to; just giving it to them--several of us have highlighted the abhorrent human rights record of the Communist Chinese Government. 
   China's practice of forcing its women citizens to submit to abortions and/or sterilization--usually both--is not only revolting; it is shameful, because it is a practice that has been repeatedly documented for 20 years now. In fact, the most recent State Department Human Rights Report on China contains a detailed account of the cruel, coercive measures used by Chinese officials, such as forced abortion, forced sterilization, and detention of those who even dare to resist this inhumane treatment. 
   My pending amendment proposes to put the Senate on record as condemning the Chinese dictatorship's barbaric treatment of its own people. 
   Although the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party officially says--and I say absurdly says, and they say it--that forced abortion has no role in China's population control, it is, to the contrary, a known fact that the Chinese Government does indeed, absolutely, and without question, force women to submit to forced abortion and to sterilization. Communist Chinese authorities strictly enforce birth quotas imposed on its citizens. They pay rewards to informants tattling on the women for having more than one child while making certain that local population control officials using coercion are left absolutely unrestrained in the way they conduct themselves. 
   For example, I have in hand reports of this cruel situation from many Chinese citizens. I received this information in my capacity as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. These citizens have witnessed firsthand countless episodes of this bloody cruelty. A defector from China's population control program testified before a House International Relations Committee hearing in June a couple of years ago that the Central Government policy in China strongly encourages local officials to use every conceivable coercive tactic in enforcing the one-child policy. They have described to me in person the results of women crying and begging for mercy simply because they were prepared to deliver a child. 
   Furthermore, Communist China's population control officials routinely punish women who have conceived a child without Government authorization. They subject the women to extreme psychological pressures, enormous fines which they can't possibly pay, along with the loss of their jobs, and with all sorts of other physical threats. 
   If women in China dare to resist the population control policy on religious grounds, they have to confront especially gruesome punishment. Amnesty International reported to us, and publicly, that Catholic women in two villages were subjected to 
   torture, to sexual abuse, and to the detention of their relatives for daring to resist China's population program.  
   Very credible reports indicate that if ``these'' methods aren't enough to convince women in China to abide by the regime's population control program, forced abortions are carried out publicly in the very late stages of pregnancy. 
   I think it was back in 1994 when it began. Since that time, forced abortion has been used in Communist China not only to regulate the number of children born but under the policy known as the ``Natal and Health Care Law,'' pregnancies are terminated on a mandatory basis if a Government bureaucrat arbitrarily declares that an unborn child is defective. Nobody checks on him. He doesn't have to present any evidence. He just says the child is defective. That is it. 
   I believe it is common knowledge that I am a resolute defender of the sanctity of life. I have tried to do that ever since I have been a Senator, and prior to that time. But the pending amendment is not merely about life; it seems to me it is about liberty. Bureaucrats terrorizing women into unwanted abortions or medical operations permanently depriving them of their capability to have children, it seems to me, is the ultimate appalling affront to freedom. 
   My pending amendment urges the President to ask the Chinese Government to stop this ungodly practice. My amendment also calls on the President to urge the Chinese Government to stop putting Chinese women in jail whose crime is resisting abortion of a child or sterilization. 
   I think this is a modest measure. It doesn't condition PNTR on China's Government changing its abhorrent behavior. It simply asks the President of the United States to say to the Chinese that we want to defend the rights of women in China and ask the Chinese officials to see that that happens. 
   The question that comes to my mind is, Can the Senate proceed to award China with permanent trade privileges while refusing to express our revulsion at a basic violation of women's freedom? 
   The amendment I shall propose and call up in just a moment will not at all endanger passage of PNTR. We need not worry about that. I don't think PNTR ought to be approved at this time. But this amendment will not forbid or do any danger to the enactment of PNTR. It will simply be a matter of the Senate doing and saying the right thing before it happens.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the pending amendment proposes that the Secretary of Commerce be requested to consult with American businesses on drafting and adopting a voluntary code of conduct for doing business in China. Such a voluntary code of conduct would follow internationally recognized human rights, work against discrimination and forced labor, support the principles of free enterprise and the rights of workers to organize, and discourage mandatory political indoctrination in the workplace. 
   The purpose of this amendment is this: So often in this debate, the argument has been advanced that only by exposing the Chinese Government and the Chinese people to our values through expanded trade and investment can we hope to bring about political change in China, and the only way we can help that desired achievement is to do as the amendment proposes. 
   I have always been skeptical about this because businesses are not in the business of expanding democracy. I am not going to comment on what the businesses support in PNTR and the way it is being supported. Be that as it may, businesses exist, quite frankly, to make money. I certainly have no problem with that. But let's be honest on the process of what we are doing here in this Senate Chamber. American businesses, even if viewed in the most charitable light, are not likely to lift a finger to promote democracy in China. Unfortunately, it is difficult to view some of the American businesses charitably when we examine their attitude toward China. If I step on some toes here, I am sorry, but I believe I must have my say for the benefit of the Senate. 
   The powerful lure of potential huge Chinese markets has obviously clouded the judgment of some of our top companies and some of their executives. With regret, I have concluded that some of America's top businesses have been willing to supplicate to the Communist Government of China, hoping that the Chinese Government will allow them someday to make a profit there. 
   I want the Senate to consider the following statements and actions by American businesses in China, which are stated as findings in the pending amendment: 
   No. 1, the chief executive of Viacom media corporation told the Fortune Global Forum, a September 1999 gathering of hundreds of corporate leaders in Shanghai gathered to celebrate--get this--the 50th anniversary of communism in China--They 
   gathered to celebrate the fact that western media groups, ``should avoid being unnecessarily offensive to the Chinese Government.'' 
   No. 2, the owner of Fox and Star TV networks has repeatedly gained favor with the Chinese leadership by dropping programming and publishing deals that offend the Communist Government of China, including a book written by the last British Governor of Hong Kong. 
   No. 3, the Chief Executive of American International Group was reported to be so effusive in his praise of China's economic progress at this global forum that one Communist Chinese official described the remarks as ``not realistic.'' 
   No. 4, the founder of CNN, one of the world's wealthiest men, proudly told the global forum, ``I am a socialist at heart.'' 
   No. 5, in 1998, Apple Computer voluntarily removed images of the Dalai Lama from its ``Think Different'' ads in Hong Kong, stating at the time,  ``Where there are political sensitivities, we did not want to offend anyone.'' 
   No. 7, in 1997, the Massachusetts-based Internet firm, Prodigy, landed an investment contract in China by agreeing to comply with China's Internet rules which provide for censoring any political information--now get this--``deemed unacceptable to the Communist government.'' 
   I am forced to wonder if some of our business leaders understand what they are doing when they make such statements and make such decisions. Obviously, they are trying to curry favor with the Communist Government of China in which they aim to do business. But isn't there a limit to what they would do to accomplish what they seek? To say things that are so clearly untrue, or to agree to self-censorship when some of them are in the media business, it seems to me, undermines the ultimate goal of these companies--their higher profits--by legitimizing a Communist government that manifestly does not even believe in the free enterprise system. 
   In any event, some U.S. businesses certainly did not seem to get a very good return on their investment of goodwill. Just consider how the Chinese Government repaid Time-Warner, for example. At the very moment that Time-Warner was sponsoring a conference in Shanghai for American business leaders to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Chinese communism, Chinese leaders banned the then-current issue of Time magazine, which is owned, of course, by Time-Warner. They removed it from the Chinese news stands--because of what? Because that issue happened to include commentaries by some Chinese dissidents and by the Dalai Lama. Then China blocked the web sites of Time Warner's Fortune magazine, as well as CNN, the founder of which is a self-described socialist. I didn't say it; he said it. 
   Chinese officials denied the conference organizers the right to invite certain Chinese participants to the forum. Instead, the Chinese leaders padded the guest list with managers of--what? Chinese-run firms. 
   That is the way they do business over there. That is the crowd that everybody in this country seems to be clamoring to bow and scrape to. 
   I have to say this for the Chinese leaders: at least they stood up at the banquet at the conclusion of the conference and harshly lashed out at the United States for daring to speak about human rights while in Communist China, and for defending democratic Taiwan, of course. 
   So I wonder if our corporate executives woke up the next 
   morning feeling a little bit underappreciated. But even if they did not, one thing is for certain. This type of attitude and conduct by American businessmen will never, never, never promote democracy in China, let alone participate in causing it to come about. If the presence of American businesses truly purports to aid in bringing democracy to China, then those businesses, it seems to me, must conduct themselves in a manner reflecting basic American values--such as individual liberty and free expression and free enterprise. 
   That is what the pending amendment's voluntary--and I repeat voluntary--code of conduct calls for. Of course, I realize that some American firms have already adopted their own ethical rules and codes for international business, but they generally are limited, narrow business practices, don't you see, and certainly have not prevented the sort of kowtowing to China's ruling Communists whom I have just described. 
   The point is this, and I will conclude. I fail to see any reason on the face of the Earth why the Senate should not take this step at least before concluding that trade will automatically bring democracy to Communist China. 
   Mr. President, before I yield the floor, let me request, by the same method as previously, that I be granted the yeas and nays on this amendment.

Mr. President, around this place I have learned, in 28 years, that you are fortunate in many instances to be able to work with people with whom you have not earlier worked, and you learn of their interest and their dedication. Such is the case with the distinguished Senator from Minnesota, Mr. WELLSTONE, with whom I have worked in the preparation of this amendment. He is a principal cosponsor of it. 
   The pending amendment, simply said, directs the President to certify that China has met a series of human rights conditions prior to granting PNTR to Communist China. The conditions set forth in this amendment are  straightforward. The President would be required to certify formally and officially that China has, among other items: 
   No. 1, dismantled its system of reeducation through labor; 
   No. 2, has opened up all areas of China for U.N. human rights agencies; 
   No. 3, has accounted for and released political and religious prisoners; and, 
   No. 4, has provided human rights groups with unhindered access to religious leaders. 
   So what this amendment really does is to remind Communist China, and all the rest of the world, that we Americans stand for something--something other than for profits, for example. In this case, what this amendment makes clear is that we believe China should not be welcomed into international organizations such as the WTO just so long as the Chinese Government continues to repress, to jail, to murder, to torture, its own citizens for their having opposed the Beijing dictatorship. 
   It seems to me, to fail to take this stand would be a double whammy against even the possibility of freedom for the people of China. First, the Senate will be sending a signal to Beijing that the Government of the United States will turn a blind eye to Communist China's grave abuses against humanity if this amendment is not approved, if only China will just let U.S. businesses make a profit in dealing with China. 
   Second, it will send a message to those miserable souls who languish in China's gulags that the United States is willing to ignore their misery just so some in America can profit from it. If we do not send the signal that this amendment proposes to send, that will happen. 
   I realize the WTO is not, itself, a paragon of virtue, let alone a democracy, given the membership already held by thuggish regimes such as Cuba and Burma and a host of African dictatorships. But that does not justify further sullying the WTO by adding Communist China to its membership. Rather, it is a reminder of the absurd notion that this so-called rules-based WTO will somehow help transform China into a democracy. 
   As does Cuba and Burma, the Chinese Government continues to have one of the worst human rights records in the world, despite two decades, 20 years of having received so-called most-favored-nation status from the U.S. Government. The findings in the pending amendment, mostly verbatim quotes from the U.S. State Department's own annual reports, provide a sketch of the disgraceful conduct, the disgraceful situation in China. For example, this is a quote from the U.S. 
   State Department's 1999 human rights report shown on this chart. The chart shows:  
   The Government of the People's Republic of China's poor human rights record deteriorated markedly throughout the year, as the Government intensified efforts to suppress dissent.  
   Note two key words in that passage, ``deteriorated'' and ``intensified,'' because these words describe a trend, a trend for the worse as reported by the U.S. State Department. That is not JESSE HELMS talking. That is the State Department's official report to this Senate. 
   I doubt that even the most enthusiastic supporter of Communist China's admission to the WTO will claim that China's human rights record is good. I don't know how they could do it, but some will do it. But year after year, we have become accustomed to hearing that China's human rights record is improving, don't you see. The trouble is, the State Department's own report, as I have indicated, emphasizes over and over again that this simply is not true and never has been true. 
   Consider, if you will, this passage from the U.S. State Department, reproduced on this chart:  
   Abuses by Chinese authorities included instances of extrajudicial killings, torture and mistreatment of prisoners, forced confessions, arbitrary arrest and detention, lengthy incommunicado detentions, and denial of due process.  
   That is in the U.S. State Department's annual report, delivered to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee of which I am chairman. 
   What is that report, when you get down to the nitty-gritty? The official report of our State Department, which advocates giving away the store to Communist China, is telling the truth on one hand and asks to reward China on the other. 
   Are we to dismiss China's vicious crackdown on the Falun Gong movement? The bloody numbers are staggering: More than 35,000 people detained, more than 5,000 people sentenced without trial, and more than 300 put on makeshift trials and sentenced to prison terms of up to 18 years. 
   I have some photographs I want the Chair to see. The first one is how the Chinese Government treats its own people whose worst offense has been their daring to meditate in public, to sit alone and think. 
   At least 37 of these people died of mistreatment while they were in custody. According to human rights groups, one Falun Gong practitioner who had been confined in a psychiatric hospital by the Chinese Government died of heart failure 2 weeks after being forcibly injected with nerve agents. Another died after being force-fed by authorities. These reports are reminiscent of those worst days long ago in the Soviet Union and in Germany under Adolf Hitler. 
   But there is more. The merciless extinction of Tibet continues. In this past year, China has perpetuated its so-called reeducation campaign aimed, in fact, at destroying Tibetan culture, border patrols have been tightened, and the arrests of Tibetans have increased greatly. 
   There is a fine lady named Dr. Elizabeth Napper who works with escaped Tibetan nuns in India. She testified before the Foreign Relations Committee that if a nun peacefully demonstrates saying, for example, ``Free Tibet,'' she is immediately arrested and taken into custody for saying, ``Free Tibet.'' 
   Basing her testimony on accounts by victims of China's cruelty, Dr. Napper added:  
   The beatings start in the vehicle on the way to the police station and continue through an interrogation that can take place over several days. Various instruments of torture are routinely used, such as electric cattle prods inserted in the orifices of the body and electric shocks that knock a person across the room.  
   These victims, mind you, are nuns. They are defenseless women. 
   The Chinese Government refuses even to talk with the Dalai Lama. Why should they? Nobody in the U.S. Government ever does anything tangible to help the Dalai Lama. Some of us who know him and are his friends do our best to help him. I have taken him to North Carolina to meet with a group there, specifically to Wingate University. It was announced he was coming, and there was standing room only on the campus of that university. People came from everywhere just to see him. They did not have a chance to meet him; they just had a chance to see him. 
   Permanent normal trade relations with China is not merely a routine foreign policy matter. As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, I have never viewed it as such. The future direction of Chinese foreign policy will depend upon whether the rulers of China agree to democratize its Government and begin to treat its own citizens with some respect, which they are not doing now. 
   It will be a tragic mistake to pass this legislation now precisely at the time the Chinese Government has succeeded in almost emasculating all opposition to its tyrannical rule. 
   Without requiring some kind of improvement in China's terrible human rights situation before bringing China into the WTO and granting China permanent normal trade relations will be 
   welcoming China into the club of supposedly civilized nations. It seems to me this would throw away the most effective leverage we could ever have with China and would deal a terribly severe blow to the millions of Chinese people who oppose their regime and are totally incapable by circumstances of doing anything to improve it. 
   Question, Mr. President: Would that not be profoundly immoral on the part of the Senate in consideration of this measure? I know the words have been passed: Don't let any amendment be adopted; don't let any amendment be approved; don't let anything happen to derail or to delay the enactment of this piece of legislation. 
   The answer is, yes, it would be immoral; it is going to be immoral. I do not hold my distinguished colleagues accountable on this, but I think it is a strategic mistake on their part, a mistake of historic proportions, that the  American people will one of these days profoundly regret the move the Senate is about to take. 
   Mr. President, this unanimous consent request has been approved on both sides. I therefore ask unanimous consent that prior to a vote on or in relation to the Helms amendment No. 4125, there be 90 minutes of debate on the amendment, with 60 minutes for the proponents and 30 minutes for the opponents, with no second-degree amendment in order, and that the vote occur by 3:30 p.m. or at a time to be determined by the two leaders. I further ask unanimous consent that the time consumed thus far on the amendment be deducted from the above limitation.

   Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, for the past two months there has been a deluge of claims regarding the Thompson-Torricelli amendment. While Mr. THOMPSON, the able Senator from Tennessee, has leaned over backward to accommodate all concerns raised in good faith, there is clearly no satisfying that particular crowd of ``beltway lobbyists'' who will stop at nothing to secure corporate profits. It is just as simple as that. 
   Virtually every argument the pro-Communist China industrial lobby makes regarding this amendment misses one crucial point: Chinese proliferation of weapons of mass annihilation poses a grave threat to U.S. national security. 
   If there cannot be agreement on this basic premise, then there is no common ground to be found on the Thompson-Torricelli amendment. 
   But I, for one, find China's trade in those commodities abhorrent and intolerable. 
   It is especially unconscionable for China to continue supplying the Islamic radicals in Iran with chemical weapons precursors and missile technology. Lest we forget, Iran's interests are antithetical to the United States. For the past twenty years the fanatics in Teheran have poured money, weaponry, and technology into terrorist groups worldwide. The mullahs have orchestrated dozens of bombings and the cold-blooded murder of hundreds of U.S. servicemen and citizens, including the bombing of Khobar Towers, in Saudi Arabia--killing 19 U.S. troops and wounding 240 others--and the Hizbollah bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, which killed 241 Americans. 
   So all this clap trap about reformists in Iran is hogwash--pure and simple. As the saying once went: ``Read my lips''--read mine--Iran is ruled by an Islamic fundamentalist regime that calls the United States the ``Great Satan'' and continues to spew anti-Semitic, anti-Israeli venom between each and every flight test of its new ``Shahab'' medium-range missiles, supplied, by the way, by Russia and China. 
   Iran is the last country on Earth that the United States should want to possess deadly chemical nerve agents, nuclear weapons, or medium-range ballistic missiles. 
   Why on Earth would the United States not do everything possible to stop China's supply of nerve agent precursors and specialized glass-lined production equipment to Iran? 
   Why on Earth would the Senate look the other way as China continues to build a research reactor and other nuclear facilities in Iran, and to supply missile testing equipment, guiding systems, technology, and specialized material to Iran's missile program? Why, Mr. President, why? Surely Iran is the last country on Earth that the United States would ever want to gain possession of advanced cruise missiles capable of sinking warships from the United States of America. 
   According to the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, China's C-802 missile is ``roughly the equivalent of the French EXOCET missile that Iraq used in 1987 to attack the frigate U.S.S. Stark in the Gulf, killing 37 Americans.'' 
   Why, Mr. President, would the United States not do everything in its power, including the imposition of sanctions, to prevent China from supplying hundreds of these missiles to the Iranian military? 
   Iran is by no means the only dangerous country to which Communist China continues to ship deadly weaponry. There is that little regime in Libya which today is on trial in The Hague for the cowardly terrorist bombing of a plane over Lockerbie, Scotland. Do you remember that, Mr. President? That cruel, beastly attack killed 270 people; 189 of whom were Americans. 
   Libya is getting from the Chinese all sorts of missile testing equipment and training. Just bear in mind, for example, this is a regime that once drew a ``line of death'' across the Gulf of Sidra  and launched war planes to attack the U.S. Navy. Under no circumstances would the United States want Libya to possess a ballistic missile capable of dropping chemical or biological weapons on the U.S. troops stationed in Italy. But that is precisely the capability that the PRC--the People's Republic of China--is supplying to Libya to date. 
   Then there is North Korea. We must not leave out North Korea, that Communist dictatorship that engaged in a massive surprise attack against the United States and South Korea in 1950 which ultimately killed more than 35,000 Americans. North Korea is acting today as if it is going to make amends, and we will see about that. I think it is about time. The point remains that North Korea still maintains a million-man army with thousands of tanks and artillery pieces deployed within a few miles of Seoul. North Korea is a country which recently launched that ballistic missile over Japan--do you remember that?--a missile capable of reaching the United States of America with a small chemical or biological warhead. 
   North Korean boats periodically engage in shooting matches with South Korean ships. North Korea has deployed assassination squads on minisubmarines to infiltrate its neighbors to the south, and they continue to harbor vicious terrorists wanted in Japan for a variety of murders, and they are working overtime on the development of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. This is not a country that the United States wants to possess long-range ICBMs--but Communists insist on supplying Pyongyang with missile technology and specialized steel. 
   I haven't even touched on the subject of Chinese missile and nuclear assistance to Pakistan or its supply relationship with the dictatorship in Syria or the help it was giving to Saddam Hussein's horrible programs. 
   The world today is a very dangerous place, populated with tyrants and despots hostile to the United States. These are countries which have killed Americans by the hundreds. At every 
   turn in the road we discover that Communist China is supplying all of these countries with technology which ultimately can be used in the future to kill Americans again. 
   No matter how many times the United States raises the matter of China's military exports, the Communist leadership in Beijing refuses to cease and desist. They change the subject. Indeed, the history of U.S.-Chinese relations on nonproliferation matters is one littered with broken promises. It is a tale of deceit and trickery by Communist China. 
   I call attention to this chart, which the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania referred to earlier, which shows China has made at least 14 major nonproliferation commitments since 1984, 7 relating to the proliferation of nuclear technology. The People's Republic of China has made five--count them, five--separate pledges regarding the transfer of missile technology and two pledges on chemical and biological transfers. During the past 20 years, the PRC has violated every one of those promises. 
   Immediately following Communist China's 1984 pledge not to help other countries develop nuclear weapons, what do you think happened? Yes, that is right, China signs a little ``secret'' protocol with Iran to supply nuclear materials. Beginning in the early 1980s, China helped Pakistan get the bomb, sharing weapons design information. In 1996, China was caught having to shift a large number of specialized ring magnets for weapons-grade enrichment of uranium to Pakistan. 
   In 1998, at the very time China was telling Congress that China had quit assisting Pakistan--in order to secure congressional support for commercial nuclear cooperation--the Clinton administration knew for a fact about ongoing PRC contacts with Pakistan's nuclear weapons program. It is abundantly clear, 2 years later, that China has never adhered even once to its nuclear nonproliferation pledges. In fact, according to the latest unclassified intelligence assessment of a month ago:  
   Chinese entities have provided extensive support in the past to Pakistan's nuclear programs. In May 1996, Beijing promised to stop assistance to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities, but we cannot preclude ongoing contacts.  
   That is a nice way of saying it is still going on. It is the same old song: second verse same as the first, in the case of missile transfers. Again, China has repeatedly broken its pledges. 
   A claim in 1989 that it had no ``plans'' to sell medium-range missiles to the Middle East was almost immediately contravened by several transactions. A subsequent pledge, in early 1991, to refrain from medium-range sales to the Middle East--also rubbish. 
   So we come to 1992, when China made yet another promise--written down this time--that it would not transfer any category I or category II missile items to Syria, Pakistan, or Iran. A lot of good people just said, OK, that is great; peace, peace, peace is right around the corner. The Chinese pledge specifically covered M-9 and M-11 missiles, and extended to existing contracts. 
   But this, of course, did not stop China from selling M-1 or M-11 missiles to Pakistan or from selling missile technology to Iran and Syria--no siree. So what happened? The Clinton administration extracted a further pledge, don't you know, in 1994--from whom? That's right, China--that it really did intend to abide by the MTCR. China said: Oh, yes, yes, sir; we are going to abide by it. 
   But that Chinese commitment to observe the MTCR guidelines--which, by the way, explicitly, clearly prohibit the transfer of missile production equipment--was observed no better than the earlier pledges. Not only did M-11 sales continue but Communist China was discovered supplying a production facility for such missiles to Pakistan. According to various press accounts, China recently completed work on this facility for Pakistan. 
   Oh, boy, you can trust these Chinese, can't you? ``I think we ought to sign this thing and go ahead and trust them and be done with it.'' If you believe that, you will believe anything because there are a lot of facts regarding the current exports of China's military that I have uncovered. 
   The point is, and I say this reluctantly because these are my friends, too--or they have been--as much as various business lobbyists may wish to portray the Communist leadership in Beijing as being trustworthy and responsible, the truth is that the Chinese regime is neither trustworthy nor responsible. It has never been responsible. It has given terrorist regimes deadly chemical capabilities and nuclear technology to vaporize entire cities and missiles capable of raining terror on innocent people from above. Nor has Beijing proven trustworthy. They have broken pledge after pledge and pledge. 
   I have to say this for the Clinton-Gore administration. It was not the first to allow itself to be duped by the PRC in order to pursue this commercial objective. But the current administration has coupled its willingness to subordinate nonproliferation concerns to trade with an alarming disregard for the law, in my judgment. 
   I deeply regret the appalling legal hijinks of the administration in trying to avoid sanctioning Communist China for its military trade. Maybe somebody else will remember, as I do, that New York Times quote that President Clinton was declared to have made, that U.S. sanctions laws put--as the President put it:  
   ..... enormous pressure on whoever is in the Executive Branch to fudge an evaluation of the facts of what is really going on.  
   The fact that the President would say such a thing, I have to admit, doesn't come as too much of a surprise. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee--of which I happen to be chairman--has in particular been on the receiving end of this sort of business of ``fudging the facts'' for the past 8 years. Time and time again it has happened. I am sick of it. While no administration has ever voluntarily imposed sanctions that it believed would be counterproductive, the Clinton-Gore 
   administration's callous disregard of U.S. law is bouncing around at a new low. 
   Because the administration has no stomach for nonproliferation sanctions, and because the Chinese obviously know it, the United States nonproliferation dialog with China has become nothing more than an opportunity for Beijing to uncover how the U.S. intelligence community knows things about China's weapons trade. At  this point, I think it must be patently obvious to Communist China that this administration does not have--what? The right stuff, I guess is the right way to put it--the right stuff to impose missile sanctions and make them stick. 
   The exponential growth in China's deadly exports, clearly shown on this chart, is occurring in the face of weakening U.S. resolve. 
   In the name of my children and grandchildren, your children and grandchildren, Mr. President and all other Senators, that is such a dangerous, dangerous combination. 
   As I see it, the obvious benefit of the Thompson-Torricelli amendment now pending is twofold. First and foremost, the amendment underscores the Senate's concern about Red China's ongoing trade in the deadliest types of weapons technology with terrorist nations. Under no circumstance should the Senate let this moment pass without deploring--without deploring it loudly--China's behavior and raising the stakes for China's continued assistance to the likes of North Korea and Iran and Libya. It is impossible to overstate how critical this is at a time when the commercial interests of the United States clearly predominate over national security concerns, and that is exactly what is happening. 
   Second, it also raises the ante on an executive branch which has come to think of mandatory sanctions as optional things. You don't have to do them. I recognize that it is clearly impossible to compel this administration to adhere to the supreme law of the land. But surely the Senate can make flagrant disregard for the law a little more uncomfortable for some in the administration by requiring expanded reporting on China's proliferation behavior based on a reasonable evidentiary standard. 
   Mr. President, for all of these reasons I strongly support the Thompson-Torricelli amendment. I not only hope, I pray that other Senators will join in sending a strong message to Beijing that its dangerous exports must stop forthwith. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Minnesota. 
   Mr. President, around this place we customarily say in a case such as this that we are ``pleased'' to support an amendment. I am honored to support this amendment, and I am honored to cosponsor it with my friend from Minnesota. In this case, we both have the same conviction about what our Government and our country ought to do before granting permanent normal trade relations to China. 
   I am sure Senator WELLSTONE has made it clear, but for the purpose of emphasis, this amendment directs the President, if China has indeed met a series of religious freedom conditions, to certify such before granting permanent normal trade relations with China. 
   This amendment really tells China--and, just as importantly, the rest of the world--that we in America still stand for something, something other than profits, something other than whatever benefit may be imagined by the steps the President is trying to take with China. 
   In this case, we are saying we don't believe China should be welcomed into international organizations such as the WTO while China continues to repress, to jail, to murder, and to torture their own citizens simply because those citizens have dared to exercise their faith. 
   Let me quote a passage from the Clinton State Department's own report on religious freedom that was delivered to the Congress of the United States just this past week. This is the State Department:  
   In 1999, the Chinese government's respect for religious freedom deteriorated markedly. 
   The question is, Are we going to stand here today and ignore this, knowing that China abuses, mistreats, and murders its own people? Are we going to ignore the crackdown on  Christians that began just last week, during which three Americans--Americans, let me emphasize--were arrested by the Communist Chinese? 
   Other crimes against religious believers in China abound. In the past couple of years, China has intensified its so-called patriotic reeducation campaign aimed at destroying Tibetan culture and religion. Similar horror stories are taking place in the Muslim northwest where the Chinese Government is smashing, destroying, and stomping anybody who attempts to display any kind of ethnic or true religious identity. 
   It is naive to believe these abuses will be dealt with by the Commission set up by this legislation. I hope I live long enough to see it happen. I will surpass, I believe, I fear, Senator THURMOND in age before that happens or, more precisely, until hell freezes over because it is not going to happen, not in the lifetime of anybody in this Chamber. 
   The example of the recently created Commission on Religious Freedom is very instructive. After dramatically cataloging the barbaric crackdown on religious freedom in China, the Commission recommended--how do you like them apples?--that permanent normal trade relations not be granted to China at this time. But nobody pays any attention, similar to a train passing in the night. 
   Here we are today, ready to toss all of those findings, all of the things we know are going on, and say we ought to do it. Not with my vote, Mr. President; not with my vote. That is why we must insist that progress on religious freedom precede China's entry into the WTO. That is precisely what this amendment does. I urge its adoption. I commend the Senator from Minnesota for sponsoring it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I say to my distinguished and long-time friend from Delaware that I seldom disagree with him, but this time I do, and it is a doozy. 
   Madam President, the pending bill, H.R. 4444, which proposes to give permanent most-favored-nation trading status to Communist China, is perhaps the most ill-advised piece of legislation to come to the Senate floor in my 28 years as a Senator. 
   As the Senate considers this issue, the ultimate question is an ominous one: Will granting permanent most-favored-nation status to Communist China advance the foreign policy interests of the United States? 
   My genuine conclusion is that by doing so, the United States Senate will be making a mockery of common sense. 
   Now, there is no question that giving permanent most-favored-nation trade status to China may advance the business interests of various sectors of the U.S. corporate community. But the Senate, amidst all the high pressure tactics, must not confuse business interests with the national interest of the American people. 
   America's principal national interest, vis-a-vis mainland China, is to seek to democratize China, hoping that China will conduct its foreign relations in a civilized fashion, and stop behaving in a rogue fashion, as the Chinese Communists have done for the past 50 years. 
   We must dare to ponder the most realistic of questions--for example: Will granting permanent most-favored-nation trade status to Communist China persuade its rulers to retreat from their threats to invade Taiwan if Taiwan does not negotiate reunification with the Communist mainland? 
   Will China all of a sudden cease its relentless military buildup in the Taiwan Strait? 
   Will China halt its brazen land grabs in the Spratly Islands? 
   Will China stop its reckless proliferation of weapons among its fellow criminal regimes around the world? 
   Any Senator answering any such questions in the affirmative should wait around until the Sugar Plum Fairy dances down Lollipop Lane. The fact is, the United States has had normal trade relations with Communist China for the past 20 years. Yet Communist China's behavior has not improved one iota; it has worsened dramatically on every one of these fronts during those two decades of normal trade. 
   Communist China has become more, not less, threatening to Taiwan during the past 20 years. Twenty years ago Communist China was not making incursions across the maritime boundaries of the Philippines, but today it is arrogantly doing so. 
   Two reports delivered to Congress by the CIA this year make crystal clear that China's weapons proliferation continues apace--flatly contradicting testimony by the Clinton State Department in 1999 before the Foreign Relations Committee of which I happen to be chairman. 
   Let's examine further this exotic pig in a poke. 
   As everyone knows--with the possible exception of anybody on a trip to the Moon for the past few years--Communist China dramatically lowered its threshold for using military force against Taiwan in its notorious White Paper this past February. For years, China has assured that it would invade Taiwan only if 
   Taiwan declared independence. That was preposterous on its face--but now, China says it will invade Taiwan if Taiwan merely delays reunification talks with China for too long. 
   That is not progress to me, Mr. President; it is instead clearly dangerous regression in China's policy toward Taiwan. And guess what. It happened just 3 weeks before the President sent this legislation to Capitol Hill. 
   Angry threats against Taiwan have become more frequent and increasingly venomous, both in the Chinese press and from the mouths of Chinese leaders. Recent headlines in Chinese newspapers have talked of smashing Taiwan and drowning Taiwan in a sea of fire. In a March 28 article in the South China Morning Post, Chinese President Jiang Zemin was quoted as saying ``If we were to take military action, it should be sooner rather than later.'' 
   The Chinese have also directed those threats at us. China has repeatedly threatened to use nuclear weapons against American cities if the U.S. comes to Taiwan's defense. As recently as April 11, an article appeared in another Hong Kong paper entitled: ``Nuclear War Will Certainly Break Out If The United States Gets Involved''--that is to say, Taiwan. 
   If that attitude is the fruit of normal trade relations with China, then by all means, it is indeed bitter fruit. 
   Lest anyone think that China is merely engaging in bluster, consider this: the year 2000 will mark the 11th straight year that China's military budget will increase by double digits. What is China doing with all that money? 
   Well, one thing is a pair of Russian destroyers armed with the Sunburn missile, which skims the sea at Mach 2.5--about 2,000 miles per hour--and has an effective range of 65 miles and can carry nuclear warheads. In answer to a question I asked at a Foreign Relations Committee hearing in February, the Secretary of State replied: ``The terminal flight path of the Sunburn makes it very difficult for any U.S. defense system, including Aegis, to track and shoot down the Sunburn.'' 
   China began shopping for this missile just after we sent carriers near Taiwan in 1996; China has spent over $2 billion for two destroyers and at least thirty-two missiles. 
   Madam President, I doubt that the American people will be heartened to know that our $68 billion trade deficit with China helped pay for this latest Chinese threat to American sailors. 
   And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Other Chinese weapons purchases (that the American taxpayers are financing through our trade policies) include Russian advanced fighters, air-to-air missiles, and submarines. Most, if not all, of this weaponry is designed for a Taiwan scenario, helping to tip the balance of power in that region further and further away from democratic Taiwan and toward the Communists in Beijing. 
   This is yet another product of our let's trade-at-any-cost policy with China. 
   That is the reason I am here today to speak against this piece of legislation. It may pass, but it will never do it with my vote or my support. 
   Madam President, I earlier mentioned increased Chinese aggression in the Spratly Islands. We must bear in mind that, in 1995, China seized some small islands called Mischief Reef in the South China Sea. Mischief Reef is just 100 miles off the coast of the Philippines and over 1,000 miles from the Chinese mainland. With this brazen land grab having gone unopposed, even verbally, by anyone other than our Philippine allies, China reached out again in late 1998. 
   In October of that year, China began a crash construction project and by January of 1999, had replaced some ramshackle huts on Mischief Reef with permanent structures that have been frequented by Chinese warships and are deemed as dual-use capable by military experts. 
   Twenty years of annual trade favors to China were not enough to ward off these blatant violations of international norms, but I, for one, await with bated breath the day when China  withdraws from Mischief Reef because of pressure from the World Trade Organization. 
   Don't hold your breath, Madam President; it's not going to happen. 
   We can also see the absurdity of U.S. policy toward China by taking a look at China's proliferation record. In 1998, President Clinton certified that China could be trusted--let me repeat that. 
   He certified that China could be trusted with our nuclear materials, paving the way for the longstanding desire of some U.S. companies to export nuclear reactors to China. Then, in testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee in March 1999, Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth gave China a clean bill of health on proliferation. 
   I am not kidding. That is so. 
   Mr. Roth stated that China had actually become part of the solution to proliferation problems. 
   It didn't take long for Assistant Secretary Roth's testimony to be exposed as--let me find a gentle word--maybe ``incomplete'' is the nicest word I can find. In April 1999, the Washington Times reported that China was continuing its secret transfer of missile and weapons technology to the Middle East and South Asia. A follow-up story in July detailed China's continuing shipments of missile materials to North Korea. These press reports were verified twice this year by none other than the Central Intelligence Agency in its semi-annual proliferation reports to Congress. 
   But I guess we are supposed to believe that more trade will solve that sort of problem. 
   But I am not convinced--not by my distinguished friend from Delaware, not by all of the businessmen who have called on me, not by anybody. 
   In sum, Communist China's foreign policy behavior has become increasingly antithetical to U.S. national interests during the past 20 years of so-called ``normal'' trade relations. It is difficult to see how making the status quo permanent will cause any improvement whatsoever. 
   Of course, the direction of China's foreign policy will hinge largely on whether the Chinese government democratizes and begins to treat its own people better than under the existing Communist regime. 
   All of us know the horror stories of things perpetuated against the Chinese people by their own government. 
   But here again, the record of engagement--or shall I state it more clearly, appeasement--has yielded miserable results. 
   In fact, China was somewhat more inclined toward reform 15 years ago than it is today. In the mid-and-late 1980s, China's leadership at least express some sympathy for reform, and for the students and others who were demanding it. But these reforms were ousted, replaced by hardline Stalinists who massacred the students and began a decade-long campaign of brutal repression. You can't describe it any way otherwise. Senator WELLSTONE and I will have more to say about human rights in China at a later time, but I believe the U.S. State Department's 1999 Human Rights Report says it all. 
   This is not JESSE HELMS. This is the State Department of the United States of America. And the last time I checked it was under the purview of a fellow named Bill Clinton. 
   The State Department said:  
   The Chinese Government's poor human rights record deteriorated markedly throughout the past year, as the Government intensified efforts to suppress dissent.  
   Do you want to hear that again? 
   The State Department of the United States said: ``The Chinese Government's poor human rights record deteriorated markedly throughout the past year, as the Government''--meaning the Chinese Government--``intensified efforts to suppress dissent.'' 
   Many supporters of this legislation, if not most, insist that the way to improve this miserable situation is to reward Communist China with permanent most-favored-nation trade status. Madam President, I find absolutely no evidence whatsoever to support such an assertion. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, countless Americans will be pleased to know that the Senate has unanimously approved the Intercountry Adoption Implementation Act to implement the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. This is a treaty that was approved by the Foreign Relations Committee about 3 months ago--in April of this year. 
   Senator LANDRIEU and I had offered the Intercountry Adoption Implementation Act a year ago, because when this legislation becomes law it will provide, for the first time, a rational structure for intercountry adoption. 
   This significant legislation is intended to build some accountability into agencies that provide intercountry adoption services in the United States while strengthening the hand of the Secretary of State in ensuring that U.S. adoption agencies engage in an ethical manner to find homes for children. 
   Although, the majority of intercountry adoptions are successful, it is also a process that can leave parents and children vulnerable to fraud and abuse. 
   For this reason, under the Intercountry Adoption Implementation Act, agencies will be accredited to provide intercountry adoption. Mandatory standards for accreditation will include ensuring that a child's medical records be available in English to the prospective parents prior their traveling to the foreign country to finalize an adoption. (The act also requires that agencies be transparent, especially in their rate of disrupted adoption and their fee scales.) 
   Moreover, under this act, the definition of orphan has been broadened so that more children can be adopted by U.S. parents. However, in no way is the power of the U.S. Attorney General (who currently has the authority to ensure that all adoptions coming into the United States are authentic) diminished. 
   Lastly, the Intercountry Adoption Implementation Act will provide much-needed protection for U.S. children being adopted abroad by foreigners. Under this act, it will be required that: (1) diligent efforts be made to first place a U.S. child in the United States before looking to place a U.S. child abroad; and (2) criminal background checks be conducted on foreigners wishing to adopt U.S. children. 
   Senator LANDRIEU and I have worked together on issues of adoption since her arrival in the Senate in 1997. I am genuinely grateful for her leadership on this issue. 
   In addition, I thank Senator BIDEN, the ranking minority member of the Foreign Relations Committee, for his hard work (and that of his staff) in finalizing the Intercountry Adoption Implementation Act. 
   I likewise extend my gratitude to Senators GORDON SMITH and JOHN ASHCROFT--both members of the Foreign Relations Committee--and Senators JOHNSON, CRAIG, and LINCOLN for their cosponsorship of this legislation. 
   Senator BROWNBACK has been as helpful, Mr. President, in making certain that small intercountry adoption agencies will be protected under the implementation of this act. 
   I also thank all Members in the House of Representatives who have worked to enable the passage of this Act; in particular, BEN GILMAN, distinguished chairman of the House International Relations Committee; Congressman SAM GEJDENSON, the ranking minority member on the House International Relations Committee; Congressmen DAVE CAMP and WILLIAM DELAHUNT; and, last but by no means least, Congressman RICHARD BURR--who introduced the original Senate companion bill in the House. 
   From our own family, the former legislative counsel of the Foreign Relations Committee, now counsel for Senate Intelligence, Patricia McNerney; and my righthand lady, Michele DeKonty. 
   Mr. President, The Intercountry Adoption Implementation Act now awaits approval by the House of Representatives. Needless to say, we hope the House will move swiftly toward final passage.

   Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I know some of the leaders in the business community around the country--particularly those who went to Shanghai last October to clink champagne glasses with China's dictators and help them celebrate the 50th anniversary of Chinese communism--these business leaders are eager for the Senate to deliver to them their year 2000 Holy Grail. It is called permanent normal trade relations with China, and I imagine there is a little bit of champagne flowing after this vote in the Senate. I say to them, just wait a little bit; maybe the American people will speak up a little more loudly than they have thus far. 
   These business leaders would have liked the Senate to take up this legislation right now and have a perfunctory debate with no amendments and just get it over with. They are convinced they are absolutely right, and I am convinced they are not necessarily right. Some of us, in any case, have some news for them: It is not going to happen. 
   I, for one, have just begun to discuss this issue, and there are other Senators who believe just as I do, that the legislation warrants a lengthy and thorough debate about Communist China. 
   We are not going to just debate and make a bunch of speeches before rubber stamping PNTR. We are going to have some votes. I have been working with several Senators on a series of amendments designed to ensure that before the Senate holds its final vote on PNTR, we will have voted on a gamut of issues that confront U.S.-China relations. 
   This is not just a China trade vote, as someone has attempted to cast it. Voting on whether or not to extend permanent normal trade relations to China will send a powerful message to Beijing and the world as to how the United States views the behavior of the Chinese regime. That is why we must have a full debate and votes on issues such as China's pitiful human rights record, China's brutal suppression of religious freedom, China's increasingly belligerent stance toward the democratic Chinese government on Taiwan, and China's unbroken record of violating agreements one after another, among other matters. You can't trust them. 
   I know there are some in this Senate who argue we must not offer any amendments to PNTR because that would send it back to the House and force that other Chamber to vote again on the legislation. Well, la-di-da. 
   I must confess, I find that argument interesting coming from the Democrat side of the aisle. Until recently, Senator after Senator on the opposite side of the aisle was coming down to the floor to fulminate against the majority leader for his efforts to expedite passage of appropriations bills by restricting the number of amendments that Senators can offer. 
   Now all of a sudden, when their party's President has legislation that he wants to be expedited by the Senate, the leadership on the other side has suddenly and miraculously been transformed into champions of speed and efficiency. 
   Let's hope they keep that spirit up when the Senate completes action on the appropriations bills this fall. 
   The fact is, there is simply no argument now for opposing commonsense amendments to PNTR. Before the House vote, 
   supporters of PNTR were concerned that amendments would somehow endanger final passage of the legislation. Everyone thought the House vote would be razor thin and that requiring the House to vote again now, or a little later, would bring final passage into question. 
   But, in point of fact, PNTR passed in the House by quite a comfortable margin. There is simply no reason why the House could not pass it again with certain commonsense amendments inserted on this side of the aisle by the Senate, and that, Mr. President, is our duty. 
   I can imagine only one reason why Senators would oppose such commonsense amendments today. It is nothing but crass partisan politics. There is a desire to prevent House Members from having to vote again on PNTR because they fear such a vote is likely to antagonize some of the labor union forces right before the fall elections. There are those who do not want to remind big labor that even the Democratic Party is doing the bidding of corporate America now. 
   The partisan interests of either political party do not interest me one bit. What interests me is having a full debate and making certain that the Senate does not send a signal to Beijing that we are willing to look the other way at Communist China's belligerence toward Taiwan, Communist China's proliferation to rogue states, and Communist China's brutal abuses against their own people time and time again in pursuit of the almighty dollar. 
   I opposed the motion to proceed, but I must say I have been disturbed by the single-minded rush to get this vote over with. Since February, we have been barraged by Chicken Little pleas to move this legislation, as though the world will come to an end if Congress does not pass this bill this year. In all likelihood, China will not enter the World Trade Organization until next year at the earliest, and China can get PNTR only when China joins the World Trade Organization. 
   So what is the rush? I think I know the reason for that, and it is the most disturbing one to me. It was articulated by the distinguished minority  leader who recently admonished the Senate to expedite PNTR because the longer the Senate waits, the greater the chance is that an international incident of some sort could scuttle the legislation. 
   Let's ponder that just a little bit. To what kind of incident could the distinguished minority leader have been referring? Could it be he is concerned that China--you know that supposedly responsible reformist power with which we are trying to do business--might somehow cause an international incident by, say, doing business with somebody or launching an invasion of Taiwan or launching another Tiananmen Square-style crackdown in which they rode that tank over a protester, a crackdown that would live in the minds of a lot of people because it would be carried live by CNN on display for the entire world. They would show what a despicable bunch of thugs with which we are dealing in this matter. 
   It speaks volumes about the depths to which we have sunk when leading supporters of PNTR openly admit that they are desperate to lock in this transaction before our Communist Chinese business partners do something so unspeakable that the American people would resent our trying to do business with them. 
   That is why, if I have anything to do with it, we are not going to rush PNTR through the Senate. We are not going to rubber stamp the President's plan to reward the Chinese Communists. We are going to have a debate. We are going to have votes. And some of us, maybe more than 12 of us, are going to make clear to China's rulers that all Senators do not and will not endorse, let alone condone, their brutality. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, passage of the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act is a priority for this Administration, but that is not why I support it. I am aware of the calamity inflicted by HIV/AIDS on many Third World countries, particularly in Africa. 
   Children are the hardest hit and they, Mr. President, are the innocent victims of this sexually transmitted disease. In fact, the official estimate of 28 million children orphaned in Africa alone could easily prove to be a low estimate. This is among the reasons why Senator BILL FRIST wrote the pending amendment, which is based on S. 2845, with solid advice from and by Franklin Graham, president of Samaritan's Purse and son of Billy and Ruth. That is why I support it. 
   Several items in the pending bill should be carefully noted. First, authorization for appropriations for the World Bank Trust Fund is scaled back from the House proposal of five years to two years. There is no obligation for the U.S. Government to support the trust fund beyond two years. 
   If the trust fund performs as expected, Congress may decide at that time to make additional funds available. However, if the Trust Fund is not transparent, if there is not strict accountability--and if money is squandered on second rate or politicized projects--I intend to do everything in my power to ensure that Congress does not provide another farthing. 
   The pending bill requires that twenty percent of U.S. bilateral funding for HIV/AIDS programs be spent to support orphans in Africa. That could be as much as $60 million. This is one of the provisions on which I insisted, and I wish it could have been an even higher percentage.  
   I suggest that A.I.D. get together with Nyumbani Orphanage in Nairobi, Kenya, Samaritan's Purse, and the other groups working in the field to develop a plan to address the crisis. 
   Finally, I insisted that the lions share of bilateral funding, specifically, 65 percent--or as much as $195 million, be available to faith-based groups and I am gratified that my colleagues have consented to this. At last, it has dawned on Senators that HIV/AIDS legislation and programs designed to address the spread of AIDS are worthless unless they recognize and address seriously the moral and behavioral factors associated with the transmission of the disease. 
   There is only one 100 percent effective way to stop the spread of AIDS, and that, of course, is abstinence and faithfulness to one's spouse. And it is through churches that this message will be effectively promoted and accepted, not through government bureaucracies. It is no exaggeration to say that policymakers refusing to face up to this obvious fact will be culpable in the deaths of millions. 
   Mr. President, approval of this bill will be an important accomplishment, and if its provisions are properly implemented it will save lives. The Foreign Relations Committee will work diligently over the next two years to ensure that the intent of Congress is understood and carried out.

    Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on July 1, Mrs. Eusebia Ortiz Vera passed away in North Carolina. Born in 1912, she arrived in the United States from Cuba, appropriately, on the Fourth of July, 1954, poor and with young children to support. 
   In America, she promptly seized the opportunity to build a new life, as all immigrants to the U.S. hope they can do. Eusebia worked very hard to ensure that her children prospered. She made certain, above all, that all of them received good educations. 
   And those children who came to the United States did prosper, and become good citizens of the United States, going on to be a U.S. Ambassador to Honduras, a high school teacher, and a professor at the University of North Carolina. 
   Among her grandchildren, Mr. President, are two U.S. naval officers, a medical student studying to be a Navy doctor, two lawyers and an elementary school principal--college graduates all. Each of them is a testament to a good life. 
   When I read about her in The Charlotte Observer, I felt a sense of pride in her story. It is not merely a testimony to her own character, discipline and strength. No, it is also a reflection of what America is all about for so many--a land of opportunity and of hope.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it would be helpful to get a clarification for the RECORD from the manager of H.R. 1167, the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. I understand that H.R. 1167, the bill to amend the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act to provide for further self-governance by Indian tribes, contains a provision that would allow Indian tribes to purchase prescription drugs from the Federal Supply Schedule for the purpose of providing health services to Indians under contract with the Indian Health Service.

   Mr. HELMS. I thank the able Senator. Moreover, I understand that the committee intends that the prescription drugs purchased off the Federal Supply Schedule can only be used for Indians whose health care is provided by the tribe, and cannot be purchased or used for resale, nor may they be dispensed to non-Indian employees of a tribe. Is that correct, Mr. Chairman?

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am grateful for the willingness of the Senator from Montana to work with us, to make certain the stabilization of Oregon Inlet is once more a priority of Congress and of the U.S. Corps of Engineers--in the next 180 days. 
   I confess some unease at the prospect of yet another study of the Oregon Inlet, inasmuch as there already have been almost 100 such studies previously. If one more study is what is required to save the livelihoods of the good people of Oregon Inlet who make their livings as commercial fishermen, then so be it. But let there be no mistake. This is the last study that will be conducted before action is taken. That is agreed to by the Senator from Montana and me--to help those good people, because enough, Mr. President, is enough. 
   I will work in good faith with the Senator from Montana and others to make certain that swift action will follow this latest, and I hope last, study to be undertaken. 
   Mr. President, for nearly three decades--nearly 28 years, to be exact--I have been urging the enactment of legislation to restore security and safety to the remarkable people who live and work on North Carolinas Outer Banks. 
   And for those almost three decades, those fine people have been short-circuited by a federal bureaucracy more intent in imposing its own will than following through on a much-needed project authorized by Congress in 1970: That is, to begin the process of creating two hard-rock jetties to stabilize and secure Oregon Inlet, the only deep-sea access along the East Coast for a distance of 220 miles between Cape Henry, Virginia, and Morehead City, N.C. 
   The purpose of the provision being challenged here tonight is to first, protect the lives of literally thousands of both commercial and recreational fishermen who live and work in the Outer Banks, and second, to protect the livelihoods of those fishermen, their boats  and their cargo, which is so vital to their making a living. 
   So let's be clear about what's at stake in this debate. We're talking about saving lives and saving a way of life for many of thousands of fine decent people trying to make a living providing fine, fresh seafood. 
   Wayne Gray, a Coast Guard officer stationed at the base there told me, ``Oregon Inlet is a nightmare. In my 32 years in the Coast Guard, it's the most dangerous place I've ever seen.'' 
   The Coast Guard station there receives on average a distress call every other day. In this fiscal year alone, the Oregon Inlet Coast Guard has responded to nearly 100 call for help by distressed seamen. There will be many more this summer, I'll promise you: There always are. 
   Over the years, more than 20 lives have been lost because of the deadly situation in the Inlet. In fact, I recently received a letter from a man named Robbie Maharaj who recounted an incident which happened about 4 years ago.  
   In November of 1996 a friend and I were fishing on the northern side of the ocean bar at Oregon Inlet. It was a fairly rough day at the bar. 
   We had caught out limit of striped bass and were pulling in our lines when I heard on the radio that some of my friends had gone down. I immediately finished pulling up my lines and went to help. 
   As I pulled up to the boat, I was able to get one man aboard. We laid him on the deck. He was so cold from being in the water that he looked pale, and almost dead. As we got him on deck, water began to break over the stern of my boat. I had to leave the scene to avoid going down myself. 
   All in all, four of the five men in the water made it. I was able to get two in my boat. Other fishermen pulled out the two other survivors. the Coast Guard got the one man that didn't make it. 
   People ask me all the time whether I would do it again. There's no question that I would try and pull men out of the water if I were faced with the same situation again. It's sort of a buddy system out there. You hear cries for help and you can't leave them there. You've got to try to help. This is especially true when the people yelling for help are friends. Who knows, the next time it could be me yelling to be saved. 
   Thanks to the events of 1996, I know just how dangerous Oregon Inlet can be. Senator, thank you for trying to get the stabilization effort moving. We really need it.  
   The provision in question merely transfers the land relevant to the project from the Department of the Interior to the Army Corps of Engineers, so that the wheels of the inlet stabilization project can finally begin. This project is sound. Almost one hundred separate studies have been made on the project; therefore, we can reasonably say that just about every possible issue relevant to the project has been thoroughly considered and resolved. 
   On an economic scale, the project has a cost/benefit ratio of 1.0/1.6, meaning for every $1 spent on the project, $1.60 in benefits are returned. 
   As for the environmental concerns that have been raised, the Corps has made numerous compromises and alterations to the jetties in order to alleviate every single negative impact upon the local habitat and wildlife. 
   How many more lives will be lost before Congress makes good on the commitment made 30 years ago. That time has finally come.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, none of us knows precisely when the hereafter begins, when the life of one of the Lord's servants ends. I myself have lost an unusually large number of good friends during the past few weeks. But I find it helpful to imagine that I can visualize each of them sitting on some sort of Cloud Nine up there, listening to those of us who are mourning the loss of good friends. 
   Yes, I do have a hunch that PAUL COVERDELL is up there, cheerfully and busily lending a hand to Saint Peter. For me, it serves the purpose of reassuring that PAUL is all right--in fact, better off than he has ever been before. 
   We all remember a hundred different personal vignettes at times like this. In PAUL's case, my first acquaintance with him was very early in the morning the day after he was first elected to the Senate in 1992. 
   I had gone quietly into the den of our Raleigh home and turned on the television set--the volume very low, so as not to awaken Mrs. Helms. I wanted to catch up on the late returns from the election the day before. 
   I heard a voice; and I was intrigued and impressed by that voice. Then I looked carefully. I did not recognize the young man who was speaking. It was PAUL COVERDELL. I saw the picture of him that appeared on the screen. It was a live interview. PAUL had not yet gone to bed. He had been up for about 36 or 40 hours. 
   There he was fielding questions politely, intelligently, and with that inevitable smile on his face. 
   That was the moment my respect and admiration--and affection--for Senator COVERDELL began. 
   Now fast forward: Like most, if not all, other Senators, I realize today that I will forever have special memories of PAUL COVERDELL. He was a good man, an honorable man, a dedicated man with whom I shared a great affection for today's young people--the responsible ones, the ones who understand their good fortune of living in this country--those who, as PAUL COVERDELL once put it, understand that the strength and the goodness and the very future of America will shortly be in their hands. 
   I have sat and listened to other who have spoken so eloquently today of the Senator's rapid rise in the leadership of the Republican Party in the Senate. That happened because PAUL believed in the Senate. He believed in the meaning of the U.S. Senate, and he believed that we have a duty to endeavor to achieve a spirit of cooperation and understanding--including the realization that we have the duty to make the tripartite system work. 
   So, PAUL, if that's you whom I think I'm looking at on Cloud Nine, you know that we are missing you and that we are so dearly grateful for the years that we enjoyed working with you. I have a notion that the Lord will be blessing you for being His good and faithful servant while you were amongst us.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I don't question the sincerity of those who advocate this amendment which is intended to repeal the law that prohibits the wholesale reimportation of potentially unsafe drugs from Canada or Mexico. While they may scoff at the opposition, I predict that one day, somewhere down the line, they will regret sincerely their support of this proposal which is fatally flawed. 
   Most Americans never doubt the safety of the drugs in our pharmacies and hospitals. That is because they understand that no drug can be sold in America without manufacturers first making enormous investments in research and development, the compound passing rigorous testing and review by the FDA, and then being distributed through a supply system that ensures that drugs must pass through a reliable and verifiable chain of custody. 
   No country in the world does as much to ensure the safety and efficacy of drugs used by its citizens.

   Mr. HELMS. Madam President, a noted sports figure in American sports history once commented that ``Bragging ain't bragging if you can prove it.'' 
   On that basis, I want to brag a little bit about North Carolina which has had its share of top sports figures--perhaps more than our share when you consider such outstanding sports figures, past and present, as Arnold Palmer, Catfish Hunter, Charlie ``Choo-Choo'' Justice, Michael Jordan, Richard Petty, David Thompson, Sonny Jurgensen, Dean Smith, Everett Case, Joe Gibbs, Enos Slaughter, and Wallace Wade, who by the way took two teams from Duke University to the Rose Bowl. But he didn't have to go very far for the second one because it was held in Durham, NC, right after Pearl Harbor. It was feared that the Japanese might try to bomb the stadium out in California, so they moved the whole thing across the country to North Carolina--the only time the Rose Bowl was not played in Pasadena. 
   But I don't recall any previous teenager--from anywhere--who has been described as a ``tennis phenomenon who walks in Chris Evert's footsteps''. But that's the accolade handed 14-year-old Alli Baker of Raleigh my hometown--in the May edition of Metromagazine in a sparkling and detailed piece by Patrik Jonsson, writing from Boca Raton, Florida. 
   As I read the tribute to Alli Baker, I was reminded that this young lady is a great granddaughter of the late Lenox Dial Baker, one of America's leading orthopedic surgeons. Dr. Baker almost single-handedly founded a children's hospital, later named for him, at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, where hundreds of crippled children's lives have brightened and their lives improved because of Dr. Baker's selfless and loving interest in them.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, unanimity is a rare event in the Senate these days but I suspect that there may be unanimous approval of a resolution I am proposing commending and congratulating the people of Mexico for their July 2 democratic elections, which shocked the experts who had predicted that the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) could not be defeated and driven from power. An articulate and steadfast candidate named Vicente Fox Quesada thought differently--and he was right. 
   With the support of millions of Mexicans across the political spectrum, Governor Fox won 42.5 percent of the votes cast--six points ahead of the PRI candidate, Francisco Labistida. And since the third-place candidate received nearly 17 percent of the vote, that meant that 60 percent of the 37.6 million Mexicans who voted wanted to put an end to the PRI's stranglehold. 
   Thus the conventional wisdom that regarded the PRI political machine as being invincible avoided two facts: (1) the legendary PRI political machine had never been in a fair fight; and (2) the Mexican people have been striving for decades to put an end to the one-party rule that has wrought corruption, poverty, and insecurity. 
   Mexico's president-elect, Vicente Fox, has pledged to root out the grinding corruption that has locked 40 percent of the Mexican population into poverty and the others into insecurity. Mr. Fox has an agenda of free-market policies with a commitment that no Mexican will be excluded from economic opportunity and development. 
   Furthermroe, president-elect Fox has a sensible plan to reform the Mexican Government to make it accountable to the people. And, he has vowed to work with the United States and other countries to fight the deadly gangsters who traffic in illegal drugs in Mexico with virtual impunity. 
   So, this ambitious reform agenda is good news for the American people as well as Mexicans. For the first time, we will have a full partner in a truly legitimate and sovereign Mexican Government--one willing to work with us to make the most of shared opportunities and to confront common challenges. 
   Outgoing President Ernesto Zedillo's election-night address, in which he recognized the victory of Vicente Fox and pledged to work for a smooth and orderly transition, seals his place in Mexican history. From his earliest days in office, President Zedillo had declared his intent to break the cycle of election thievery that had marked 70 years of PRI rule, and the gentleman kept his word. 
   A special tribute is due the men and women of the Federal Electoral Institute who systematically ensured that Mexicans would get the free and honest elections they demanded. The IFE lived up to its mandate and has shown itself to be one of the premier electoral bodies in the world. 
   My resolution congratulates the Mexican people, President-elect Fox, and President Ernesto Zedillo. It is a new day in Mexico and for relations between our two great nations.

   Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, a basic question--and I think a significant one--pending with this amendment is: Should the taxpayers be required to pay for the controversial ``morning-after pill''--which is identified as an abortifacient--to be distributed to schoolgirls on school property? The answer, Mr. President, is absolutely not. 
   But as CRS reported to me, federal law does, indeed, permit the ``morning-after pill'' to be distributed at school-health clinics. 
   I urge my colleagues to prohibit funds from the Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill to be used to distribute the ``morning-after pill'' on school property.

   Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, Americans who follow international news, will recall that the French Government recently created an uproar when it authorized its public schools to distribute the post-conception ``morning-after-pill'' to girl students as young as 12 years old. 
   I wish parents in our country could be assured that such an initiative will never see the light of day in the United States, but no such assurance can be made under existing circumstances. 
   In fact, when the French Government announced that it would be distributing the ``morning-after pill'' in French schools, the Alan Guttmacher Institute--the research arm of Planned Parenthood--recommended almost immediately that the United States duplicate the Western European's approach in handing out contraceptions to teenage girls. 
   So, isn't it clear that attempts to distribute the ``morning-after pill'' in U.S. public schools are indeed underway in planning boards of Planned Parenthood?  
   Moreover, Americans will be alarmed to learn that Federal law currently gives schools the authorization to distribute these ``morning-after pills'' to schoolchildren. 
   In fact, the Congressional Research Service confirmed to me that Federal law does, indeed, permit the distribution of the ``morning-after pill'' at school-based health clinics receiving Federal funds designated for family planning services. 
   Simply put, this means that any school receiving Federal family planning money is prohibited by Federal law to place any sort of restriction on contraception. Even parental consent requirements. 
   In a handful of cases, the Federal courts have struck down parental consent laws, ruling that any Federal family planning program trumps a State or county parental consent statute because Federal law prohibits parental consent requirements--even though Federal law says recipients of Federal family planning money should ``encourage family participation.'' I make this point because so many who oppose placing restrictions on contraception--like parental consent requirements--run for cover under this language ``encourage family participation'' when they know good and well that it means absolutely nothing in a court of law. 
   Let me reiterate a warning: There is nothing in Federal law to prevent the post-conception ``morning-after pill'' from being distributed on school grounds by clinics receiving Federal funding--regardless of whether a parental consent State statute exists. 
   That is why I asked the Congressional Research Service to look into whether or not school clinics are distributing the ``morning-after pill.'' What CRS found is that there is some discrepancy to the response to this question. 
   For example, according to CRS, the National Conference of State Legislatures spokesman said there was no knowledge that any school had distributed the ``morning-after-pill.'' Yet, the National Assembly on School-Based Health Care--an organization which works closely with HHS--told Congressional Research Service that their group has recently conducted a national survey of their members, and that the resulting data reflected that out of 1,200 schools, 15 percent offer contraceptives, including the ``morning-after pill.'' 
   So, you see, it is not clear as to exactly what is being provided to schoolchildren these days. But it is clear that we are not just talking about condoms. 
   Simply put, Planned Parenthood and its cronies have been given free reign to distribute to American schoolchildren whatever they so please--to the point where schoolchildren are now being provided extremely controversial forms of contraception. And, in my judgment, this has gone on far too long. 
   That is why I am offering an amendment today that would forbid schools from using Federal funds from the Labor, HHS, Education appropriations bill to distribute the lawfully given ``morning-after pill'' in school. 
   But before the guardian angels of Planned Parenthood get themselves in a tizzy, let me make clear precisely what this amendment will and will not do. 
   Under the proposed measure, elementary and secondary schools will be forbidden to use funds from the Labor, HHS and Education appropriations bill to distribute to school children the ``morning-after pill''--which is widely considered to be an abortifacient. In fact, many pharmacists nationwide have refused to fill prescriptions for the ``morning-after pill'' because they, too, see it as an abortifacient. 
   This amendment will apply only to school clinics on school property. 
   Clearly, Congress simply must not ignore the fact that our schoolchildren deserve to be protected. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two memoranda prepared by the Congressional Research Service be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I offer this amendment in the hopes that it will bring about needed realism in our Government's relationship with Russia. President Clinton continues to promote the myth that the Russian Government has been ``a supportive and reliable partner in the effort to bring peace and stability to the Balkans.'' 
   That myth was shattered again last month by the Kremlin's brazen display of the enormous political, military, and economic support Russia continues to provide the Milosevic regime. Surely no Senator has forgotten the visit to Moscow last month by General Ojdanic, Milosevic's Minister of Defense, who just happens to be a war criminal indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal of the former Yugoslavia. Instead of arresting and sending this man to The Hague, the Kremlin provided not only meetings with the Russian Minister of Defense but a privileged seat at the Putin inauguration and a week of fine food and camaraderie. 
   Shortly after Milosevic's Minister of Defense visited Russia, Russian officials announced that it is sending to the Milosevic regime $102 million of a $150 million loan. All of this flies in the face of the effort of the international community to isolate and undermine the Milosevic regime. 
   I confess that I find incredible the audacity of Russian President Putin. Here he is, providing the Milosevic regime with more than $150 million in economic support while seeking debt relief from the international community and loans from the International Monetary Fund. He is doing this while his country seeks and receives food aid from the United States and while he is asking the United States to reschedule and forgive Russian debt owed to the United States. 
   The Kremlin should not be encouraged to assume that Western, and particularly the United States, economic assistance and aid are an entitlement. It is, however, sadly evident that Putin has concluded that he can conduct Russian foreign policy with impunity and still count on the West's economic largesse. The fact is, the hospitality and support provided to Serbian war criminals occurred just one month prior to President Clinton's visit to Moscow, emphasizing how little respect Putin has for the policies of the U.S. Government. 
   What concerns me most about the relationship of the Kremlin and the Milosevic regime is the threat it poses to America's men and women in uniform serving in the Balkans, along with those of our allies. The political, military, and economic support the Kremlin provides Milosevic directly jeopardizes the safety and security of both American and allied forces deployed in the Balkans. While we are trying to force the Milosevic regime to step down and turn power over to Serbia's democratic opposition, Russia is signaling Milosevic that he can survive and even outlast the alliance and that Russia will help him, Milosevic, prevail.  
   There is no reason the American taxpayer should provide Russia loan forgiveness and economic assistance when the Kremlin continues to support a regime in Serbia whose forces directly threaten U.S. troops who are trying to bring peace to the Balkans. 
   My amendment, which I have just offered, simply underscores that the U.S. assistance is not an entitlement benefiting the Kremlin. The amendment proposes that the United States withhold assistance to Russia by an amount equal to the amount which Russia provides Serbia. The amendment also will preclude any debt forgiveness or rescheduling of OPIC and Eximbank programs along with U.S. support for loans from international financial institutions to Russia. This assistance certainly is not warranted unless and until the Kremlin demonstrates that it has at long last cut its ties to the Milosevic regime.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota. 
   Mr. President, more than 80 percent of the cocaine, and most of the heroin flooding America's streets comes from Colombia. That is just one of many reasons why helping honest Colombians is an urgent and absolute necessity. 
   Today, Colombia's democratically elected government is besieged by blood-thirsty communist guerrillas who have gone into business with narcotraffickers, and, Mr. President, without U.S. help, Colombia may very well lose its fight with these narcoterrorists--and that is why the United States must move swiftly to help President Andres Pastrana save the second oldest democracy in the Americas. 
   I support doing whatever it takes to save Colombia--not only because of the enormous cost of drugs to our country but because the United States of America should stand with a decent, democratic government in our own hemisphere that is threatened by Marxist terrorist groups. 
   I am grateful to the distinguished Senator from Alaska, Mr. STEVENS, and the able Senator from Kentucky, Mr. MCCONNELL, for including in the foreign operations bill the emergency anti-drug assistance for Colombia and surrounding countries. 
   This bill deserves our support even though I expect that the House-Senate conference will choose to make some adjustments. 
   For example, we must resist unrealistic conditions that will block the delivery of badly needed support. Also, I am persuaded that we must supply the Colombian Army with Blackhawk helicopters so they have the mobility to respond to the hit-and-run tactics of the guerrillas who are part of the drug trade. 
   The stakes are enormously high. Colombia is one of the most important U.S. trading partners in the Americas, with $4.5 billion in direct U.S. investment in sectors--not counting the key petroleum sector. Also, the guerrillas have expressly targeted American businesses and citizens in Colombia for bombings, kidnapings, and murders. 
   Further, the threat to regional stability is acute: Venezuela, Peru, and Ecuador all have massed troops on their borders with Colombia. Panama, which has no army, is helpless to secure its frontier from smugglers of drugs and weapons. 
   President Pastrana doesn't ask us to do his fighting for him. In fact, no man alive has taken more risks for peace. If anything, he might be criticized for making too many concessions to bring the guerrillas to the peace table. 
   The guerrillas have responded by launching murderous attacks on civilian targets. While President Pastrana is going the extra mile for peace, the guerrillas have launched a recruitment drive--bent on tearing Colombia apart. 
   These guerrillas are criminals and terrorists who thrive on drug trafficking, kidnaping, and extortion. They are playing an ever-increasing role in the drug trade, which earns them a blank check from the narcotraffickers who realize that chaos is good for their dirty enterprise. 
   These 20,000 guerrillas move about the country virtually unchallenged while most of Colombia's army is pinned down protecting bridges, oil pipelines, and power stations from terrorist attacks. That leaves only 40,000 soldiers, with a mere 30 helicopters, to take on the guerrillas in a rugged, mountainous country almost twice the size of Texas. 
   What can the United States do to help? 
   We can approve emergency anti-drug aid to Colombia and to her neighbors, thereby giving them a fighting chance to stem the tide of lawlessness and cocaine that threatens the entire Andean region. 
   U.S. support will bolster the Colombian army's counter-drug battalions, providing continued U.S. military training, better intelligence and communications, and increased mobility in he form of transport helicopters. We will also provide support to eradicate illegal crops and create alternative employment for displaced farmers. 
   Current U.S. law requires that any military units receiving U.S. aid must be ``scrubbed'' for human rights violations. That is as it should be. But we should not hold U.S. support hostage to unrealistic preconditions. 
   If America fails to act, Colombia will continue to hurdle toward chaos. If the war drags on--or if desperate Colombians lose their struggle or are forced to appease the narco-guerrillas--the United States and the rest of the hemisphere will pay a very dear price. 
   The longer we delay, the higher that price will be. 
   I urge Senators to support emergency anti-drug support for Colombia--and to do so without delay.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as I look around the Chamber, I see nobody except myself who is old enough to remember a Prime Minister of Great Britain who went over to Munich, before the United States entered World War II, sat with Adolph Hitler and made a deal with him. He came back and he told the British people: We can have peace in our time. I trust this man. 
   Castro's own daughter has publicly condemned him over and over for the atrocities he has committed against the Cuban people. He is a bloodthirsty tyrant; and it is well known that he is. That is why I support the motion to table the amendment offered by my friend, CHRIS DODD, who is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. We work together amiably and effectively, I think. I do so for several practical reasons--including the one I have just stated--that I hope Senators will bear in mind as they consider Senator DODD's proposal. 
   First, the proposal is to create a national commission on Cuba. I would remind the Senators here, and those who may be watching by television in their offices, that such a panel already exists. It is called the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, consisting of 18 Senators, all duly elected representatives of the American people. There is a similar committee over in the House of Representatives. 
   The Senate committee has been quite active on Cuba, as my friend, Senator DODD, will testify. In this session alone, we have held hearings on Castro's repression of the Cuban people. We adopted a resolution supporting a United Nations resolution on Cuba and even approved language that would modify the U.S. embargo on Cuba. I do not support the latter proposal--which was the Ashcroft amendment--but it was reported out of committee as part of a broader foreign affairs bill. In short, we have a committee on Cuba consisting of elected representatives of the American people. I think it works just fine, thank you. 
   Secondly, what on Earth has Fidel Castro done to earn the forbearance of the United States? Does every cruel dictator in the world deserve a commission to study how U.S. foreign policy has done him wrong? Why not a national commission on Iraq or Libya or North Korea or China? 
   The problem is not that U.S. policy toward Cuba has not changed. The tragedy for 11 million Cubans is that Fidel Castro has not changed. 
   U.S. policy toward Cuba is based on sound, clear principles. Our economic and political relations will change when Cuba's regime frees all prisoners of conscience, legalizes political activity, permits free expression, and commits to democratic elections. 
   But that bar is too high for Fidel Castro. That is his problem. It is not our problem. But making unilateral concessions to a dictatorship on its last legs is the worst sort of appeasement. Neville Chamberlain would be proud of this proposition. 
   Third, why single out Cuba? Is there any Senator who does not expect the  next President of the United States to review our entire foreign policy across the board? A lot of Americans are counting the days when the United States has someone in the White House who will turn around our foreign policy for the better. That brings me to my fourth and final point. 
   It will be the prerogative of the next President of the United States to review U.S. foreign policy across the board and to formulate his own policies in close consultation with a new Congress. The next administration should not be saddled with the recommendations of a lameduck ``Clinton Commission'' on Cuba. 
   For these reasons, I hope Senators will vote to table the amendment of my friend, CHRIS DODD. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, during the past week, there has been a great deal of misinformation emanating from the ivory towers of liberal newspaper editors in North Carolina. They have made futile attempts to place blame for what they describe as the ``stalled'' aid to Eastern North Carolina victims of Hurricane Floyd. The tone and the substance of those editors are mystifying when we consider that North Carolina has been specified by the federal government to receive more than $2 billion in federal aid. 
   There are some politicians who are feeding the editors false and misleading information while they themselves know better. They complain about politics, even though their actions clearly suggest they themselves are practicing politics in its very worst form. I am dismayed that much of the false and unfair criticism has focused on some distinguished Senate colleagues, who have done far more for North Carolina's flood victims than the political finger-pointers. 
   One in particular who has done much for North Carolina is the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Mr. STEVENS, who has been deeply and consistently concerned with the plight of the flood victims. Since the day Hurricane Floyd struck North Carolina, nobody has shown more concern or been more willing to help than Ted STEVENS. He has stood with us every step of the way, and I shall never forget his friendship and his compassion. 
   And if I may impose Senator STEVENS one more time, may I engage him in a colloquy to set the record straight? First, is it not correct that the Senate, under the leadership of the Appropriations Committee, directed more than $800 million in federal aid to go to flood victims this past fall not long after the flood hit Eastern North Carolina?

<TEXT>
   Mr. HELMS. First of all, I compliment the distinguished clerk because there was a name or two that was difficult to pronounce. I probably will have the same difficulty. In any case, I wanted the amendment to be read to serve notice that this is a matter of great importance and one that bothers me tremendously. 
   It grew out of a meeting yesterday morning with Mr. Ilyas Akhmadov, the Foreign Minister of Chechnya, who represents Chechnya's democratically elected President. 
   He is visiting Washington hoping to discuss with the Clinton administration his government's efforts to bring an immediate cease-fire to the brutal war that has wrought so much misery and destruction upon the Chechen people. His proposals to achieve a cease-fire and peace negotiations deserve close consideration by Russia and, indeed, the entire international community. 
   I find it incredible that Mr. Akhmadov's requests for a meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other senior U.S. Government officials have been flatly rejected. As a matter of fact, I resent the fact that they conducted themselves as they did because this is an outrage. 
   The United States should be working to facilitate peace in Chechnya, not to encourage the Kremlin to further its brutal campaign against the Chechen people. 
   There is simply no excuse for the Secretary of State to refuse even to meet with Mr. Akhmadov. Any meeting to discuss the democratically elected Government to Chechnya's legitimate peace proposal would not constitute a de facto recognition of Chechen independence. And the Secretary of State and others know that. 
   But this refusal even to meet with Mr. Akhmadov will certainly be interpreted, by Russia's President Putin, as yet another green light from the Clinton-GORE administration to continue its indiscriminate campaign of violence against the Chechen people--a campaign that has led to the death, starvation, and torture of countless of innocent people in Chechnya. 
   In our meeting yesterday morning, Mr. Akhmadov and I discussed the atrocities that Russian forces are committing against the Chechen population. He shared with me, with tears in his eyes--and these were not pretended tears; this man was almost distraught about what is happening to his people--he gave me a grim picture of life in Chechnya under the repeated and indiscriminate assault by the Russian military. 
   Countless families continue to be bombed out of their homes. Chechens are still rounded up and sent to what are called ``filtration camps'' where they are tortured, raped, and then executed. 
   For too long, our President has refused to use his power and influence to pressure the Kremlin into genuine negotiations to end the bloody conflict in Chechnya which already has cost countless thousands of lives of men, women, and children. 
   Aside from empty rhetoric from the administration, not one finger has been lifted to make clear the outrage of the United States at the atrocities committed by Russian forces against innocent Chechen civilians. 
   Worse still, the administration has even legitimized Russia's military campaign in Chechnya with public declarations comparing this conflict to the Civil War in the United States. 
   For this reason, I submit this amendment to the Defense authorization bill. It calls upon the Kremlin to cease immediately its military operations in Chechnya. 
   It calls upon the Kremlin to grant international humanitarian organizations access to the victims of this conflict and do it immediately. And, this amendment calls upon Secretary of State Albright to meet with Mr. Akmadov to at least consider his proposal to bring an end to this terrible war in Chechnya. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

    Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, one of the myths dear to President Clinton's heart these days is that the government of Russia has been ``a supportive and reliable partner in the effort to bring peace and stability to the Balkans.'' That myth was shattered once again earlier this month when a war criminal indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, ICTY, was hosted in Moscow--not by Russia's criminal underworld--but by the Kremlin itself. 
   General Dragolub Ojdanic, Minister of Defense of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, visited Moscow for nearly a week earlier this month--from May 7-12, 2000. He was there as a guest of the government of the Russian Federation and enjoyed the privilege of attending President Vladimir Putin's inauguration ceremonies. 
   As Slobodan Milosevic's military Chief of Staff during the Kosovo war, General Ojdanic was directly responsible for the Serbian military's ethnic cleansing campaign in Kosovo. For this, the General was indicted by the ICTY for crimes against humanity and violations of the laws and customs of war for alleged atrocities against Albanians in Kosovo. 
   Mr. President, the ICTY has issued international warrants for General Ojdanic's arrest and extradition to The Hague. The Russian Federation, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council which established the ICTY, has an obligation to arrest General Ojdanic and extradite him to The Hague if and when they have the opportunity. 
   But what did President Putin and his regime do when Ojdanic was in Moscow? Instead of arresting and sending him to The Hague, they provided a week of fine food and camaraderie and a privileged seat at the Putin inauguration! 
   What truly disturbs me, Mr. President, is that General Ojdanic's visit was not just for fun. He was there to work--to reestablish the links between the Milosevic regime and the Kremlin. While in Moscow, he held official talks with Defense Minister Sergeyev, Army Chief of Staff Anatoly Kvashnin, and Foreign Minister Ivanov. 
   On May 16, four days after General Ojdanic's visit to Moscow, Russia announced that it has provided the Serbian regime of Slobodan Milosevic with $102 million of a $150 million loan. The Russian government also announced that it will facilitate the sale to Serbia of $32 million worth of oil, despite the fact that the international community has imposed economic sanctions against the Milosevic 
   regime. 
   I confess that I am impressed by the audacity of Russian President Putin. Here he is, providing the Milosevic regime with over $150 million in economic support while seeking debt relief from the international community and loans from the International Monetary Fund. He is doing this while his country seeks and receives food aid from the United States. 
   What should we conclude from all this? 
   First, President Putin seems comfortable ignoring the requirement to arrest and transfer indicted war criminals to The Hague. I suppose we can just add this to the long list of international obligations Mr. Putin sees fit to disregard. 
   Second, Russia does not share NATO's goals and objectives in bringing peace and stability to the Balkans. If it did, its leaders would not be so brazenly and warmly supporting senior officials of the Milosevic regime. 
   Third, the Kremlin must regard Western, and particularly, U.S. economic assistance and aid to be unconditional. He has evidently concluded that he can conduct his foreign policy with impunity and still count on the West's economic largesse. The fact that the hospitality and support provided to these Serbian war criminals occurs just one month before President Clinton's visit to Moscow shows how little respect Putin has for the policies of the United States. 
   Mr. President, what concerns me most about the relationship between the Kremlin and the Milosevic regime is the threat it poses to our men and women in uniform serving in the Balkans--and those of our allies. The political support the Kremlin provides Slobodan Milosevic directly jeopardizes the safety and security of American and allied forces deployed in the Balkans. This outreach by Putin to the Milosevic regime only encourages that brutal dictator to continue his policies of destruction in the Balkans. 
   While we are trying to force the Milosevic regime to step down and to turn power over to Serbia's democratic opposition, Russia is signaling to Milosevic that he can survive and even outlast the Alliance--and that Russia will help him prevail. 
   It is for these reasons, that I plan to introduce an amendment to the foreign operations appropriations bill that will restrict material and economic assistance the United States provides to the Russian Federation. There is no reason why the United States should be providing Russia loan forgiveness and economic assistance when the Kremlin continues to support a regime in Serbia whose forces directly threaten our troops and those of our allies trying to bring peace to the Balkans. 
   This amendment does four things: 
   First, it reduces assistance obligated to the Russian Federation by an amount equal in value to the loans, financial assistance, and energy sales the Government of the Russian Federation has provided and intends to provide to the Milosevic regime. 
   Second, it ensures U.S. opposition to the extension of financial assistance to Russia from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other international financial institutions. 
   Third, it suspends existing programs to Russia provided by the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. 
   Fourth, it ensures the United States will oppose proposals to provide Russia further forgiveness, restructuring, and rescheduling of its international debt. 
   Mr. President, I sincerely believe that a partnership with Russia is possible and indeed, would serve the interests of both countries. A strategy of engagement, however, cannot and must not ignore reality. Partnership cannot occur when Russia blatantly supports a regime that continues to threaten stability in the Balkans, whose calling cards are ethnic cleansing and political repression, and that continues to threaten U.S. soldiers in the field. 
   I will be pleased to treat Russia as a responsible partner when it behaves as one.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Sierra Leone is a failed state and merely hoping that a few new Bangladeshi or Indian peacekeepers will turn the situation around is irresponsible. The President should bear this in mind as he decides U.S. policy in Sierra Leone--especially the extent of U.S. military involvement there or support for a U.N. or regional peacekeeping or peacemaking operation. 
   All of us--100 Senators--must remind ourselves that the rebels in Sierra Leone--the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)--cannot be dealt with as if it were a political party. The Revolutionary United Front has terrorized the population of Sierra Leone by mutilating their enemies--and innocent civilians, including women and children--by chopping off their ears, noses, hands, arms, and legs. 
   At some point the downtrodden people of Sierra Leone must find a way to hold their own leadership responsible. But it's impossible to overlook the fact that Liberian President Charles Taylor provides succor to the sadistic Revolutionary United Front. 
   Taylor (with enthusiastic participation of regional leaders, including Maummar Qadhafi) provides leadership, weapons and safe haven while the RUF digs diamonds using slave labor in payment for services rendered. 
   It's shameful that President Clinton's hand-picked emissary hugs the godfather of the RUF like a brother and contemplates negotiating with his henchmen. Or had it not been for certain Congressional objections, the U.S. Government would be shoveling foreign aid to Charles Taylor. 
   Mr. President, the Resolution I offer, along with Senators BIDEN, FRIST, and FEINGOLD, speaks for itself. The Administration should take note, as it attempts to formulate U.S. policy, that at this stage of the game there is bipartisan ``concern'' (and I use that world in the most understated diplomatic fashion) about the policy of the United States and the sorry performance of the United Nations.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I will shortly offer legislation authorizing the naming of the Post Office 114 Ridge Street Lenoir, N.C., for The Honorable James T. Broyhill, one of North Carolina's more distinguished servants, philanthropists, and businessmen. 
   Congressman RICHARD BURR and Congressman CASS BALLENGER are offering companion House legislation, which is cosponsored by the entire North Carolina delegation in that body. 
   He was born in Lenoir, NC on August 19, 1927 to the late J.E. and Satie (Hunt) Broyhill. He is a 1950 graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a degree in Business Administration. 
   After graduation he served as Vice-President of Broyhill Furniture Industries and as a member of the Lenoir Chamber of Commerce, which he served as President from 1955 to 1957. As many Senators are aware, Broyhill Furniture Industries has a worldwide reputation as one of the finest furniture manufacturers in the world. 
   Mr. President, in 1962, Jim Broyhill was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives where he served 12 terms ending in June of 1986. During his service in the House he was the Ranking Member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and was instrumental in guiding Republican legislative efforts through that committee. 
   In May 1986 he won the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Senator John P. East. Following Senator East's tragic death in June of 1986, Jim Broyhill was appointed to the U.S. Senate by then Governor Jim Martin to serve the remainder of Senator East's term. His committee assignments include seats on the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Armed Services Committee. 
   While he was unsuccessful in his 1986 election bid for the U.S. Senate, but this did not dampen his willing commitment to help others in North Carolina. In addition he was selected (by then Governor Jim Martin) to serve as Chairman of the North Carolina Economic Development Board. In 1989, he was appointed by Governor Martin to serve as North Carolina's Secretary of Commerce, which he held until 1991. 
   He then retired to Winston-Salem. His wife is the former Louise Robbins and has three fine children; and they have three children: Marylin Beach, James Edgar Broyhill II, and Philip R. Broyhill.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, mothers across America will be showered with love and appreciation this Sunday as an annual expression of love and gratitude for the selfless acts mothers make for their families every day. Sunday is one of the truly special days of the year. It is Mother's Day. 
   Americans have a tradition of honoring mothers, dating back to 1914, when the second Sunday of May was first recognized as ``Mother's Day'' 
   It is especially significant in this year 2000 because of the irony that a number of high-profile women in the Clinton Administration--and in Congress--are so vocally supportive of the so-called U.N. Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, which they call CEDAW--which rhymes with hee-haw. 
   In any case, the point is this, Mr. President, the radical feminists groups around the country have gone to extreme lengths with incessant declarations, shouting, and even rudely disrupting at least one congressional hearing in their futile efforts to convince American women that the CEDAW Treaty somehow protects the rights of women, which it absolutely would not do--even in the highly unlikely event that the Senate ever gives CEDAW a second glance. 
   The problem for the radical feminists is that the truth has been circulated across the land that the proposed treaty fails to offer increased opportunities for women. All the same, the radical feminists have tried to turn the proposed treaty into a feminist manifesto, and the militant women have fallen on their faces in the process. 
   Mr. President, one needs only to examine the reports of the various CEDAW committees, and it is clear that motherhood is not favorably viewed by the CEDAW advocates. 
   For instance, Mr. President, earlier this year, one such committee solemnly warned the nation Belarus that there was great ``concern [over] the continuing prevalence of such [stereotypical] symbols as a Mother's Day.'' Now get that--``the continuing prevalence of such [stereotypical] symbols as a Mother's Day.'' The nation Armenia was lectured about the need to ``combat the traditional stereotype of women in the noble role of mother.'' 
   Another CEDAW committee warned Slovenia that too many Slovenian mothers (that's right, too many mothers) were staying home (in the opinion of the CEDAW ladies) to raise their children. Think of that bad situation,  mothers staying home to raise their children. The CEDAW crowd also warned that because only 30 percent of children in Slovenia were in day-care centers, the other 70 percent were in grave danger of ``miss[ing] out on educational and social opportunities offered in (the) formal day-care institutions.'' One can surmise they mean that all this is more important and more effective than motherhood in the home. 
   So, in spite of CEDAW's noisy advocates, Mr. President, the so-called Convention of Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women--and that is a jawbreaker within itself--has been left at the starting gate simply because this unwise proposed treaty was clearly negotiated by radical feminists with the intent of enshrining their radical anti-family agenda into international law. 
   That is why this CEDAW mishmash has been collecting dust in the Senate for 20 years. And when I say Senate, I mean the Committee on Foreign Relations. It was sent to the Senate by President Carter in 1980--since which the Democratic Party was in control of the Senate for 10 years. But the treaty is so obviously bad that the Democrats never brought it up for a vote, and if I have anything to do with it--and I think I do--it will never see the light of day on my watch.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as the distinguished Majority Leader knows, I have made no secret of my opposition to the conference report to accompany H.R. 434, the so-called African Growth and Opportunity Act. And though there's no doubt that the conference report will be adopted by the Senate, I am obliged to point out that Congress is on the brink of passing legislation that accelerates the loss of a significant part of America's manufacturing base and costs numerous jobs in the beleaguered textile and apparel industry. 
   Let me say at the outset that I certainly am not against ``African growth'' or ``African opportunity'' or economic growth in the Caribbean Basin. But I do not believe--and will not be convinced--that U.S. trade policy should aid emerging economies at the expense of an entire domestic industry and thousands of American workers. 
   But make no mistake, Mr. President, that is precisely what is occurring this week in the United States Senate. Consider the evidence: The textile industry is already operating under an enormous trade deficit. For every $6 million in apparel and fabric the industry exports, $21 million is imported, the vast majority of which streams in from third-world countries with cheap production costs. I don't suspect any Senator will seriously argue that H.R. 434 will do anything but dramatically increase this trade deficit. 
   Why is this so? Because American textile companies simply cannot compete on a playing field that isn't a level playing field. As cheap imports continue to flood the domestic market, job loss will not only continue, but increase. The media report news of our booming economy, but this so-called ``boom'' has left the textile and apparel industry out in the cold. As the Clinton administration crows about low unemployment, the Bureau of Labor Statistics also announced that just last month, 3,000 textile jobs were lost. Since 1994, when Congress passed the North American Free Trade Agreement, this industry alone has lost 453,000 jobs. 
   That's not just a statistic, Mr. President. That's 453,000 families forced to contend with the stress and displacement that accompany job loss. That's 453,000 workers forced to find new means to make their livelihood, often at lower-paying, entry level jobs for which they have little or no training. 
   453,000 Americans lost their job Mr. President, 70,000 of whom are North Carolinians. Let's try to put that job loss statistic into perspective. The distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, knows that there are only 412,000 jobs in the entire state of Delaware. A senior member of his committee, Senator BAUCUS, who was a conferee on this legislation, surely is aware that there are only 389,000 total jobs in Montana. Alaska has 289,000 jobs, Wyoming has 235,000 jobs, Vermont 296,000, South Dakota 381,000 and North Dakota 325,000 jobs. 
   Perhaps Senators would feel differently about U.S. trade policy if all of the workers instead of their entire states lost their jobs in the last decade. Yet that's the 
   precarious state of textile and apparel in America, Mr. President, and Congress continues to promote policies that will further erode the industry. 
   In the textile communities of North Carolina, where 18 plants shut down in 1999 alone, you can bet they don't talk much about the booming economy. They're talking about something else. 
   Last April, I held a hearing in the Foreign Relations Committee on the effects of NAFTA five years after it took effect. Among those who provided testimony was a wonderfully unassuming women named Vontella Dabbs. Ms. Dabbs works at Delta Mills in Maiden, North Carolina, and although she was seated at the same table with Ambassador Richard Fischer and Pat Buchanan, she stole the show. 
   I am going to quote extensively from her testimony because it's important and it bears repeating again and again. She said the following:  
   I come to you not as an expert in any field, not as a politically motivated person, but simply as an American that is deeply concerned for both my future and the future of my family and friends. I cannot quote you statistics or give you fancy computer-generated data to support some theory about foreign trade. What I can give you are honest and heartfelt feelings about what's going on in our community, as related to the foreign trade agreements and the people who work in textile plants ..... 
   Today ..... modern textile companies and plants are threatened by one thing that I feel can put an end to our entire industry. This threat is that we are not being given a fair opportunity to compete with foreign business on a level playing field. Many of the well-intentioned laws, treaties, and trade agreements enacted during the past few years have made the competition between domestic and foreign textile business unfair, in favor of the foreign producers. These treaties and laws and trade agreements have not really opened up the world to American textiles, as was intended, but instead have opened our borders for foreign manufacturers to flood our country with goods produced with near slave labor in deplorable conditions for workers. These agreements have also created an incentive for American manufacturers to close the door on American manufacturing and go south to Mexico and the Caribbean to invest millions in foreign countries. And by doing this, they are putting thousands of hard-working Americans out of a job.  
   It's hard to argue with that, Mr. President, though I have no doubt that many of my colleagues will try to do so. I can hear them now, saying that may comparable new jobs have been created through the growth of the retail industry. To which the textile communities of North Carolina say, ``Thanks for nothing.'' Textile jobs pay 63 percent more than retail jobs. While the average mill worker earns wages of $440.59 a week, retail workers make only $270.90. 
   Worse, the loss of textile jobs means money is drained from the economies of the hardest-hit communities, making it impossible for these towns to support this highly touted new retail employment. When the mills close, workers can't simply consult the local newspapers to get another job. Instead, they are forced to relocate, looking for those elusive retail jobs that pay barely more than half than the job they just lost, and are growing most rapidly in larger cities with a higher cost of living. 
   With this in mind, the last thing Congress needs to do is increase the amount of cheap imports coming into our markets. Yet this is exactly what H.R. 434 will do. Even worse, however, the bill provides the perfect loophole for Asian countries to circumvent U.S. import restrictions. No wonder many 
   people around town are starting to refer to this legislation as the ``Chinese Transshipment Bill.'' 
   Here's how Asian companies can easily conduct illegal transshipments from both African and Caribbean nations, Mr. President. Asian companies, which currently must comply with U.S. quota and duty requirements, will simply set up shop in the nations that benefit from this legislation. Once they are in operation, it's impossible to know whether garments are actually  assembled in Africa or the Caribbean or being shipped to these countries from elsewhere. Then, under the bill, they can add another $3 billion to their current agreements with the United States. 
   Mr. President, these illegalities certainly won't benefit American textile companies--and it's hard to see how it does much for the African and Caribbean nations that this bill is ostensibly designed to help. Instead, it merely allows already-established Asian companies to use these nations as simple fronts for their own business. I certainly hope that's not what the Senate has in mind. 
   Mr. President, in my view, the decimation of one of America's most important industries is absolutely unacceptable. I do not quarrel with the contention that economic development in Africa and the Caribbean is an important objective and ultimately in America's best interest. Yet I fail to see why we must sacrifice an entire domestic industry to this international goal. 
   Sadly enough, the Senate is now poised to do just that. I am realistic enough to know the ultimate outcome of this debate. But I would be remiss in my duty as a Senator from North Carolina--and as an American--if I did not take a stand on behalf of the many thousands of workers who have paid--and will continue to pay--the price for a U.S. trade policy willing to countenance the destruction of the textile industry and the communities it supports.

   Mr. HELMS. That is my understanding. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I genuinely regret that it is not possible for me to offer an amendment at the present time, but I do wish to raise an issue that continues to cause confusion and frustration and hard feelings in the schools and in the courts at all levels. 
   It involves an issue that deserves careful consideration by the Senate, and it seldom comes up; but I have made the decision that I am going to bring it up from time to time and have the Senate vote on it. All of us should be willing to stop pussyfooting and take a stand, unequivocally, clearly and honestly on the issue of school prayer. 
   There is no question about the absurdity of the Senate remaining silent while some judge somewhere says that a high school football team cannot even engage in a simple prayer before the whistle blows the start of the game. 
   Equally absurd is the denial of a valedictorian of a high school of the right to include a brief invocation in her remarks. But that sort of thing is going on all over the country. 
   I believe Benjamin Franklin and the other patriots, whom we refer to today as our Founding Fathers, made clear the power of--and the need for--prayer when they met at Philadelphia to set in motion this great land of freedom. It is very clear what Benjamin Franklin meant when he lectured his fellow colleagues. He said, ``We should close the windows and the doors and get down on our knees and pray for guidance.'' 
   I have lived a large part of my life believing there should never be any limits on the right of public prayer. I never heard of a high school student being debased or deprived of his rights, or having any problem as a result of school prayer. We had prayer every day in every school I attended, and my recollection is that all of us got along pretty well. No student was ever shot, or raped, or found to have drugs on his or her person, let alone a gun, in any school that I attended. But then along came Madalyn O'Hair and her crusade against school prayer. That was in 1962 when she stirred up a few atheists and agnostics, and ultimately some judges, who contrived out of the whole cloth a fanciful argument that somebody's rights might be violated if a simple prayer were allowed in school. It was always allowed every day in the schools of America until Madalyn O'Hair came along. Since the systematic removal of nearly all aspects of religious expression from the schools, there have been repeated disasters of all kinds, cataclysmic things we never believed would happen. 
   From teen crime to teen pregnancy, so many young people are sinking in a quicksand of immorality. Would these heartbreaking events have occurred if prayer had not been banned from the schools? I don't think they would. When that question is raised, my response is that such things didn't happen before prayers and religion were banned from the schools. 
   There is still time to fix this problem. We can restore prayer in school. By the way, the distinguished occupant of the Chair this morning may have recalled that I offered this same amendment I am discussing right now to the Senate in 1994. It passed overwhelmingly, with 74 other Senators agreeing that a more sensible policy regarding  prayer in schools is essential and necessary. But that amendment was gutted--gutted--at the eleventh hour for partisan reasons, which I am not going to get into now. On some occasion, I may describe exactly how that happened. 
   In any event, the amendment I would like to have offered this morning allows students to exercise their first amendment prerogative of prayer. 
   Under the amendment:  
   No funds made available through the Department of Education shall be provided to any State, or local educational agency, that has a policy of denying, or that effectively prevents participation in, prayer permissible under the Constitution in public schools by individuals on a voluntary basis.  
   I must say that once more my amendment clearly states that:  
   No person shall be required to participate in prayer in a public school.  
   If a student doesn't want to pray, he or she, under no circumstances, will be required to do so. Therefore, I regret the parliamentary situation under which the Senate is operating this morning, which prevents my calling up this amendment for consideration. 
   Let me say this: I steadfastly believe that any education bill that does not protect the first amendment rights of students to engage in voluntary prayer is incomplete, and I intend to raise this issue subsequent to this morning as often as it takes until the right to voluntary school prayer is guaranteed once and for all.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this is an occasion when I wish to attempt, with a heavy heart, to pay my respects to a dear lady who last week passed away. Myra Leonard was a leader of the Polish-American community and the long-  time Executive Director of the Washington Office of the Polish American Congress. 
   For nearly 20 years Myra was a respected and tireless advocate of the ties that bind the United States and Poland. During the 1980s, when Poland's Solidarity movement struggled under martial law, Myra generated great support for the movement by soliciting humanitarian support to Poland. 
   She coordinated the ``Solidarity Express''--a train of some 22 railroad cars loaded with relief goods. At her suggestion, on the first-year anniversary of Solidarity, a Solidarity Convoy produced thirty-two container trucks bearing relief cargo. 
   Myra's initiatives contributed literally millions of dollars of humanitarian support to the Polish people during that difficult decade, but more recently, Myra played a pivotal role in the effort to transform the Polish-American relationship from one of partnership to that of allies. One cannot overestimate the energy and momentum she and her husband, Casimir, brought to the effort to bring Poland into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. For her efforts, Myra and her husband were both honored by the Polish Government with the Commanders' Cross. 
   This year, Poland and the United States will, together, launch the Polish American Freedom Foundation. Myra's invaluable counsel and political judgment ensured that this initiative successfully navigated the difficult path of transforming a grand concept into a real foundation that will on a daily basis reaffirm the commitment of the United States and Poland to democracy and freedom. 
   So, we are deeply saddened by Myra's passing and we use this occasion to express to her husband, Casimir Leonard, and to the other members of her family, how much we will miss her. Our memory of Myra will be a lady of tireless energy and warmth who brought to Washington a genuine devotion to the ties binding Poland and America.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have been around this place a long time and a lot of things have happened that I can't quite understand, one of them being the veto of this measure by the President of the United States. If you stop and think, you see that it is purely political. For that reason, I hope this Senate will not hesitate to vote to override the veto of S. 1287, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2000. 
   The President's decision to veto this vital legislation is just further evidence that the Clinton administration has no energy policy, except the appeasement of the doctrinaire environmentalists. 
   Because of the President's purely political veto, the United States will continue to have spent fuel assemblies piling up at all nuclear generation facilities throughout the United States--including five facilities in North Carolina. 
   The taxpayers of my state alone have paid more than $700 million into the Nuclear Waste Disposal Fund justifiably expecting that the spent fuel assemblies would be transported to Yucca Mountain, Nevada, for permanent storage. 
   But no, it was not to happen, according to the environmentalists, and therefore according to the President of the United States, who immediately got his pen out and vetoed it. 
   A portion of the monthly electric bill payments of North Carolinians and other states goes into this fund, but while the Administration plays its political veto game, North Carolina's utility companies have been forced to construct holding pools or dry cask storage facilities to store this used material. This has caused additional expense for the utilities and higher prices for their customers. 
   Why did Mr. Clinton veto this legislation? Clearly it was to appease the self-proclaimed environmentalists, who so piously proclaim their concern about the air Americans breathe. We are all concerned about that. 
   Mr. President, it has long been self-evident that these so-called self-proclaimed environmentalists are opposed  to nuclear energy production--which is, behind hydro-power, the cleanest source of electricity. Nuclear power generation does not emit greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. 
   The question is inevitable. Is it not better for the environment that no fossil fuels are burned? 
   So while the President plays politics to please the self-proclaimed environmentalists the spent fuel assemblies continue piling up all over the country in spite of the availability of the Yucca Mountain storage site which--according to the experts-- poses absolutely no environmental risks for the permanent disposal of the spent fuel assemblies. 
   A handful of North Carolina anti-nuclear activists are complaining about the on-site storage of this material. If these activists were truly concerned about the environment, they would support this legislation and urge the federal government to complete construction of the national storage site at Yucca Mountain in one of the most remote areas of the United States.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the news media is buzzing with speculation that President Clinton will attempt, in his final month in office, to strike a major arms control deal with Russia--including a major ABM Treaty that would limit the ability of the United States to defend itself against ballistic missile attack. 
   White House officials have openly stated their concern that Mr. Clinton faces the prospect of leaving office without a major arms control agreement to his credit--the first President in memory to do so. 
   And from this President--a man uniquely absorbed with his legacy--that perhaps would be, to him, a personal tragedy. 
   Mr. Clinton wants an agreement, a signing ceremony, a final photo-op. He wants a picture shaking hands with the Russian President, broad smiles on their faces, large, ornately bound treaties under their arms, as the cameras click for perhaps the last time--a final curtain call. 
   I must observe that if the price of that final curtain call is a resurrection of the U.S.-Soviet ABM Treaty that would prevent the United States from protecting the American people against missile attack, then that price is just too high. 
   With all due respect, I do not intend to allow this President to establish his legacy by binding the next generation of Americans to a future without a viable national missile defense. 
   For nearly 8 years, while North Korea and Iran raced forward with their nuclear programs, and while China stole the most advanced nuclear secrets of the United States, and while Iraq escaped international inspections, President Clinton did everything in his power to stand in the way of deploying a national missile defense. Do you want some facts, Mr. President? Let's state some for the record. 
   In 1993, just months after taking office, Mr. Clinton ordered that all proposals for missile defense interceptor projects be returned unopened to the contractors that had submitted them. 
   In December of that same year, 1993, he withdrew the Bush administration's proposal for fundamentally altering the ABM Treaty to permit deployment of national missile defenses at a time when Russia was inclined to strike a deal. 
   By 1996, 3 years after taking office, Mr. Clinton had completely gutted the National Missile Defense Readiness Program. He slashed the national missile defense budget by more than 80 percent. 
   In 1997, he signed two agreements to revive and expand the U.S.-Soviet ABM Treaty, including one that would expand ABM restrictions to prevent not only national missile defense for the American people but to constrain theater missile defenses to protect our troops in the field. 
   Then for the next 3 years, the President, heeding some of his advisers, no doubt, refused to submit those agreements to the Senate, despite making a legally binding commitment to submit them. He made that commitment to me in writing. He did not submit them because he was afraid the Senate would reject them, while in doing so would clear the way for rapid deployment of missile defenses. To this day, he still has not fulfilled his legal requirement to submit those treaties for the Senate's advice and consent. 
   In December 1995, Mr. Clinton vetoed legislation that would have required the deployment of a national missile defense with an initial operational capability by the year 2001. 
   Three years later, in 1998, he again killed missile defense legislation--the American Missile Protection Act--which called for the deployment of national missile defense, as soon as its technology was ready, by threatening a veto and rallying Democratic Senators to filibuster the legislation. 
   Only in 1999 did he at long last sign missile defense legislation into law, but only after it passed both Houses of Congress by a veto-proof majority and only after the independent Rumsfeld Commission had issued a stinging bipartisan report 
   declaring that the Clinton administration had dramatically underestimated the ballistic missile threat to the United States. 
   But while Mr. Clinton was doing all this, costing America almost 8 years in a race against time to deploy missile defenses, our adversaries were forging ahead with their missile systems. 
   While Mr. Clinton was dragging his feet, for example, foreign ballistic missile threats to the United States grew in terms of both range and sophistication. Today, several Third World nations possess, or are developing, ballistic missiles capable of delivering chemical, biological, or nuclear warheads against cities in the United States. 
   According to the Rumsfeld Commission, both North Korea and Iran are within 5 years of possessing viable ICBMs capable of striking the continental United States, and North Korea may already today have the capacity to strike Alaska and Hawaii. Last month, Communist China explicitly threatened to use nuclear weapons against United States cities should the United States take any action to defend democratic Taiwan in the event Beijing launched an invasion of Taiwan. 
   So Mr. Clinton is in search of a legacy? La-di-da. He already has one. The Clinton legacy is America's continued inexcusable vulnerability to ballistic missile attack. The Clinton legacy is 8 years of negligence. The Clinton legacy is 8 years of lost time. 
   But in the twilight of his Presidency, Mr. Clinton now wants to strike an ill-considered deal with Russia to purchase Russian consent to an inadequate U.S. missile defense--one single site in Alaska to be deployed but not until 2005--in exchange for a new, revitalized ABM Treaty that would permanently bar any truly national missile defense system. 
   The President is attempting to lock this Nation, the United States of America, into a system that cannot defend the American people, and the President is trying to resurrect the U.S.-Soviet ABM Treaty which would  make it impossible for future enhancements to U.S. national missile defense in general. 
   The agreement Mr. Clinton proposes would not permit space-based sensors; it would not permit sufficient numbers of ground-based radars; and it would not permit additional defenses based on alternate missile interceptor systems, such as naval or sea-based interceptors. All of these, and more, are absolutely necessary to achieve a fully effective defense against the full range of possible threats to the American people. 
   Mr. Clinton's proposal is not a plan to defend the United States; it is a plan to leave the United States defenseless. It is, in fact, a plan to salvage the antiquated and invalid U.S.-Soviet ABM Treaty. That is what it is. No more. No less. It is a plan that is going nowhere fast in protecting the American people. 
   After dragging his feet on missile defense for nearly 8 years, Mr. Clinton now fervently hopes he will be permitted in his final 8 months in office to tie the hands of the next President of the United States. 
   He believes he will be allowed to constrain the next administration from pursuing a real national missile defense. Is that what he believes or even hopes? 
   Well, I, for one, have a message for President Clinton: Not on my watch, Mr. President. Not on my watch. It is not going to happen. 
   Let's be clear, to avoid any misunderstandings down the line: Any modified ABM Treaty negotiated by this administration will be DOA--dead on arrival--at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of which, as the Chair knows, I happen to be the chairman. 
   This administration's failed security policies have burdened America and the American people long enough. In a few months, the American people will go to the polls to elect a new President, a President who must have a clean break from the failed policies of this administration. He must have the freedom and the flexibility to establish his own security policies. 
   To the length of my cable-tow, it is my intent to do everything in my power to ensure that nothing is done in the next few months by this administration to tie the hands of the next administration in pursuing a new national security policy, based not on scraps of parchment but, rather, on concrete defenses, a policy designed to protect the American people from ballistic missile attack, a policy designed to ensure that no hostile regime--from Tehran to Pyongyang to Beijing--is capable of threatening the United States of America and the American people with nuclear blackmail. 
   Any decision on missile defense will be for the next President of the United States to make, not this one. It is clear that the United States is no longer legally bound by the U.S.-Soviet ABM Treaty. Isn't it self-evident that the U.S.-Soviet ABM Treaty expired when the Soviet Union, our treaty partner, ceased to exist? Legally speaking, I see no impediment whatsoever to the United States proceeding with any national missile defense system we--the American people and this Congress--choose to deploy. 
   That said, for political and diplomatic reasons, the next President--the next President--may decide that it is in the U.S. interest to sit down with the Russians and offer them a chance to negotiate an agreement on this matter. 
   Personally, I do not believe a new ABM Treaty can be negotiated with Russia that would permit the kind of defenses America needs. As Henry Kissinger said last year in testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee:  
   Is it possible to negotiate a modification of the ABM Treaty? Since the basic concept of the ABM Treaty is so contrary to the concept of an effective missile defense, I find it very difficult to imagine this. But I would be open to argument--  
   And let me emphasize these words as Henry Kissinger emphasized them when he said--  
   provided that we do not use the treaty as a constraint on pushing forward on the most effective development of a national and theater missile defense.  
   Now then, like Dr. Kissinger, I am open to the remote possibility that a new administration--unencumbered by the current President of the United States in his desperate desire 
   for a legacy and this administration's infatuation with the U.S.-Soviet ABM Treaty--could enter into successful negotiations with the Russians. 
   The Republican nominee for President, Mr. Bush of Texas, has declared that on taking office he will give the Russians an opportunity to negotiate a revised--a revised--ABM Treaty, one that will permit the defenses America needs. But Mr. Bush made it clear that if the Russians refuse, he will go forward nonetheless and deploy a national missile defense. And good for him. Mr. Bush believes in the need for missile defense, and he will negotiate from a position of strength. 
   By contrast, President Clinton clearly has no interest whatsoever in missile defense. His agenda is not to defend America from ballistic missile attack but to race against the clock to get an arms control agreement--any agreement; he means any agreement--that will prevent his going down in history as the first President in memory not to do so. 
   So it is obvious, I think, that any negotiations Mr. Clinton enters into in his final months will be from a position of desperation and weakness. 
   For this administration--after opposing missile defense for almost 8 years--to attempt at the 11th hour to try to negotiate a revised ABM Treaty is too little, too late. This administration has long had its chance to adopt a new security approach to meet the new threats and challenges of the post-cold-war era. This administration, the Clinton administration, chose not to do so. 
   So this administration's time for grand treaty initiatives is clearly at an end. For the remainder of this year, the Foreign Relations Committee will continue its routine work. We will consider tax treaties, extradition treaties, and other already-negotiated treaties. But we will not consider any new last-minute arms control measures that this administration may negotiate and cook up in its final, closing months in office. 
   As the chairman of this committee, I make it clear that the Foreign Relations Committee will not consider the next administration bound by any treaties this administration may try to negotiate in the coming 8 months. 
   The Russian Government should not be under any illusion whatsoever that any commitments made by this lame-duck administration will be binding on the next administration. America has waited 8 years for a commitment to build and deploy a national missile defense. We can wait a few more months for a new President committed to doing it--and doing it right--to protect the American people. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in December 1988, a few days before Christmas, a terrorist bomb exploded on Pan Am flight #103 over Scotland. 270 people died--murdered is the more fitting word--including 189 Americans. It was one of the worst terrorist attacks in history. 
   Next month, two Libyan suspects are scheduled to go on trial in the Netherlands for the bombing. These two Libyans are believed to have planted the bomb, but there is widespread belief that the Libyan government ordered the attack. 
   Though the United Nations has suspended sanctions on Libya since Qadhafi saw fit to turn over the two suspects in the Pan Am 103 bombing, Libya has by no means been restored to the status of a civilized nation. Libya is a rogue nation that has been an avowed enemy of the United States for three decades. (``The time has come for us to deal America a strong slap on it's cool arrogant face,'' Qadhafi said in 1973--at the same time he ``nationalized'' all foreign oil concessions in his country. ``Nationalized'' in this instance is a dressed-up word for outright thievery.) 
   So it is Qadhafi's regime that stands accused of the deliberate murder of American servicemen in the 1986 La Belle discotheque bombing. The same regime whose top officials have been convicted, in absentia, by French courts for bombing a French jetliner, killing 171 people, including seven Americans. The same regime that ordered the murder of 189 Americans on Pan Am Flight 103--Americans from 22 states: New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Vermont, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Maryland, North Dakota, California, New Hampshire, Colorado, West Virginia, Texas, Florida, Virginia, Kansas, Arkansas, Rhode Island, and Washington D.C. Nearly half of America's states lost one or more residents to the Libyan terrorists in that 1988 bombing of Pan Am 103 over Scotland. 
   The mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, and all those children of the Pan Am 103 victims will never forget the horror but, unfortunately, the U.S. foreign policy establishment appears less concerned with that history, hence the recent U.S. decision to ``review'' the ban on American citizens' travel to Libya. 
   Mr. President, this resolution should remind the Administration of the heinous crimes committed by the Libyan regime. It identifies Libya's continued refusal to accept responsibility for its role in these acts. It calls on President Clinton to consult with Congress on policy toward Libya--consultations that would include disclosing United Nations documents containing assurances to the Qadhafi regime that it would not be destabilized as a result of the trial in The Hague. 
   Most importantly, this resolution would emphasize the Sense of the Senate that all U.S. restrictions on Libya, including the travel ban, should remain in place until all cases of Libyan terrorism against Americans have been resolved, and until the Libyan government cooperates in bringing the murderers to justice. 
   A clear signal is needed to Qadhafi, and, apparently, to the Clinton Administration--that the United States will not stand idly by when our citizens are murdered. 
   If and when Libya apologizes and begins to make amends to all Americans, then perhaps there can be talks. Not before.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, when a remarkable North Carolina native died on March 16, a more perfect world would have dictated that his death be given far more attention than it received, attention that would have invoked memories of a distinguished, decorated war veteran; a career Air Force officer; and a conscientious, hard-working real estate agent; and most importantly, it would have kindled memories of a kind, gentle grandfather who enjoyed bass fishing and tending to his beloved roses. 
   But, when death came to Thomas Wilson Ferebee, some of the media mentioned these fine personal qualities only in passing, but many others will remember Tom Ferebee's carrying out his awesome, solemn responsibility as  lead bombardier on the Enola Gay. It was he, on duty that fateful day when the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, helping to bring, finally, an end to the costly, destructive, most terrible conflict that history records as World War II. 
   The decision to use the atomic bomb was an extraordinarily difficult one. And, too often, revisionist historians have tried to rewrite the lessons of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with unjustified suggestions that Harry Truman's decision to use the bomb to end the war was immoral. 
   What would have been immoral, of course, would have been to force the world into a further, protracted, bloody struggle when the means were available to end it--with, in the end, less suffering, destruction, and killing. 
   The weight of that decision was placed on the shoulders of the crew of the Enola Gay, among whom was a farm boy from Davie County, NC. In nearby Mocksville, where Tom Ferebee went to school, nobody could have predicted that this four-sport star of baseball, football, basketball, and track would be remembered one day around the world. 
   Throughout his later years, Tom Ferebee was often questioned about his Enola Gay role. One journalist after another with their minds made up in advance tried to press Tom Ferebee to admit guilt about his role--which Tom Ferebee rejected, saying, for example in 1995:  
   I'm sorry an awful lot of people died from that bomb, and I hate that something like that had to happen to end the war. But it was war, and we had to do something to end it. 
   None of us who were on the Enola Gay ever lost a minute's sleep over it. In fact, I sleep better because I feel a large part of the peace we have had in the last 50 years was what we brought about. If we hadn't forced the surrender, there would have had to be a land invasion of Japan and the estimates are that a million Americans and as many Japanese would have died in it.  
   Which is absolutely correct. The fact is, Mr. President, that Tom Ferebee and his comrades deserve better than to be symbols of phony guilt resulting from an absolute necessity of war. Tom Ferebee knew--as we do--that he did the right thing by carrying out his mission. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Tom Brokaw's recently released a best-selling book, ``The Greatest Generation'' is a tribute to the contributions of the millions of Americans who grew up during the Great Depression, then went on to fight and win WWII. 
   I suggest that most Americans will agree that Mr. Brokaw's father's generation is one of unique and lasting significance. 
   Having lived through that dark hour when totalitarian regimes in Europe and Asia threatened the survival of our republic, and having witnessed the sacrifices unhesitatingly borne by our servicemen, I must confess that I, like most of that generation, can never take our liberties for granted. 
   More than a half-century removed from victory in WWII, in retrospect I am convinced that far too many Americans have forgotten (or perhaps never learned) how bleak the prospects for our success appeared to be in the spring and early summer of 1942. 
   Victory was not preordained, and our fate might well have been vastly different had it not been for the heroic actions of U.S. Navy Lieutenant Richard Best and others like him who won that decisive victory at the Battle of Midway in June 1942, reversing a decade of previously unchecked (and largely unchallenged aggression) by the Japanese Imperial Navy. 
   Mr. President, to understand fully the heroic nature of Lieutenant Best's heroism, it is essential to understand the events leading up to the battle. Prior to Midway, American forces in the Pacific had endured a devastating series of losses and withdrawals that had crippled the U.S. Pacific Fleet. 
   Beginning with almost 3,600 casualties at Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Americans witnessed the fall of Hong Kong, Singapore, and Rangoon to battle-hardened Japanese forces; the collapse of a spirited defense of Battan by American and Filipino forces; and finally, the devastating loss of Corregidor, the island at the entrance of Manila Bay--an island that the United States had heavily fortified and which had been dubbed the ``Gibraltar of the East.'' 
   These losses led many Americans to the conclusion that Japan's success in the Pacific was inevitable. Some voices at home began to call for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Pacific theater so that we could first concentrate on winning the war against fascism in Europe. 
   After the selfless and courageous action of Lieutenant Best on June 4, 1942, and the American victory at the Battle of Midway, it became clear that America would not abandon the Pacific theater to an unprovoked aggressor. Instead, America would stand and fight. 
   Mr. President, the Japanese plan of attack on Midway was designed as part of the largest operation in the history of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Anticipating complete surprise and equipped with four fast carriers, Kaga, Akagi, Soryu, and Hiryu, the First Carrier Striking Force had reason to expect a crushing victory. The early action of the battle seemed to justify that confidence. 
   The first action saw three successive waves of American torpedo bombers attack the Japanese carriers. While avoiding damage to their carriers, Japanese fighters and antiaircraft guns quickly managed to shoot down 35 of the 41 American aircraft. 
   Following these devastating losses, two squadrons of United States dive bombers from the U.S.S. Enterprise swooped down on the Japanese carriers. Leading the Enterprise's Bombing Squadron Six, a group of 15 Dauntless SBD aircraft was their commanding officer, Lieutenant Richard Best (later lieutenant commander). 
   Regarded as one of the Navy's most skilled dive-bomb pilots. Lieutenant Best took the point attacking the well-defended Japanese flagship, The Akagi. With precision, he delivered his bomb on the flight deck of the powerful carrier, scoring the first direct hit, one that would eventually lead to the sinking of the ship. 
   Of the 15 planes in his squadron, only Lieutenant Best and four others returned to the Enterprise that day. After refueling and rearming, Lieutenant Best soared into the air again. This time he was searching for the Hiryu, the one Japanese carrier that had managed to survive the day's earlier fighting. 
   According to the Naval Historical Center, Richard Best scored a second direct hit against the Hiryu, helping to deliver a devastating blow the overconfident and seemingly invincible Japanese Navy. 
   In addition to being the only American pilot to score two successful direct hits on Japanese carriers at the Battle of Midway, there was something else remarkable about Lieutenant Best's courage that day. At the time of the attack, he was physically weakened and suffering from severe lung damage. Doctors later diagnosed him as suffering from tuberculosis, a condition that would (1) prevent him from ever flying again and (2) would cause him to spend the next two years recovering in Navy hospitals. 
   For his actions at Midway, Lieutenant Commander Best received the Navy Cross in 1942, the second highest military award presented to members of the Naval Service. It now appears that this award was based on incomplete information and that at the time, the Navy was not aware (1) that Best was the only pilot who scored two direct hits and (2) that he was suffering from tuberculosis. 
   Since then, a number of distinguished retired Naval officers, including Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, have ``weighed-in'' in support of awarding Dick Best the Congressional Medal of Honor. Should the Department of the Navy and the Department of Defense determine that an upgrade of the Navy Cross is appropriate I will unhesitatingly support it.  
   Mr. President, tomorrow night, at a dinner in New York City, the International Midway Memorial Foundation, will celebrate the 90th birthday of Dick Best and honor him for his selfless and courageous conduct in the Battle of Midway. While I am unable to be present, I certainly extend my gratitude and respect for his incredible heroism that day.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, earlier this morning I was thinking about 20 years ago when a delightful young lady Senator from Kansas served in this body, Nancy Kassebaum. She was a lady in every respect, and I miss her to this good day. 
   I was thinking about Nancy because today is International Women's Day. The radical feminists are at it again. They have chosen once again to press their case for Senate ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and that has the acronym of CEDAW. 
   Let's examine this treaty which women organizations--including some of the more liberal women in Congress--are so eager to have approved by the Congress and reported out, first of all, by the Foreign Affairs Committee, on which I am chairman. They put out a press release yesterday that they were going to picket me. I guess they were going to scream and holler at me as they tried to do not long ago, which suits me all right because I have been screamed and hollered at before by the same crowd. 
   ``This urgently needed'' treaty, as they describe it, has been collecting dust in the Senate archives for 20 years. It was submitted by President Carter to the Senate in 1980. In these years since President Carter sent it to the Senate, the Democratic Party controlled the Senate for 10 of those years and the Democrats never brought it up for a vote. 
   Indeed, in the first 2 years of the Clinton administration, when the Democrats controlled not only the Senate but the White House, the Democrats never saw fit to bring this radical treaty up for a vote. They were silent in seven languages about it. 
   Now, suddenly, 20 years later, they demand to be given urgent priority in the recommendation of this treaty, and that it be considered first by the Foreign Relations Committee and then by the Senate. 
   I say dream on because it is not going to happen. Why has CEDAW, the Convention of Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, never been ratified? Because it is a bad treaty; it is a terrible treaty negotiated by radical feminists with the intent of enshrining their radical antifamily agenda into international law. I will have no part of that. 
   Let me give a few examples of the world in which the authors and proponents of this treaty would have all live. Under this treaty, a ``committee on the elimination of discrimination against women is established with the  task of enforcing compliance with the treaty.'' 
   Mr. President, how about a few excerpts from the reports that the committee has issued? They provide a telling insight into the hearts and minds of the authors who wrote this treaty in the first place. 
   What do they propose? They propose global legalization of abortion. The treaty has been intended, from the very beginning, to be a vehicle for imposing abortion on countries that still protect the rights of the unborn. For example, this committee has instructed Ireland a country that restricts abortion, to ``facilitate a national dialogue on *.*.* the restrictive abortion laws'' of Ireland and has declared in another report that under the CEDAW treaty ``it is discriminatory for a [government] to refuse to legally provide for the performance of certain reproductive health services for women''--that is to say, abortion. 
   Another issue: Legalization of prostitution. In another report issued in February of, 1999, the CEDAW committee declared:  
   The committee recommends the decriminalization of prostitution.  
   They even called for the abolishment of Mother's Day. The CEDAW crowd has come out against Mother's Day--yes, Mother's Day. Earlier this year, the committee solemnly declared to Belarus its ``concern [over] the continuing prevalence of *.*.* such [stereotypical] symbols as a Mother's Day'' and lectured Armenia on the need to ``combat the traditional stereotype of women in `the noble role of mother.' '' 
   There are not enough kids in day care, they claim. 
   The committee informed Slovenia that too many Slovenian mothers were staying home to raise their children. What a bad thing for mothers to do--think of it--staying home with their children. This committee warned that because only 30 percent of children were in day-care centers, the other 70 percent were in grave danger of, now get this, ``miss[ing] out on educational and social opportunities offered in formal day-care institutions.'' 
   Another thing, mandating women in combat. Boy, they are hot to trot on that. In a 1997 report, the CEDAW committee mandated that all countries adopting the treaty must ensure the ``full participation'' of women in the military, meaning that nations would be required to send women into combat even if the military chiefs decided that it was not in the national security interest of, for example, the United States of America. 
   This is the world that the advocates of this CEDAW treaty want to impose on America. That is why they are picketing my office right now, demanding the Senate Foreign Relations Committee consider this treaty and report it out to the Senate for approval. 
   I say to these women who are picketing my office: Dream on. If its authors and implementers had their way, the United States, as a signatory to this treaty, would have to legalize prostitution, legalize abortion, eliminate what CEDAW regards as the preferable environment of institutional day care instead of children staying at home. 
   This treaty is not about opportunities for women. It is about denigrating motherhood and undermining the family. The treaty is designed to impose, by international fiat, a radical definition of ``discrimination against women'' that goes far beyond the protections already enshrined in the laws of the United States of America. That is why this treaty was publicly opposed in years past by, as I said earlier, Nancy Kassebaum and many others, who felt as I did then, and still do, that creating yet another set of unenforceable international standards would dilute, not strengthen, the human rights standards of women around the world. 
   We need only to look at the conditions of women living in countries that have ratified this treaty, countries such as Iran and Libya, to understand that Nancy Kassebaum was right in her opposition to the Treaty on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. The fact is, the United States has led the world in advancing opportunities for women during the 20 years this treaty has been collecting dust in the Senate's archives. I suspect that America will continue to lead the way, while the CEDAW crowd and the treaty sits in the dustbin for a few more decades to come. If I have anything to do with it, that is precisely where it is going to remain. 
   I do not intend to be pushed around by discourteous, demanding women no matter how loud they shout or how much they are willing to violate every trace of civility. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in honor of Leap Day, which was yesterday, I am going to vary my regular format. 
   It is estimated that 200,000 people in the United States were born on February 29th. While these individuals may not share their birthdays with their families and loved ones every year, they do share--every year--in the less than desirable Federal debt like the rest of us. 
   Since 1970, the Federal debt has leapt remarkably--reaching $5,735,333,348,132.58 (Five trillion, seven hundred thirty-five billion, three hundred thirty-three million, three hundred forty-eight thousand, one hundred thirty-two dollars and fifty-eight cents) at the close of business yesterday, February 29, 2000. 
   The previous Leap Day, February 29, 1996, the Federal debt stood at $5,016,041,000,000 (Five trillion, sixteen billion, forty-one million) which reflects a debt increase of more than $700 billion--$719,292,348,132.58 (Seven hundred nineteen billion, two hundred ninety-two million, three hundred forty-eight thousand, one hundred thirty-two dollars and fifty-eight cents) during the past four years. 
   Today, Mr. President, each citizen's share of the Federal debt is $20,727.13. Translating this figure into the amount that Leap Day citizens owe, the figure becomes $4,145,426,000.00 (Four billion, one hundred forty-five million, four hundred twenty-six thousand). This amount may not seem like a lot, but it is when you consider it is only enough to pay down four days worth of the interest on the Federal debt. 
   Mr. President, I wish my Senate colleagues to note how tragic it is that our country's debt leaps with more frequency than the years do.

    Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, back in the mid-1960s, I was enjoying life as one of the guys active in the management of a very successful television station in my hometown of Raleigh. The company, Capitol Broadcasting Company, had been founded by a remarkable gentleman, Mr. A.J. Fletcher, born in the mountains of Western North Carolina, son of a circuit-riding Baptist preacher whose ministry included hundreds of mountain families who attended the many churches under the watchcare of the Reverend Mr. Fletcher. 
   Those were hard scrabble times and by today's standards, just about everybody whom Reverend Fletcher's ministry served was poor. 
   A.J. Fletcher had nonetheless begun a lifetime love affair with the music of opera. So he headed east, to Raleigh and Wake County; virtually penniless he nonetheless studied law at night and in the process developed an instinctive knowledge of business and investment. In the years that followed, neither A.J. Fletcher nor anyone else in his family ever lived another hard-scrabble day. 
   Mr. President, I developed a high respect and genuine friendship for and with Mr. Fletcher. What I have recited up to this point is intended to be a lead-in to a magazine article about one of Mr. Fletcher's remarkable grandsons, James Fletcher Goodmon who today is president and CEO of Capitol Broadcasting Company. 
   I will get to the article in a moment, Mr. President, but I am obliged to mention my earliest impressions of Jim Goodmon when he was in high school in Raleigh and worked every possible minute of every day (and night) that he could manage at the television station (WRAL-TV) which was to become the flagship station-to-be of an expanded Capitol Broadcasting Company. 
   I saw young Jim Goodmon frequently back in those days (and nights) as he concentrated on learning everything possible about the mysteries of keeping a television station on the air. Many times he was covered with grease, many times he was bound to have been tired, but Jim Goodmon was then, as he is today, a hard-charger. Grandpa Fletcher was proud of Jim--and so was I. I sensed back then that Jim Goodmon would one day be a leader in television--as he certainly has turned out to be. 
   A few words about Jim Goodmon's family. After attending Duke University, Jim Goodmon found a bride--a lovely one and a hard-charger herself--across the mountains in Tennessee. Barbara Lyons was a registered nurse then. Now, years later, Barbara Lyons Goodmon genuinely cares about people. She and Jim have three children and one grandchild. They complement each other; both stay busy but never so busy that they cannot help each other in their myriad of projects. 
   What I have stated is scarcely more than a snapshot of a remarkable family. Mr. A.J. Fletcher is long gone from the scene but I have a hunch that he is looking down from a Cloud Nine somewhere, nodding his approval of the way Jim and Barbara are doing things. 
   Let me hurriedly add that Jim Goodmon is president and owner of the Durham Bulls baseball team which plays its home games in its dandy new stadium about 20 miles away in Durham--and then I will proceed to calling attention to a profile about Jim Goodmon published in the latest issue of the magazine, Region Focus.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am certainly not alone in my disappointment at the recent turn of events in Northern Ireland. It is a disheartening development. With the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in April 1998 and the overwhelming desire for peaceful resolution of the conflict--in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland--the prospects for peace in that troubled region had never seemed better. 
   The Good Friday Agreement, like all negotiated peace settlements, offers incentives to all parties but it also requires compromises--compromises that most people are willing to make, and have made, in order for peace. I do not pretend to speak for any side in Northern Ireland, but I can imagine that it was difficult for many in the Unionist community to see convicted IRA bombers walk free from prison. 
   And it was certainly difficult for many in the nationalist community to accept the principal of continued British sovereignty over Northern Ireland. But David Trimble, John Hume, and other honorable men and women have fulfilled their obligations under the Good Friday Agreement in order to give peace the opportunity to take root in Northern Ireland. 
   The current crisis stems from the refusal of one organization--the Irish Republican Army--to begin the process of decommissioning of their weapons and explosives. The IRA claims it has done enough by keeping its guns silent, by not setting off bombs, by adhering to a cease-fire. But, Mr. President, what kind of democratic system exists when one organization maintains a massive arsenal for potential use in the event that it is dissatisfied with the political process? Is that considered a genuine peace? I maintain that it is not, and it should not be accepted by people in this country. 
   Let me clear, the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, signed onto decommissioning in the Good Friday Agreement. As the Agreement states: ``all participants accordingly reaffirm their commitment to the total disarmament of all paramilitary organizations'' and to ``use any influence they may have, to achieve the decommissioning of all paramilitary arms within two years'', which is May 22 of this year. 
   Now, Sinn Fein's leader Gerry Adams has said that his organization ``has no further room to move'', which I find quite interesting, considering that members of his party were allowed to participate in the local governing structures established by the Good Friday Agreement (but do not seem to be willing to convince the IRA it must fulfill its obligations as well). 
   I suggest that Mr. Adams be advised that he cannot have it both ways. And to those whose excuse is that the deadline for decommissioning is still three months off (May 22, 2000), I would remind them that there is an established body designed to manage this process and that the IRA refused to make any commitment or offer any timetable for decommissioning to this institution. It is difficult to believe that on May 21, 2000, the IRA would have, in any event, turned over its hundreds of guns, its tons of Semtex, which it maintains as a veto on peace. 
   We are at a critical point: due to lack of commitment by the IRA on decommissioning, the British government had no choice but to suspend the indigenous institutions of Northern Ireland. Why? Let me merely recite the obvious: Why should Sinn Fein be allowed to participate in legitimate, elected governing bodies when the IRA refuses to disarm? How can we expect the unionist community to deal with Sinn Fein officials in this capacity when the IRA has turned its back on this crucial part of the peace process? 
   Sinn Fein and the IRA continue to raise the bar; after demanding that the Northern Ireland Executive and Northern Ireland Assembly be established before beginning decommissioning, they now state that if the British withdraw their troops from bases in Northern Ireland, they might consider handing in their weapons. I would remind them that there is an agreement, there is a process that they have signed onto--from which they have benefitted. Their prisoners have been released. Plans for a drastic overhaul of the Royal Ulster  Constabulary have been put forth. Cross border institutions have been established and are functioning. 
   They must abide by their obligations as well. Mr. President, Sinn Fein and the IRA must understand that if they do not, they will not have the support of the United States. 
   Today I am offering a resolution stressing the importance of decommissioning to the success of the peace in Northern Ireland and calling on the IRA to commit to the process and to offer a timetable as to when they will turn in their arms and explosives. And although the loyalist paramilitary organizations have significantly fewer weapons in their possession, they must fulfill their promise to disarm as well. The two main loyalist paramilitaries have stated that they will disarm when the IRA begins to do so. If the IRA moves on decommissioning, these organizations should respond immediately. 
   This is an historic moment in Northern Ireland--the best chance for peace in a quarter of a century. Let us not waste it. We must encourage those who are working for peace. But more importantly, we must make clear to those who want to destroy this opportunity by clinging to old and violent means, they can not succeed.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, during the past 5 months the Government of Russia has waged a brutal war against Chechnya. The Kremlin's indiscriminate use of force has left countless thousands of innocents dead and hundreds of thousands homeless on the icy plains and in the snow-covered mountains of the Caucasus. 
   We all have seen the photos of Grozny, a city subjected to a travesty not witnessed in Europe since the siege of Stalingrad and the leveling of Warsaw in World War II. Indeed, what has been done to Grozny surpasses even the havoc Milosevic wrought upon the towns and cities of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo. It is difficult to believe, but it is true. 
   In a time when Western Governments have turned a blind eye to this conflict, the ability of journalists to report objectively on the horrors of this war becomes all the more important to the effort to bring an end to this violence and establish a just peace. 
   Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to recognize this only too well. As a consequence, freedom of the press, a cornerstone of democracy, has become another victim of his government and his war against Chechnya. 
   Mr. President, the Russian government is today systematically censoring the press and attempting to use it to disseminate misinformation about public events. Journalists in Russia who report on the war and other matters in a manner contradicting the Putin Government do so at great risk. They are subject to intimidation, harassment, detention, and even violence by Russian authorities. 
   In one recent case, Russian police attempted to arrest a journalist and send him off to a psychiatric hospital, a ghoulish effort reminiscent of Putin's not to distant career in the Soviet KGB. 
   Nowhere has this suppression of the free press become more blatant and cruel than in the case of Andrei Babitsky, a ten year veteran journalist of our own Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe. 
   Babitsky courageously and objectively covered the 1994-1996 Russo-Chechen war as well as the current conflict. For his accounts of the atrocities committed by Russian military and the resilience of the Chechen resistance, he has paid an extremely high price. 
   In mid-January, he was seized in Chechnya by Russian forces and detained. That is the last heard from him directly. 
   The Russian Government's response to inquiries about Babitsky's health and whereabouts have been contradictory and dismissive. 
   After nearly three weeks of asserting that Babitsky had not been detained, that he was about to be freed--and, indeed, that he had been freed, a Kremlin spokesman summarily announced on February 3 that his government exchanged Babitsky for three Russian prisoners of war held by the Chechen resistance. 
   Chechen authorities deny that such an exchange ever took place. And, the Kremlin has not provided one iota of credible evidence backing its version of events. Today, the fate of Andrei Babitsky remains unknown. He is a father with a loving and courageous wife and two children. We must pray that Babitsky will return safely to his family. 
   Mr. President, it is with Andrei Babitsky in mind, I, along with Senator BIDEN, the Majority Leader, and Senator ROTH, send to the desk a resolution concerning the state of freedom of press in Russia. This resolution recounts the facts as we know them in the case of Andrei Babitsky, and it underscores that his detention and disappearance are not isolated incidents but part of the Russian government's broader and systematic repression of the press. 
   It expresses our belief that--and at that this point I shall read the concluding elements of the pending resolution:

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, for the past three years the Clinton administration has fought tooth-and-nail against the legislation now before the Senate. The White House repeatedly claimed, in its attempted defense, that the Lott-Lieberman initiative would undermine U.S. nonproliferation efforts, repeatedly asserting that they had Russia's behavior in check, and that progress was being made. 
   Well, Mr. President, we now confront an Iran that has been armed to the gills with technology for ballistic missiles and nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. According to the National Intelligence Officer for Strategic and Nuclear Programs, (who testified before the Foreign Relations Committee this past September), Iran is in a position to test, within the latter half of this decade, an ICBM that ``could deliver a several-hundred kilogram payload to many parts of the United States ..... using Russian technology and assistance.'' 
   Moreover, according to the Director of Central Intelligence, Iran ``probably has achieved `emergency operational capability' '' with its medium range Shahab-3 missile. In other words, under President Clinton's watch, Iran has acquired from Russia and China the ability to strike Israel and Turkey with ballistic missiles carrying chemical or biological warheads. And the mullahs are working overtime to develop the Shahab-4 and Shahab-5 in order to menace U.S. citizens at home. 
   In conclude now, in the absence of fierce opposition to this bill from the White House this time around, that reality has finally sunk in at the National Security Council. The Clinton administration's nonproliferation policy has been an abject failure. Bill Clinton and AL GORE will leave office having subordinated nonproliferation concerns to business interests, the wishes to foreign campaign donors, and their ``touchy-feely'' personal politicking in Russia, China and elsewhere. 
   The result has been an all-out fire-sale of deadly technologies by Russia, China, and others. Delegations from Iran, Syria, Iraq, North Korea, Libya, Sudan, Egypt, India, and Pakistan are virtually tripping over one another on their way in and out of various Russian and Chinese firms. 
   The Clinton-Gore Administration will leave office: 
   1. having allowed Russia and China to sell dangerous commodities around the globe with no fear of sanctions or consequences; 
   2. having presided over the development of a North Korean ICBM capable of dropping biological weapons on U.S. soil (according to the intelligence community, a Taepo Dong-2 ICBM could be tested any day now); 
   3. having presided over the arming of Iran, Syria, and others with nuclear, chemical, and biological missiles; 
   4. having squandered its inheritance regarding Iraq by interfering with, and ultimately abandoning, UNSCOM; 
   5. having prompted India and Pakistan into an all-out nuclear arms race by trying to ``strong-arm'' the two countries into the Test Ban Treaty (which merely prompted the nations to test); 
   6. having lost all hope of getting the START II Treaty ratified, which would have banned MIRVed ICBMs in Russia; 
   7. having imperiled the IAEA by tying the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to the poorly-conceived, poorly-drafted CTBT, which the Senate rightly rejected; 
   8. having destroyed the Missile Technology Control Regime by allowing Russia (a missile proliferator) to come in as a member; and 
   9. having wasted half a decade of precious time in deploying a national missile defense to protect the United States from the consequences of their failed nonproliferation policy.  
   We must all remember that the Clinton-Gore administration voted the DoD authorization bill in 1995 because it required deployment of a national missile defense by 2001, with additional protection by 2003. Because of the President's reckless disregard for the nation's security, the U.S. will not ``break ground'' on a missile defense site in Alaska until this summer, at the earliest. 
   At the same time, this administration taught Russia and China how to evade U.S. sanctions laws while simultaneously putting the U.S. sanctions determination process into a deep freeze. Not a single MTCR sanction has been imposed for Russia's arming of Iran or China's assistance to Pakistan. The enormity of this blatant disregard for the law is stunning, Mr. President. 
   What is worse, by promoting U.S. commercial interests at the expense of national security, the Clinton-Gore administration has become part of the problem. 
   China's nuclear proliferation has been swept under the rug by Mr. Clinton in order to clear the way for the nuclear lobby to sell reactors to the PRC. We must recall that, in 1998, President Clinton made a legally binding certification which no other President could, in good faith, bring himself to make. But the Clinton-Gore administration was happy to oblige industry and the Communist Chinese. 
   In 1996 the Clinton administration pulled controls on commercial satellites because millionaire campaign donors wanted it. Unsupervised, unscrupulous U.S. companies engaged in the transfer of very sensitive ballistic missile information to the PRC, including information relating to the MIRVing of ICBMs. The Congress tried to shore up this fiasco by recontrolling satellites, but the Commerce Department is at it again, having recently declared--despite the law--that it wants reduced controls on extremely sensitive items such as radiation hardened chips and kick motors. 
   From 1993 until 1999, willful disregard for security at the White House and the Department of Energy permitted continued acquisition of the nation's most sensitive nuclear warhead designs by China. This was exacerbated by the foolhardy declassification of thousands of documents by Hazel O'Leary, which undoubtedly has contributed to nuclear weapons capabilities around the globe. Even now, the Clinton-Gore administration is contemplating sharing nuclear weapons secrets with Russia in an effort to bribe them into submission on the ABM Treaty. 
   Lately, the Department of Defense--once the bulwark against the foolhardy weakening of export controls--has been working ``hand-in-glove'' with the defense industry and the Gore campaign. The Pentagon is now looking for ways to undermine the Arms Export Control Act. Again, this is happening because industry lobbying groups want these changes. There is an effort underway to avoid congressional notification of arms sales and to create license-free zones. The result, if unchecked, will be unfettered and unregulated trade in weaponry, which cannot be seen as a positive development under any circumstance. 
   Finally, the administration has decided to support passively an Export Administration Act which would effectively undermine all existing U.S. export controls and which would undercut what is left of the nonproliferation policy which this administration inherited eight years ago. Enormous sums of money are being spent all over Washington by various industry groups because they know how loose export controls will be under this bill. 
   Ronald Reagan's nonproliferation policy is in shambles, Mr. President. At best, this administration has been inept in managing such important issues. At worst, the administration has co-opted and corrupted nonproliferation policy on the basis of fund-raising schemes being run out of the Oval Office. The damage to U.S. nonproliferation policy is so severe and far-reaching, and the global results to date have been so catastrophic, that the next administration is going to spend the first four years just picking up the pieces. 
   Mr. President, history will do worse than recording this administration as having fiddled while Rome burned. It will record these people as having set many of the fires themselves. 
   I support the Iran Nonproliferation Act. Its reporting requirements will shed light on the fact that numerous Russian entities have sold their souls to the Mullahs in Tehran by offering that bunch of terrorists everything they want for their ballistic and cruise missile programs, including nuclear, chemical, and biological warfare technology. It will also prove that this administration has accomplished nothing in the past several years of ``talking.'' 
   That said, however much it might help, this bill will not solve the problem. It is much too late to prevent Iran from capitalizing upon the capabilities it has acquired. 
   While it is not too late to defend ourselves, or to assist Israel, Turkey, and others in defending themselves, it will fall to the next administration to reconstruct a comprehensive nonproliferation policy and reverse the fearful effects of the past eight years. 
   Thank you, Mr. President; I yield the floor.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, for those who may wonder why H.R. 3427, which was deemed enacted as a separate law in H.R. 3194, the D.C. Appropriations bill is called the ``Admiral James W. Nance and Meg Donovan Foreign Relations Authorization Act for 2000 and 2001,'' it is because of our love, affection and respect for Admiral Bud Nance and Meg Donovan. 
   Bud Nance was Chief of Staff of the Foreign Relations Committee until he passed away on May 11. 
   Bud served his country his entire adult life--as an ensign aboard the USS North Carolina in the Pacific Theater during World War II and later as a test pilot and fighter pilot. Among his many honors, he earned two Distinguished Service Medals and capped off his distinguished 38-year navy career as skipper of the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal. 
   Bud went on to serve as President Ronald Reagan's Deputy National Security Advisor. And at my request in 1991 Bud became minority staff director for the Foreign Relations Committee. From January 1995 until his passing in May, he served as Chief of Staff for the majority. Bud refused to take the job until I agreed that he would not take a paycheck. Bud said that his country had been good to him and this was how he could give something back to his country. 
   Bud was my lifelong friend. We were born two months apart, two blocks apart in the little town of Monroe, North Carolina. I miss my friend; it was a blessing to know him. 
   I am pleased that the House and the Senate agreed to recognize Bud and his influence on this bill, which was the last bill on which he had the opportunity to work. In addition, Meg Donovan has been added to the bill's name. I know Bud would have been honored to share this bill with Meg for whom he had a deep affection. 
   Like Bud, Meg Donovan, who died at age 47 of cancer last October, had spent much of her life in government service and international affairs. She served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs at the State Department at the time of her death, and before that was a longtime House International Relations Committee staff member. 
   Meg worked closely with the Senate on the confirmation of key foreign affairs nominations, including those of Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and later, Madeleine K. Albright. In the Congress, she worked primarily on issues dealing with political and religious dissidents, minorities and other persecuted groups, including Tibetans, Soviet Jews and women. 
   Both Bud and Meg are missed by the staffs of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House International Relations Committee, and by me and countless others, all of whom are pleased that this legislation bears the names of these two fine Americans.

   Mr. HELMS. I thank my colleague, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. I too have been assured by the Department that it will not use special access program status to deny the Foreign Relations Committee access to the nonproliferation information required by section 602(c).

   Mr. HELMS. I believe that is correct. If the Department's assurances are accurate, then this provision would not modify DOD's current policies regarding the protection of sensitive sources and methods. The Foreign Relations Committee has no intention of seeking expanded access to such sources and methods, or to DOD special access programs, so long as DOD lives up to its reporting obligations under existing law. DOD's policy of not handling nonproliferation information within special access channels certainly provides a significant reassurance in that regard. Our concern is only to ensure that DOD policy regarding special access programs or intelligence sources and methods not be seen as obviating its long-standing legal obligations to inform appropriate committees of Congress.

   Mr. HELMS. That is correct, Mr. Chairman. Unlike the other Secretaries you have mentioned, the Director of Central Intelligence is required only to disclose information covered under subparagraph (B). That information relates to significant proliferation activities of foreign nations. The Director is exempt from reporting information under subparagraph (A) and (B) which relates to the agency's operational activities. The Foreign Relations Committee understands that intelligence operations fall within the jurisdiction of the Intelligence Committee, and therefore did not include such activities in this reporting requirement.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, protecting America's children, our most vulnerable future leaders, is one of the highest obligations of government. Foremost among the reasons for waging a war on illegal drugs is the threat drugs pose and the damage they inflict on the children of America. 
   At the core, it has always been understood that drug policy is primarily a federal responsibility. The vast majority of illegal drugs consumed in the United States are produced outside of our borders, smuggled into the country, transported across state lines, and distributed via a complex multi-faceted criminal network. If we hope to combat the spread of this cancer effectively, the federal government simply must take the lead role. 
   The able Senator from Georgia, Mr. COVERDELL, expressed that view well when he said:  
   [W]hile our schools are the responsibility of states and local communities, the federal government has a responsibility to lead. ..... We must act now to ensure that every child has the opportunity to learn in a safe and drug-free school. ..... The message we send our children on drugs is a real problem. When the message is anything short of zero tolerance for drugs, we encourage drug usage by kids.  
   Mr. President, I agree absolutely. This recognition led me, along with several other Senators, to introduce a bill in the past two Congresses to extend the provisions of the Gun-Free Schools Act to illegal drugs. A modified version of that bill was also introduced as an amendment to S. 254 earlier this year; that version was unanimously agreed to by the Senate. 
   Today, I am reintroducing that amendment as part of the Hatch-Ashcroft-Abraham drug amendment, of which I am a proud cosponsor. 
   I am thankful for the opportunity once again to allow Senators to go on record in support of the eradication of illegal drugs from our classrooms. Simply put, my amendment conditions receipt of federal education funds on state adoption of a policy of ``zero tolerance'' for student drug dealers. By zero tolerance, my amendment would require that drug traffickers be expelled from school for not less than one year. 
   Anyone who thinks this policy unduly harsh should consult the 1998 CASA National Survey of Teens, Teachers and Principals. Prepared by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University under the direction of President Carter's former HEW Secretary, Joseph  Califano, the report states under the heading ``Drug Dealing in Our Schools'':  
   For too many kids, school has become not primarily a place for study and learning, but a haven for booze and drugs. ..... Parents should shutter when they learn that 22% of 12- to 14-year-olds and 51% of 15- to 17-year-olds know a fellow student at their school who sells drugs. ..... Indeed, not only do many of them know student drug dealers; often the drug deals take place at school itself. Principals and teachers may claim their schools are drug-free, but a significant percentage of the students have seen drugs sold on school grounds with their own eyes. ..... In fact, more teenagers report seeing drugs sold at school (27%) than in their own neighborhoods (21%).  
   The report goes on to detail that students consider drugs to be the number one problem they face, that illegal drugs are readily available to students of all ages, and that illegal drugs are now cheaper and more potent than ever before. According to CASA, ``one in four teenagers can get acid, cocaine or heroin within 24 hours, and given enough time, almost half (46%) would be able to purchase such drugs.'' Clearly, eliminating illegal drugs from America's classrooms is a required first step to restore order. 
   Impossible to calculate--the ill effects, disruptions, and violence associated with the drug trade are not limited to those who are active participants. The lives and futures of children who want to learn are often sacrificed by those disruptive students who seek to victimize their classmates. 
   A clear link between school violence and drugs was found by the PRIDE survey, conducted by the National Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education, when it reported that:  
   Gun-toting students were 23 times more likely to use cocaine; gang members were 12 times more likely to use cocaine; and students who threatened others were 6 times more likely to use cocaine than others.  
   The connection between drugs and school violence is apparent. 
   Mr. President, the devastation wrought by illegal drugs crosses all geographic, political and economic boundaries. It is not confined to a region of the country or a class of individuals. As one example, according to the North Carolina State University's Center for the Prevention of School Violence (a remarkable organization that tracks the incidence of school crime in North Carolina and suggests preventative measures), ``possession of a controlled substance'' has been either the first or second most reported category of school crime in my home state for the past four years. Regrettably, I suspect that many other 
   states share that dubious distinction as well. 
   In recognition of the federal obligation to foster safe schools, the Congress passed and the President signed the Gun-Free Schools Act in 1994. Many commentators have, at least in part, credited that act with reducing the number of guns brought to our schools. 
   It is time to provide a logical and common sense extension of that act by focusing not merely on the gun but on why students take guns to school in the first place. We must acknowledge that many children take guns to school either because they are involved in illegal activity or because they seek to protect themselves from those who are. A comprehensive effort to rid our schools of weapons must eliminate the reasons why students arm themselves not merely prohibit the possession of weapons. 
   This realization is not lost on those who are on the ``front lines'' of our war on drugs. When surveyed, students, teachers, and parents express overwhelming support for the adoption of a zero tolerance policy for drugs at schools. In fact, the closer they are to the problem, the more enthusiastic they are in support of zero tolerance. 
   For example, the CASA study that I mentioned earlier found that 80% of principals, 79% of teachers, 73% of teenagers and 69% of parents support zero tolerance. Additionally, 85% of principals, 79% of teachers, and 82% of students believe this policy effective at keeping drugs out of schools and believe that adoption of the policy would actually reduce drugs on their campus. In conclusion, the CASA report stated:  
   If these students believe them [zero tolerance policies] so effective, these policies must make an impact on their decisions to not bring drugs on campus. Given this, it seems that schools ..... should implement and strictly enforce zero tolerance policies.  
   Mr. President, this policy is firm but fair. The drug trade and its violence have no place in America's schoolhouses. Schools should be a safe haven for our children, fostering an environment that is conducive to learning and supportive of the vast majority of students who are eager to learn. At the very least, our children and teachers deserve a school free of fear and violence. 
   President Clinton, in his 1997 State of the Union address, stated ``[W]e must continue to promote order and discipline, supporting communities that remove disruptive students from the classroom, and have zero tolerance for guns and drugs in schools.'' Echoing that view, Texas Governor George W. Bush, in a major education speech last week, called for zero tolerance policies for disruptive students, stronger enforcement of federal laws on bringing guns into schools and greater accountability from schools that receive federal money for drug and safety programs. 
   Mr. President, it is obvious that the need to set high standards to protect our children from the scourge of illegal drugs should be a subject of broad bipartisan consensus. I hope that the Congress will heed President Clinton and Governor Bush's calls and that the Senate will once again send a strong signal to all that we intend to give our children the support they need to grow up safe and drug-free.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, 4 days ago, on November 5, the Senate Foreign Relations East Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee conducted its hearing on the Moseley-Braun nomination. Since it was a subcommittee meeting and a hearing, I viewed it on television. I have a long practice of giving chairmen and ranking members of our subcommittees free rein in conducting their respective hearings. So I viewed the hearing on television, as I say, and it was a sight to behold. 
   In fact, what it was was a political rally, lacking only a band and the distribution of free hot dogs, soda pop, and balloons. Last night, the full committee met briefly, almost informally, just outside the Chamber here, and reported the nomination to the Senate, with one dissent. I will let you guess whose dissent that was. 
   Before I proceed further, I express the sincere hope that the nominee, when confirmed to serve as U.S. Ambassador to New Zealand, will serve diligently, effectively, and honestly. She will be representing the United States, the country of all Americans. For the sake of our country, I pray there will be no further reports of irregularity involving her conduct. In short, I wish her well. 
   Before the book is closed on the scores of reports regarding the nominee's often puzzling service as a U.S. Senator, I decided a few footnotes were in order. Many citizens from many States all over this country--principally, however, from the Chicago area--have contacted me during the past few weeks. There have been expressions of puzzlement that the President of the United States decided to reverse the clearly expressed judgment of the people of Illinois in the 1998 election. Several speculated over the weekend that the Senate was about to rubber stamp the President's nomination to serve as U.S. Ambassador to New Zealand. After all, the Illinois voters have made the judgment that serious charges of ethical misconduct by Senator Moseley-Braun disqualified her from further representing them in the Senate. Now they say the same Senate is preparing to declare she is qualified to represent all Americans abroad. 
   I think it important, therefore, that the people of Illinois --indeed, all Americans--be assured before the Senate proceeds that what they are witnessing is by no means an absolution of Ms. Moseley-Braun. What the American people are witnessing is a successful coverup of serious ethical wrongdoing. I am not going to dwell this afternoon on each of the many serious charges that have been raised, such as the continuing mystery of who really paid for her numerous visits to Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha or where Ms. Moseley-Braun's fiance, Kosie Matthews, got the $47,000 downpayment on the Chicago condo. For the record, Mr. Matthews was also her campaign manager and is now conveniently a missing man. Nobody knows where he is. 
   Whatever happened to the $249,000 the Federal Election Commission cannot account for her in her campaign? Or who was it exactly who paid for several thousand dollars in airfare, luxury hotel bills, and jewelry purchases during her 1992 trip to Las Vegas or the $10,000 in jewelry she purchased on her 1992 trip to Aspen, CO? 
   In most cases, the Foreign Relations Committee and its legal officer were unable to get to the bottom of these and other matters because Ms. Moseley-Braun has been hiding behind Mr. Matthews. Mr. Matthews, a South African native, has skipped the country and is nowhere to be found. 
   My purpose today is not to go through the laundry list of Ms. Moseley-Braun's well-known ethical lapses but, rather, to focus on the Clinton administration's culpability in all of this affair. Ms. Moseley-Braun was suspected of serious tax crime by the Internal Revenue Service following her 1992 campaign. According to a report in the New Republic magazine, she had:  
   ..... a $6 million-plus war chest for her general election campaign, only $1 million of which was spent on TV advertising. Moreover, her campaign wound up $544,000 in debt.  
   Where did this money go? The IRS wanted to find out, but the IRS' efforts to investigate allegations that Moseley-Braun had diverted an estimated $280,000 of those campaign funds for personal use and failed to report it as personal income, those 
   allegations were blocked every step of the way by the Clinton Justice Department. 
   In 1995, the Clinton Justice Department twice refused routine requests by the IRS Criminal Tax Division to convene a grand jury to investigate the charges against Ms. Moseley-Braun. The IRS had credible evidence that, among other things, she had spent some $70,000 in campaign funds on designer clothes, $25,000 on two jeeps, $18,000 on jewelry, $12,000 on stereo equipment, and some $64,000 on luxury vacations in Europe, Hawaii, and Africa. 
   Without a grand jury, Government investigators were denied the subpoena power to get at the key documents they had to have to prove their case. The Clinton Justice Department refused repeated requests to convene a grand jury. 
   Refusing such a request is highly unusual, according to numerous former IRS and Justice Department officials who made clear that the Justice Department's routine in such matters was to impanel grand juries so the IRS could continue gathering evidence. One former official with the Criminal Tax Division of the Justice Department, a Mr. John Bray, called it virtually unheard of to deny such a request. A former head of the Criminal Tax Division, Cono Namorato, commented:  
   They [that is to say, the IRS] don't need to show much....... By and large, if it is requested, it is approved.  
   Another described the relationship between the Justice Department and the IRS this way:  
   The Justice Department basically sees the IRS as their client, and as their attorney they should do as requested.  
   But in Moseley-Braun's case, this routine request from the client was denied, not once but twice. 
   Then the Foreign Relations Committee requested all of the documents from both IRS and the Department of Justice on this matter. Contrary to declarations by Ms. Moseley-Braun, the documents do not absolve her of wrongdoing. What the documents prove is that these serious allegations of ethical misconduct were never properly examined because the investigation was blocked by political appointees at the Justice Department, no doubt on instructions from the White House. Interestingly enough, the official at the Justice Department who made the decision, Loretta Argrett, was a Moseley-Braun supporter who had made a modest contribution to the Moseley-Braun  1992 campaign and who had a picture of Ms. Moseley-Braun on her office wall. Senator Moseley-Braun even presided over Ms. Argrett's confirmation in 1993. 
   It is noteworthy that the White House had to spend more than a week digging around in the bowels of the Justice Department to find the documents requested by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. That is compelling evidence in and of itself because it demonstrates that the administration failed to properly examine the charges against this nominee when the charges were presented by the IRS in 1995. Again, the administration demonstrably failed even to review the charges in 1999 before sending her nomination up to the Senate. 
   It occurs to me that perhaps that was not unintentional. Perhaps the folks in the administration knew exactly what they were doing. Perhaps they hoped the spectacle of a public dispute between JESSE HELMS and Carol Moseley-Braun would serve the base political interests of the Clinton administration. 
   Well, Mr. President, I am not going to give them the spectacle they have been hoping to provoke. It may be that history, in a strange way, is now repeating itself. It is of interest to me that back in 1943, the then United States Senator Josiah William Bailey of North Carolina strongly opposed a proposal that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt nominate FDR's press secretary, a former Raleigh newspaper editor named Jonathan Daniels, as nominee to go--where? To New Zealand as United States Ambassador. Jonathan Daniels was a son of Josephus Daniels who had founded the Raleigh News and Observer many years earlier. Josephus once served as Secretary of the Navy and had chosen Franklin D. Roosevelt to be his assistant. Later on Josephus Daniels served as Ambassador to Mexico, nominated by President Roosevelt. 
   Jonathan Daniels repeatedly pleaded with FDR to nominate him to be Ambassador to ``somewhere'' so that he could emulate his father Josephus, but FDR told Jonathan Daniels that he would nominate him to be an Ambassador only if Jonathan persuaded Senator Bailey to approve the nomination. The fly in the ointment was that Jonathan Daniels, prior to going to Washington as press aide to FDR, had written a series of abusive, mean editorials about Senator Bailey. Anyhow, Jonathan decided that he had nothing to lose by going to Senator Bailey's office to plead his case. Senator Bailey flatly rejected the idea of Jonathan Daniels' going anywhere as Ambassador--and flat-out told Jonathan so. To which Jonathan Daniels played his last card, pleading:  
   Well, Senator, I would have thought that you wouldn't mind my being sent to New Zealand--it's on the other side of the world, you know.  
   To which U.S. Senator Josiah William Bailey slowly shook his head and said:  
   Yes, and it ain't fur enough.  
   Mr. President, you are free to draw your own conclusion. I thank you, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President in responding to the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, it is certainly true that North Carolina is the largest of the nation's textile and apparel states in terms of employment. In fact, North Carolina employs over 200,000 workers in this industry, many of which are directly involved in wool fabric production. For that reason, I share his deep interest in this wool fabric issue. I want to make it clear that any such legislation would institute a unilateral tariff reduction on the part of the U.S. I do not believe that it is wise policy for the U.S. to simply reduce important tariffs and gain nothing in return. These same fabric makers are essentially precluded from shipping their products to many key markets overseas. My point is simply, if we want to consider reducing these duties, it would be better done as part of the upcoming World Trade Organization talks later this month in Seattle. At the very least, in that forum we would have the ability to gain some reciprocal market access to our manufacturers.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the Senate is today considering the Serbia Democratization Act, which I introduced on March 25 with eleven other Senators, and which was approved by the Foreign Relations Committee on August 5. 
   The purpose of the legislation is clear: to undermine and ultimately eradicate the murderous regime of the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic. 
   Just one day before I introduced this legislation, NATO began its air campaign against Yugoslavia in response to that country's brutal treatment of the ethnic Albanian population in Kosovo. After NATO bombs started falling, Yugoslav army, police, and paramilitary forces controlled by Mr. Milosevic slaughtered thousands more Kosovar Albanians. More than one million were forced to flee Kosovo to neighboring counties. And hundreds of thousands more Kosovars eluded Serb forces by hiding in the hills. 
   This brutality was conceived, directed, and carried out under the orders of Slobodan Milosevic. As you know, Mr. President, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia indicted this madman as a war criminal for his activities in Kosovo. And if I might add, I have no doubt of his culpability for the ethnic cleansing and mass murder in Bosnia during the war there. 
   Now that the NATO bombs have stopped falling and there is hope for a peaceful future for the people of Kosovo, we must look to the next step. A ``Marshall Plan'' for the Balkans has been proposed. The European Union, the United States, and other allies have negotiated a so-called ``Stability Pact'' for Southeastern Europe, designed to encourage cooperation between countries in the region and target foreign assistance most effectively. 
   But no matter what kind of proposals put forth by the United States and our allies for this region, I am convinced that until the Balkans is rid of the dictatorial rule of Mr. Milosevic, we will be forced to confront crises that he manufactures well into the future. There is but one hope for stability in the Balkans, and that is the removal of Milosevic from power. 
   To achieve that objective is why I encourage the Senate to pass this legislation today. The United States should provide extensive support for democratic forces, including independent media, and non-governmental organizations in Serbia. Just as the United States did during the days of the cold war, it is in our interests to identify and give aid to those forces in Serbia that share our values and our goals. We should make clear that unless and until the government of Yugoslavia is based on democratic principles and the rule of law and respects internationally recognized human rights, the United States will maintain the sanctions regime that we have in place today. 
   But Mr. President, when the Serbian people have a government in Belgrade based on these important principles--the government that they deserve--this legislation calls for substantial support by the United States to assist their transition to democracy, including by helping Yugoslavia integrate into international institutions. 
   I am pleased that the Clinton administration agrees with me on the importance of assisting the democratic opposition in Serbia. Let me emphasize, however, that we need to act quickly. We missed an opportunity to encourage democratic change in Serbia three years ago, when tens of thousands of Serbian citizens took to the streets, demanding political change. We must not lose another chance to help those in Serbia who are trying to help themselves. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Serbia Democratization Act.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this is a sad afternoon for all of us. Senator CHAFEE and I had been seatmates for nearly a decade. I can testify that never once during those years did he comport himself in the slightest manner to diminish his image--which was widely held--as a perfect gentlemen and a dedicated American. His whole life was such. 
   He was a man whose dedication to his wife and family was demonstrable in everything he did and said. Often were the times that we exchanged tidbits of news about his family and mine; we talked a lot about those whom we love. 
   I was one of the many Senators who, with some frequency, did not agree with some of JOHN's votes. And you know, it is a funny thing, Mr. President, he disagreed with me the same number of times but always pleasantly. I never doubted that he was genuine, honest, and sincere in all that he did and said as a Senator and as a human being. 
   I never once heard him speak a harsh word about anyone, and I never was aware of his losing his temper. He may have, but I never saw it. 
   Mr. President, JOHN CHAFEE was a thoroughly decent and unfailing gentlemen who was respectful of the opinions and judgments of others but unyielding in his own opinions. That is the way it is supposed to be around here. 
   Did I like JOHN CHAFEE? You bet. Did I respect his quiet independence? Of course. Like the good U.S. Marine that he was in World War II, he was demonstrably willing to give his life for his country and to serve his country in other capacities, such as Secretary of the Navy. 
   I shall miss his sitting next to me; I shall always remember our agreement to nudge each other when the rhetoric in this Chamber caused heads to begin to nod, which frequently happens when some long-winded speaker takes up a lot of time, which I am not going to do at this time.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognizing me. 
   Let me say at the outset, I am so grateful to the younger Senators who have taken up this battle. And they are doing well with it. They may not win, but they are doing the Lord's work as far as I am concerned. 
   I remember, on January 22, 1973--and I had barely arrived in the Senate--Jim Buckley and I were sitting right over there, and the clerk brought in a bulletin from the Associated Press announcing the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade. Jim Buckley looked at me, and he said: We've got to fight this. I said: We certainly do. And we did. And we are still fighting it--in different ways. He is a Federal judge now, and I am a somewhat older Senator. 
   But my respect goes out to the ladies outside who are standing up for the right to life. They will always be dear to me. 
   Mr. President, before I launch into what I want to say, I have thought so many times of a beautiful Afro-American lady named Ethel Waters, born in Mississippi, the product of a rape. Her mother was much beloved by citizens in that Mississippi town. And they offered to take care of an abortion for her. She said: No. I don't want it. The Lord put that child in me, and I want it to be born. The baby turned out to be a girl who grew up to be one of the greatest singers in the history of this country. Ethel Waters' name is in all of the musical records as being a great voice. 
   That brings me up to the point that I want to try to make today, as briefly as possible. The United Nations recently sounded its alert button to announce what the United Nations described as the arrival of the six-billionth baby born in this world. And the news reports went on and on, of course, in great lamentation that the Earth does not produce enough resources to handle such population growth, the point being, of course, that the United Nations crowd does not believe bringing more babies into the world is advisable. 
   If I may be forgiven, I do not regularly agree with the United Nations, and this is another time when I do not agree. 
   In fact, the spin doctors worked steadily drumming up all manner of contrived environmental statistics to persuade the American people to support abortion. And those spin doctors, of course, used the term ``population control''--which is nothing more than a diplomatic way of promoting abortion because that is exactly what ``population control'' means. It means brutally killing innocent unborn babies. 
   Anyone doubting the horrors of population control need only to look at Red China, a Communist country, that proudly boasts of its population control program, a program which forces  pregnant women, who have already given birth to a male child, forces those women to undergo an abortion. 
   Astonishingly, Red China's Premier, Zhu Rongji, boasted that the world had been spared the ``burden'' of 300 million babies as a result of Red China's forced-abortion policy. 
   So I think there is no doubt that the ``population control'' spin doctors are, without fail, pro-abortionists with an undying and unyielding commitment to the abortion movement. 
   And no matter where it is performed, whether it is in 
   Red China or in the United States, abortion, in any form, is atrocious and wrong. And my critics may come out of their chairs, but they are breaking one of the Ten Commandments. 
   That is why I am grateful to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. SANTORUM, for his strength and conviction in standing up in defense of countless unborn babies. RICK SANTORUM's willingness to continue to lead the fight on behalf of the passage of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act is a demonstration of his courage. 
   From the moment the Senate first debated the Partial-Birth Ban Act in the 104th Congress, the extreme pro-abortion groups have sought to justify this inhumane, gruesome procedure as necessary to protect the health of women in a late-term complicated pregnancy. That is what they always say. However, well-known medical doctors, obstetricians, and gynecologists have repeatedly rejected this assertion that a partial-birth abortion can be justified for health reasons. 
   Moreover, there is much to be said about the facts surrounding the number of partial-birth abortions performed every year and the reasons they are performed--or at least the stated reasons. It is difficult to overlook the confession of Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, who acknowledged that he himself had deceived the American people on national television about the number and nature of partial-birth abortions. Mr. Fitzsimmons has since then estimated that up to 5,000 partial-birth abortions are conducted annually on healthy women, carrying healthy babies--a far cry from the rhetoric of Washington's pro-abortion groups who have insisted that only 500 partial-birth abortions, as they put it, are performed every year, and only--they say, every time--in extreme medical circumstances. 
   It is time for the Senate, once and for all, to settle this matter and pass the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act with a veto-proof vote and affirm the need to rid America of this senseless, brutal form of killing. 
   It is also important to note that the American people recognize the moral significance of this legislation. The majority of Americans agree that the Government must outlaw partial-birth abortion. In fact, in recent years, polls have found as many as 74 percent of Americans want the partial-birth procedure banned. 
   Unfortunately, the American people have to contend with President Clinton's adamant refusal to condemn this senseless form of killing, despite the public's overwhelming plea to ban it. 
   The President of the United States should have to explain, over and over again, to the American people why he will not sign this law. The spotlight will no longer shine on the much proclaimed ``right to choose.'' 
   I remember vividly the day when the Supreme Court handed down the decision to legalize abortion. As I said earlier, Jim Buckley and I--Senator Jim Buckley of New York and I--were sitting side by side because we were back-bench Senators at that time. Each of us who has fought, heart and soul, to undo that damaging decision, understood so well that day that we had yet to see what devastation would come of such a horrendous rule. 
   Indeed, when you stop to think about it, when the President of the United States condones the inhumane procedure known as ``partial-birth abortion,'' it is clear that our worst fears that January morning are coming true. 
   So it is time, once again, Mr. President, for Members of the Senate to stand up and be counted for or against the most helpless human beings imaginable, for or against the destruction of innocent human life in such a repugnant way. Senators are going to have to consider whether an innocent, tiny baby, partially born, just 3 inches from the protection of the law, has a right to live and to love and to be loved. In my judgment, the Senate absolutely must pass the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. I pray that it will do it by a great margin, of at least the 67 votes to override Bill Clinton's veto. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the Senate is moving toward the end of an historic confrontation against the most egregious arms control treaty ever presented to this body for its advice and consent. 
   The CTBT is a dangerous treaty which, if ratified, would do enormous harm to our national security. It will not and cannot accomplish its highly exaggerated stated goal of halting the spread of nuclear weapons, because as the CIA has repeatedly made clear the CTBT cannot be verified. Moreover, at the same time, it would undermine America's security by undermining confidence in the safety and reliability of our nuclear arsenal. 
   It is for these reasons that the Senate is prepared to vote down this treaty. 
   Unable--indeed unwilling even to try to respond to these facts, the White House has spitefully argued that Republicans are ``playing politics'' with the national security of the United States--a spurious charge, which is one of many reasons why the administration has failed to convince Senators who have raised substantive concerns. 
   Mr. President, the Senate Republicans' purpose in opposing this treaty is not because we seek to score political points against a lame-duck administration. 
   We are opposed because the CTBT is unverifiable, and because it will endanger the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Those who support the CTBT have failed to make a compelling case, and that, Mr. President, is precisely why the CTBT is headed for defeat. 
   The President and his Senate allies have mouthed the charge that the process has been ``unfair''--that Republicans are ramming this vote through the Senate in what the White House has falsely asserted as a ``blind rush to judgment.'' 
   Let's examine the record: The Senate has held seven separate hearings exclusively on the CTBT--three in the Government Affairs Committee, three in the Armed Services Committee and one final, day-long marathon hearing in the Foreign Relations Committee with 11 different witnesses. It is instructive that, after demanding for months that the Foreign Relations Committee hold hearings, only a handful of Democrat Senators even bothered to show up. 
   As for floor debate, we scheduled 22 hours of debate on the CTBT--more than any other arms control treaty in recent history. By contrast, the Senate held just 6 hours of debate on Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty; 9 1/2 hours on the START Treaty; 6 hours on the START II treaty; 18 hours on the Chemical Weapons Convention; and just 2 hours on the Conventional Forces in Europe Flank Agreement. 
   Well, then, some of them have falsely charged, Republicans pushed their unanimous-consent request through an unsuspecting Senate, on a Friday when few Senators were in town to discuss and consider it--a demonstrably false allegation. 
   The majority leader shared our draft unanimous-consent request with the minority leader on Wednesday, September 29. He offered it on the Senate floor the next day, Thursday, September 30. The minority objected, and asked for more time to consider it. After consulting with the White House, with the State Department, and with the Democrat Caucus, they came back with a request for more time for the debate. 
   We agreed to give them an additional week before the vote, and 12 additional hours of floor debate. Then on Friday October 1--after 3 days of internal discussion--they finally agreed to a unanimous consent for a vote they had vociferously demanded for two full years. And they are complaining that we are rushing to judgment? As my friend, Senator BIDEN has often pleaded during this debate; Give me a break! 
   So the ``politics'' argument failed, and the ``process'' argument failed. Now they are turning in desperation to the ``Chicken Little'' argument, warning us of the ``disastrous'' consequences should the Senate reject the CTBT. 
   If we vote the CTBT down, they warn, India and Pakistan may well proceed with nuclear test. Well, as Senator BIDEN may plead: Give me a break! That horse has already left the barn. India and Pakistan have already tested. Why did they test in the first place? Because of the Clinton administration's failed nuclear nonproliferation policies. 
   For years, India watched as Red China transferred M-11 missiles to their adversary, Pakistan. They watched as this administration stood by--despite incontrovertible evidence from our intelligence community that such transfers were taking place--and refused to impose sanctions on China that are required by law. As a result,  they made an unfortunate but understandable calculation that the President of the United States is not serious about non-proliferation, and that this White House is unwilling to impose a real cost on proliferating nations. 
   The fact of the matter is that no matter how the Senate votes on the CTBT, nations with nuclear ambitions will continue to develop those weapons. Russia and China will continue their clandestine nuclear testing programs. 
   North Korea will not sign or ratify the CTBT, and will continue to blackmail the West with its nuclear program. And India and Pakistan will probably test again--no matter what we do today. Because these nations know that this administration is unwilling to impose any real costs on such violations. 
   By defeating this treaty, the Senate will not change this calculus one iota. We will not be giving a ``green light'' for nuclear testing. Such tests by non-nuclear states are already a violation of the international norm established by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The proliferation we have witnessed in recent years has been a result of the administration's failure to enforce that existing norm, and place a real costs on violations of that norm. 
   Mr. President, only a willingness to impose real penalties on such violations will prevent the expansion of the nuclear club. Papering over the problem with a worthless piece of paper like the CTBT will accomplish nothing. 
   Let me suggest something that will happen when we defeat this treaty. This administration, and future administrations, will henceforth think twice before signing more bad treaties which cannot pass muster in the United States Senate. 
   This administration clearly wants the Senate's ``consent'' on treaties, but they are not interested in the Senate's ``advice.'' If they had asked our ``advice'' on the CTBT before they signed it, they would have known well in advance that an unvertifiable, permanent, zero-yield ban on all nuclear tests would be defeated. They would have negotiated a treaty that could be ratified. 
   Mr. President, when the debate ends today, there must be no ambiguity about the status of the CTBT. The Senate must make clear that this treaty is dead. Unless we vote today to explicitly reject the CTBT, under customary international law the U.S. will be bound by the terms of this treaty. The CTBT will be effectively in force. That is an unacceptable outcome. 
   Why must the Senate defeat the CTBT? The answer is clear: Because the next administration must be left free to establish its own nuclear testing and nuclear nonproliferation policies, unencumbered by the failed policies of the current, outgoing administration. We must have a clean break, so that the new President can re-establish American credibility in the world on non-proliferation. A credibility not based on scraps of paper, but on clear American resolve. 
   Mr. President, we must vote on this treaty and we must reject it. It is our duty and solemn responsibility under the Constitution. 
   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, my friend, Senator BIDEN, began with an allusion to the young people listening by television about how we call each other distinguish Senators and various other good things, and that is called courtesy. I call him a distinguished Senator, and I admire JOE BIDEN. He knows I do. I cannot outshout him. He has far more volume than I. I have used my windpipes a little bit longer than he has. 
   Let me tell you about JOE. He is a good guy. He is a good family man. He goes home to Delaware every night. He comes back in the morning. Sometimes he is not on time for committee meetings and other things, 
   but we take account of that. But you can bank on JOE BIDEN in terms of his vote. He is going to vote liberal every time. I have never known him--and I say this with respect--to cast a conservative vote. And that is the real difference. 
   I believe it is essential that the Senate withhold its consent and vote to  defeat the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. 
   Mr. President, in the post-cold-war world, many of us have assumed that the U.S. nuclear deterrent is less relevant than before. I contend that it is more important than ever. 
   The level of threat posed by another nation has two parts--the nation's capabilities to inflict damage upon us, and the intent to do so. Since the end of the cold war, Russia's intent, clearly, is peaceful. This has not changed Russian nuclear capabilities, however. If Russia's government were to change to a hostile one tomorrow, the level of threat posed by Moscow would be even greater than it was during the cold war. 
   Unlike the United States, Russia has not stopped improving on its nuclear arsenal. The Russians have continued to modernize their nuclear arsenal with new warheads and new delivery systems, despite the end of the cold war. This modernization has been at tremendous economic expense and has probably entailed continued nuclear testing. I might also add that Russian nuclear doctrine has continued to evolve since the end of the cold war, and now Moscow relies even more on its nuclear deterrent for defense than it did before. 
   But, Russian is not the only potential threat. The greater danger may come, ultimately, from China. As you know, Chinese espionage has yielded great fruit, including United States nuclear weapons designs and codes, as well as intelligence on our strategic nuclear submarine force. China continued nuclear testing long after the United States undertook a self-imposed nuclear test moratorium in 1992. And, undoubtedly, it can continue secret nuclear testing without our being able to detect it. 
   Other threats also abound. One of the most serious is from North Korea, which remains in noncompliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and is continuing to build missiles that can be used for nuclear weapons delivery. 
   In this uncertain world, it is not enough to simply retain a nuclear arsenal. We need a true nuclear deterrent. A nuclear arsenal becomes a nuclear deterrent only when we have convinced potential enemies that we will use that arsenal against them if they attack us or our allies with weapons of mass destruction. This means we must do two things. First, we must maintain the arsenal in workable, reliable condition. Second, we must clearly communicate our willingness to use the arsenal. We must not forget: a weapon does not deter if your enemy knows that you won't use the weapon. 
   Nuclear testing, historically, has performed both the maintenance and communications functions. Testing kept the arsenal reliable and modern. Very importantly, it also signaled to potential enemies that we were serious about nuclear deterrence. 
   Some people might argue that our nuclear arsenal is as modern as it will ever need to be. I am not willing to make that argument because I know I can't predict the future. I have no way of knowing what technological advances our potential enemies may make. Perhaps they will make discoveries of countermeasures that make our delivery systems outmoded. Or, perhaps they will acquire ever more potent offenses, just as Iraq, Russia, and North Korea have acquired highly virulent biological weapons. 
   If the future does bring new challenges to our existing arsenal, I think we ought to be in a position to modernize our stockpile to meet those challenges. The directors of our nuclear weapons design laboratories have told us that we cannot modernize our weapons, for example, to take on the threat of biological weapons unless we can test. It therefore seems reasonable that we not deny ourselves the ability to test. 
   Again, some people may argue that we should join the CTBT and then pull out if we need to test. That would be terribly foolish. We all know how politically difficult it is to pull out of a treaty, no matter how strong the arguments are for doing so. It is better to not join in the first place. 
   In conclusion, let me reiterate my support for keeping our nuclear deterrent strong. The nuclear arsenal protects us against attacks from other nations that might use weapons of mass destruction against us. It tells them silently that the cost of any aggression is too high. We need to keep sending that signal to them, and nuclear testing will help us do that. 
   Mr. President nuclear deterrence was crucial to U.S. and allied security throughout the cold war, and it will be no less important in the future. The enormous benefit of America's nuclear deterrent is that it protects U.S. interests and safeguards the peace without the use of force. 
   It is clear that on several occasions, notably during the Cuban missile crisis, nuclear deterrence kept the cold war from becoming a shooting war. Now that the cold war is over, has nuclear deterrence become less important? The answer is no. During the first conflict of the post-cold-war period, the 1991 gulf war with Saddam Hussein, nuclear deterrence undoubtedly saved thousands, possibly tens of thousands of lives. How? Saddam Hussein was deterred from using his chemical and biological weapons because he feared the United States would retaliate with nuclear weapons. That is not my interpretation of the gulf war; it is what senior Iraqi leaders have said. The gulf war experience illustrates that as chemical, biological and nuclear weapons continue to proliferate, the U.S. nuclear deterrent will become even more vital to our security. 
   While Washington must be prepared for the possibility that nuclear deterrence will not always safeguard the peace, we must safeguard our capability to deter. President Clinton recognized this continuing value of nuclear deterrence in the White House's most recent presentation of U.S. national security strategy. A National Security Strategy for A New Century, I quote: ``Our nuclear deterrent posture is one of the most visible and important examples of how U.S. military capabilities can be used effectively to deter aggression and coercion .....'' And, quote ``The United States must continue to maintain a robust triad of strategic forces sufficient to deter any hostile foreign leadership .....'' 
   The strategy of nuclear deterrence that for decades has played such a crucial role in preserving peace without resort to war would be damaged, perhaps beyond repair, in the absence of nuclear testing. Make no mistake, the CTBT would harm U.S. security by undermining the U.S. nuclear deterrent. 
   For the nuclear stockpile to underwrite deterrence it must be credible to foes. That credibility requires testing. To deter hardened aggressors who are seemingly impervious to reason, there is no substitute for nuclear testing to provide the most convincing demonstration of the U.S. nuclear stockpile and U.S. will to maintain nuclear deterrence. 
   The strategy of nuclear deterrence also requires that U.S. leaders have confidence that the nuclear stockpile will work as intended, is safe and reliable. Only testing can provide that confidence to U.S. leaders, and to our European and Asian allies who depend on the U.S. nuclear deterrent for their security. In the past, nuclear testing has uncovered problems in given types of weapons, and also assured that those problems were corrected, permitting confidence in the reliability of the stockpile. 
   The absence of testing would undermine both the credibility of the U.S. nuclear deterrent in the eyes of would-be aggressors and the confidence of U.S. leaders in the strategy of nuclear deterrence. 
   In addition, an effective strategy of nuclear deterrence requires that the nuclear stockpile be capable of deterring a variety of aggressors and challenges. New and unprecedented threats to United States security are emerging as a variety of hostile nations, including North Korea and Iran, develop mass destruction weapons and their delivery means. The U.S. nuclear deterrent must be capable against a wide spectrum of potential foes, including those who are desperate and willing to take grave risks. The nuclear stockpile inherited from the cold war is unlikely to be suited to effective deterrence across this growing spectrum of potential challengers. America's strategy of nuclear deterrence will become increasingly unreliable if the U.S. nuclear arsenal is limited to that developed for a very different time and challenger. Nuclear weapons of new designs inevitably will be necessary; and as the directors of both nuclear weapons design  laboratories have affirmed, nuclear testing is necessary to provide confidence in the workability of any new design. In short, nuclear testing is the key to confidence in the new weapons design that inevitably will be necessary to adapt our nuclear deterrent to a variety of new challengers and circumstances. 
   Finally, the U.S. strategy of nuclear deterrence cannot be sustained without a cadre of highly trained scientists and engineers. That generation of scientists and engineers that served successfully during the cold war is passing rapidly from the scene. Nuclear testing is critical to recruit, train, and validate the competence of a new generation of expert to maintain America's nuclear deterrent in the future. 
   Mr. President, there is no credible evidence that the CTBT will reduce nuclear proliferation. None of the so-called ``unrecognized'' nuclear states--India, Pakistan and Israel--will be convinced by this Treaty to give up their weapons programs. Most important, those states that are currently seeking nuclear weapons--including Iran, Iraq and North Korea a state that probably already has one of two nuclear weapons--will either not sign the Treaty or, equally likely, will sign and cheat. These countries have demonstrated the value they ascribe to all types of weapons of mass destruction and are not going to give them up because others pledge not to test. They also know that they do not need to test in order to have confidence in first generation weapons. The United States did not test the gun-assembly design of the ``little boy'' weapon in 1945; and the South Africans and other more recent proliferators did not test their early warhead designs. 
   Contrary to its advertised purpose, and in a more perverse and bizarre way, the CTBT could actually lead to greater proliferation not only by our adversaries but also by several key allies and friends who have long relied on the American nuclear umbrella as a cornerstone of their own security policy. In other words, if the CTBT were to lead to uncertainties that called into question the reliability of the U.S. nuclear deterrent, which it certainly will, the result could well be more rather than less proliferation. 
   The United States has for many years relied on nuclear weapons to protect and defend our core security interests. In the past, our nuclear weapons were the central element of our deterrent strategy. In today's world--with weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles increasingly available to rogue states--they remain an indispensable component of our national security strategy. While serving as a hedge against an uncertain future with Russia and China, United States nuclear weapons are also essential in meeting the new threat of regional states armed with weapons of mass destruction. In fact, in the only contemporary experience we have with an enemy armed with chemical and biological weapons, there is strong evidence that our nuclear weapons played a vital role in deterring Saddam from using these weapons in a way that would have changed the face of the gulf war, and perhaps its outcome. 
   While the U.S. nuclear deterrent today inspires fear in the minds of rogue-type adversaries, U.S. nuclear capabilities will erode in the context of a CTBT. Inevitably, as both we and they watch this erosion, the result will be to encourage these states to challenge our commitment and resolve to respond to aggression. Much less concerned by the U.S. ability--and therefore its willingness--to carry out an overwhelming response, they will likely pursue even more vigorously aggression in their own neighborhoods and beyond. To support their goals, these states will almost certainly seek additional and ever more capable weapons of mass destruction--chemical, biological and nuclear--to deter American intervention with our conventional superiority. They may also be more willing to employ weapons of mass destruction on the battlefield in an effort to disrupt, impede, or deny the United States the ability to successfully undertake military operations. 
   By calling into question the credibility of the ``extended deterrent'' that our nuclear weapons provided for key allies in Europe and Asia, the CTBT could also spur proliferation of nuclear weapons by those states who have long relied on the U.S. nuclear guarantee. For over half a century, the United States has successfully promoted non-proliferation through the reassurance of allies that their security and ours were inseparable. U.S. nuclear weapons have always been a unique part of this bond. Formal allies such as Germany, Japan and South Korea continue to benefit from this protection. Should the U.S. nuclear deterrent become unreliable, and should U.S. allies begin to fear for their security having lost faith in the U.S. guarantee, it is likely that these states--especially those located in conflict-laden regions--would revisit the question of whether they need their own national deterrent capability. 
   Maintaining a reliable and credible nuclear deterrent has also contributed to the reassurance of other important friends in regions of vital interest. For instance, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia have to date shown considerable restraint in light of the nuclear, chemical and biological weapons proliferation in their region, in large part because they see the United States as committed and capable of coming to their defense. While strong security relations have encouraged Taipei and Riyadh to abstain from their own nuclear programs, an unreliable or questionable U.S. nuclear deterrent might actually encourage nuclear weapons development by these states. 
   In summary, by prohibiting further nuclear testing--the very ``proof'' of our arsenal's viability--the CTBT would call into question the safety, security, and reliability of U.S. nuclear weapons, as well as their credibility and operational utility. Consequently, should the United States move forward with ratification of the Treaty, it is likely to have the profound adverse effect of encouraging further proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This would be in the most fundamental way detrimental to U.S. national security objectives. 
   Mr. President, a cornerstone of arms control is the ability of the U.S. government to verify compliance. In U.S. bilateral agreements such as the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, and the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, the Senate has insisted on provisions in the treaty that would provide for a combination of cooperative measures including on-site inspection, as well as independent national technical means of verification to monitor compliance. Such provisions have been almost entirely absent in multinational arms control agreements. It is not surprising that international agreements such as the Biological Weapons Convention, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Missile Technology Control Regime, and the Chemical Weapons Convention are ignored by nations whose security calculation drives them to acquire weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. The CTBT is likely to sustain the tradition of non-compliance we have so widely observed with other multilateral arms control agreements. The problem with the CTBT is particularly acute because national technical means of verification do not exist to verify compliance. There is some relevant arms control history on this point. 
   In the 1980's, the United States negotiated a threshold test ban treaty with the former Soviet Union, FSU. This agreement limited nuclear tests to a specific yield measured in equivalent explosive energy in tons of TNT. Compliance with this agreement could not be verified by national technical means of verification. Very specific cooperative measures were required to render the agreement vulnerable to verification of compliance. Specifically, underground nuclear tests were limited to designated sites, and each side was required to permit the deployment of sensors in the region where tests were permitted to monitor such testing. These extraordinary measures emphasize the limitations of underground nuclear test monitoring. Tests that were not conducted at designated sites could not be reliably monitored. Moreover, even when we are confident we know where a test will be conducted, unless we have detailed knowledge of the local geological conditions and are able to deploy our own sensors near the site, the limits of modern science--despite the billions of dollars invested in various technologies for nearly half a century--cannot verify compliance with national undertakings concerning underground nuclear testing.  
   Since the early 1990's, Russian nuclear weapons scientists and engineers have been conducting experiments at a test site on the Novaya Zemlya Island in the Russian Arctic. Because these tests are conducted in underground cavities, it is beyond the limits of modern scientists to be certain that a nuclear test has not been conducted. Two such tests were carried out in September according to the Washington Post in its report on Sunday, October 3, 1999. No one in the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, the CIA, or the White House knows what those tests were. Nor can they know. These could have been nuclear tests using a technique for emplacing the nuclear device in circumstances that will deny us the ability to know whether or not a nuclear test has been carried out. 
   A technique known as ``decoupling'' is a well understood approach to concealing underground nuclear tests. By suspending a nuclear device in a large underground cavity such as a salt dome or hard rock, the seismic ``signal'' produced by the detonation is sharply reduced as the energy from the detonation is absorbed by the rock or salt. The resulting ``signal'' produced by the blast of the detonation becomes difficult to distinguish from natural phenomena. Because decoupling is a simple, cheap, and reliable means of concealing nuclear tests, the United States insisted on a provision in the Threshold Test Ban Treaty that underground nuclear tests could only be undertaken in specific agreed-upon sites. The unfeasibility of monitoring compliance with a CTBT if a nation decides to use decoupling techniques to conceal nuclear tests. This has been acknowledged by the Intelligence Community. The Community's chief scientist for the Arms Control Intelligence Staff, Dr. Larry Turnbull stated last year. 
   The decoupling scenario is credible for many countries for at least two reasons: First, the worldwide mining and petroleum literature indicates that construction of large cavities in both hard rock and sale is feasible with costs that would be relatively small compared to those required for the production of materials for a nuclear device; second, literature and symposia indicate that containment of particulate and gaseous debris is feasible in both sale and had rock. 
   The reduction in the seismic ``signal'' can diminish the apparent yield of a nuclear device by as much as a factor of 70. The effectiveness of concealment measures means that potential proliferators can develop the critical primary stage of a thermonuclear (hydrogen) weapon. It can do so with the knowledge that science does not permit detection of a decoupled nuclear test in a manner that will permit verification of compliance with a CTBT or any other bilateral or multilateral arms control agreement intended to restrain nuclear testing. 
   How much risk must the United States continued to be exposed by these ill-thought out multilateral arms control agreements? We have been reminded of this problem recently. The Biological Weapons Convention has been advertised by the same people now advocating the CTBT to be a successful example of a universally subscribed codification of the rejection of biological weapons by the international community. What has happened in the three decades since its ratification? The treaty has in fact, been widely violated. Two dozen nations have covert biological weapons programs. The arms control community--recognizing the treaty's fundamentally flawed character--is now seeking to ``put toothpaste back in the tube'' by attempting to negotiate verification provisions 30 years after the fact. We know from the report of the Rumsfeld Commission last year that the technology of nuclear weapons has been widely disseminated--abetted by the declassification policies of the Department of Energy. The problem of nuclear proliferation is now beyond the grasp of arms control. Other measures to protect American security and the security of its allies from its consequences now must be identified, considered, and implemented. We simply have to face the fact that compliance with the CTBT cannot be verified and no ``fix'' is possible to save it. The scope and pace of the consequences of nuclear proliferation will be magnified if the CTBT is verified. 
   Mr. President, when Ronald Reagan said ``trust but verify'' he expressed what most Americans feel about arms control treaties that limit the tools of U.S. national security. They know we will abide scrupulously by our legal obligations and would like to live in a world where others do the same. But since we do not live in such a world, they expect us to avoid treaties whose verification standards are less demanding than our own compliance standards. 
   The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty now before us for advice and consent would be a radical departure from traditional U.S. approaches to the cessation of nuclear testing. Despite its superficial attractiveness there are two enduring reasons why no previous administration has ever advocated a permanent, zero-yield test ban. The first is that we've never apologized for relying on low yield underground tests to assure the safety and reliability of our nuclear deterrent. 
   Others and I will have more to say about that issue, but right now I will focus on the second reason we've never catered to the anti-nuclear sentiments behind a zero-yield test ban. In the 1950's--when international nuclear disarmament really was a stated objective of U.S. policy--President Eisenhower's ``comprehensive'' test ban applied to tests above four or five kilotons. But after studying it for a few years he turned instead to nonproliferation and limited test ban proposals because he realized he could not assure verification of a test ban even at that threshold. 
   We understood back then that cheating would allow an adversary to modernize new weapons and confirm the reliability of existing ones. We knew we would never exploit verification loopholes for military advantage but were less sanguine about the forbearance of others. We knew that monitoring, detecting, and identifying noncompliance, let alone verifying it under international legal standards, was beyond our technical, diplomatic, and legal limits, and we were honest enough to say so. 
   And yet today we are told verification methods are good enough to enforce compliance by others with a permanent zero-yield test ban while we pursue unconstrained nuclear weapons modernization by other means ourselves. Mr. President, I know that science has not stood still over the past 40-plus years. Our monitoring methods have no doubt improved. But does that mean that from now until forever we can verify any nuclear test of any magnitude, conducted by anyone, anywhere? And--if we could--that we would be equipped to do something about it? The administration wisely stops short of such absolute claims, but asserts nevertheless that international verification methods are adequate for this treaty. 
   So I have to ask is it our means of detection and verification or our standards of foreign compliance that have ``evolved'' over the past 44 years? I realize that perfect verification is unachievable. The U.S. is party to many treaties--some good, some bad--that are less than 100% verifiable. But the administration's belief--that this CTBT is so important that we should bind ourselves forever to its terms anyway--does not flow logically from that premise. 
   Previous administration have proposed bans on nuclear tests above certain yields despite sub-optimal means of monitoring compliance by appealing to their ``effective'' rather than ``foolproof'' verification provisions. The Carter administration employed that standard to promote a ten-year ban on tests above two kilotons. They knew a lower threshold would stretch credulity despite the seemingly infinite elasticity of ``effective verification.'' 
   Mr. President, ``effective verification'' is an intentionally vague political term-of-art, but as the old saying goes, we all ``know it when we see it.'' for the CTBT, it should mean we have high confidence that we can detect within hours or days any clandestine nuclear test that would provide a cheater with militarily significant weapons information. 
   If the administration attaches a different meaning to the term, we are entitled to know that. If not, we are entitled to know precisely what nuclear tests yields do provide militarily significant information, and whether the CTBT's verification system can detect them down to that level.  
   As they are pondering those questions, permit me to offer some assistance. Those who test new weapons and track the deterioration of old ones will tell you that Carter's two-kiloton threshold would have permitted scientifically valuable U.S. nuclear tests (which Clinton's CTBT would disallow) bearing directly on the reliability of our nuclear deterrent. 
   So, let me rephrase the question. Let's say evidence suggests a foreign test in, say, Novaya Zemlya, North Korea, Iran's territorial waters, or somewhere near the Tibetan mountains. Let's say it indicates an explosion of five kilotons--250 percent of what Carter would have allowed. Let's say the test did not take place in a ``decoupled'' cavity and, unlike the Pakistani test of May 1998, that the suspect state did not disable in-country seismic stations. 
   Now, will the IMS reliably detect that test within hours or days with high confidence? Will is promptly identify the test and its precise location? Will it quickly differentiate it from mining excavations and plant disasters? 
   And if it does: Will the requisite 30 members of the 51-member CTBT Executive Council immediately support an on-site inspection on the basis of that IMS input? 
   Will the Executive Council issue an inspection request even if the state in question was the last one inspected and cannot be challenged consecutively? 
   With the alleged cheater welcome a team of top caliber experts and escort them to the suspected location promptly on the basis of that input? 
   Will inspectors be allowed to use state-of-the-art inspection equipment in and around all suspect facilities on the basis of that input? 
   Let's say the IMS and Executive Council overcome all of those impediments and call for an on site inspection of the suspected state. Now, do you suppose a state that conducted a clandestine nuclear test might be prepared to exercise any of the following rights explicitly granted under the CTBT's ``managed access'' principle: 
   Deny entry to the inspection team [88(c)]? Refuse to allow representatives of the United States (as the challenging state) to accompany the inspectors [61(a)]? Delay inspectors' entry for up to 72 hours after arrival [57]? Permanently exclude a given individual from any inspections [22]? Veto the inspection team's use of particular equipment [51]? Declare buildings off-limits to inspectors [88(a); 89(d)]? Declare several four-square-kilometer sites off-limits to inspectors? [89(e); 92; 96]? Shroud sensitive displays, stores, or equipment [89(a)]? Disallow collection/analysis of samples to determine the presence or absence of radioactive products [89(c)]? 
   Mr. President, even if we truly believe that in certain cases, working diligently under CTBT rules, each of these impediments can be surmounted, I must ask: 
   Would it really be worth it for 5 kilotons? What if comparable events arise days, weeks, or months apart? What if new information bearing on the event arises after the elaborate inspection process has run its course? What if we develop comparable suspicions of the same state frequently? How many of these would it take before the United States is branded as a ``pest'' by the anti-nuclear crowd that is pushing this treaty? What if only our friends agree with our judgments? Or, perish the thought, if even our ``friends'' don't? How many pointless, frustrating, inconclusive OSI exercises would have to proceed our exercise of ``Safeguard F'' withdrawal rights? 
   In short, Mr. President, the CTBT is long on President Reagan's ``trust'' requirement, but fatally short on his ``verify'' requirement. I don't see how a single Senator can vote in favor of its ratification. 
   Mr. President, I want to clarify a point in regard to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and to set the record straight concerning the heritage of the treaty that the Senate is now considering. 
   The treaty before the Senate is not, as some have led us to believe, the product of nine administrations. Certainly Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon, and Dwight D. Eisenhower have no ties to this treaty. And, the administrations of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter's never proposed this treaty. The fact is, no other administration has any tie whatsoever to the treaty that is being considered by the Senate. The administration would like you to think that the treaty has had decades of support. Not so. This treaty is all Bill Clinton's. No other administration has ever supported a zero yield, unlimited duration nuclear test ban treaty barring all tests. 
   Well, they'll say, the idea of limiting nuclear testing has been endorsed since the Eisenhower administration. Well, that may be, but supporting an idea and endorsing the specifics of a concrete proposal are two different things. President Clinton and I both support tax cuts. We both support missile defense. We even both say we're for maintaining a strong nuclear deterrent. It's in examining the specific tax cuts, missile defense proposals, and methods of maintaining our nuclear security that we differ. 
   President Eisenhower's name has been invoked here a number of times by Members supportive of the treaty. The implication is that Eisenhower is somehow the father of the CTBT. A review of the historical record reveals that President Eisenhower's administration proposed a test ban only of limited duration. Eisenhower only supported the test moratorium that began in 1958 because he was assured that the moratorium would retain American nuclear superiority and freeze the Soviets in an inferior position. He was very clear that the United States had to maintain a nuclear edge both in quality and quantity. I believe President Eisenhower would not have supported a treaty that gave others an advantage, as this treaty clearly does. 
   President Kennedy's views of a nuclear test ban were much the same as Eisenhower's. He did not support a zero yield test ban. In fact, hydronuclear tests were conducted secretly in the Nevada desert during President Kennedy's administration. He also did not support a ban of unlimited duration. Kennedy broke out of the testing moratorium after the Soviet Union tested on September 1, 1961. At that time the world was shocked that the Soviets were able to begin an aggressive series of 60 tests within 30 days. Equally shocking was the realization that the Soviets had been planning for the tests for at least six months, while at the same time negotiating with the United States to extend the test moratorium. The Kennedy and Johnson administrations did agree to the Limited Test Ban Treaty which banned nuclear blasts in the atmosphere, space, or under water, but not underground as the CTBT does. 
   President Nixon did not seek to ban nuclear tests, although he agreed to limit tests above 150 kilotons. 
   James Schlesinger, President Jimmy Carter's Secretary of Energy tell us that President Carter only sought a 10-year treaty and sought to allow tests of up to two kilotons. 
   Presidents Reagan and Bush did not pursue a comprehensive test ban of any kind or duration. Some point to President Bush's signing of the Hatfield/Exon/Mitchell legislation limiting the United States to a series of 15 underground tests before entering a ban on testing as evidence that President Bush supported this comprehensive test ban treaty. This is not correct. On the day he left office, President Bush repudiated the Hatfield legislation and called for continuation of underground nuclear testing. He said, I quote,  
   The administration strongly urges Congress to modify this legislation urgently in order to permit the minimum number and kind of underground nuclear tests that the United States requires, regardless of the action of other states, to retain safe, reliable, although dramatically reduced deterrent forces.  
   That brings us to the Clinton administration. Only President Clinton has sought a zero yield, unlimited duration treaty, and he has not even held that position for the entirety of his administration. For the first 2 1/2 years, this administration pursued a treaty that would allow some level of low yield testing. As recently as 1995, the Department of Defense position was that it could support a CTBT only if tests of up to 500 tons were permitted. As a concession to the non-nuclear states, the Clinton administration dropped that proviso and agreed to a zero yield test ban. 
   This treaty has no historical lineage. It is from start to finish President Clinton's treaty. 
   Mr. President, proponents of the CTBT are fond of pointing out that public opinion is strongly in favor of the treaty. This is not particularly a surprise because, in general, Americans support treaties that have been signed by their President. They assume that the U.S. Government would not participate in a treaty that is not in the nation's interest. 
   In this regard, I would like to make two points. First, the American public overwhelmingly supports maintenance of a strong U.S. nuclear deterrent. If people are given the facts about the importance of nuclear testing to that deterrent, I believe that their view of the CTBT would change dramatically. Second, the CTBT indeed is not in the nation's interests and it is up to us, as leaders, to explain to the people why. Let me first address Americans' attitudes toward their nuclear deterrent. 
   In June, 1998, the Public Policy Institute of the University of New Mexico truly non-partisan and professional groups conducted a nationwide poll on public views on security issues. Let me give you a few results of that poll: 
   Seventy-three percent view it as important or extremely important for the U.S. to retain nuclear weapons today. 
   Sixty-six percent view U.S. nuclear weapons as integral to maintaining U.S. status as a world leader. 
   Seventy percent say that our nuclear weapons are important for preventing other countries from using nuclear weapons against our country. 
   More than 70 percent say that it is important for the U.S. to remain a military superpower, with 45 percent saying that it is extremely important that we remain so. 
   Now, we all know that the measure of commitment to a given aim can sometimes best be gauged by willingness to spend money to achieve it. The poll asked, ``Should Government increase spending to maintain existing nuclear weapons in reliable condition?'' Fifty-seven percent support increased spending and 15 percent support present spending levels. 
   I will return to the subject of public opinion in a moment, but let me turn briefly to the issue of whether this treaty is in the nation's interest. If there were a test ban, we would not be able to know with certainty whether our nuclear weapons are as safe and reliable as they can be. On the other hand, Russia, China, and others might be able to continue nuclear testing without being detected. This is because the CTBT is simply not verifiable. What do you think the American people would think about that? Well, we have some data to tell us. 
   The University of New Mexico's poll asked: ``If a problem develops with U.S. nuclear weapons, is it important for the United States to be able to conduct nuclear test explosions to fix the problem?'' Fifty-four percent of the people said yes. Only 15.5 percent said no. The rest were undecided. 
   The poll also asked, ``How important do you think it is for the United States to be able to detect cheating by other countries on arms control treaties such as the comprehensive nuclear test ban? Over 80 percent said that it was important, with 40 percent saying that it is extremely important. 
   The bottom line here is that the American people want us to retain a strong nuclear deterrent. While they will also support good arms control measures, they expect the American leadership to do whatever is necessary to keep the deterrent strong. Let's not be fooled by simplistic yes-or-no answers to questions about the CTBT. This issue is more complex than that. We must simply give people the facts about this treaty. The CTBT would imperil our security. 
   I urge a vote against this treaty. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time. 
   I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. HELMS. I feel obliged to observe that the United States has already flirted with an end to nuclear testing--from 1958 to 1961. It bears remembering that the nuclear moratorium ultimately was judged to constitute an unacceptable risk to the nation's security, and was terminated after just three years. On the day that President Kennedy ended the ban--March 2, 1962--he addressed the American people and said:  
   We know enough about broken negotiations, secret preparations, and the advantages gained from a long test series never to offer again an uninspected moratorium. Some urge us to try it again, keeping our preparations to test in a constant state of readiness. But in actual practice, particularly in a society of free choice, we cannot keep top flight scientists concentrating on the preparation of an experiment which may or may not take place on an uncertain date in the future. Nor can large technical laboratories be kept fully alert on a standby basis waiting for some other nation to break an agreement. This is not merely difficult or inconvenient--we have explored this alternative thoroughly and found it impossible of execution.  
   This statement is very interesting. It makes clear that the fundamental problems posed by a test ban remain unchanged over the past 27 years. The United States certainly faces a Russian Federation that is engaging in ``secret preparations'' and likely is engaging in clandestine nuclear tests relating to the development of brand-new, low-yield nuclear weapons. The United States, on the other hand, cannot engage in such nuclear modernization while adhering to the CTBT. 
   Likewise, the Senate is faced with the same verification problem that it encountered in 1962. As both of President Clinton's former intelligence chiefs have warned, low-yield testing is undetectable by seismic sensors. Nor does the United States have any reasonable chance of mobilizing the ludicrously high number of votes needed under the treaty to conduct an on-site inspection. In other words, the treaty is unverifiable and there is no chance that cheaters will ever be caught. 
   This is not my opinion. This is a reality, given that 30 of 51 countries on the treaty's governing board must approve any on-site inspection. Even the President's own senior arms controller--John Holum--complained in 1996 that ``treaty does not contain ..... our position that on-site inspections should proceed automatically unless two-thirds of the Executive Council vote ``no.'' Instead of an automatic green light for inspections, the U.S. got exactly the opposite of what it requested. 
   But most importantly, in 1962 President Kennedy correctly noted that the inability to test has a pernicious and corrosive effect--not just upon the weapons themselves (which cannot be fully remanufactured under such circumstances)--but upon the nation's nuclear infrastructure. Our confidence in the nuclear stockpile is eroding even as we speak. Again, this is not my opinion. It is a fact which has been made over and over again by the nation's senior weapons experts. 
   In 1995, the laboratory directors compiled the following two charts which depict two simple facts: (1) that even with a successful science-based program, confidence will not be as high as it could be with nuclear testing; and (2) even if the stockpile stewardship program is completely successful by 2010, the United States will not be able to design new weapons, and will not be able to make certain types of nuclear safety assessments and stockpile replacements. 
   Senators will notice that, on both charts, there is mention of ``HN'' (e.g. hydronuclear) and 500 ton tests. The laboratory directors, in a joint statement to the administration in 1995, said: ``A strong Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program is necessary to underwrite confidence. A program of 500-ton experiments would significantly reduce the technical risks.'' 
   This judgment has not changed over the past several years. Both weapons laboratory directors stated in 1997 that nuclear testing would give the United States greater confidence in the stockpile. 
   So as I listen to these claims that the United States is ``out of the testing business,'' I make two basic observations. First, we are only out of the testing business because President Clinton has taken us out. There is no legal barrier today to conducting stockpile experiments. The reason is purely political. Indeed, the White House is using circular logic. The United States is not testing because the White House supports the test ban treaty; but the White House is claiming that because we are not testing, we should support the treaty. 
   Second, I remind all that the United States thought it was out of the testing business in 1958, only to discover how badly we had miscalculated. President Kennedy not only ended the 3-year moratorium, but embarked upon the most aggressive test series in the history of the weapons program. If Senators use history as their guide, they will realize that the CTBT is a serious threat to the national security of the United States.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the incredible and contrived rhetoric pouring forth constantly from the White House for the past few weeks has at times bordered on absurd and futile efforts to  sell to the American people the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. For example, only this administration could attempt to put a positive spin on a Washington Post article reporting that the CTBT is unverifiable. It didn't work and once again it was demonstrable that you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. 
   No administration, prior to the present one, has ever tried to argue with a straight face that a zero yield test ban would or could be verifiable. A treaty which purports to ban all nuclear testing is, by definition, unverifiable. In fact, previous administrations admitted that much less ambitious proposals, such as low-yield test ban, were also not verifiable. 
   This is not a ``spin'' contest. This is a fact. 
   There is one hapless fellow, at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, who is bound to know this, and he should not be lending his name to such shenanigans. 
   I am not referring to the President. This is his treaty--the only major arms control agreement negotiated on his watch--and its ratification is entirely about his legacy. No, I am talking about Vice President GORE, who took the correct, flat-out-position--when he was a United States Senator--he was opposed to even a 1-kiloton test ban. According to then Senator GORE, the only type of test ban that was verifiable was, in his estimation, one with no less than a 5-kiloton limit. He was quite clear, Mr. President, in saying that anything less--such as the CTBT treaty now before the Senate--would be unverifiable. 
   On May 12, 1988, Senator GORE objected to an amendment offered to the 1989 defense bill which called for a test ban treaty and which restricted nuclear tests above 1 kiloton. Then-Senator GORE declared:  
   Mr. President, I want to express a lingering concern about the threshold contained in the amendment. Without regard to the military usefulness or lack of usefulness of a 1 kiloton versus the 5 kiloton test, purely with regard to verification, I am concerned that a 1 kiloton test really pushes verification to the limit, even with extensive cooperative measures. ..... I express the desire that this threshold be changed from 1 to 5.  
   In other words, the Vice President knows full well that a 1-kiloton limit--to say nothing of 0-kiloton ban--was unverifiable. In fact, at his insistence, the proposed amendment was modified upwards to allow for all nuclear tests below 5 kilotons. 
   Why then, is the administration, of which he is now a part, claiming that a zero-yield ban is ``effectively verifiable''? 
   Numerous experts have cautioned the Senate that a ``zero-yield'' CTBT is fundamentally unverifiable. Other nations will be able to conduct militarily significant nuclear tests well below the detection threshold of the Treaty's monitoring system, and even below the United States' own unilateral capability. 
   President Clinton's own former Director of Central Intelligence, Jim Woolsey, testified before the Foreign Relations Committee, on May 13, 1998, that ``With the yield of zero, I have very serious doubts that we would be able to verify.'' 
   On August 5, 1999, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger noted: ``When I was involved in test-ban negotiations, it was understood that testing below a certain threshold was required to ensure confidence in U.S. nuclear weapons. It also was accepted that very low-yield tests would be difficult to detect, and an agreement to ban them would raise serious questions about verifiability.'' 
   Most significantly, Fred Eimer, former Assistant Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and chief verification expert for both the Reagan and Bush administrations, wrote to me this past Sunday stating his opposition to the CTBT. 
   Dr. Eimer noted that: ``Other nations will be able to conduct militarily significant nuclear tests well below the verification threshold of the Treaty's monitoring system, and well below that of our own National Technical Means.'' 
   Now, of course, the Administration has claimed on a variety of occasions that the CTBT is ``effectively verifiable.'' It seems, however, that this administration is saying one thing to the Senate and the American people, and admitting quite another thing overseas. I will read into the RECORD the criticism that was leveled against the CTBT on August 1, 1996, by Mr. John Holum--President Clinton's ACDA Director--when he was in Geneva. Mr. Holum stated:  
   The United States' views on verification are well known: We would have preferred stronger measures, especially in the decision-making process for on-site inspections, and in numerous specific provisions affecting the practical implementation of the inspection regime. I feel no need to defend this view. The mission on the Conference on Disarmament is not to erect political symbols, but to negotiate enforceable agreements. That require effective verification, not as the preference of any party, but as the sine quo non of this body's work. ..... On verification overall, the Treaty tilts toward the `defense' in a way that has forced the United States to conclude, reluctantly, that it can accept, barely, the balance that Ambassador Ramaker has crafted.  
   ``Reluctantly''? 
   ``Accept, barely''? 
   Does this sound like a ringing endorsement of the CTBT's verification regime? I would say this is tantamount to ``damnation by faint praise''. 
   The fact of the matter is that the CTBT's much-vaunted international monitoring system (IMS) was only designed to detect ``fully coupled'' nuclear tests down to one kiloton, and cannot detect evasive nuclear testing. Any country so-inclined could easily muffle its nuclear tests by conducting them in natural cavities (such as salt domes or caverns) or in man-made excavations. This technique can reduce the seismic magnitude of a test by a factor of 70. In other words, countries can conduct tests of up to 60 kilotons without being detected by the IMS. 
   Every country of concerns to the United States is technically capable of decoupling its nuclear explosions. In other words, countries such as North Korea, China, and Russia will be able to conduct very significant work on their weapons programs without fear of detection by the IMS. I point out to Senators that, according to Department of Energy data, 56 percent of all U.S. nuclear tests were less than 20 kilotons in yield. Such tests, if decoupled, would all have been undetectable by the IMS. In other words, one out of every two nuclear tests ever conducted by the United States would not have been detected by the IMS--had the U.S. chosen to mask its program. I fail to see how the administration does not think this monitoring deficiency is not militarily significant. 
   Moreover, claims that the IMS will provide new seismic monitoring capabilities to the United States are ludicrous. The vast majority of seismic stations listed in the CTBT already exist, and were funded by the U.S. taxpayer; 68 percent of the ``Primary Seismological Stations,'' and 47 percent of the ``Auxiliary'' stations called for under the treaty already are in place because the United States put them there years ago. I repeat, the only reason the IMS has any value to the United States is because it was already U.S. property long before the CTBT was negotiated. 
   So where are the additional 32 percent of the stations going to be located? In places such as the Cook Islands, the Central African Republic, Fiji, the Solomon Islands, Cameroon, Niger, Bolivia, 
   Botswana, Costa Rica, Samoa, and so on and so forth. There is no benefit to having seismic stations in these places. In other words, Mr. President, the CTBT will provide zero benefit to our nuclear test monitoring. 
   In fact, it is going to make life more difficult for the United States. The same ``overselling'' of the IMS that is going on here in the United States is also occurring internationally. Ultimately, this is going to cause great problems for the United States in arguing that a country has violated the treaty when the much-vaunted IMS has not detected anything. Few nations are likely to side with the United States in situations where the IMS has not detected a test. 
   Moreover, the IMS also will complicate U.S. efforts by providing false or misleading data, which in turn will be used by countries to conceal treaty violations. Specifically, the CTBT fails to require nations to ``calibrate'' their regional stations to assess the local geology. 
   Naturally, countries such as Russia and China have refused to volunteer to do so. By consequence, these stations will record data that will be inconsistent with U.S. national information  and will be used to argue against U.S. on-site inspection initiatives. 
   While it is important to realize the deficiencies of the CTBT's seismic monitoring regime, it also is a fact that several treaty provisions will severely impair the ability of any on-site inspection, if launched, to uncover credible evidence of a violation. First, the aforementioned failure to calibrate regional stations will introduce inaccuracies in the location of suspicious events, creating a broader inspectable area than otherwise would be the case. Second, if the United States requests an inspection, no U.S. inspectors would be allowed to participate, and the country in question can refuse to admit other specific inspectors. Third, the treaty allows for numerous delays in providing access to suspect sites, which will cause dissipation of most of the best technical signatures of a nuclear test. 
   Indeed, in the case of low-yield testing, there are few enough observable signatures to begin with, and on-site inspections are unlikely to be of use at all. Finally, the inspected party is allowed to restrict access under the treaty and to declare up to 50 square kilometers as being ``off-limits.'' As UNSCOM found with Iraq, any time a country is given the right to designate sites as off-limits to inspectors, the inspection regime is undermined. 
   In conclusion, the IMS and the inspection regime is likely to be so weak that I would not be surprised if countries such as Iraq and North Korea did not ultimately sign and ratify. Because of the technical impossibility of verifying a zero-yield test ban, such rogue regimes can credibly claim to adhere to a fraudulent, unverifiable norm against testing without fear of ever getting caught. 
   The only puzzling question for me, Mr. President, is why, with a Vice President who knows the truth quite well, does the Clinton administration continue to insist otherwise?

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, yesterday President Clinton sent a written request to the Senate asking that we ``postpone'' a vote on the CTBT. In light of the President's outburst on Friday lashing out at Senate Republicans, and his adamant declaration that he would never submit a written request asking the Senate to withdraw the CTBT from consideration, his decision to send just such a letter is interesting. 
   His letter, was a baby-step in the right direction, insufficient to avert a vote on the CTBT today. The President is clearly playing poker with the Senate, but he doesn't have a winning hand, and I think he knows it. 
   The President sent this letter only because he realizes he has failed to make a compelling case for the treaty, and failed to convince two-thirds of the Senate that this treaty is in the national interest. He knows that if we vote on the CTBT today, the treaty will be defeated. 
   His letter did not meet both the criteria set by me and others. For example, he requested: (a) that the treaty be withdrawn and (b) that it not be considered for the remainder of his presidency. 
   The President has repeatedly dismissed the critics of this treaty as playing politics. Look who's talking. In his mind, it seems, the only reason anyone could possibly oppose this treaty is to give him a political black eye. Putting aside the megalomania in such a suggestion, accusing Republicans of playing politics with our national security was probably not the most effective strategy for convincing those with substantive concerns about the treaty. 
   The fact is, we are not opposed to this treaty because we want to score political points against a lame-duck Administration. We are opposed because it is unverifiable and because it will endanger the safety and reliability of our nuclear arsenal. The White House and Senate Democrats have failed to make a compelling case to the contrary. That is why the treaty is headed for defeat. 
   Of course, treaty supporters want to preserve a way to spin this defeat into a victory, by claiming that they have managed to ``live to fight another day.'' That's probably the same thing they said after President Carter requested the SALT II Treaty be withdrawn. But they will be fooling no one but themselves. 
   Before this debate is over, it must be made clear that to one and all this CTBT is dead--and that the next President will not be bound by its terms. The next administration must be left free to establish its own nuclear testing and nuclear non-proliferation policies, unencumbered by the failed policies of the current, outgoing administration. 
   Without such concrete assurances that this CTBT is dead, I will insist that the Senate proceed as planned and vote down this treaty.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I assure my friend from Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, I enjoy hearing him and hearing him and hearing him. 
   I guess it is sort of similar to what the President said in one of his strong moments not long ago: I guess it depends on what the definition of ``is'' is. 
   This afternoon in Canada, President Clinton held a press conference in which he explicitly rejected the offer I made along with a number of other Republican Senators that the Senate would put off a vote on the CTBT if the President requested in writing (a) that the treaty be withdrawn and (b) that it not be considered for the duration of his presidency. 
   Considering that the President acknowledged he does not have the votes to ratify the treaty, this seemed to many of us a generous offer which the President rejected with a strange rhetorical outburst. 
   When asked about our offer today, he said:   
   They want me to give them a letter to cover the political decision they have made that does severe damage to the interest of the United States and the interest of nonproliferation in the world? I don't think so.  
   The Mr. President further suggested, strangely and absurdly, that the reason we made the offer in the first place was because, as he put it, Republicans are afraid to go though with a vote. He said:  
   ......they want to [kill the treaty] and don't want to get up and defend it before the American people in an election year....... [They think] that some letter from me will somehow obscure [that fact].......  
   Mr. President, among those who are urging that the Senate kill this dangerous treaty are: six former Secretaries of Defense, four former National Security Advisors, four former Directors of Central Intelligence, and two former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
   Yet, Mr. Clinton suggests that Republicans are afraid to vote? The fact is, the President and his advisors have done everything possible to discourage a solution. 
   Let's make it clear so the President can get his confusing rhetoric straightened out: Since he has rejected our offer, I will object, along with many of my Republican colleagues, to any effort to put off next week's vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   This is a dangerous treaty, contrary to the national security interests of the American people. The Senate should go on record as planned: The Senate should vote this treaty down. 
   Mr. President, may I make an inquiry how much time has expired on each side since this morning when the Senate convened?

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, pursuant to the unanimous-consent agreement by the Senate, consideration has begun regarding an arms control treaty that has been the longest-sought, hardest-fought item on the unilateral nuclear disarmament agenda. Strangely, the Clinton administration has used every fanciful reasoning in its attempt to portray the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) as an agreement long pursued by every administration since President Eisenhower, a claim that is bewilderingly untrue. Even the administration's own negotiator acknowledged that the administration's claims are ``hyperbole.'' 
   You see, Mr. President, the truth of the matter is that not one administration (prior to the current one) ever proposed a zero-yield, unverifiable, permanent duration test ban. Indeed, as Ambassador Ledogar admitted, even the Clinton administration itself did not want such a treaty initially. 
   Someone has commented that the CTBT now before the Senate is the clearest case of ``parchment worship'' ever seen. It was neither carefully negotiated nor well-thought through. It does not even define exactly what it bans. 
   Instead, the CTBT is the product of a mad scramble to: (1) Create an arms control ``legacy'' for the Clinton-Gore administration; or (2) provide an excuse for this administration's lack of any nonproliferation policy; or (3) obscure the fact that this administration presided over the collapse of the single-most significant reduction in nuclear weapons with Russia ever negotiated--the START II Treaty--which would have eliminated all MIRVed ICBMs and the SS-18 missile. (The likelihood is that all three played a major role in the administration's decision to try to ram through this Senate this unwise and dangerous treaty.) 
   Unfortunately, in the race to fashion a last-minute rickety ``legacy'', the Clinton administration abandoned longstanding United States policy on nuclear testing and signed up to a ``zero yield,'' unverifiable, permanent duration test ban. As several of us have noted, for a number of reasons relating to verification and U.S. nuclear weapons requirements, this is something to which no other administration ever agreed. For instance, President Eisenhower--who has been repeatedly and mistakenly blamed with authorship of the CTBT--insisted that nuclear tests with a seismic magnitude of less than 4.75 be permitted. 
   The reason that the United States historically has refused to sign on to a zero yield test ban is that five problems are created by such a prohibition. First, confidence in the safety and the reliability of the weapons stockpile will erode. Second, warheads cannot be ``remanufactured'' to capitalize upon modern technologies. Third, no further designs or capabilities can be added to the nuclear stockpile. Fourth, critical infrastructure and hardware cannot be thoroughly ``hardened'' against nuclear weapons effects. Fifth, the U.S. can have no confidence that other countries are abiding by the CTBT because a zero yield ban cannot be verified. 
   By preventing the United States from testing, the CTBT will erode our ability to discover and fix problems with the nuclear stockpile and to make safety improvements. Confidence that the weapons will perform as needed will erode. Already, leaders of our own nuclear weapons design laboratories have stated that problems with the stockpile have arisen that formerly would have prompted nuclear tests. 
   Further, several of the weapons are not as safe as they could be. As this chart demonstrates, only one warhead of the nine in the stockpile is equipped with all of the modern surety features available. One weapon--the W62--does not have any safety features at all, and three of the weapons--the W76, W78, and W88--are only equipped with ``enhanced detonator safety'' measures. 
   Mr. President, several important safety improvements cannot be made to these weapons unless subsequent nuclear testing is allowed to ensure that modified devices will function properly with these changes. I will underscore that for Senators. The CTBT will prevent the United States from making critical safety improvements to its warheads. I, for one, agree with the Governor of North Dakota who wrote to me opposing the CTBT stating:  
   As a governor of a state that hosts a sizable percentage of our nation's nuclear weapons, I have an obligation to the people of North Dakota to ensure that these warheads are as safe and reliable as they can be made. It troubles me that several U.S. warheads do not contain the most modern safety features available, such as fire-resistant pits and insensitive high explosives. Yet these warheads cannot capitalize upon such improvements without nuclear testing.  
   I hope Senators will understand that the CTBT will gradually undermine the safety of the U.S. deterrent by precluding the incorporation of modern safety features. 
   Moreover, nuclear testing is essential if the United States is to discover and fix problems with the stockpile. These problems usually are associated with aging. The materials and components of weapons can degrade in unpredictable ways and can cause the weapon to fail. Many weapons believed to be reliable and thoroughly tested nevertheless developed problems which were only discovered, and could only be fixed, through nuclear testing. In fact, one-third of all the weapon designs placed in the stockpile since 1958 have required and received post-deployment nuclear tests to resolve problems. 
   In three quarters of these cases, the problems were identified and assessed only as a result of nuclear testing, and only could be fixed through testing. 
   The United States has chosen to remanufacture aging weapons in the enduring stockpile rather than designing and building new ones. This presents problems because many of the materials and processes used in producing the original weapon are no longer available. New materials and processes need to be substituted, but they can only be validated to assure that the remanufactured weapon works as intended through nuclear testing. 
   Exact replication, especially of older systems, is impossible without testing. In part, this is because documentation has never been sufficiently exact to ensure replication. Nuclear testing is the most important step in product certification; it provides the data for valid certification. As a case in point, the United States attempted to remanufacture both the W52 and W68 warheads on the basis of simulations. However, when actually tested, both weapons had a measured yield well short of what test-experienced weapons designers predicted. This is a lesson that the administration, in supporting the CTBT, seems willing to forget. 
   The CTBT also will prevent the United States from developing new weapons to counter new technological advances by adversaries. Nuclear testing is essential to such modernization.  Without it, the nuclear triad will become obsolete. 
   I fail to see the logic behind the argument that the United States has no need to modernize its deterrent if Russia, China, and others are similarly constrained. Such a claim just won't fly; in fact, given the demonstrable inability to verify a total test ban, I am persuaded that such assertions are founded upon the mistaken presumption that nuclear weapons modernization is driven by the evolution of other nuclear deterrents. Historically, this simply has not been the case. 
   Indeed, nuclear weapons modernization is generally driven either by new mission requirements, or by non-nuclear technological evolution in defensive systems. For instance, during the cold war, advances in air defense and anti-submarine warfare created needs for new weapons. Nuclear testing was needed to create the B83 bomb, a gravity bomb--a ``laydown weapon'' because it enabled the B-1B to drop its payload, at low altitude and high speed, and thereby escape the resulting explosion. 
   This weapon was needed in response to advances in air defense capability. For the same reason, the U.S. developed the nuclear air-launched cruise missile, which allows U.S. bombers to fulfill their mission outside of air defense ranges. 
   Nuclear testing was needed for the Trident II missile's warheads, W76 and W88. Testing was essential to optimize the system, giving the missile, and thus the submarine as well, increased striking range. This was needed in response to advances in anti-submarine warfare. Without the ability to test and modernize, the airmen and sailors aboard our bombers and submarines will be put at increased risk as they try to perform their duties with obsolete technology. Senators should think carefully about the implications of the CTBT, and the risk it poses--not just to the nuclear weapons themselves--but to our servicemen. 
   Our clear, future need facing the United States is the requirement to develop new or modified warheads to respond to developments in missile defense--particularly in the area of directed energy. It would be impossible to adapt to such developments under a complete test ban. 
   Further, without the ability to design new weapons, such as a warhead optimized to kill biological plagues or to destroy deeply-buried targets, the U.S. will be unable to respond to serious emerging threats 
   to our security. I could not agree more with one of the former Directors of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Dr. Roger Batzel, who warned that; ``A nuclear arsenal which is unable to keep pace with a changing security environment is unlikely, in the long run, to prove much of a deterrent.'' 
   Fourth, the CTBT would make the United States increasingly vulnerable to foreign nuclear programs. Critical systems such as satellites cannot be hardened and thoroughly protected against electro-magnetic pulse attack without nuclear testing. Computers cannot simulate a nuclear environment. Neither can controlled radiation sources. It takes a nuclear explosion to create the heat and complex interplay of radiation needed to evaluate the resistance of systems to these nuclear effects. 
   Historically, the United States often has been surprised by how systems which seemingly performed as needed during non-nuclear simulations then failed to function properly in an actual nuclear environment. Indeed, surprises have been found in the vulnerability to nuclear effects of all U.S. strategic nuclear systems except the Minuteman II. The CTBT will allow counties to exploit a growing U.S. vulnerability brought about by an increasing reliance on high-tech weaponry and a decision not to test in order to harden systems. 
   Finally, a ``zero yield'' test ban is not verifiable. While the exact thresholds are classified, it is commonly understood that the United States cannot detect nuclear explosions below a few kilotons of yield. Countries are able to resort to a number of techniques, ranging from ``unattended detonations'' to seismic decoupling, that will enable them to conduct significant nuclear explosions with little chance of being detected. 
   The proposed verification regime under the CTBT offers scant reassurance in this matter. The seismic detection thresholds of the International Monitoring System are sufficiently high that a large amount of clandestine testing could occur without fear of seismic detection. Moreover, the on-site inspection regime is riddled with loopholes and deficiencies. 
   The bottom line is that if the Senate were to make the mistake of approving this treaty, the United States would scrupulously adhere to the CTBT, thereby losing confidence in its nuclear deterrent. Other nations, however, most likely would violate the treaty and escape detection, building new weapons to capitalize upon the U.S. deficiencies and vulnerabilities created by the CTBT. For these reasons, I oppose the CTBT and I am gratified that more and more Senators are making clear their opposition to ratification of an unwise, even dangerous, proposal to deprive the American people of the protection they need and deserve. 
   Mr. President, for just a moment I suggest the absence of a quorum and then I will resume.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the inspiring prayer which Senators just heard was delivered by the remarkable Dr. John C. Compton, whose church is the home church for Dot Helms and me when the Senate is in session. 
   The congregation at First Baptist Alexandria includes many good folks from North Carolina, with relatives in our State. Dr. Compton has been senior pastor at First Baptist Alexandria since June 1997, and what an enormous impact he has had. His powerful sermons are always meaningful and helpful. Young adults are flocking to the various services and other events at his church. Dr. Compton's messages to all who hear him are straight from the Bible. He dares to address with candor the moral and spiritual breakdown so evident in America today. That is because his message, without exception, emphasizes the hope available to all who will follow and embrace the precepts and faith of our Founding Fathers. 
   John and Teresa Compton have two daughters, Sarah and Rachel. Dr. Compton's father, deceased, and his mother served as missionaries in Brazil for a quarter of a century beginning in 1950. 
   Numerous staff members from Capitol Hill attend First Baptist Alexandria, including several from my own office. A warm welcome is extended to the Senate's guest Chaplain for today, Dr. John C. Compton. And for my part, Mr. President, I am genuinely grateful for what this remarkable minister has meant to Dot Helms and me and countless others. 
   I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as the Senate proceeds toward its still-scheduled debate on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, I am confident that the record will show most former senior U.S. government officials remain strongly opposed to Senate ratification of the CTBT. 
   The Senate--and the American people--will hear from many distinguished officials in the coming days, as they speak out against the CTBT. Of course, the Clinton Administration will try to counter that other well-known people support the CTBT, but those who support ratification of this proposed total nuclear test ban are a distinct minority. 
   In looking over the record, however, I found that many of the very people the Clinton Administration claims now support such a permanent and total nuclear test ban treaty in fact explicitly rejected it when they served in the U.S. Senate and in uniform. 
   They argued at that time (a) that such a test ban was unverifiable, and (b) that the U.S. needs to preserve the ability to conduct nuclear tests if the American people are to be assured of the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons. 
   Make no mistake: These are all great Americans, whom I admire and respect, who served their country with distinction. In calling attention to their statements of the past for the record today, I certainly imply no disrespect. 
   To the contrary, I hope the record will reflect their judgements at that time because I believe that those judgements on a zero-yield test ban were right back then--and those judgements are still right today. 
   For example, as a U.S. Senator, our distinguished former colleague, Bill Cohen of Maine, was a leading light on defense issues in the U.S. Senate. Indeed, he vigorously objected to the termination of nuclear testing when he served here as a U.S. Senator. He objected, he said, because the termination of nuclear testing would undermine efforts to make U.S. weapons safer. 
   Throughout the months of August and September 1992, Senator Cohen vigorously fought efforts by Senators Mitchell, Exon, and Hatfield to kill the United States nuclear test program. 
   Here is a sample of Senator Cohen's 1992 views as expressed on the Senate floor on September 18 of that year seven years ago:  
   We have made, in fact, remarkable progress in negotiating substantial reductions in nuclear arsenals. While we have made substantial reductions, we are not yet on the verge of eliminating nuclear weapons from our inventories. We are going to have to live with nuclear weapons for some time to come, so we have to ask ourselves the question: Exactly what kinds of nuclear weapons do we want to have during that time?  
   Senator Bill Cohen declared further seven years ago:  
   ..... [W]hat remains relevant is the fact that many of these nuclear weapons which we intend to keep in our stockpile for the indefinite future are dangerously unsafe. Equally relevant is the fact that we can make these weapons much safer if limited testing is allowed to be conducted. So, when crafting our policy regarding nuclear testing, this should be our principal objective: To make the weapons we retain safe. 
   ..... The amendment that was adopted last week ..... does not meet this test ..... [because] it would not permit the Department of Energy to conduct the necessary testing to make our weapons safe.  
   Similarly, Vice President AL GORE likewise adamantly opposed a ``zero-yield'' test ban--i.e., one that would ban all nuclear tests--as a United States Senator, on the grounds that such a ban was unverifiable. 
   Indeed, on May 12, 1988, Senator GORE objected to an amendment (offered to the 1989 defense bill) because it called for a test ban treaty and restricted all nuclear tests above 1 kiloton. 
   A 1 kiloton limit ban, Senator GORE said at that time, was unverifiable. At Senator GORE's insistence, the proposed amendment was modified to raise the limit for nuclear testing from a 1 kiloton limit to a 5 kiloton limit. 
   For the RECORD, here's what Senator GORE's position as taken on the Senate floor in 1988:  
   Mr. President, I want to express a lingering concern about the threshold contained in the amendment. 
   Without regard to the military usefulness of lack of usefulness of a 1 kiloton versus the 5 kiloton test, purely with regard to verification, I am concerned that a 1 kiloton test really pushes verification to the limit, even with extensive cooperative measures........I express the desire that this threshold be changed from 1 to 5.  
   If Senator GORE argued on the Senate floor that a 1 kiloton test ban was unverifiable, surely the zero-yield--ban--i.e. a ban on all nuclear tests would be equally unverifiable. 
   President Clinton has argued that several former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff strongly back his call for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty banning any and all nuclear tests. 
   It's interesting that their statements, when they were still in uniform, however, raise doubts about Administration's claims that they vigorously support the CTBT. Consider, for example, what General Colin Powell, then the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said on December 1, 1992:  
   With respect to a comprehensive test ban, that has always been a fundamental policy goal of ours, but as long as we have nuclear weapons, we have a responsibility for making sure that our stockpile remains safe. And to keep that stockpile safe, we have to conduct a limited number of nuclear tests to make sure that we know what a nuclear weapon will actually do and how it is aging and to find out a lot of other physical characteristics with respect to nuclear phenomenon. ..... As long as we have nuclear weapons, I think as good stewards of them, we have to conduct testing.  
   General Powell previously had made much the same declaration during a Senate hearing on September 20, 1991:  
   We need nuclear testing to ensure the safety, surety of our nuclear stockpile. As long as one has nuclear weapons, you have to know what it is they will do, and so I would recommend nuclear testing.  
   What General Powell said was as true back then as it is today. 
   Similarly, Admiral William Crowe also opposed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty while he was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on May 5, 1986, he stated:  
   [A comprehensive test ban] would introduce elements of uncertainty that would be dangerous for all concerned.  
   He further declared:  
   I frankly do not understand why Congress would want to suspend testing on one of the most critical and sophisticated elements of our nuclear deterrent--namely the warhead.  
   General David Jones likewise stated, during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee:   
   I would have difficulty recommending a zero test ban for an extended period.  
   Among the General's reasons for opposition were, according to a May 29, 1978 press account, that the CTBT  
   is not verifiable, and that U.S. stockpile reliability could not be assured.  
   Numerous press accounts from 1994 and 1995 indicated that General John Shalikashvili maintained strong reservations regarding a zero yield test ban, and made clear that he favored maintenance of the ability to conduct low-yield testing under any negotiated treaty. 
   Indeed, these comments by these former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs--while in uniform--strongly echo the current views of other former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs, such as Admiral Tom Moorer and General John Vessey, Jr., both of whom today strongly oppose the CTBT. 
   Again, I must emphasize that all of these men are distinguished Americans whom I greatly respect and admire. 
   Indeed, my point today is simply to show that the arguments of Senators Cohen and GORE, and Chairmen Powell, Crowe, Jones and Shalikashvili were right then--and they are still right today: 
   Nuclear testing is vital to maintaining the safety of our nuclear weapons and the reliability of our nuclear deterrent. 
   A ``zero-yield''--i.e., a total and complete--nuclear test ban is unverifiable.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it was on September 16 that Hurricane Floyd crashed into the North Carolina coast dumping 20 inches of rain that resulted in devastating floods. The region of Eastern North Carolina most affected was visited by another 4-6 inches of rain just a week later, making an already catastrophic situation even worse. 
   So I noted with great interest when President Clinton paid a visit to a group of elite international financiers at the annual World Bank and IMF meeting 13 days later (September 29) to make an important announcement. It was there that he disclosed with great fanfare his proposal to forgive 100 percent of the debt owed by some 40 foreign countries to the United States--and much of their debt owed indirectly to the U.S. through the World Bank and the IMF. 
   Thirteen days after Hurricane Floyd arrived, and when many communities in my state were still literally under water, President Clinton decided it was appropriate to make the following plea on behalf of debt relief to foreign governments--he said: ``......I call on our Congress to respond to the moral and economic urgency of this issue, and see to it that America does its part. I have asked for the money and shown how it would be paid for, and I ask the Congress to keep our country shouldering its fair share of the responsibility.'' 
   No wonder my constituents are puzzled as to why, in the words of John Austin of Tryon, North Carolina, ``we can help everyone else--but not our own people.'' North Carolinians understand instinctively that there is something odd about our national priorities when we have spent more--$27.9 billion--on foreign aid in the past two years than the $27.7 billion FEMA has expended in the past ten years. That's right: government aid through FEMA for such wide-ranging disasters as the Northridge earthquakes in California, Hurricane Andrew in South Florida and the catastrophic Midwestern floods doesn't even measure up to the past two years of foreign aid. 
   Now, I have been in constant communication with the Majority Leader, the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, members on the other side of the aisle, and countless federal agencies seeking relief for thousands of North Carolinians who have been ruined by Hurricane Floyd. Helping these victims is the number one priority for those with whom I have spoken. And for the record, I am gratified by their cooperation and their determination to help. 
   With respect to the President's plan to forgive the debts of foreign governments, I remind Senators that every one of the governments whose debt the President proposes to forgive has no one to blame but themselves for pursuing socialist and statist policies, and often outright theft, that drove them in a hole in the first place. 
   Just how much is being taken away from victims in my state to fund the President's proposal? The Administration calculates that it will cost $320 million to forgive the $5.7 billion in mostly uncollectible debts owed to the U.S. Additionally, Uncle Sam is being asked to underwrite debt forgiveness to the World Bank and the IMF to the tune of $650 million. 
   That's a total of $970 million which North Carolina and other 
   devastated regions desperately need, but will not get because money used to forgive the debts of foreigners is money that cannot and will not be used to assist hurricane victims. 
   Bear in mind, Mr. President, that the United States has already provided approximately $32.3 billion in foreign aid to just these countries since the end of World War II. And the U.S. Government has already provided $3.47 billion in debt forgiveness to these countries in the past several years alone. 
   If Senators study the list of countries, it turns out that the President seeks to reward governments who keep their people in economic and political bondage, and he proposes to do it at the expense of suffering Americans. The human rights organization Freedom House determined that only eight of the 36 proposed beneficiaries are ``free'' in terms of political expression. At least one on the World Bank's list of countries eligible to receive debt forgiveness is a terrorist state, and that's  Sudan. Also included are the communist dictatorships in Angola, Vietnam and the military dictatorship Burma. 
   The Heritage Foundation determined that none of the countries in question are ``free'' economically. (The economies of the vast majority of the countries judged are either ``repressed'' or ``mostly unfree'' according to the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom.) Some countries on the World Bank's list do not even have functioning governments, such as Somalia, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. 
   Only one of 36 countries voted with the United States more than half of the time at the United Nations in 1998 (that is Honduras, which supported the U.S. only 55 percent of the time). Make no mistake about it: this proposal diverts assistance from Hurricane Floyd victims to corrupt, economically and politically repressed foreign countries--many of whom are not even friendly to the United States. 
   Mr. President, my office has received a steady stream of visitors and mail urging Congress to support the ``Jubilee 2000'' debt forgiveness plan, which now includes the President's proposal. It has been a well-orchestrated lobbying campaign. 
   But since the day Hurricane Floyd slammed into the North Carolina coast and dumped 20 inches of rain on the eastern third of my state, the phone calls and mail from North Carolina in support of debt forgiveness to foreign governments has dried up. The reason is clear: we have a natural disaster unlike any seen in 500 years here at home, and our duty is to help suffering Americans first. 
   Mr. President, I'm putting the Administration on notice here and now that the first priority shall be helping victims of Hurricane Floyd. Not until sufficient resources are dedicated to this effort by the federal government will I agree to Senate consideration of President Clinton's debt forgiveness to foreign governments proposal.

   Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I was fascinated when I saw in the Washington Post this Sunday the front-page headline reading: ``CIA Unable to Precisely Track Testing: Analysis of Russian Compliance with Nuclear Treaty Hampered.'' 
   The first paragraph of the story below that headline said it all:  
   In a new assessment of its capabilities, the Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that it cannot monitor low-level nuclear tests by Russia precisely enough to ensure compliance with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. ..... Twice last month the Russians carried out what might have been nuclear explosions at its.......testing site in the Arctic. But the CIA found that data from its seismic sensors and other monitoring equipment were insufficient to allow analysts to reach a firm conclusion about the nature of events, officials said........  
   This surely was devastating news for a lot of people at the White House. Our nation's Central Intelligence Agency had come to the conclusion that it cannot verify compliance with the CTBT. 
   Mercy. I can just see them scurrying around. 
   But more amazing than this was the response of the White House spin machine. I've seen a lot of strange things during my nearly 27 years in the Senate, but this is the first time I have ever seen an administration argue that America's inability to verify compliance with a treaty was precisely the reason for the Senate to ratify the treaty. Back home that doesn't even make good nonsense. 
   Yet this is what the White House has been arguing all day today. This revelation is good news for the CTBT's proponents, they say, because the CTBT will now institute an entirely new verification system with 300 monitoring stations around the world. 
   Madam President, I am not making this up. This is what the White House said. 
   I say to the President: What excuse will the White House give if and when they spend billions of dollars on a ``new verification system with 300 monitoring stations around the world''--and the CTBT still can't be verified? Talk about a pig in a poke. Or a hundred excuse-makers still on the spot! 
   If the Administration spokesman contends that the CTBT's proposed ``International Monitoring System,'' or IMS, will be able to do what all the assets of the entire existing U.S. intelligence community cannot--i.e., verify compliance with this treaty--isn't it really just a matter of their having been caught with their hands in the cookie jar? 
   Let's examine their claim. The CTBT's International Monitoring System was designed only to detect what are called ``fully-coupled'' nuclear tests. That is to say tests that are not shielded from the surrounding geology. 
   But the proposed multibillion-dollar IMS cannot detect hidden tests--known as ``de-coupled'' tests--in which a country tries to hide the nuclear explosion by conducting the test in an underground cavern or some other structure that muffles the explosion. 
   ``Decoupling'' can reduce the detectable magnitude of a test by a factor of 70. 
   In other words, countries can conduct a 60-kiloton nuclear test without being detected by this fanciful IMS apparatus, a last-minute cover up for the administration's having exaggerated a treaty that should never have been sent to the U.S. Senate for approval in the first place. 
   Every country of concern to the U.S.--every one of them--is capable of decoupling its nuclear explosions. North Korea, China, and Russia will all be able to conduct significant testing without detection by our country. 
   What about these 300 ``additional'' monitoring sites that the White House has brought for as a illusory argument in favor of the CTBT? They are fiction. The vast majority of those 300 sites already exist. They have been United States monitoring stations all along--and the CIA nonetheless confesses that it cannot verify. 
   The additional sites called for under the treaty are in places like the Cook Islands, the Central African Republic, Fiji, the Solomon Islands, the Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Niger, Paraguay, Bolivia, Botswana, Costa Rica, Samoa, etc. The majority of these will add zero, not one benefit to the U.S. ability to monitor countries of concern. The fact is if U.S. intelligence cannot verify compliance with this treaty, no International Monitoring System set up under the CTBT will. This treaty is unverifiable, and dangerous to U.S. national security. 
   If this is the best the administration can do, they haven't much of a case to make to the Senate--or anywhere else--in favor of the CTBT. The administration is grasping at straws, looking for any argument--however incredible--to support an insupportable treaty. 
   We will let them try to make their case. As I demonstrated on the floor last week, the Foreign Relations Committee has held 14 separate hearings in which the committee heard extensive testimony from both sides on the CTBT--113 pages of testimony, from a plethora of current and former officials. This is in addition to the extensive hearings that have already been held by the Armed Services Committee and three hearings exclusively on the CTBT held by the Government Affairs Committee. 
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold its final hearings this Thursday to complete our examination of this treaty. We will invite Secretary Albright to make her case for the treaty, and will hear testimony from a variety of former senior administration officials and arms control experts to present the case against the treaty. 
   I have also invited the chairman of the Senate Armed Service Committee, Senator WARNER, to present the findings of his distinguished panel's review of this fatally flawed treaty. 
   Finally, the facts are not on the administration's side. This is a ill-conceived treaty which our own Central Intelligence Agency acknowledges that it cannot verify. Approving the CTBT would leave the American people unsure of the safety and reliability of America's nuclear deterrent, while at the same time completely unprotected from ballistic missile attack. That is a dangerous proposal, and I am confident that the U.S. Senate will vote to reject this dangerous arms control pact called the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am getting a little weary of this business of saying this is true and that is true when it is not true. 
   We have held at least nine hearings on this matter. We have invited Senators to come. They didn't want to come. I have done the best I can to have hearings. But if the Senators won't come, and if the news media won't report what we have had, I believe I have discharged my responsibility. 
   Let's hear no more about ``no hearings.'' There have been hearings; the Senators from the other side just didn't participate.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I said a moment ago, and I repeat for emphasis, I am absolutely astonished our friends across the aisle refuse to agree to the majority leader's unanimous consent agreement to bring the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to the Senate floor for debate and vote on October 7. 
   I think this refusal is significant because of the incessant grandstanding that has been going on by the administration and some Senators and, of course, the liberal media that are not going to tell the facts about the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty--all clamoring that there is such an urgent need for immediate Senate action on the CTBT. It has been proclaimed constantly that the Senate absolutely must ratify the treaty so the United States can participate in the October 6 through 8 conference in Vienna. Yet when the majority leader offered a unanimous consent agreement to bring the treaty to a vote in time for that conference, the same people clamored for more action, running for the hills and demanding more time and making other demands. 
   If it were not so pitiful, this behavior would be amusing. I am not going to let Senators have it both ways. The same people who have been criticizing the Foreign Relations Committee for inaction on the CTBT are now refusing to a date certain, and a timely vote on the CTBT. 
   Of course, some are hiding behind the idea that more hearings are needed for a full Senate vote. Hogwash. For the record, the Committee on Foreign Relations has held in the past 2 years alone 14 hearings in which the CTBT was extensively discussed. Most folks don't show up for the hearings--the train was too late or whatever. This number of 14 does not include an even larger number of hearings held by the Armed Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee on CTBT relevant issues, nor does this include three hearings by the Governmental Affairs Committee on the CTBT and relevant issues.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, at least 17 respected witnesses have discussed their views on both sides of the CTBT question in the past 2 years. The administration itself has included this treaty in testimony on five occasions. More than 113 pages of committee transcript text are devoted to this subject. I have a stack of papers here that are CTBT testimony and debate within the committee. A record can be made of how this has been delayed and by whom. 
   Mr. President, I find it puzzling that some in the Senate are objecting to the unanimous-consent request of the majority leader. The Foreign Relations Committee has thoroughly examined this matter. We have heard from experts on this very treaty. Let me share this with the Senate, the people listening, and the news media--that have not covered hearings on this matter but whose editors have said it is a disgrace that a vote has not been allowed on the CTBT treaty. Here are the people who have discussed the CTBT before the Foreign Relations Committee. 
   Let me point out, we have hearings fairly early in the morning, maybe too early for some to come. But I look on both sides of the aisle, and I have seen, sometimes, nobody on one side. Anyway, here is a list of the people I recall having discussed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty with the Committee on Foreign Relations:  
   The Honorable Madeleine K. Albright, Secretary of State; 
   The Honorable Karl F. Inderfurth, Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs; 
   Mr. Robert Einhorn, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Nonproliferation; 
   The Honorable R. James Woolsey, Former Director, Central Intelligence Agency; 
   Dr. Fred Ikle, Former Director, Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; 
   The Honorable Stephen J. Solarz, Former U.S. Representative from New York; 
   The Honorable William J. Schneider, Former Under Secretary of State for Security Assistance, Science and Technology; 
   Dr. Richard Haass, Former Senior Director, Near East and South Asia, National Security Council; 
   The Honorable Stanely O. Roth, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs; 
   The Honorable James R. Schlesinger, Former Secretary of Defense; 
   The Honorable Eric D. Newsom, Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs; 
   The Honorable Ronald F. Lehman, Former Director, Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.  
   Parenthetically, I might say, not one word, as I recall, has been published by the same newspapers that have been piously declaring there must be action on the CTBT. 
   To continue the list:  
   General Eugene Habiger, Former Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Strategic Command;  
   The Honorable Frank G. Wisner, Vice Chairman, External Affairs, American International Group; 
   Dr. Stephen Cohen, Senior Fellow, Foreign Policy Studies, The Brookings Institution; 
   The Honorable Henry A. Kissinger, Former Secretary of State; and 
   The Honorable Richard Butler, Former Executive Chairman United Nations Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM). 
   I think this record will show--it should--that the Foreign Relations Committee has thoroughly examined this matter. We have pleaded for members of the committee, several of them, to come to a meeting once in a while. I have done everything I could to get this thing orderly presented to the Senate. All I have received are communications from Senators with a veiled threat if I did not proceed in some other way. We have certainly talked about this treaty in more depth than many other treaties, to my knowledge. 
   Those who are objecting, and objected to the majority leader's proposition this morning, don't want more hearings; what they want is more delay. You see, until a few minutes ago, until the majority leader offered his unanimous consent request, the same people who are now demanding more hearings were ready to dispense with further debate and go to a vote. Let me tell you what I mean. 
   The American people may recall, if they were watching C-SPAN, that President Clinton, in his State of the Union Address on January 27, 1998, declared: ``I ask the Senate to approve it" --the CTBT--and he said ``this year'' in mournful tones. 
   In other words, the President was ready for a vote in 1998. Then a year later, the President said:  
   I ask the Senate to take this vital step: Approve the Treaty now.  
   ``Approve it now,'' he said. He did not say approve the CTBT after more hearings. 
   On July 23, 1998, the Vice President, Mr. GORE, asked the Senate to ``act now'' on the CTBT, and all the while the New York Times and the Washington Post, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, have been saying that HELMS is holding up this treaty. 
   In February, Secretary Albright asked for approval of the CTBT ``this session.'' And in April she said:  
   ..... the time has come to ratify the CTBT this year, this session, now.  
   On January 12, 1999, the National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger, declared:  
   ..... it would be a terrible tragedy if our Senate failed to ratify the CTBT this year.  
   The point I am making is that the list goes on and on. 
   Mr. President, 45 Democratic Senators wrote to me asking me to allow a vote:  
   ..... with sufficient time to allow the United States to actively participate [sic] in the Treaty's inaugural Conference of Ratifying States.......  
   That conference begins next week. 
   At a recent press conference for the cameras, Senator SPECTER, my friend, declared:  
   The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was submitted to the Senate months ago, and it is high time the Senate acted on it.  
   Senator MURRAY called for:  
   ..... immediate consideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  
   Senator DORGAN said that:  
   ..... we must get this done at least by the first of October.  
   I must observe that the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator DASCHLE, also had very strong words on this matter. Just 6 days ago, he proclaimed:  
   Senate Republicans have permitted a small number of Members from within their ranks to manipulate Senate rules--  
   I wonder how we did that when I was not looking. No rules have been manipulated, and I resent the inference. But to continue his quote--  
   from within their ranks to manipulate Senate rules and procedures to prevent the Senate from acting on the CTBT....... I would hope we would soon see some leadership on the Republican side of the aisle to break the current impasse and allow the full Senate to act on the CTBT ..... That effort must begin today.  
   Mr. President, I hope when we get to the debate, however long it lasts, that we will not have the spectacle of Senator KENNEDY again and again offering his minimum wage amendment. He keeps it in his hip pocket all the time and pulls it out anytime he can stick it up, and he will debate it for an hour or 2. We have to have some understanding about what we are going to debate, when we do debate, and I hope we will debate on the terms the Senator from Mississippi, the majority leader, offered. 
   I think all this speaks well of the majority leader, and I congratulate him. 
   I congratulate him for having the will to do this because this has been insulting on many occasions as a political issue, which it is not. 
   I hope the Senate Democrats will reconsider their refusal to agree to a CTBT vote after having demanded it so often. 
   Let me go back in time a little bit. I have been waiting for the President of the United States to follow up on his written commitment to me that he will send up the ABM Treaty, and I have been hoping to see a treaty on two or three other things. 
   I am not in the mood to leave the American people naked against a very possible missile attack, and that has been my problem. The President of the United States has insisted on keeping the ABM Treaty alive when that would forbid anything happening in terms of defending the security of the American people. I was unwilling to do that until he followed through on his written guarantee to me that he would send the ABM Treaty to me and to the Senate. 
   I trust in the future that the media will, for once, acknowledge some of their statements regarding the CTBT for what they have really said because it is inaccurate and misleading to the American people. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it has been a moving and gratifying experience to witness the outpouring of genuine, spontaneous concern by countless Americans for the victims of the Hurricane Floyd flooding. 
   It goes without saying that I am deeply grateful for the countless public servants and concerned neighbors who have been and still are working around the clock to extend heroic efforts and helping hands to the thousands of Eastern North Carolina people who have lost everything they possess--except their courage, and their determination to rise above the hardship that befell them. 
   Mr. President, before I go further I am compelled to convey publicly my personal gratitude to FEMA Director James Lee Witt and his remarkable associates for their dedication to helping those in such dire need. No federal agency could possibly be more efficient in carrying out its mission, and Director Witt deserves enormous credit for the incredible responsiveness FEMA has demonstrated on so many occasions when disasters have befallen many other areas of America. 
   Also, I am deeply grateful to my colleagues, who have responded to this disaster not merely with kind condolences and genuine sympathy, but also with their actions. For example, the senior Senator from Missouri, Senator BOND, made every effort to assure that FEMA is adequately funded to do the job in North Carolina. The Senate Leadership on both sides of the aisle--particularly Senator LOTT--have been gracious in their offers of assistance. 
   Many in the administrative branch are also going out of the way to be helpful. Yesterday, Customs Service Administrator Raymond Kelly granted my request to administratively waive certain maritime regulations, thereby allowing grain and feed shipments to reach flood-ravaged farmers more quickly. I am genuinely appreciative of his swift action. 
   And Mr. President, let there be no mistake: Eastern North Carolina needs all the help it can get. I do not exaggerate when I say that the flooding is of near-Biblical proportions. At least 45 people have lost their lives; there are fears of finding even more bodies as the flood waters recede. Entire communities have been washed away. Standing flood waters are becoming more polluted each day by gasoline, chemicals, animal waste and drowned livestock. An estimated 1,000 roads have been flooded, and countless houses have been damaged, some beyond repair. Perhaps the most poignant stories are those of cemeteries washing away, with coffins rising to the surface. 
   It is a devastating regional problem, Mr. President, but more than that, it is truly a national problem affecting every state in the Union. Because the communities affected by this flooding--whether they be Wilson or Greenville, Rocky Mount or Goldsboro, Kinston or Tarboro--are communities that are essential to American agriculture. 
   The heart of the agriculture community in North Carolina has been virtually destroyed by this storm, Mr. President. And as concerned as we are for the countless citizens who have lost their homes and their possessions, the agricultural implications of this disaster for our entire country are enormous. 
   Here's why: North Carolina ranks third in total agricultural income, behind only California and Iowa. Numerous commodities will be radically affected by the flooding because North Carolina ranks in the top ten states of production for such a wide variety of products: turkeys, sweet potatoes, hogs, cucumbers for pickles, peanuts, poultry and egg products, chickens, blueberries, peanuts, strawberries, cotton, catfish, pecans, watermelons, peaches, tomatoes. 
   In short, Mr. President, North Carolina agricultural production is inseparable from U.S. agricultural production, and this regional disaster is in fact a national disaster. And I highlight this not to insist upon a government response--though one is needed--but to underscore the inescapable fact that the private sector must play a key role in helping Eastern North Carolina recover from this disaster. 
   The federal government can do its share to meet the needs of those who have been affected by the flood--and I will work to make sure the federal government plays a substantial role in assisting in the recovery. (In fact, those who are being helped by FEMA know that the federal government is already doing its part to lend a helping hand.) But government cannot do it all, Mr. President. The private sector must play an enormous role in rebuilding the communities and economy of my home state. And this will be an historic test of the strength and purpose of the free enterprise system--and of all of us who believe that the strength of America is the willingness to stand up for each other in times of hardship. 
   North Carolinians understand this fact instinctively, Mr. President. Already, private citizens and businesses from all over the state are volunteering their time and money to help their neighbors. May I offer a few examples: 
   Carolina Power & Light, a wonderfully civic-minded electrical company, has promised to match citizens' donations to the Red Cross up to $100,000 and is double-matching its employee's contributions. Capitol Broadcasting in Raleigh has donated $100,000. 
   From the financial industry, Bank of America has donated $150,000. First Union is contributing the same generous amount to the Red Cross and is also pitching in with in-kind contributions of ice and water. First Citizens Bank has donated $100,000 and has already developed a short-term emergency loan program. 
   The tobacco industry, which is so important to Eastern North Carolina--and which, incidentally, is now facing another spiteful attack by the Justice Department-- has been especially generous. RJ Reynolds has donated $250,000; Philip Morris has donated  $50,000 in addition to the food products they are donating through Kraft. US Tobacco has given an additional $25,000. 
   And, of course, I have been in contact almost daily with Franklin GRAHAM, son of the remarkable Billy GRAHAM, who operates a truly wonderful organization called Samaritan's Purse, which distributes food, clothing and medical supplies to people who are suffering all over the world. Franklin and his associates have once again demonstrated their usual selflessness by sending truckloads of potable water and other needed supplies to the areas in greatest need. 
   All of this generosity does not include the generous contributions of individual North Carolinians that are pouring in, Mr. President. Our fine Governor, Jim Hunt, has set up a Disaster Relief Fund for contributions to the United Way, and the contributions are coming in so fast that they have yet to be counted. I am continually amazed and highly gratified by the thoughtfulness of North Carolinians who genuinely want to help those in distress. 
   Mr. President, neither government nor the private sector alone can help rebuild the communities of North Carolina. If ever there was a time In North Carolina's history when all of our institutions--public and private--must work together, that time is now. And I pledge to do my part to make sure that individuals, businesses and government are working together to help North Carolina recover from the worst disaster in its history.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am grateful for the courtesy of the distinguished manager of the bill, Mr. BOND, for his willingness to work with me to make sure that FEMA is fully prepared to respond to the needs of victims of flooding caused by Hurricane Floyd. I do not exaggerate when I say that North Carolina is facing the worst flooding in its history. 
   There is no need for me to catalogue the details of the enormous suffering caused by this storm because I know that Senators understand and share my dismay in hearing the incredible damage reports still coming in from my home state. I am so very grateful for the kind words of my colleagues who have told me they are thinking of--and praying for--the people of Eastern North Carolina, and I know they join in pledging that the federal government will do its part to alleviate their suffering. 
   So, Mr. President, I genuinely appreciate Senator BOND's efforts to assure that FEMA is currently funded at a level to respond to the developing situation in Eastern North Carolina. I hope it is understood that this is a serious and ongoing situation and that state and local officials are still scrambling to grasp the enormity of the loss to life and property. North Carolinians have become gratefully familiar with the splendid work FEMA does in the wake of natural disasters, but our familiarity does not minimize the heartfelt gratitude we feel for the dedicated public servants who are helping the victims of flooding. 
   I have the utmost faith in Senator BOND and his fine staff, and I appreciate their willingness to consider any additional needs that FEMA may identify as this bill goes to Conference. At the same time, I certainly understand that there will be an effort to make an accurate accounting of the funding--if any--that FEMA needs and I pledge that I do not intend to make unreasonable demands upon appropriators. It is important that we do not act heedlessly in our understandable haste to help those in desperate need, and I will certainly make every effort to make sure that any aid requested is genuinely necessary.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Americans should be disturbed that the U.S. Census Bureau obviously no longer regards marriage as having any importance. 
   When the Census Bureau compiled its list of questions to be included in the 2000 decennial survey, the decision was obvious that it would be unnecessary and burdensome for the Bureau to include marital status in the census forms sent to the majority of American households. 
   So the Census Bureau decided to delete the marital status question from the census ``short form'' which it is called--which goes to approximately 83 percent of the American population--but continue to use the question on the ``long form''--which goes only to approximately 17 percent of the American population. 
   This will mark the first time since 1880 that the decennial census will not gather from the majority of the U.S. population, a count of those who are single, married, divorced, or widowed. This is especially disturbing, at least to this Senator, when one considers that the survival of the American culture is dependent upon the survival of the sacred institution of marriage. Moreover, marital status has heretofore regularly been viewed as vital information because there has always been great value placed in the institution of marriage. 
   It is irresponsible for the U.S. Government to suggest or imply that marriage is no longer significant or important, but that is precisely the message that will go out if marital status is eliminated from the short form by the Census Bureau. 
   However, Mr. President, the Census Bureau feels far differently when it comes to compiling statistics on various other things including race. The Census Bureau made it a top priority to learn the race of the majority of Americans; therefore the agency is asking, not one, but two questions relating to racial identity. 
   One can only speculate the reasoning behind this bizarre maneuver removing marital status from the short form, while asking two questions about race. It's important to remember that every year, more than $100 billion in Federal funding is awarded based on the data collected by the Census Bureau. Considering that American people will foot the bill on the Census Bureau's strange inclinations, should not Congress remind the U.S. Census Bureau that its job is not to seek out information to promote a social agenda. 
   For this reason, Mr. President, I am offering a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to the Transportation appropriations bill, expressing that the U.S. Census Bureau was wrong to eliminate  marital status from the census short form. The U.S. Census Bureau should include marital status on the short form census questionnaire--the one going out to the vast majority of Americans for the 2000 decennial census. 
   Unfortunately, most of the census short form questionnaires have already been printed without the important marital status question being included. Notwithstanding that, does not Congress have a moral obligation, as caretaker of America's culture, to set the record straight in emphasizing that marriage is still at the forefront of America's national survey? 
   I believe this sense-of-the-Senate resolution deserves careful consideration of all Senators, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I genuinely appreciate the courtesy of the distinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee (Mr. ROTH) for allowing me to discuss an innovative new technology more readily available to the dry cleaning industry. 
   Dr. Joe DeSimone, an highly-respected professor on the faculties of both the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and N.C. State University in Raleigh has developed an environmentally safe way to dry clean clothes while eliminating the millions of pounds of toxic solvents currently now being used to clean clothes, and, at the same time, advancing more energy-efficient technology. This procedure would dramatically reduce the dry cleaning industry's reliance on hazardous chemicals as solvents. 
   My amendment will allow for a 20 percent tax credit to new and existing dry cleaners who purchase the equipment which uses non-toxic solvents. The equipment includes both wet cleaning and liquid carbon dioxide cleaning systems which are now readily available. In fact, the EPA recently published a case study extolling the benefits of carbon dioxide technology. 
   The Joint Tax Committee estimates the tax credit would decrease revenues by a little more than $500 million during the next 10 years. I find this a modest price to pay considering the amount Americans rely on dry cleaners and by the fact that so many of these Americans bring potentially hazardous chemicals into their homes when they dry clean their clothes. 
   I believe that clarification of a Treasury regulation's application to an international tax treaty would provide an ample offset for this tax credit. Let me briefly explain the current situation: 
   Just this month, a judge in New York overturned 19 years of tax treaty policy. The judge ruled that an existing regulation that permits the Treasury to allocate interest based on a company's worldwide operations did not comply with the 1980 treaty. I disagree. The regulations allowed the U.S. Treasury to disallow abusive tax strategies and make sure that these companies pay their fair share of taxes. Tax treaties are never intended to be a means to avoid taxes, simply a means to prohibit double taxation. This amendment will continue this policy and avoid a rush for billions of dollars in tax refunds by international corporations.

   Mr. HELMS. Unfortunately, Mr. President, under the rules of the budget act, my amendment is subject to a point of order. However, I do appreciate the willingness of Chairman ROTH to work with me to find a way to make this tax credit a reality.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have at hand several news reports indicating that Nicaragua's Sandinistas have finally confessed that they supplied weapons in the 1980s to communist guerrillas in El Salvador and, in fact, were themselves dependent on a flood of weapons from the Soviet Union during that period.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Mr. Garvin conducted a series of interviews with current and former Sandinista officials who are now celebrating the 20th anniversary of their rise to power on July 19, 1979. What they celebrate is a revolution that brought nothing but poverty and heartache to millions of people. 
   But in the midst of reciting war stories, they let the truth slip out: these Sandinista officials confirmed that they provided weapons to the Marxist Salvadoran guerrillas. They also acknowledged that the Soviet Union agreed to supply Nicaragua with high-performance MiG fighters, along with other military assistance. 
   This is not news, but what is, indeed, news is that, for once, two Sandinistas told the truth. back in the 1980s, when President Ronald Reagan and good many Senators accused the Sandinistas of fomenting revolution in neighboring countries, they and their left-wing media apologists in the United States questioned our facts. When the Reagan Administration warned the Soviets not to provide MiGs to Nicaragua, the other side falsely accused President Reagan of hysteria. 
   Now come Sandinista leaders--co-founder Tomas Borge and former president Daniel Ortega--admitting their role in a plot to escalate the crisis in Central America. Mr. President, neither of the two is famous for telling the truth, but in this case, I think they stumbled upon it, letting the cat out of the bag.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the able Senator from New Hampshire is to be commended for bringing to the attention of the Senate the issue of normal trade relations with the communist regimes of China and Vietnam. 
   Few Senators have so steadfastly opposed communism in East Asia as Senator BOB SMITH. During this decade when it has been fashionable to declare the cold war over and just forget about the billion-plus people who continue to suffer under communist oppression, Senator SMITH has remained firm in his commitment to freedom in East Asia and that is why he is bringing these motions before the Senate today. 
   And on that score, I join Senator SMITH in support of the policies that he is emphasizing here today--that of denying normal trade status to Communist China and Vietnam. The Senator is right on the mark. Neither of these illegitimate regimes merits this honor. Mr. President, too often, in our search for trade dollars, we neglect to ask ourselves: With whom are we doing business? 
   Well, let's ask. 
   We are dealing with a communist regime in China that has illegitimately held power for 50 years. The same regime, in fact, that killed so many U.S. soldiers in the Korean war. The same regime that has killed tens of millions of its own people since 1949. And the same regime that has consistently identified the United States as the number one obstacle to its strategic agenda. 
   Supporters of the engagement theory dismiss all of this. They say that normal trade with China is in the U.S. interest and, in any event, will change China's behavior for the better. Reality has yet to catch up with the theory. Red China's behavior continues to be unacceptable and it is difficult to see which U.S. interests are being served by trade-as-usual with this regime. 
   This year, as in the past, there is voluminous evidence to contradict the claims of the engagement theorists. Whether it be national security issues or human rights, the picture in China is even bleaker than it was a year ago, the exact opposite of what the engagement theorists have predicted. 
   For starters, we have the Cox Committee's revelations of China's massive pilfering of our nuclear secrets. At a minimum, the Cox report has laid waste to the notion of China as a strategic partner. And the orchestration of anti-American riots by the Chinese government in May has reminded us that the true colors of the communist regime remain unchanged. 
   Meanwhile, China continues its reckless foreign policies that engagement was supposed to help moderate. In March, ace reporter Bill Gertz revealed that despite its promises to the Clinton administration, China continues to proliferate weapons of mass destruction to fellow rogue regimes around the world. 
   In February, the Pentagon reported that China is engaged in a massive buildup of missiles aimed at the democratic country of Taiwan. 
   Similar to national security issues, human rights have also regressed after another year of normal trade with China. The State Department itself was forced to admit this in April in its annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. Even on the economic front, where one might expect some benefits to accrue to America from trade with China, the yield is minimal. In 1998, American exports to Communist China were just $14 billion, less than one-fifth of one percent of GNP and fifty percent less than we export to democratic Taiwan. 
   The picture in Vietnam is similar. That country is still run by the same  communist autocrats as when the U.S. trade relationship resumed in 1994. These, of course, were the same revolutionaries who killed 58,000 Americans in the Vietnam war. Meanwhile, the Vietnamese people today still don't enjoy any real freedoms of speech, assembly, religion or political activity. The Vietnamese government continues to put up roadblocks to emigration for Montagnards and other citizens who wish to escape the misery and tyranny of Communist Vietnam. The economy is still a socialist mess, riddled with bureaucracy and corruption. 
   And yet again, Mr. President, we cannot stand here today and honestly claim that the Vietnamese government has provided a full accounting of our missing soldiers from the Vietnam war. 
   The bottom line, Mr. President, is that granting normal trade relations to China and Vietnam has purchased precious little for the United States and we ought to revoke the status for both countries. 
   But while I support Senator SMITH from a policy point of view, I cannot agree with the method that is being used here today. I am concerned that utilizing a motion to discharge these resolutions infringes on the prerogatives of the committee of jurisdiction, in this case the Finance Committee. Thus, I cannot support these motions. 
   However, given the gravity of the underlying policy issues, I would strongly encourage the Committee on Finance to report out Senate Joint Resolutions 27 and 28 so that the Senate can debate these important measures.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, today I'm introducing legislation to correct errors in the Coastal Barrier Resource System maps which have resulted in the denial of federal flood insurance to a large number of coastal North Carolinians in Dare County, insurance for which they unquestionably should have been eligible. 
   I've received many complaints from property owners about this situation, and last year I and members of North Carolina's House delegation asked the Fish and Wildlife Service to determine whether the map of the ``otherwise protected area' overlaying the Cape Hatteras National Seashore was in fact accurate.'' (Property owners outside of the seashore were being denied flood insurance on the grounds that they were within the boundary of the ``otherwise protected area.'') 
   Mr. President, the background regarding this Senate bill that I'm introducing today will explain the necessity of this bill's being offered: 
   Congress enacted the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-591; 104 Stat. 2931); within that act it established a classification in the System  known as ``otherwise protected areas'' which consist of publicly or privately-owned lands on coastal barriers which were held for conservation purposes. While they were not made part of the Coastal Barrier Resources System, the Congress forbade the issuance of new flood insurance for structures within these areas. (Lands within the Coastal Barrier Resources System--undeveloped coastal barriers and associated areas--are denied any Federal development-related assistance.) 
   All of the ``otherwise protected areas'' are depicted on maps adopted by the Congress in the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act. As needed, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which administers these maps, works with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, (FEMA) to determine precisely where the boundary of otherwise protected areas are located, so that FEMA may determine whether specific locations are eligible for flood insurance. 
   After consulting extensively for more than a year with FEMA and the National Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service has now advised us that the maps of the ``otherwise protected area,'' known as NC03P, are indeed inaccurate. The errors in the maps deny flood insurance to property owners adjacent to the Cape Hatteras National Seashore in Dare County. 
   The errors result from inaccurate depictions of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore boundary on the standardized maps upon which Congress designated this area, and in part because of the problems inherent in translating lines drawn on the large-scale maps used for designations into precise, on-the--ground property lines-a problem which neither the Congress nor the Interior Department appears to have considered when this was enacted in 1990. 
   The fact that Congress designated the boundaries of coastal barrier units and ``otherwise protected areas'' by maps, the detection of an error in a depicted feature of the underlying map, or disparities between clear Congressional intent and the actual map, does not alter the enacted boundary of the unit or area. Only any act of Congress may revise such a boundary; the statute does not provide authority for an administrative correction of such an error. 
   Although there is no statutory definition of, and little legislative history for, ``otherwise protected areas'', the areas so designated by Congress in 1990 were almost without exception depicted on maps transmitted by the Secretary in his January 1989 report to Congress pursuant to section 10 of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act of 1982. In developing the recommendations and maps for that Report, the Department utilized the following definition, which was published in the Federal Register (50 FR 8700):  
   A coastal barrier or portion thereof is defined as ``otherwise protected'' if it has been withdrawn from the normal cycle of private development and dedicated for conservation, wildlife management, public recreation or scientific purposes. . . .  
   This definition indicates that ``otherwise protected areas'' included only the conservation areas upon which they were based. In addition, the Administration has supported and Congress has enacted legislation in several instances where the stated purpose was to remove private property from the mapped outer boundary of an otherwise protected area. 
   I am grateful for the cooperation of the Administration in this matter, I do regret that it look so long in this case. 
   The fact remains that the mistakes which led to more than 230 properties in Dare County being placed within the outer boundary of the ``otherwise protected area'' was clearly not intended by Congress when the ``otherwise protected area'' was created. 
   The bill I'm introducing today will correct these errors, Mr. President, and I urge the Senate to pass this legislation promptly.

   Mr. HELMS. I commend the Senator from Minnesota for working with us on his amendments. The issues he raised are--``significant'' is not strong enough. They are grave issues that ought to be considered, and I commend him for it. I assure the Senator the committee will continue to work with him to address his concerns. 
   Mr. President, we have made significant progress in the State Department authorization bill. We have now completed debate on the Feingold amendment, and we have just, obviously, accepted the modified Wellstone amendment. We are making progress on the Sarbanes amendment, which is the only remaining amendment to be debated. I understand some Senators wish to come to the floor and speak on the bill in general, and I encourage them to do that now. This afternoon we will vote on the Feingold amendment and possibly the Sarbanes amendment, and then we will move to final passage.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, listening to my dear friend from Delaware, JOE BIDEN, I harken back to the days when there was very little working relationship between the two parties on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Today, I think the working relationship is very good. That is due to the efforts of Senator BIDEN and his desire to make things work. 
   Let me be candid. I am not in the mood to give away the store, and I haven't given it away regarding the United Nations yet. It remains to be seen whether the reforms both of us have been demanding will be in place early enough for this proposition, which I will discuss in just a minute, to take place. We will see. 
   I can't tell the Senate how many times my best friend--next to Dot Helms--Admiral Nance and I have talked about this very issue. Bud Nance is gone now, but I remember his counsel on this bill. 
   This measure is important to me because it bears the name of the Admiral James Wilson ``Bud'' Nance State Department Authorization bill. Bud is gone; he is at the Arlington National Cemetery, after a distinguished career. I miss him. 
   However, both Senator BIDEN and I are blessed with excellent staffs. I thank staff on both sides. For the minority, the Democrats, I especially thank the inimitable Ed Hall, Brian McKeon, Runeet Talwar, Diana Ohlbaum, Janice O'Connell, and Joan Woodward. 
   I am especially grateful to the Senate's legislative counsel, Art Rynearson, and, of course, the best part for me, the majority staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The staff was put together by Admiral Nance and me, but he became the chief of staff of the Foreign Relations Committee. Steve Biegun has succeeded Bud Nance. He has been very artful in his contribution to this measure. Patti McNerney, Garrett Grigsby, Marshall Billingslea, Michael Westphal, Beth Stewart, Roger Noriega--this Noriega was born in Kansas, by the way--Kirsten Madison, Marc Thiessen, Sherry Grandjean, Dany Pletka, who has just given birth to her second little girl--Richard Fontaine, Jim Doran, Natasha Watson, Christa Muratore, Laura Parker, Christa Bailey, Andrew Anderson and Susan Oursler. All of these young people on both sides have made a mighty contribution not only to the composition of the bill but the fact we were able to compose it at all. 
   We are working together now. I want to say to my friend, Senator BIDEN, I appreciate his friendship and his cooperation. I extend my congratulations to him. 
   Now then, this bill addresses several significant oversight and authorization issues that ought to be at least mentioned before we go to a vote. 
   No. 1, it proposes to strengthen and preserve the arms control verification functions of the U.S. Government while  addressing other nonproliferation matters as well. 
   No. 2, the bill authorizes a 5-year construction blueprint for upgrading U.S. embassies around the world to provide secure environments for America's personnel overseas. Unlike the funds provided more than a decade ago in the wake of a report by Admiral Inman calling for improved security of U.S. embassies, this bill would create a firewall for funding of other State Department expenditures. This, of course, would ensure that embassy funds are not raided again to pay for other State Department pet projects. I am just not going to stand for it, and this bill makes that very clear. 
   This bill makes some reforms to strengthen the Foreign Service and significantly, as Senator BIDEN has discussed at some length, the bill includes the United Nations reform package. This is not something we are going to lay on the table and say we are going to do someday. It is going to be done now. The United Nations is going to be reformed now or there is going to be trouble ahead. The reform agenda required by this bill, prior to payment of any U.S. taxpayers' dollars, has the full support of the Secretary of State and Senator BIDEN and me. These reforms were approved by the Senate during the 105th Congress by a vote of 90 to 5, with 5 Senators absent. But, of course, those reforms were vetoed by the President of the United States. 
   In conclusion, I want to pay my respects to all who have participated in the building of this legislation, those with whom I have disagreed as well as those with whom I have agreed. All in all, I think it is a very fine bill and I am glad to have had a very small part in it. 
   I yield the floor. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. HELMS. This amendment, as modified, preserves one of the key Foreign Service reforms in the bill. The bill currently requires that any disciplinary action taken against a member of the Foreign Service be included in a Foreign Service member's file for at least one successful tenure or promotion. Current practice requires that such actions remain in a personnel file for only 2 years. 
   The current requirement has enabled some Foreign Service members to game the system and receive a promotion once the disciplinary action has been removed from the file. For example, the committee was recently asked to review the promotion of an individual who had failed to attain promotion by two review boards while the disciplinary action remained a part of his file. After 2 years, when the action was removed from his file, he immediately received promotion. 
   The Foreign Service, like the military, is intended to be an up or out system. In the military, disciplinary actions stay with an officer's file for his entire career. The current provision in the bill seems to me to be a reasonable reform that would ensure a Foreign Service promotion board can make an informed decision. I accept the reasonable compromise offered by Senator SARBANES that ensures this requirement applies only to more severe disciplinary actions. 
   Madam President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am a father. Like everybody else, every daddy wants to get home, except a few who will not give time agreements on their amendments. So we will just have to plow ahead and do the best we can. 
   On behalf of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I offer the foreign relations authorization bill, approving specific State Department activities for fiscal years 2000 and 2001, including funds for payment of some dues arrearages to the United Nations and other international organizations conditioned upon reform of those institutions. 
   In the course of debate, the distinguished Senator from Delaware, Mr. BIDEN, and I will offer an amendment naming this bill the Admiral James W. Nance Foreign Relations Authorization bill, in memory and in honor of the late chief of staff of the Foreign Relations Committee, Bud Nance. 
   The Foreign Relations Committee approved this bipartisan legislation back in April--I believe on April 21st--by a vote of 17 to 1. 
   This is the first authorization of State Department activity since enactment last October on the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, which required the consolidation of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the U.S. Information Agency into the State Department. These were temporary agencies. They were established in the 1950s and were explicitly and emphatically described as temporary agencies. 
   As Ronald Reagan said, there is nothing so near eternal life as a temporary Federal agency. So what we did, we folded two of those into the State Department, their responsibilities, and got rid of them. 
   Both of these temporary agencies were created about a half century ago, and this effort by the Foreign Relations Committee is the first time any body has tried to do away with those nontemporary or temporary agencies. 
   The bill addresses several significant oversight and authorization issues. It proposes to strengthen and preserve the arms control verification functions of the U.S. Government, while addressing other nonproliferation matters as well. 
   The bill authorizes a 5-year $3 billion construction blueprint for upgrading U.S. embassies around the world to provide secure environments for America's personnel overseas. Unlike the funds provided more than a decade ago in the wake of a report by Admiral Inman calling for improved security of U.S. embassies, this bill creates a firewall for funding from other State Department expenditures which will ensure that embassy funds are not raided to pay for other State Department pet projects. 
   The bill makes some reforms to strengthen the Foreign Service. Most Foreign Service officers are supportive of ensuring poor performing members of the Foreign Service are not automatically kept in the Service by statutes manipulated to protect unworthy employees from discharge and/or personnel actions. The changes in the bill will streamline the grievance and disciplinary process stipulated by the Foreign Service Act. 
   The bill augments a coordination and oversight of the U.S. Government's role in assisting parents seeking return of abducted children. These provisions are an outgrowth of the Foreign Relations Committee oversight hearing this past year on the growing problem of international abduction of children in disputes growing out of divorce and separation. It is a real problem, I say to the distinguished occupant of the Chair.  
   Significantly, the bill includes a U.N. reform package which includes payments of arrearages in exchange for--I reiterate for emphasis--in exchange for key reforms of and by the United Nations. 
   I say parenthetically to the distinguished occupant of the Chair that on the day that Kofi Annan was designated to be the Secretary General of the United Nations, I called him and invited him to come to Washington. We worked out a stipulated number of reforms that had to be done before any thought or agreement could be considered regarding the so-called arrearages. 
   He agreed to that. He went back to the United Nations and made some other statements, but we are working that out. 
   Interestingly enough, we are getting some support from the gentleman who probably will be confirmed in a week or so as the new U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations who strongly favors the reform of the United Nations. He stipulated that to me yesterday. 
   The reform agenda required by this bill, prior to the payment of any U.S. taxpayer dollars, has the full support of the Secretary of State and the distinguished Senator from Delaware, Mr. BIDEN, and me. These reforms were approved by the Senate during the 105th Congress by a vote of 90-5, but it was vetoed by the President of the United States. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. 
   I believe we are going to have to have order, Mr. President.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator, the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. BIDEN, is far too generous. Several times in the past year or two, former Secretaries of State, and other past foreign policy officials of this Government, have said that the Foreign Relations Committee is now relevant. I think that is a high compliment to the committee. 
   But it would not have happened if it had not been for JOE BIDEN. When JOE BIDEN became--by his choice--the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, when I became chairman, we made a pact that we would work together. I have not enjoyed any other of my services in the Senate more than the cooperation with him. 
   I have just been amazed at how much he has learned about foreign policy since we have been on opposite sides of the committee. I have gotten to know JOE BIDEN well. He is a good partner, a good Senator, and an expert on foreign policy. And I compliment him.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that 30 years of federal deficits have taken their toll on the federal budget. 
   Likewise, two budget ``surpluses,'' although a step in the right direction, will scarcely make a dent on the actual federal debt oppressing both the government and the people. In fact, it does very little, but constrict the actual increase of the federal debt. 
   Even if the projected estimates from the Office of Management and Budget are correct, a surplus for 11 consecutive years will go hand-in-hand with a ``gross federal debt'' that will inch closer and closer to a 6 trillion dollar figure!--Now that, Mr. President, is a couple I do not particularly like to envision. But that is where we are. We are in a quagmire of debts. 
   I have heard comments that we--the Congress and this Administration--have taken steps to cut the federal deficit, but what is not being said is that  the budget ``surplus'' has little effect on the federal debt. We have indeed managed to cut the deficit out of the equation, but the answer to the relevant question--are we reducing the total federal debt at the same time--is NO. The surplus only cuts the debt's rate of growth. 
   With these thoughts in mind, Mr. President, I begin where I left off on Thursday: 
   At the close of business, Friday, June 11, 1999, the federal debt stood at $5,606,704,532,050.51 (Five trillion, six hundred six billion, seven hundred four million, five hundred thirty-two thousand, fifty dollars and fifty-one cents). 
   One year ago, June 11, 1998, the federal debt stood at $5,496,698,000,000 (Five trillion, four hundred ninety-six billion, six hundred ninety-eight million). 
   Fifteen years ago, June 11, 1984, the federal debt stood at $1,519,173,000,000 (One trillion, five hundred nineteen billion, one hundred seventy-three million). 
   Twenty-five years ago, June 11, 1974, the federal debt stood at $472,107,000,000 (Four hundred seventy-two billion, one hundred seven million) which reflects a debt increase of more than $5 trillion--$5,134,597,532,050.51 (Five trillion, one hundred thirty-four billion, five hundred ninety-seven million, five hundred thirty-two thousand, fifty dollars and fifty-one cents) during the past 25 years.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the late Admiral James W. (Bud) Nance was eulogized in late May by an eloquent friend who knew Bud well, a friend who had worked with Bud on many occasions beginning with their respective responsibilities with President Reagan during the eight years of the Reagan presidency. 
   That eloquent friend is a friend of many of us, a remarkable American who understands the miracle of this great country, Richard V. Allen, Chairman, The Richard V. Allen Company. 
   Mr. President, Dick Allen was speaking at a dinner on behalf of a non-profit foundation at Wingate University. He began by paying his respects to ``fifteen distinguished directors'' of the foundation, among them the Honorable Roger Milliken identified by Mr. Allen as ``the champion of good causes''.

    Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the commencement speaker at a leading university in my state, Campbell University at Buies Creek, N.C., was one of the most impressive and meaningful addresses that I have ever heard or read. 
   It was delivered by Dr. Denton Lotz, General Secretary to the Baptist World Alliance. Dr. Lotz's subject was ``New Hope for Destroyed Foundations''. 
   Campbell University is a truly remarkable institution whose president, Dr. Norman Adrian Wiggins, is one of the Nation's most respected educators. 
   Incidentally, in addition to his responsibilities as president, Dr. Wiggins serves as Professor of Law. I am obliged to add a personal note here: Campbell University's law school is the only law school in North Carolina not one of whose graduates has flunked the State Bar Exam for the past several years.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the Murray amendment because it proposes to legalize the destruction of innocent unborn babies at military facilities. And Mr. President, if precious unborn babies are allowed to be slaughtered on military grounds, it will be a stark contradiction to the main purpose of our national defense--the defense and protection of the human lives in America. 
   Small wonder that the men and women serving in the military are losing faith in the leadership of this country. In fact, Congress recently heard from members of the Air Force, Navy, Army, and Marines who testified about the low morale among U.S. service men and women--which they contribute to a general loss of faith and trust. 
   After all, the military establishment continues to have its moral walls chipped away by the immoral principles of the extreme liberal-left. In fact, the American people would be shocked and disturbed to learn that our military has been pressured to accept Witchcraft as a recognized religion. 
   Why would Congress wish to demoralize our military folks further by casting a dark cloud over military grounds--which is precisely what will happen if abortions are to be performed at these facilities. 
   Let us not forget, America's military is made up of fine men and women possessing the highest level of integrity and pride in defending their country. These are men and women who have been selfless in dedicating their lives to a deep held belief that freedom belongs to all. 
   Senators should not mince words in saying that military doors should be shut closed to abortionists. I urge Senators to vote against this amendment.

    Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Monday morning I was delighted--and highly gratified--to find that the national media are finally catching up to a fact that many of us have known all along: The Honorable Mr. Justice Clarence Thomas is one of the brightest, most principled, and intellectually engaging member of the United States Supreme Court in a generation. 
   An article in Monday's The Washington Post headed ``After a Quiet Spell, Justice Finds Voice'' drew a profile of a Justice who refuses to subvert to his own personal views the plain meaning of statutes passed by Congress; a Justice who is committed to protecting our basic American political structure by respecting state sovereignty; and who exercises the patient to undertake the exhaustive historical research needed to ascertain the original intent of the Founding Fathers in framing our Constitution. 
   Clearly, Mr. President, Mr. Justice Thomas is a remarkable American--one who bears no resemblance to the often cruel and totally false caricatures his critics have attempted to create. I shall not catalogue or dwell upon the many injustices Mr. Justice Thomas has suffered at the hands of those who--for their own petty political purposes--have heaped abuse upon this fine man except to make this simple observation: Clarence Thomas has found the strength to serve his country and remain true to his principles in the face of viciously unfair personal criticism and his courage speaks volumes about the strength of his character.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it is abundantly clear that more judges like Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court *.*.*. As further proof, I offer the disastrous decision of the Supreme Court--from which Justice Thomas sensibly dissented--in the case of Davis v. Monroe County School Board. By a 5-4 margin, the Supreme Court held that public schools can be held liable under federal law for failing to stop so-called sexual harassment on the part of school children. 
   Exactly what constitutes sexual harassment on the part of children is not defined by the Court, Mr. President. Moreover, what constitutes the vague ``deliberate indifference'' standard that public school administrators must now avoid is anyone's guess. The meaning will no doubt be haggled over in countless frivolous lawsuits in federal court that will impose unnecessary financial costs on beleaguered school districts. 
   As the cacophony countless exhortations to spend ever-increasing amounts of money on federal education programs continue, Mr. President, should we not also address the financial problems federal laws cause to local school boards in our increasingly litigious society? For if more distinguished judges like Clarence Thomas are not present to rein in lawsuit-happy interest groups (e.g. the National Women's Law Center, which brought this case in the first place), we will find even the most trivial aspects of children's regrettable but predictable boorishness regulated by federal judges. 
   Playground teasing and immature behavior does not require a federal lawsuit, Mr. President; it may require a good spanking. Unfortunately, we often find that reasonable discipline measures result in legal action as well. Pity the taxpayer who pays the bill, Mr. President--and pity the students and teachers who must navigate this baffling legal minefield. 
   So thank Heaven for Clarence Thomas, who is doing his level best to hold the line against foolish decisions. We must hope the Senate will soon act to rectify the devastating financial effects frivolous lawsuits are imposing on school boards and local taxpayers across the country.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am grateful to Senators HATCH, ALLARD, ASHCROFT, and SESSIONS who have spent countless hours over the past two Congresses addressing the complex issues of school safety and juvenile violence. 
   And, needless to say, I deeply appreciate their accommodating my concerns regarding a bill that I regard as among the most significant pieces of legislation to be considered this Congress--and for their having included three of my amendments in the manager's education package. 
   When enacted, these provisions will improve access to public school disciplinary records by other schools; expand the authority of schools to run a national criminal background check on their employees; and encourage State and local governments to run such checks on all school employees who are charged with providing educational and support services to our children. 
   Together, these provisions will make sure that local public, private, and parochial schools are able to make informed decisions about these individuals--whether a student, a teacher, or other school employee--who pose an unreasonable risk to the safety and security of our children. 
   Mr. President, we all share a common responsibility to protect our children and a common hope that our children will have a bright future. Though we disagree on the wisdom of creating more gun control laws, there are things that we ought to agree are necessary and in our children's best interests. 
   In this spirit, I introduced a bill in the past two Congresses seeking to extend the provisions of the Gun-Free Schools Act to illegal drugs. This amendment is based on that bill and is cosponsored by the distinguished Assistant Majority Leader, Mr. NICKLES, and the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, Mr. THURMOND. I trust that this amendment will be looked upon favorably by Senators on both sides of the aisle. 
   Mr. President, this amendment will strike an important blow in the war against drugs by helping to protect America's school-children from the scourge of drugs in their classrooms. It does this by requiring States to adopt a low mandating ``zero tolerance'' for illegal drugs at school in order to qualify for Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) funds. Zero tolerance is defined as requiring any student in possession of a felonious quantity of this contraband at school to be expelled for not less than one year. Its adoption will finally send a clear unambiguous message to students, parents, and teachers--drugs and schools do not mix. 
   Anybody who questions the necessity of this measure should consider these excerpts from the 1998 CASA National Survey of Teens, Teachers and Principals. This outstanding report was  prepared by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University under the direction of President Carter's former HEW Secretary, Joseph Califano. Under the heading ``Drug Dealing In Our Schools'', the report states:  
   For too many kids, school has become not primarily a place for study and learning, but a haven for booze and drugs. ..... Parents should shutter when they learn that 22 percent of 12- to 14-year-olds and 51 percent of 15- to 17-year-olds know a fellow student at their school who sells drugs. ..... Indeed, not only do many of them know student drug dealers; often the drug deals take place at school itself. Principals and teachers may claim their schools are drug-free, but a significant percentage of the students have seen drugs sold on school grounds with their own eyes. ..... In fact, more teenagers report seeing drugs sold at school (27 percent) than in their own neighborhoods (21 percent).  
   In other places, the report details that students consider drugs to be the number one problem they face and that illegal drugs are readily available to students of all ages. Exacerbating this terrible situation, illegal drugs are not cheaper and more potent than ever before. The CASA report goes on to state that ``one in four teenagers can get acid, cocaine or heroin within 24 hours, and given enough time, almost half (46 percent) would be able to purchase such drugs.'' Clearly, eliminating drugs from America's classrooms is a necessary first step to the restoration of order in our schools. 
   The harm that illegal drugs causes our students in incalculable. Though its' ill effects, disruptions, and the violence associated with it are not limited to those actually involved in the drug trade. The PRIDE survey, conducted 
   by the National Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education, found a link between school violence and drugs when it demonstrated that:  
   Gun-toting students were 23 times more likely to use cocaine; 
   Gang members were 12 times more likely to use cocaine; and 
   Students who threatened others were 6 times more likely to use cocaine than others.  
   Clearly, the connection between drugs and school violence is an irrefutable as it is frightening. 
   Mr. President, it should seem obvious that many children take guns to school because they are either involved in illegal activity or because they seek to defend themselves from those who are. It is clear that any further effort to eliminate guns and violence from schools must focus not merely on the gun but on the reasons why students choose to arm themselves. My amendment does precisely that. 
   My home state of North Carolina has not been immune to the ravages of illegal drugs. In fact, ``possession of a controlled substance'' has been either the first or second most reported category of school crime in North Carolina for the past four years. That's according to North Carolina State University's Center for the Prevention of School Violence, an outstanding organization that tracks the incidence of school crime and suggests ways to prevent it. 
   As bleak as the picture is, there are immediate steps that we can take to reverse course. Those who are on the ``front lines'' of our country's drug war have important things to contribute to the discussion. Overwhelmingly, students, teachers and parents support the adoption of a zero tolerance policy for drugs at school. 
   Among those surveyed, the CASA study found broad support for the adoption of firm policies on random locker searches, drug testing of student athletes, and zero tolerance policies. Regarding zero tolerance, 80% of principals, 79% of teachers, 73% of teenagers and 69% of parents voiced support for the adoption of such a policy at their school. 
   Additionally, 85% of principals, 79% of teachers and 82% of students believe that zero tolerance policies are effective at keeping drugs out of schools and that they would actually reduce drugs on their campus. Quoting from the CASA report again:  
   If these students believe them [zero tolerance policies] so effective, these policies must make an impact on their decisions to not bring drugs on campus. Given this, it seems that schools ...... should implement and strictly enforce zero tolerance policies. Perhaps in doing so they can increase their likelihood of eradicating drugs on their school grounds.  
   It is not my position that this amendment, by itself, will eliminate all drugs from our schools but it is clear that this is a long overdue step in the right direction. 
   This policy is firm but fair. The drug trade and the violence associated with it have no place in America's classrooms. Schools should foster an environment that is conducive to learning and supportive of the vast majority of students who want to learn. Children and teachers deserve a school free of the fear and violence caused by drugs. 
   Removing drugs and violence from our schools is a goal that we should all agree on. The President, in his 1997 State of the Union address, said ``we must continue to promote order and discipline'' in America's schools by ``remov[ing] disruptive students from the classroom, and hav[ing] zero tolerance for guns and drugs in school.'' I could not agree more with the President on this point: it is time that the Senate go on record in support of removing illegal drugs from America's classrooms, by approving this amendment.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, let me take note that members of Adm. Nance's family are in the family gallery. While the rules prohibit my saying anything to them, I think they know that our deepest sympathy goes to them from us. 
   Mr. President, when I heard the sound of Dr. Elaine Sloand's quiet voice on the other end of the line at about 3:30 in the afternoon a week ago, I detected an unmistakable sadness in it. I tried to brace myself for the bad news that had been expected for a day or so. Dr. Sloand, a wonderful, great, kind and compassionate physician, had done everything within her power to save Bud Nance's life. Many others at the National Institutes of Health had  also worked against the odds to save this great American, the remarkable retired Naval officer who had fought in almost a dozen of the major battles of World War II. 
   So, Mr. President, when I picked up the phone and heard Dr. Sloand's voice, I knew that James Wilson Nance was gone. And he was. 
   As I sat at my desk in silence and alone, I recalled the poignancy of Adlai Stevenson years ago when he lost the bid for the Presidency: ``It hurts too bad to smile and I'm too old to cry.'' 
   A thousand memories crowded their way into my consciousness as I sat there in those few quiet minutes. You see, Mr. President, Bud Nance and I could not have been more than 4 or 5 years old when we began playing together as little boys. On one occasion, he had scarcely had time to get to his home from my house a couple of blocks away in our little hometown of Monroe, when he was back knocking at the door. There he stood with his little hand thrust forward with a toy: ``Here,'' he said, ``this is yours; I took it home by mistake and I'm sorry.'' 
   Just as the boy, Bud Nance, was unfailingly and impeccably honest, so was Rear Adm. James W. Nance decades later when he skippered a series of U.S. warships, including the giant aircraft carrier, the Forrestal, that had more sailors aboard than there were people in Bud Nance's hometown and mine. 
   During the past week, there has been an almost endless series of friends and admirers of Admiral Nance expressing their sorrow and their admiration for what I regard as a giant of a man fallen. Needless to say, I have been deeply grateful to every one of those expressing their regrets and their comfort. 
   Anybody who has known Bud Nance did not merely like Bud Nance; it is a far deeper and genuine feeling that so many have held for him. In my case, nothing fits but the word ``love''. I loved Bud Nance like a brother. In my final conversation with him 9 days ago, I told him so. His voice, weak and raspy, but nonetheless unmistakably clear, replied, ``I love you, too.'' 
   Bud loved his family; oh, how he loved them. We had often discussed, down through the years, his and my good fortunes. He once commented about his dear wife, Mary Lyda, that it was she who did the hard part. He used to say, ``I was away so much of the time, and she was back home raising our children and raising them right.'' 
   Mr. President, I could go on, but I shall not, except for one final vignette, which underscores the goodness and tenderness of ``The Admiral.'' 
   Some years ago, on a cold and wintry night, a kitten was abandoned at Bud's and Mary Lyda's front door. It was doubtful that the kitten--cold, shivering and wet--would survive, but Bud and Mary Lyda produced hot water bottles and a tiny bed for that little kitten who was too fragile and too young to handle solid food. For 2 or 3 nights straight, Bud Nance sat up with that kitten, lovingly holding it in his arms while, with a teaspoon, feeding a little bit of warm milk into that tiny little fluff of fur. 
   But the kitten did survive. He named that kitten Kate. She slept at the foot of Bud's bed from then on. 
   Mr. President, Dot and I visited Mary Lyda Faulk and the wonderful Nance children that night following Bud's departure earlier in the afternoon. While we sat in the living room chatting, in strolled Kate. She checked each one of the several of us, but she first went to Bud's empty chair. I believe Kate knew that her great benefactor and her best friend was gone. 
   Kate was such a lucky little kitten, just as all the rest of us were lucky to have known Bud Nance, to have worked with him, to have had him as a true and faithful friend, a friend whom we not only admired, but loved.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am grateful to the able Senator from Missouri, Mr. ASHCROFT, and the able Senator from Tennessee, Mr. FRIST, for offering this amendment which corrects a glaring flaw in the Federal disabilities law and, in my judgment, is among the most important amendments to the juvenile justice legislation when, again, it is pending. 
   This past Thursday morning, I was aghast when I noted an op-ed piece in the Washington Times written by Kenneth Smith. It was entitled ``Disabled Educators.'' The article detailed a number of disturbing incidents of students threatening their teachers and peers with violence, bringing knives and guns to campus and even burning down their own schools. In the wake of the tragedy of Littleton, CO, these news items, of course, are particularly chilling. 
   What is most alarming about the column is not the individual stories of violence, it is that a well-intentioned Federal law nevertheless prevents local school officials from expelling these dangerous students from their schools for all but a short period of time. 
   Let me admit up front that I bear my share of the responsibility for this situation. Two years ago, I was one of 98 Senators who voted to reauthorize the Individuals with Disabilities Act, the so-called IDEA legislation. 
   Only the courageous and farsighted Senator from Washington, Mr. GORTON, voted against final passage of IDEA shortly after his commonsense amendment to address these discipline procedures failed by just three votes. 
   Two years later, Senator GORTON's warnings began to appear prophetic, and I certainly appreciate his crucial leadership on this issue, as well as the many others Senator GORTON has helped the Senate to follow. 
   In any case, I voted for IDEA because I believed then, and I continue to believe, that it is appropriate for the Federal Government to help local school districts bear the financial burden of attending to the special needs of disabled children. But it is unfair and it is unwise for the Federal Government to use these funds to mandate unreasonable and even dangerous discipline procedures on the local schools. I believe that the amendment which I hope will be pending shortly will be an important first step in correcting this flaw in the IDEA legislation. 
   There are 165,402 children in North Carolina classified as learning disabled. I believe that every one of these children is entitled to get an education. But under the IDEA legislation, if 1--even 1--of those 165,402 children brings a weapon to school, he or she must be returned to the classroom within 45 days if the school district wants to keep its IDEA funding. If a disabled student threatens violence or poses any other kind of general discipline problem, the student can be suspended for only 10 days. Worse, these limitations apply to disabled children even if their behavior is unrelated to the disability. 
   Clearly, this policy defies common sense. This amendment frees the hands of school administrators to use their discretion to discipline a learning-disabled student who brings a weapon to school or threatens violence. I believe the Senate should adopt this eminently reasonable position. 
   Anybody who does not want to take my word for it should listen to the experts. For example, North Carolina State University is home to a unique organization called the Center for the Prevention of School Violence. It is, as far as I know, one of the few public policy outlets devoted solely to the issue of school violence. Its director, Pam Riley, works tirelessly to collect statistics, analyze legislation, and suggest solutions to make our schools safer. 
   I called Dr. Riley and asked her to look over the amendment I am discussing and to let me know her opinion. With the Chair's permission, I shall read a paragraph from her reply to me, because she states the issue quite clearly and succinctly, as far as I am concerned. Let me quote her:  
   I believe it is entirely appropriate--indeed, entirely necessary--for Congress to allow local schools the flexibility to discipline students who bring weapons to school or threaten violence on their teachers or peers, regardless of whether the student is classified as disabled. While I believe it is important to make sure disabled students receive quality education, the safety of our classrooms should be an overriding goal of federal education policy.  
   That says it all, as far as I am concerned. I know that

   Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, the North Carolina School Boards Association, in a letter dated May 13, 1999, echoed Dr. Riley's sentiments:  
   Being able to appropriately discipline all students is essential to maintaining safe schools.  
   Dr. Bob Bowers, superintendent of the Buncombe County Schools, wrote:  
   [T]he Ashcroft amendment--  
   And it is now the Ashcroft-Frist-Helms amendment--  
   is a necessary and proper response to student threats of violence in our schools made against teachers and [other students]. Moreover, weapons have no place in our schools and making exceptions erodes confidence regarding overall school safety.

   Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. 
   I hope those listening to this discussion are not misled into thinking that school administrators are suddenly discovering this problem as an aftermath of the Littleton tragedy. The fact is that schools have long been concerned about this aspect of IDEA. 
   This letter to my office dated April 2, 1998, from the Onslow County Schools in Jacksonville, NC, clearly indicates that discipline procedures have long been a problem for our school districts. More than a year ago, Superintendent Ronald Singletary wrote to me to say that under the IDEA law, ``we convey [to students] that there are no real consequences for the serious misbehavior of a disabled student.'' I cannot imagine a more inappropriate message to send to our students. 
   The problems we are discussing are more than just a quirk in the law or a technical matter. It is clearly an ill-conceived mistake by Congress, in which I participated. And I hope Senators will ask themselves what possible reason the Federal Government would have to prevent local school officials from making sure that their students have safe classrooms. This is the real problem. 
   Our school boards and our administrators are asking for our help in correcting a part of IDEA that does not work. And I sincerely hope the Senate will listen.

   Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I thank my distinguished friend and great American, Senator MCCAIN. 
   Madam President, before commenting on the substance of the resolution before us today, I think I ought to make it clear that I take exception to the circumstances that would have been dictated by the War Powers Act had the Foreign Relations Committee not acted voluntarily this past Friday morning to take an action. In my judgment, the War Powers Act is ill considered and fundamentally unconstitutional, as such distinguished Senators of years gone by have declared it to be--along with near unanimity of sitting conservative Senators today. 
   In any case, Madam President, including the distinguished Presiding Officer at the moment, this past Friday, April 30, the Foreign Relations Committee met formally and officially reported S.J. Res. 20 without recommendation in order to avoid setting a precedent in support of the War Powers Act. Let me repeat, had we not met and had we not reported the type of legislation that we did report, we would have set a precedent in support of the War Powers Act. And I would resign from the Senate before I would have done that voluntarily. The committee reported S.J. Res. 20 without recommendation by a vote of 14-4. 
   While I do support the underlying sentiment of the resolution offered by my friend, JOHN MCCAIN, to win the war against Serbia, I do not--and I cannot--support S.J. Res. 20. 
   In times of armed conflict between the United States and a hostile power, it is the duty of the President of the United States, in his role as Commander in Chief, to provide leadership in seeking to achieve our political and military objectives. 
   The Senate cannot and must not force the President to take measures that he is unwilling or unprepared to take. So I am not prepared to sign off prematurely on measures and methods on which I do not yet have details. 
   Approval of this resolution would mistakenly--even dangerously perhaps--authorize the President to use force in a manner far exceeding anything that he has thus far publicly or privately indicated to the Congress. 
   Now, approval of this resolution would also provide the President with prior congressional approval--prior congressional approval--for any and all action he may want to subsequently undertake in prosecuting the war--and that is what it is--against Serbia. And that would have the effect of preventing Congress from exercising its responsibilities in authorizing, or limiting, options as circumstances may change. 
   Now let me be clear: I detest the unspeakably cruel acts committed by the Milosevic forces, and I certainly pray for that evil man's early and speedy defeat in this war. But that, however, is not what this resolution is about, despite what are, without doubt, the good intentions by the author. 
   I worry that a negative vote by the Senate on S.J. Res. 20 will provide comfort to Mr. Milosevic, and lead him to assume falsely that the United States is not resolute in its determination to prevail in this conflict. Yet I am more concerned about what may be unintended effects of this resolution. 
   This resolution would simply give the President a blank check. It would provide the President with prior Congressional approval for anything and everything the President may decide to undertake in prosecuting the war against Serbia. 
   S.J. Res. 20 puts the cart before the horse. Giving the President carte blanche to do whatever he wants in Kosovo without first coming to Congress to explain his mission and ask for authorization, is not a solution for the President's failure to follow the Constitution. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this is a significant piece of legislation, I believe, the Serbia Democratization Act of 1999, on which I am honored by the cosponsorship of a number of distinguished colleagues--Senators GORDON SMITH, LUGAR, LIEBERMAN, LAUTENBERG, DEWINE, MCCAIN, and ORRIN HATCH. 
   More than a year ago, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic sent Serbian troops into Kosovo to launch a brutal assault on the ethnic Albanian population there. This action was the beginning of a merciless and unjustified Serbian offensive against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Two thousand victims of Milosevic's cruelty lie dead--many of them innocent civilians. And hundreds of thousands of people have been driven from their homes. 
   Mr. President, this tragedy in Kosovo has emphasized the obvious: that if the United States continues to foolishly hope for good will on the part of Milosevic, the United States will be dragged into the crises this cruel man manufactures time and again. Instead of pursuing a strategy that leads to NATO airstrikes or the deployment of thousands of United States troops in peacekeeping operations, I believe it is the course of wisdom to examine the root cause of instability in that region--the bloody regime of Slobodan Milosevic. 
   President Milosevic has imposed rigid controls on, or launched outright attacks against, the media, universities, and the judicial system in Serbia to prevent the possibility that a democracy and an independent civil society can be developed. The massacres of innocent women and children in Kosovo demonstrate Milosevic's disregard for 
   basic human rights. This man, in a word, forbids the very thought of a democratic system in Serbia. 
   For too long this Administration has claimed that no viable democratic opposition exists in Serbia or that the United States has no choice but to work with Milosevic. Mr. President, I refuse to accept this argument. There are individuals and organizations in Serbia that can be a force for democratic change in that country. Milosevic is not the only option. And in no case should the United States treat that dictator as a responsible leader or as someone with whom we can do business. 
   The Serbia Democratization Act, which I am introducing today, has but one purpose--to get rid of the murderous regime of Mr. Milosevic. Let me briefly summarize the key points of the legislation: 
   It authorizes $100 million over a two year period to support the development of a government in Yugoslavia based on democratic principles and the rule of law. 
   It calls for increased Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty broadcasting to Serbia to undermine state control of the media and spread the message of democracy to the people of Serbia. 
   It calls for humanitarian and other assistance to the victims of oppression in Kosovo. 
   It adds new sanctions or strengthens those that exist against Serbia until the President certifies that the government is democratic. For example, it codifies the so-called ``outer wall'' of sanctions that the United States has informally in place. It blocks Yugoslav assets in the United States. It prevents senior Yugoslav and Serbian government officials, and their families, from receiving visas to travel to the U.S. And it requires a democratic government to be in place in Serbia before extending MFN status to Yugoslavia. 
   It states that the U.S. should send to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia all information we have on the involvement of Milosevic in war crimes. 
   Now, as for Mr. Milosevic's future, I do not care one way or the other if he lives out his days in sunny Cyprus if he will agree to step aside and make way for democracy in Serbia. The important thing is that he be removed from power, whether voluntarily or not. 
   Once the Milosevic regime has been replaced by a democratic government in Yugoslavia, this legislation calls for immediate and substantial U.S. assistance to support the transition to democracy. When that day comes, I will lead the way in encouraging Yugoslavia to take its place among the democratic nations of the West. Until that time, I will work to implement a policy that will undermine the autocratic regime of Slobodan Milosevic in every way possible.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, at the close of business yesterday, Tuesday, March 23, 1999, the federal debt stood at $5,645,199,129,224.03 (Five trillion, six hundred forty-five billion, one hundred ninety-nine million, one hundred twenty-nine thousand, two hundred twenty-four dollars and three cents). 
   One year ago, March 23, 1998, the federal debt stood at $5,539,833,000,000 (Five trillion, five hundred thirty-nine billion, eight hundred thirty-three million). 
   Five years ago, March 23, 1994, the federal debt stood at $4,559,372,000,000 (Four trillion, five hundred fifty-nine billion, three hundred seventy-two million). 
   Ten years ago, March 23, 1989, the federal debt stood at $2,737,055,000,000 (Two trillion, seven hundred thirty-seven billion, fifty-five million). 
   Fifteen years ago, March 23, 1984, the federal debt stood at $1,465,084,000,000 (One trillion, four hundred sixty-five billion, eighty-four million) which reflects a debt increase of more than $4 trillion--$4,180,115,129,224.03 (Four trillion, one hundred eighty billion, one hundred fifteen million, one hundred twenty-nine thousand, two hundred twenty-four dollars and three cents) during the past 15 years.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, today on behalf of the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. TORRICELLI, and myself, I am sending to the desk a bill entitled ``The Taiwan Security Enhancement Act.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. 
   This bill is to do the best we can to ensure that the United States is fulfilling its obligations to the Republic of China as specified by the Taiwan Relations Act. 
   Mr. President, this has been done reasonably well for about 20 years, but recent trends disclose the need for efforts by the United States to be stepped up, hence the introduction of this bill by Senator TORRICELLI and  me. There will undoubtedly be further additions to the sponsorship of this bill. In any case, as you know, the Pentagon, last month, delivered to the Congress a report entitled ``The Security Situation in the Taiwan Straits.'' Frankly, I found this report exceedingly disturbing. 
   For openers, the report stated that Red China has been and will continue to deploy a large number of missiles directly across the strait from Taiwan. In fact, according to media reports, China already has more than 150 such missiles aimed at Taiwan and plans to increase the number to 650 during the next few years. 
   Taiwan has virtually no defenses against such missiles. In 1995 and 1996, Red China proved beyond a shadow of a doubt a willingness to use these missiles, at a minimum to intimidate Taiwan. 
   I think Americans should also be concerned about Chinese missiles. In late November, the Chinese People's Liberation Army conducted exercises consisting of mock missile attacks on United States forces in South Korea and in Japan. The Pentagon report, to which I just referred, also makes clear that mainland China's vast quantitative edge over Taiwan in naval and air power, coupled with China's ongoing modernization drive, will prove overwhelming in any sort of military confrontation. The Pentagon report concluded that Taiwan's future success in deterring Chinese aggression will be--and I quote from the report--``dependent on its continued acquisition of modern arms, technology and equipment and its ability to deal with a number of systemic problems'' such as logistics. 
   This is precisely where the United States had better step in, Mr. President, because the United States is the only power in the world that can assure that Taiwan can continue to acquire the weapons it needs and deal with its systemic problems. 
   The question is, Will we do it? Communist China has coupled its military buildup and threats against Taiwan with increased pressure on the United States to limit or to cease our arms sales to Taiwan. This is reminiscent of 1982 when the Reagan administration yielded to Chinese pressure and mistakenly agreed to limit and gradually reduce our arms sales to Taiwan in the regrettable August communique. 
   President Clinton, similarly, last summer caved in to Beijing's three noes--no, no, no. Will arms sales to Taiwan be sacrificed next? I put a question mark after it because I hope the administration will recover from its lack of foresight of last summer. 
   In any event, if one listens to administration officials, 
   who somehow seem incapable of commenting on arms sales to Taiwan without mentioning the 1982 communique, or the administration's refusal to sell submarines to Taiwan on the flimsy pretext that those submarines are offensive, I think one will get some idea of where the United States arms sales to Taiwan will be if we do not now stand steadfast. 
   Let me explain. Sections 3(a) and 3(b) of the Taiwan Relations Act compel us, oblige us, to provide defensive arms to Taiwan based solely upon the judgment of the United States regarding Taiwan's needs, meaning that Beijing's opinion doesn't count. Given China's threatening military buildup, it is unlikely that Taiwan's legitimate needs are going to go down soon. Nor should U.S. arms sales go down, Mr. President. 
   Moreover, it is high time to begin a discussion of whether the United States ought to be doing more in the way of exchanges in training and planning with Taiwan's military. The Taiwan military has operated in virtual isolation for 20 years, and this has certainly contributed to some of the systemic problems alluded to in the Pentagon report, to which I referred just a moment ago. 
   Taiwan's military does not exercise with us. They do not plan with us. When the Red Chinese missiles were flying over Taiwan in 1996 and our carriers went to the strait, the Taiwan military had no direct or secure way of communicating with the United States fleet, none whatsoever. The question is, Do we want to be stuck in that situation again? While the Secretary of Defense and other top officials can rub elbows in Beijing and possibly have champagne, the State Department prevents any other officer above the rank of colonel setting foot on Taiwan. 
   In addition to being outrageous, this cannot help having a corrosive effect on our joint ability to deter conflict in the Taiwan Strait over time. 
   All of this is why I have introduced, with Senator TORRICELLI, the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, which has three main thrusts. Let me briefly identify each of them. 
   One, the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act seeks to ensure that our friends in Taiwan will have the necessary equipment to maintain their self-defense capabilities as required by the Taiwan Relations Act. It does this by prohibiting any politically motivated reductions in arms sales to Taiwan pursuant to the 1982 communique and by authorizing the sale to Taiwan of a broad array of defense systems, including missile defense systems, satellite early warning data, diesel submarines, and advanced air-to-air missiles. 
   Secondly, the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, which I have just introduced, seeks to bolster the process for defense sales to Taiwan. The bill does this in several ways. It requires an increase in staffing at the currently overworked technical section at the American Institute in Taiwan. It also requires the President to report to Congress annually on Taiwan's defense requests and to justify any rejection or postponement of arms sales to Taiwan. 
   These actions are not currently taken and the President and the Congress need to get more involved in the process, precisely as the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, which I just introduced, will require. 
   Third, the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act will redress some of the deficiencies in readiness resulting in part from the 20-year isolation of Taiwan's military. This will be achieved by supporting Taiwan's increased participation at United States defense colleges, requiring the enhancement of our military exchanges and joint training, and establishing direct communication between our respective militaries. 
   All of this will merely implement section 2(b)(6) of what? It will implement the Taiwan Relations Act, which calls for the United States--not Taiwan, but the United States--to maintain a capacity to resist any resort to force or coercion that would jeopardize Taiwan. 
   How can we maintain that capacity over the long run if we can't even communicate with Taiwan's military--obviously, we can't--or if we do not do joint planning and training with Taiwan's military? 
   I can hear it now. Some are going to say this is provocative. They will claim that doing these things will upset the United States relationship with China. This is true. The Red Chinese won't like this bill. But I think we all know, Mr. President, that many of the things called for in this legislation must be done at the earliest possible time. 
   China's behavior--let me be clear--mainland China's behavior is a clear warning that it is time for the United States to be much more serious about maintaining a posture of deterrence in the western Pacific and in protecting our loyal, long-time friends in the Republic of China on Taiwan.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send to the desk legislation that the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, Ms. LANDRIEU and I are introducing today, its purpose being to implement the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption--a treaty pending before the Foreign Relations Committee. 
   Senator LANDRIEU and I have worked together on issues of adoption since her arrival in the Senate in 1997. I am genuinely grateful for her leadership on this issue. 
   According to the most recent statistics, in 1998 almost 15,774 children were adopted by Americans from abroad. The majority of the children were brought to the United States from Russia, China, Korea, and Central and South American countries. In my state of North Carolina, 175 children were adopted in 1996 from outside the United States. 
   The Intercountry Adoption Implementation Act will provide for the first time a rational structure for intercountry adoption. The act is intended to bring some accountability to agencies that provide intercountry adoption services in the United States, and strengthen the hand of the Secretary of State in ensuring that U.S. adoption agencies engage in efforts to find homes for children in an ethical manner. 
    Mr. President, I strongly support adoption. It is in the best interest of every child--regardless of his or her age, race or special need--to be raised by a family who will provide a safe, permanent, and nurturing home. However, it is also a process that can leave parents and children vulnerable to fraud and abuse. 
   For this reason, the legislation that Senator LANDRIEU and I are introducing today includes a requirement that agencies be accredited to provide intercountry adoption. Mandatory standards for accreditation will include ensuring that a child's medical records be available in English to the prospective parents prior to their traveling to the foreign country to finalize an adoption. (We are also requiring that agencies be transparent, especially in their rate of disrupted adoption and their fee scales.) 
   This legislation also places the requirements of implementing the Hague Convention with the U.S. Secretary of State. Some have advocated a role for various government agencies, but I believe that spreading responsibility among various agencies will undermine the effective implementation of the Hague Convention. 
   During hearings last year in the Foreign Relations Committee regarding international parental kidnaping, the Committee heard testimony regarding the difficulties of coordination among agencies in implementing the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of Parental Abduction. This situation provides a valuable lesson. As a result, our legislation tasks the Secretary of State with establishing accreditation criteria for adoption agencies. 
   The Foreign Relations Committee soon will schedule hearings to consider both the treaty and this legislation. I hope that these hearings will emphasize both the many benefits of intercountry adoption, but also several of the abuses that have resulted during this decade.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I commend our distinguished colleagues from Florida, Senators BOB GRAHAM and CONNIE MACK, for their leadership in the bipartisan effort to defend the rights of the Cuban people. 
   Their Senate Resolution No. 57--of which I am a proud cosponsor--is a timely reminder to the administration that the United States must speak out clearly in behalf of those whose own voices are choked by communist repression--be they in China or Cuba. Our principled, consistent defense of human rights must be heard at the upcoming meeting of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. 
   In recent weeks, Fidel Castro has executed a brutal crackdown on courageous Cubans and independent journalists who seek freedom from the heavy-handed treatment imposed on them by the Castro government. 
   Just this week, he sentenced four prominent, peaceful dissidents to up to 5 years in prison for daring to criticize Castro's failed communist experiment. 
   There's nothing new about Castro's brutality. But the latest Castro crackdown is significant because it violates Castro's commitments to the Pope. The Pope asked Castro to ``open up to the world'' and to respect human rights. Castro's reply has now been heard: He gave a bloody thumbs-down to the Pope's plea. 
   The latest crackdown also comes despite years of Canadian coddling and European investment in Cuba. The Canadians' self-described ``policy of engagement'' has served to prop-up the Castro regime but has done nothing to advance human rights or democracy. 
   Thos who have urged unilateral concessions from the United States in order to nudge Castro toward change surely will now acknowledge that appeasement has failed--as it always does.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, today, March 15th, is the Ides of March for 1999. Like Caesar, Congress and the Administration are ignoring the one thing that has the potential to cripple our nation by crippling the booming U.S. economy--I am speaking of the Federal Debt. 
   While the political debate addresses the budget surplus, the balanced budget, and Social Security, it ignores the larger and lingering problem of the federal debt, and the lurking interest on the federal debt. Essentially, Mr. President, the forest cannot be seen for the trees. 
   Well, Mr. President, I am one who far prefers to examine to see the whole picture. If we continue to ignore the escalating debt and its enormous interest growing almost one billion dollars daily--just to pay the interest, mind you--then we will continue to risk economic bedlam down the road. 
   With these thoughts in mind, Mr. President, I begin where I left off Friday: 
   At the close of business, Friday, March 12, 1999, the federal debt stood at 5,653,581,734,840.04 (Five trillion, six hundred fifty-three billion, five hundred eighty-one million, seven hundred thirty-four thousand, eight hundred forty dollars and four cents). 
   One year ago, March 12, 1998, the federal debt stood at $5,529,750,000,000 (Five trillion, five hundred twenty-nine billion, seven hundred fifty million). 
   Fifteen years ago, March 12, 1984, the federal debt stood at $1,464,623,000,000 (One trillion, four hundred sixty-four billion, six hundred twenty-three million). 
   Twenty-five years ago, March 12, 1974, the federal debt stood at $469,792,000,000 (Four hundred sixty-nine billion, seven hundred ninety-two million) which reflects a debt increase of more than $5 trillion--$5,183,789,734,840.04 (Five trillion, one hundred eighty-three billion, seven hundred eighty-nine million, seven hundred thirty-four thousand, eight hundred forty dollars and four cents) during the past 25 years.

   Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, the National Missile Defense Act of 1999, in addition to being sort of a jawbreaker of a title, is exceedingly significant legislation which takes the first step toward protecting the American people from the growing threat of attack from ballistic missiles carrying nuclear, chemical, or biological warheads. 
   Now, I am gladly a cosponsor because this establishes the unmistakable policy of the U.S. Government emphasizing the need to defend the American people from missile attack. This policy is clear, it is unequivocal. 
   However, it is only the first step. Ultimately, the President must agree or be compelled to agree by an overwhelming congressional override of his veto to begin immediately the building and deploying of a national missile defense. 
   The construction of a meaningful defense will take time, obviously--time that, given North Korea's recent missile test--we may not have. I am among those who have become increasingly frustrated as the Clinton administration has squandered month after month, year after year, dithering and delaying, and otherwise reacting in ostrich-like fashion to the fast-approaching threat of missile attack by a rogue regime. 
   I have long regarded as beyond belief that the Clinton administration still refuses to commit to the immediate deployment of a national missile defense. I wonder, given the fact that North Korea now has a three-stage intercontinental ballistic missile capable of dropping anthrax on U.S. cities in Alaska and perhaps Hawaii, how much indifference could so dictate such a perilous do-nothing attitude by the President and his advisors. Nero fiddled as Rome burned--and the crowd in charge on Pennsylvania Avenue may wake up one morning and realize that they have been playing with the safety of the American people and playing fast and loose. 
   I trust I am very clear on this point: it is an absolute, irrefutable fact that a hostile tyrant today possesses missiles capable of exterminating American cities. 
   Mr. President, North Korea is not our only concern. The Islamic fundamentalists in Iran continue their crash missile program. The Rumsfeld Commission has warned that Iran has everything it needs to put together an ICBM within a few years. And because the Clinton administration has fooled around in its do-nothing mode for so long, Iran may very well be able to deploy an ICBM before America has a missile defense to counter it, even if the United States breaks ground on construction tomorrow morning. 
   Perhaps most troubling, however, is Communist China's nuclear missile program. China fields dozens of submarine-launched ballistic missiles, hundreds of warheads on heavy bombers, roughly 24 medium and long-range ballistic missiles, and has several crash modernization initiatives in progress this very moment. 
   Further, Red China has begun deploying several new types of ballistic missiles. And most troubling, it is now clear that China has stolen America's most sensitive nuclear secret--technical data for the W-88 warhead. Theft of that warhead design, coupled with the multiple-satellite dispenser that China developed working with United States satellite companies, will enable the PRC to deploy MIRVed weapons far sooner than expected. 
   In other words, China is on the verge of tripling or quadrupling, the number of warheads pointed at our cities, and this, Mr. President, is the same country that flexed its military might by firing missiles in the Strait of Taiwan in an effort to intimidate a longstanding and peaceful ally of the United States. The People's Republic of China--that is to say, Communist China--also is the same nation that engaged in a bit of nuclear blackmail by threatening a missile strike against Los Angeles. 
   Obviously, Mr. President, with these hostile threats emerging, it would be assumed that the United States would already have deployed a system to protect the American people against this danger; and it would be assumed that the Clinton administration surely is working, in cooperation with a bi-partisan majority in Congress, to make certain that the United States will never be exposed to a missile attack by a terrorist regime. 
   Well, such assumptions have been woefully wrong. The do-nothing Clinton administration has aggressively blocked every effort by Congress to implement a national missile defense system to protect the American people. More than 3 years have already been lost in deploying a missile defense system because of the President's veto, in December, 1995, of critical legislation designed to protect the American people. The President's people, in fact, are out there right now lobbying against the pending business of the Senate today, the National Missile Defense Act of 1999, of which I am a cosponsor. 
   Indeed, China, North Korea, and Iran can today hold the American people hostage to missile attack because of the do-nothing attitude of the President of the United States who, here in Washington, has consistently refused to build, or even consider building, the strategic missile defenses necessary to protect the American people from such an attack. 
   For years, liberals have tut-tutted that no long-range missile threat existed to necessitate a missile defense. But now, in the wake of the Rumsfeld Commission's report and North Korea's missile launch, even the most zealous arms control advocates have been forced to admit that their critical lapse of judgment and foresight has put our nation at heightened risk. 
   Though these people now admit the existence of a serious threat, just the  same, they cannot bring themselves to agree to the deployment of a shield against missile attack. Why, Mr. President? 
   I'll tell you why. It is because of an incredible and dumb devotion to an antiquated arms control theory. Critics of the National Missile Defense Act of 1999 claim that Henny Penny's sky will fall because even the most limited effort to defend the American people will scuttle strategic nuclear reductions. One Senator, for example, declared in a recent press release that, if S. 257 is passed, ``Russia would likely retain thousands of nuclear warheads it would otherwise eliminate under existing and planned arms reduction treaties.'' 
   Mr. President, if this is the last, best argument that can be mustered against deploying a national missile defense, opponents of the pending National Missile Defense Act of 1999 had better go back to the drawing board in search of logic. While they are at it, they should 
   ponder the fact that Russia has been threatening to block ratification of START II since almost the day it was signed. For more than 6 years, the United States has been waiting for the Russian Government to put this treaty into force; in the meantime the American people have been subjected to a barrage of Russian threats and demands for concessions on a bewildering array of issues, largely unrelated to the treaty.

   Mr. HELMS. The bottom line, Mr. President, is that it is prima facie ridiculous to still insist that the United States must forgo defending itself against missile attack in order to ensure that Russia ratifies START II. The United States has already paid a dozen ransom notes to Russia in an effort to secure START II's ratification--to no avail. This latest price demanded by Russia is simply too high. 
   Now, I believe that START II may still be in the United States' national security interests, but it is not of such overriding interest that we must forgo the defense of the American people in order to salvage START II. What will happen if START II is not ratified? Strategic forces are expensive to maintain, as both the United States and Russia have rediscovered. That is why the Clinton administration is seeking permission to fall below START I levels regardless of whether the Russians honor their START II obligations--because it wants the money that would be spent on strategic nuclear forces to be used for other, neglected requirements like readiness. 
   And what of Russia, Mr. President? The truth is that Russia's strategic force levels are going to plummet far past the levels mandated by START II regardless of whether there is any agreement in force. The strategic missiles Russia (then the Soviet Union) deployed in the 1980s are reaching the end of their useful life, and cannot be replaced. Russia has neither the money nor a reason, to replace them. 
   In fact, last year the Russian Minister of Defense told Russia's Security Council that even the new SS-27 Topol ICBM currently being deployed, Russia will be unable to field more than 1,500 warheads by the year 2010, which, at the rate things are going, might be about the time the Duma finally gets around to ratifying START II. 
   The truth is that arms control agreements are not controlling force levels. Fiscal and strategic realities are. Why is Russia allowing its forces to fall to historically low levels? I will tell you. For the same reason as is the United States. We no longer live in a cold war world in which huge nuclear arsenals are our top spending priority. The notion that limited ballistic missile defenses will somehow set off a new arms race--or forestall further reductions--is absurd. 
   Mr. President, the truth of the matter is that the arguments about START II are really a cover for those who continue to worship the arms control doctrine of mutually-assured destruction. No amount of policy sophistry or arms control rhetoric by the Clinton administration can alter the fact that the United States is vulnerable to nuclear-tipped missiles fielded by China, or any one else. Rectifying this dangerous deficiency requires leadership and action. It is an all the more pressing issue because the current course charted by the administration fails to recognize the inherent danger in China's pursuit of an advanced nuclear arsenal, based--as we have learned in recent days--around the W-88 warhead. 
   Mr. President, any further delay in the development by the United States of a flexible, cost-effective national missile defense is unconscionable. I am honored to cosponsor the National Missile Defense Act of 1999 and I urge Senators to support this legislation to make certain that the United States Government will finally adopt a policy to protect the American people from attack by ballistic missiles. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. HELMS. There are times, Mr. President, when every Senator, on one occasion or another, for one reason or another, feels the need to share with his colleagues a moment of grief or happiness or sadness or hope. 
   This being a time like that for me, Mr. President, my purpose is to share a few thoughts about a wonderfully gifted, beautiful, thoughtful lady named Hannah Covington McGee. 
   I suppose I should begin, Mr. President, by stating that Hannah married a young fellow named Jerry McGee 33 years ago. Dr. Jerry McGee today is president of Wingate University, a splendid Baptist institution in North Carolina. Jerry is the kind of friendly, caring and active husband and father with an enthusiasm for his responsibility as a top-flight educator--and his privilege of being Hannah's husband all those years. 
   Mr. President, Jerry and Hannah this past weekend were enjoying a six-week sabbatical at Tortola Island, one of the British Virgin Islands. Their stay on Tortola had been, both said last week, the happiest weeks of their lives. It all ended when Hannah was awakened Sunday morning suffering an excruciating numbness which quickly developed into the massive cerebral hemorrhage that claimed Hannah McGee's life at such an early age. 
   Hannah grew up in Rockingham in North Carolina. At age 14 she caught the eye of a star athlete at Richmond County Senior High School. She married that star athlete years later--- after both of them had finished college. They immediately began together devoting their lives to young people. 
   A mutual friend asked Jerry about Hannah. Jerry's response was that Hannah provided the kind of relationship that everyone dreams of; he confirmed that he had been in love with Hannah since his high school football days when she was that 14-year-old girl with the ponytail. 
   Mr. President, services for that beautiful, loving and caring Hannah will be held at the Wingate Baptist Church tomorrow very close to the campus of Wingate University. She will be remembered as one who was forever and tirelessly doing things for others and, as Jerry McGee put it, ``It never once occurred to her that anybody ought to do anything for her.'' 
   Mr. President, I certainly know nothing more than anyone else about the hereafter, or what will happen on that inevitable day for all of us. But I suspect that Saint Peter was standing at the Pearly Gate Sunday motioning for Hannah to come in and take her seat on the right hand of God who loves her just as all of us who know her do.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, now that we are back to doing the people's business, it may be of interest that despite the so-call budget surplus, the federal debt continues to increase by an average of $248 million a day. Some ``surplus''! 
   Congress and the Administration have been BUSILY creating new federal programs which in turn appear to absorb more taxpayer money than produce desired benefits for the American people. If we continue with this spend--spend--spend mentality, the American people's average portion of the federal debt will further escalate from its present sum of $20,650.78. 
   With these thoughts in mind, Mr. President, I begin where I left off in the 105th Congress: 
   At the close of business yesterday, Monday, February 22, 1999, the federal debt stood at $5,617,212,277,099.84 (Five trillion, six hundred seventeen billion, two hundred twelve million, two hundred seventy-seven thousand, ninety-nine dollars and eighty-four cents). 
   Five years ago, February 22, 1994, the federal debt stood at $4,540,132,000,000 (Four trillion, five hundred forty billion, one hundred thirty-two million). 
   Ten years ago, February 22, 1989, the federal debt stood at $2,722,208,000,000 (Two trillion, seven hundred twenty-two billion, two hundred eight million). 
   Fifteen years ago, February 22, 1984, the federal debt stood at $1,454,396,000,000 (One trillion, four hundred fifty-four billion, three hundred ninety-six million).  
   Twenty-five years ago, February 22, 1974, the federal debt stood at $467,489,000,000 (Four hundred sixty-seven billion, four hundred eighty-nine million) which reflects a debt increase of more than $5 trillion--$5,149,723,277,099.84 (Five trillion, one hundred forty-nine billion, seven hundred twenty-three million, two hundred seventy-seven thousand, ninety-nine dollars and eighty-four cents) during the past 25 years.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, one doesn't lose a friend like Wilmer Mizell without experiencing a deep and penetrating sadness. And, by the way, Mr. President, my reference to ``Wilmer'' just now is one of the few times I have ever called him that. Sure, that's the name on his birth certificate; he was officially identified as Wilmer for the very good reason that Wilmer is the name given him by his parents. 
   At least 95 percent of his thousands of friends knew him as ``Vinegar Bend'', or sometimes as just ``Vinegar''. And everybody who knew him loved him. (He was born in Vinegar Bend, Alabama, 68 years ago.) 
   Vinegar Bend died this past Sunday while visiting his wife's family in Texas. He suffered a severe heart attack some weeks ago, but had bounced back and was apparently feeling well until the fatal attack on Sunday. 
   Vinegar Bend Mizell served three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1969 through 1974. His first wife, Nancy, was exceedingly popular among Members of the House and Senate until her death several years ago. He and his second wife, Ruth Cox Mizell, were a devoted couple.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. Chief Justice, 26 years ago this past November, I was first elected to serve as a United States Senator from North Carolina. I had not believed it possible that I would be the first Republican directly elected to the U.S. Senate by the people of North Carolina. 
   I have often told many of the thousands of young people with whom I have visited during the past 26 years that one of three commitments I made to myself on that election night in November 1972 was that I would never fail to see a young person, or a group of young people, who want to see me. 
   That was one of the most meaningful decisions I ever made. I am told that I have met with something in the neighborhood of almost 70,000 young people according to our records for the past 26 years. 
   These are wonderful young Americans and I am persuaded that they are by all odds the most valuable treasure held by our country. 
   For the better part of the past year, these young people have almost without fail asked me about what they described as ``the problems'' of President Clinton. The vast majority of the time, the young people have talked about the moral and spiritual principles so deeply etched in the hearts of those patriots whom we today call our Founding Fathers--or the Framers of our Constitution--or both--when America was created. 
   So, in the first few weeks of this New Year 1999, I have begun my remarks to the young visitors with the recitation  of two statements that I sincerely believe have much to do with whether (and how) this blessed nation can and will survive. 
   The first statement: ``A President cannot faithfully execute the laws if he himself is breaking them.'' 
   The second statement: ``The foundations of this country were not laid by politicians running for something--but by statesmen standing for something.'' 
   The first statement was voiced by a former distinguished Democratic U.S. Attorney General of the United States, The Honorable Griffin Bell. 
   The second was sent to me at Christmas time by a friend whose name and voice I suspect is familiar to most if not all Senators, my dear friend, George Beverly Shea, who for so many years has thrilled and inspired millions as he stood beside Billy Graham and, singing with that remarkably deep voice ``*.*.* How great Thou art. 
   Our trouble today is that the American people every day, must choose between what is popular and what is right. There is a constant deluge of public opinion polls telling us which way to go, almost without fail showing the popular way. 
   But I must put it to you that we will, at our own peril, look to opinion polls to decide how we vote, when the real need is to look to our hearts, to our consciences and to our soul. So many decisions are made in the Senate--be it on the fate of treaties, or legislation, or even presidents--decisions having implications, not merely for today, but for generations to come, reminding that if we don't stand for something, the very foundations of our Republic will crumble. 
   Perjury and obstruction of justice are serious charges, as nobody knows better than you, Mr. Chief Justice, charges that have been proved during the course of this trial. Therefore, the outcome of this trial may determine whether America is becoming a fundamentally unprincipled nation, bereft of the mandates by the Creator who blessed America 210 years ago with more abundance, more freedom than any other nation in history has ever known. 
   There is certainly evidence fearfully suggesting that the Senate may this week fail to convict the President of charges of which he is obviously guilty. What else can be made of the behavior of many in the news media whose eyes are constantly on ratings instead of the survival of America? 
   This trial has been dramatized as if it were a Hollywood movie trivializing what should be respected as our solemn duty. 
   The new media technology is creating an explosion of media outlets and 24-hour news channels--and a brand new set of challenges. 
   A friend back home called me after an impressive presentation by one of the House managers and said, ``You know, Jesse, I found ASA HUTCHINSON persuasive. But I had to tune into CNN to see whether it was effective--because I knew without the media's immediate stamp of approval, it wouldn't make a damn bit of difference.'' 
   He had a valid point. Mr. Chief Justice, the awesome power of the media with its instant analysis is frightening. A political event occurs. The TV commentators immediately offer their lofty opinions; overnight surveys are taken and many politicians are all too often cowed into submission by poll results. 
   In these proceedings, the House Managers of course provided a forest of evidence clearly indicating that the President of the United States perjured himself before a federal grand jury and obstructed justice. The imaginative White House attorneys of course chopped down a few trees here and there--and then proclaimed that the whole forest had burned down. The press gallery bought that whole concept. 
   Some years ago, there was a western movie starring Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne called ``The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.'' Jimmy Stewart portrayed a tender-footed young lawyer who ran afoul of the local outlaw, Liberty Valance. 
   Through a twist of fate, the character played by Jimmy Stewart received credit for ridding the county of the outlaw, even though it was John Wayne's gun that brought Liberty Valance down. Yet it was Stewart who rode public acclaim into a political career in the United States Senate, while Wayne's character faded into obscurity. 
   Late in life, Stewart's character, still a Senator, returned from Washington to attend John Wayne's funeral. Stewart felt guilty, of course, that the truth of Wayne's heroism remained untold. He related the entire story to the local newspaper, only to find the editor totally disinterested. 
   ``When the legend becomes fact,'' the editor said, ``print the legend.'' 
   With its vote on Articles of Impeachment, the United States Senate is preparing to add to the legend of this whole sordid episode, Mr. Chief Justice. We have the facts before us and we should heed those facts because truth must become the legend. 
   We must not permit a lie to become the truth. 
   A couple of weeks ago, a Falls Church Episcopal minister, the Reverend John Yates delivered a remarkable sermon to his parishioners. The Reverend Dr. Yates had this to say about lying--and liars:  
   .....if a person will lie, and develops 
   a pattern of lying as a way of life, 
   that person will do anything. Someone 
   who becomes good at lying loses his 
   fear of being discovered and will move 
   on to any number of evil actions. He 
   becomes arrogant and self-assured. 
   He comes to believe he is above the 
   law. You should fear people like this. 
   If such a person is caught red-handed 
   in a lie and confronted with the evidence, 
   that sort of man or woman will be 
   forced to admit it, but he won't like 
   it. It will make him angry and vengeful. 
   He will do all he can to move and leave 
   it behind. It's what the Bible calls 
   evidence of a seared conscience, not a 
   sensitive conscience, but a seared 
   conscience.''  
   If we allow the lies of the President of the United States of America to stand, Mr. Chief Justice, then I genuinely fear for America's survival. 
   Shortly before his death, Senator Hubert Humphrey visited this chamber for the last time. He knew it was the last time; we knew it was the last time. Hubert's frail body was wracked with cancer, his steps were halting, his voice feeble. But as he walked down the aisle, Hubert saw me standing at my desk over there. He walked over to me, arms outstretched. Tears welled up in my eyes as Hubert hugged me softly saying, ``I love you''. 
   I loved Hubert Humphrey too, Mr. Chief Justice, and I told him so. 
   Hubert and I disagreed on almost all policy matters, large and small. Often Hubert got the better of me in debates, a few times I did it to him. But I loved Hubert Humphrey because we agreed on so much more--duty, honor, patriotism, faith and justice, the very essence of America. 
   But we are obliged to ponder: What is the essence of America now? Public life once was about honest debate on the merits, but it is now often a debate on the merits of honesty. And it was the President of the United States who brought us where we are today. 
   In November of 1955, a young editor named William F. Buckley undertook an ambitious mission, now completed. Bill had decided to start a conservative journal of ideas that would fuel an entire political movement. 
   In his ``Publisher's statement'', printed in the very first edition of National Review, he declared that his magazine ``stands athwart history yelling `Stop!' '' 
   Mr. Chief Justice, I plead with Senators to look around and see what Bill Clinton's scandal has wrought. National debate is now a national joke. Children tell their parents and teachers that it's okay to lie, because the President does it. Our citizens tune out in droves, preferring the daily distractions of everyday life to an honest appraisal of the depths to which the Presidency of the United States has sunk. 
   If this is progress and if this is the path history is taking, the Senate does have an acceptable alternative: 
   We simply must summon our courage and yell, ``Stop tampering with the soul of America''.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, among the steady stream of foreign heads of state visiting the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, King Hussein was always given a special welcome. He was instinctively a friend possessing a unique combination of grace and good humor. I therefore view his death as a personal loss. 
   I recall one occasion when members of our committee were gathered around the large oval table enjoying the King's jovial good humor. Queen Noor was present on that occasion. As His Majesty traded comments with the senators around him, it occurred to me that Queen Noor had perhaps not been properly welcomed. So I asked the King if he could identify the most significant 20th century export to his country. He obviously pondered the question with uncertainty, so we identified the ``export''--Queen Noor. 
   He laughed heartily and replied: ``I'm not about to disagree with that!'' 
   This great man, great leader, and faithful friend of the United States presided over his country at a time fraught with peril, beset with almost constant threats both internal and external. Yet throughout his long reign he met the challenges of leadership with grace and courage. Without King Hussein, there would not today be even the limited peace the Middle East now enjoys. 
   He will be sorely missed, certainly by me. I wish godspeed to his son and successor, Abdullah bin Hussein.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator MOYNIHAN today in introducing a bill that would for the first time place in statute the government system for the classification of information. To date this has been accomplished solely through executive order. 
   The statute is based on the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission to Protect and Reduce Government Secrecy chaired by my colleague PAT MOYNIHAN, the senior senator from New York. The Secrecy Commission achieved a unified report of recommendations--a feat that should not be underrated, especially in Washington. The bill also makes changes based on recommendations by the Government Affairs Committee during its consideration of our legislation during the 105th Congress. 
   The bill recognizes that over-classification can actually weaken the protections of those secrets that truly are in our national interest. All the same I am obliged to begin with a reiteration of the obvious--that the protection of true national security information remains vital to the well-being and security of the United States. The end of the Cold War notwithstanding, the United States continues to face serious and long-term threats from a variety of fronts. While communist and anti-American regimes, such as North Korea, Cuba, Iran and Iraq, continue to wage a war against the United States, new threats have arisen as well. Indeed, there is even a growing trend of espionage conducted not by our enemies but by American allies. Such espionage is on the rise especially against U.S. economic secrets. 
   At first blush, a push to reduce government secrecy may seem at odds with these increasing threats. I am convinced it is not. The sheer volume of government ``secrets''--and their costs to the taxpayers and U.S. business--is staggering. In 1996 the taxpayers spent more than $5.2 billion to protect classified information. We know all too well from our own experiences that when everything is secret nothing is secret. 
   Secrecy all too often then becomes a political tool used by Executive Branch agencies to shield information which may be politically sensitive or policies which may be unpopular with the American people. Worse yet, information may be classified to hide from public view illegal or unethical activity. On numerous occasions, I, and other Members of Congress, have found the Executive Branch to be reluctant to share certain information, the nature of which is not truly a ``national secret,'' but which would potentially politically embarrassing to officials in the Executive Branch or which would make known an illegal or indefensible policy. 
   I have also found that one of the largest impediments to openness is the perverse incentives of the government bureaucracy itself in favor of classification, and the lack of accountability for those who do the actual classification. I strongly endorse the Commission's recommendation of adding individual accountability to the process by requiring a detailed justification of the decision to classify. 
   On the other hand, declassification decisions can be politicized. Limited resources for declassification are used to declassify information for political purposes. Only recently, in the case of documents relating to U.S. activities in Central and South America the Administration has made decisions to declassify documents at the request of certain interest groups. As a result the resources for routine declassification are being redirected to serve political ends. This bill would serve to eliminate politicized declassification decisions by requiring routine declassification and oversight by an independent board. 
   I would add a note of caution regarding declassification, however. In the course of the two years of its work, the Commission became very interested in the declassification of existing documents and materials. In a perfect world, if information remains relevant to true U.S. national interests it should remain classified indefinitely. Information that does not compromise U.S. interests and sources should be made public. We all realize, however, that this is a tremendously costly venture. In fact, the Commission was unable to come up with solid data on the true cost of declassification. 
   In this era when Congress has finally begun to grasp the essential need to reduce government spending and balance the budget, the issue of balancing costs and benefits is an essential one. The financial costs to the American taxpayers must be balanced against the necessity of the declassification. The real lesson to take from the work of this Commission is the need to redress for the future the problems of over classification and a systematic process for declassification, so that the costs and timeliness of declassification does not pose the same economic and regulatory burdens on future generations. At the same time, it may be too costly to declassify all of the countless classified documents now in existence. 
   I hope the 106th Congress will complete the work of the 105th Congress and bring government wide rationalization to the classification process. It is an area where tough Congressional oversight is long overdue.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have sent to the desk a slate of legislation that addresses a number of our Nation's most pressing social problems. I have introduced a great many of these bills in prior Congressional sessions and Senators who have been around for a while will find these proposals familiar. 
   Nonetheless, I shall devote a few minutes to explain the importance of these bills and why it is so crucial to address permissive social policies that are creating a moral and spiritual crisis in our country. 
   I am delighted, Mr. President, that our Nation's economy has grown and prospered for the last two years--helped along, not incidentally, by the responsible fiscal policies insisted upon by the Republican Congress. But the good news on the financial pages is too often overshadowed by utterly horrifying stories elsewhere, stories which detail a moral sickness at the heart of our culture, stories which chronicle the devaluation of human life in our society, symbolized by the tragic 1973 Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade. 
   The most notorious of these appalling stories was the episode involving a young New Jersey woman who in May of 1997 gave birth to an infant in a public bathroom stall during her senior prom. She then strangled her newborn baby boy, placed the body in a trash can, adjusted her makeup, and returned to the dance floor. 
   Mr. President, this chilling tale cries out that something is badly wrong in the culture that produced it. The American people were justifiably stunned by the furor surrounding this crime--and they are surely even more shocked to learn that this is not an isolated incident. 
   Consider this: In November of 1997, in Tucson, Arizona, a 15-year-old boy found a newborn in a 3-pound coffee can. After an investigation, police arrested the boy's sister, then 19 years of age. She had given birth to the baby and promptly drowned it in the toilet, covered its little head with a plastic ice cream wrapper, wrapped the body in a flannel shirt and hidden it. She said she had intended to bury it later. 
   Despite these largely uncontested facts, an Arizona jury--browbeaten into submission by a defense team suggesting that its client was in fact the victim of a strict Catholic upbringing-- returned a guilty verdict only on a charge of negligent homicide, the least severe conviction applicable. This woman, who had murdered her own baby, received a sentence of one year, and during her prison term, she will be released during daytime hours on a work furlough program. 
   This is the tip of the iceberg, Mr. President. National Public Radio recently reported that the bodies of about 250 newborns are callously discarded each year. In some of these cases the babies were stillborn, but in others, the newborns were murdered. 
   Lest anyone think I am exaggerating, pick up almost any newspaper in America, and a distressing story is likely to be found. For example:  
   The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, August 12, 1997: Teenage Mother Admits Slaying: Newborn was Found Dead in Gym Bag in Garage of Home 
   The Record, Northern New Jersey, December 24,1997: 12 Years for Mom Who Killed Baby: Newborn Tossed From Window 
   Associated Press, Atlantic City, New Jersey, July 14, 1997: Baby Born in Toilet Stall, Left in Atlantic City Bus Terminal 
   St. Petersburg Times, December 20, 1997: Girl Charged who Left Baby in Trash 
   Dallas Morning News, October 29, 1997: Teen Jailed in Baby's Death Hid Pregnancy, Parents say Newborn Boy Was Found Suffocated in Garbage Bag 
   Should we really be surprised, Mr. President, that a Nation that not only tolerates, but actively defends the practice of partial birth abortion would produce these gruesome headlines? And the extraordinary level of disrespect for human life to which America has fallen isn't limited to the horrible practice of neonaticide on the part of young mothers. It pervades every part of our society. 
   In Pennsylvania, two teenagers were stabbed during a showing of a so-called ``horror movie'' that itself featured two characters being brutally stabbed to death watching a horror film. In Oregon, much of the Nation watched in disbelief as news reports described the case of a young man who, after killing his parents, walked into a crowded school cafeteria and opened fire on his fellow students. 
   No one Act of Congress or court decision is solely responsible for these tragedies, of course. But can it be denied that the decline in moral values in American culture helped set the stage for these notorious crimes? The American people believe this is true. Last year, CBS and CNN/Time both conducted polls indicating more Americans believe that a lack of moral values was the most important problem facing the United States--more important than crime, more important than  taxes, more important than health care, more important than education. 
   Too often, however, the mainstream media doesn't seek to remedy our decaying culture; they actively celebrate it. Just last fall, the supposedly responsible news magazine ``60 Minutes'' elected to show the videotaped death of a man via Dr. Jack Kevorkian's so-called ``suicide machine''. In voice-over, Kevorkian was allowed to comment on the procedure--no, strike that, the murder--that the viewer was watching. All the while he defended his abhorrent belief in assisted suicide. And instead of responding with outrage, a portion of the American public rewarded the program with its highest ratings of the year. 
   Has America become so hard-hearted and callous, Mr. President? Or is it just responding to so-called cultural elitists who celebrate abortion, euthanasia, and promiscuity, 
   while with unrestrained zeal endeavor to destroy all traces of religion in American public life. 
   Too many politicians blithely suggest that government and morality are not and should not be related; too many producers in Hollywood claim that the filth that passes for entertainment does not corrupt our culture; and too many educators claim the academy does not have a place in addressing the difference between right and wrong. 
   Mr. President, they are the ones who are wrong. We fool ourselves and we fool the public if we suggest that there is no connection between the business we do in Congress and the state of public morality in our society. We are the caretakers of our own culture. And we must not shrink from the responsibility of passing laws that promote what is right and prevent what is wrong in our society. 
   We make judgements between right and wrong every day, Mr. President in every vote we cast and every action we take. And when we judge correctly, the positive results can be wonderfully encouraging. Consider this: On August 1, 1996, the Senate passed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act. It was subsequently enacted into law. This landmark legislation, commonly referred to as ``welfare reform'', injected the time-honored values of hard work and personal responsibility into our social welfare system. 
   Welfare reform has been successful beyond even its supporters' wildest expectations--and, in my view, has tangible indirect benefits as well. 
   The numbers are stunning: According to the Department of Health and Human Services, the percentage of Americans receiving welfare benefits has plunged from 5.5% in 1995 to 3.3% in 1998. In three short years--and aided by the polices of a number of creative, innovative Governors and state leaders--welfare reform almost halved the welfare rolls. 
   The success of welfare reform is not limited to the dramatic decline of the welfare recipients, though the numbers are impressive indeed. Putting people back to work has started to mend other social problems. The January/February 1999 edition of The American Enterprise reports the following good news: 
   The number of homicides has dropped from 11 Americans per 100,000 in 1990 to only 7 in 1998, with a noticeably steep decline in the curve since 1995. 
   Poverty among Black Americans has declined sharply, to a 30-year low of 27%. (U.S. Bureau of the Census) 
   Divorce rates in the last three years are dropping, while marriage rates over the same time period are inching upward. (U.S. National Center for Health Statistics) 
   I for one do not doubt that welfare reform is partially responsible for these encouraging statistics. 
   In short, Mr. President, good laws help make good societies. And that is the reason I continue to introduce bills in each and every Congress that limit the modern tragedy of abortion and its insidious effects; that allow for prayer in schools while taking steps to ease the scourge of drug use among our children; that protect the rights of federal employees to speak their minds about moral issues; and that make sure our civil rights laws treat Americans as individuals rather than faceless members of racial groups, religious groups, or of a certain gender.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the Unborn Children's Civil Rights Act has several goals. First, it puts the Senate on record as declaring that one, every abortion destroys deliberately the life of an unborn child; two, that the U.S. Constitution sanctions no right to abortion; and three, that Roe v. Wade was incorrectly decided. 
   Second, this legislation will prohibit Federal funding to pay for, or promote, abortion. Further, this legislation proposes to de-fund abortion permanently, thereby relieving Congress of annual legislative battles about abortion restrictions in appropriation bills. 
   Third, the Unborn Children's Civil Rights Act proposes to end indirect Federal funding for abortions by one, prohibiting discrimination, at all federally funded institutions, against citizens who as a matter of conscience object to abortion and two, curtailing attorney fees in abortion-related cases. 
   Fourth, this bill proposes that appeals to the Supreme Court be provided as a right if and when any lower Federal court declares restrictions on abortion unconstitutional, thus effectively assuring Supreme Court reconsideration of the abortion issue. 
   Mr. President, I believe this bill begins to remedy some of the damage done to America by the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade. I continue to believe that a majority of my colleagues will one day agree, and I will never give up doing everything in my power to protect the most vulnerable Americans of all: the unborn.

   Mr. HELMS. In 1989, our distinguished colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Gordon Humphrey, first called attention to the incredibly brutal practice of abortions performed solely because prospective parents prefer a child of a gender different from that of the baby in the mother's womb. 
   The Civil Rights of Infants Act makes sure nobody could ever act upon this unthinkable decision by specifically amending title 42 of the United States Code governing civil rights. Anyone who administers an abortion for the purpose of choosing the gender of the infant will be subject to the same laws which protects any other citizen who is a victim of discrimination. 
   Nobody--even the most radical feminists--can ignore the absurdity of denying a child the right to life simply because the parents happened to prefer a child of the opposite gender. I hope the 106th Congress will swiftly act to fulfill the desires of the American people, who rightfully believe it is immoral to destroy unborn babies simply because the parents demand a child of a different gender.

   Mr. HELMS. I am also pleased to intoduce the Federal Adoption Services Act of 1999. This bill proposes to amend title X of the Public Health Service Act to permit federally funded planning services to provide adoption services based on two factors: (1) the needs of the community in which the clinic is located, and (2), the ability of an individual clinic to provide such services. 
   Under this legislation, no woman will be threatened or cajoled into giving up her child for adoption. Family planning clinics will not be required to provide adoption services. Rather, this legislation will make it clear that Federal policy will allow, or even encourage adoption as a means of family planning. Women who use title X services, will be in a better position to make informed, compassionate judgments about the unborn children they are carrying. 
   With so many loving, caring parents available to care for unwanted children, the federal government should do everything it properly can to make sure that adoption is an alternative for expectant mothers. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this reasonable proposal.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the Voluntary School Prayer Protection Act will make sure that student-initiated prayer is treated the same as all other student-initiated free speech--which the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld as constitutionally protected so long as it is done in an appropriate time, place and manner such that it ``does not materially disrupt the school day.'' [Tinker v. Des Moines School District, 393 U.S. 503.] 
   Under this bill, school districts could not continue--in constitutional ignorance--enforcing blanket denials of students' rights to voluntary prayer and religious activity in the schools. For the first time, schools would be faced with real consequences for making uninformed and unconstitutional decisions prohibiting all voluntary prayer. The bill creates a complete system of checks and balances to make sure that school districts do not shortchange their students one way or the other. 
   This proposal, Mr. President, prevents public schools from prohibiting constitutionally protected voluntary student-initiated prayer. It does not mandate school prayer and suggestions to the contrary are simply in error. Nor does it require schools to write any particular prayer, or compel any student to participate in prayer. It does not prevent school districts from establishing appropriate time, place, and manner restrictions on voluntary prayer--the same kind of restrictions that are placed on other forms of speech in the schools. 
   What this proposal will do is prevent school districts from establishing official policies or procedures with the intent of prohibiting students from exercising their constitutionally protected right to lead, or participate in, voluntary prayer in school.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, government has no higher obligation than the protection of the most vulnerable among us--our children. Outside of their own home, there is no place that a child should feel more secure and protected than while at school. 
   That is why I joined with several other Senators last Congress in introducing the Safe Schools Act. This legislation directly confronts the issue of illegal drug use and juvenile violence by requiring schools that accept federal education funds to adopt a ``zero tolerance'' policy when a student is found in possession of illegal drugs at school. 
   The Safe Schools Act provides a logical and commonsense extension of 1994's Gun-Free Schools Act by conditioning receipt of federal education dollars on state adoption of a policy requiring the expulsion for not less than one year of any student who brings illegal drugs to school. 
   Anyone who questions the link between school violence and drugs should merely turn their attention to the results of a recent National Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education survey, or PRIDE survey as it is called, which found that: 
   Gun-toting students were twenty times more likely to use cocaine than those who didn't bring a gun to school; 
   Gang members were twelve times more likely to use cocaine than non-gang members; 
   And students who threatened others were six times more likely to be cocaine users than others. 
   These frightening statistics combined with students own reports that  drugs are the number one problem they face and that illegal drugs are readily available to students of all ages illustrate the need for immediate action. The Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) at Columbia University has documented that two-thirds (66%) of students report that they go to schools where students keep, use and sell drugs and that over half (51%) of high school students believe the drug problem is getting worse. In contrast, CASA has found that most principals see drugs ``virtually nowhere.'' 
   Mr. President, the Center for the Prevention of School Violence in North Carolina tracks the incidence of criminal acts on school property. For the last four years, ``possession of a controlled substance'' has been either the first or second most reported category of incident. It is past time that we restore an environment that is secure and conducive to the education of the vast majority of students who are eager to learn. Our students and teachers deserve nothing less.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am also pleased to introduce the Freedom of Speech Act, which makes sure that federal employees are not forced to check their moral beliefs at the door when they arrive at the federal workplace. 
   This bill attempts to make sure that President Clinton is not allowed to do by Executive Order what Congress has declined to enact in the past two Congressional sessions--namely, to treat homosexuals as a special class protected under various titles of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Last year, President Clinton signed such an Executive Order, and in so doing, infringed upon the Constitutional rights of Federal employees who wish to express their moral and spiritual objections to the homosexual lifestyle. 
   President Clinton has instructed Federal agencies and departments to implement a policy that treats homosexuals as a special class protected under various titles of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This necessarily prevents federal employees who have strong religious or moral objections to homosexuality from expressing those beliefs without running afoul of what amounts to a workplace speech code. Apparently, when the President's desire to write his belief system into federal workplace regulations conflicted with the First Amendment right to free speech, the Constitution lost. 
   Congress should jealously protect its Constitutional prerogative to make laws, and prevent the executive branch from creating special protections for homosexuals, particularly in a way that doesn't take into account the Constitutional right of freedom of speech enjoyed by all Federal employees. That is the purpose of the legislation I offer today. 
   Under this bill, no Federal funds could be used to enforce President Clinton's Executive Order #13807. Further, no Federal department or agency would be able to implement or enforce any policy creating a special class of individuals in Federal employment discrimination law. This bill will also prevent the Federal government from trampling the First Amendment rights of Federal employees to express their moral and spiritual values in the workplace. 
   Mr. President, for many years the homosexual community has engaged in a well-organized, concerted campaign to force Americans to accept, and even legitimize, an immoral lifestyle. This bill is designed to prevent President Clinton from advancing the homosexual agenda at the expense of both the proper legislative role and the free speech rights of Federal workers.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the last of these bills is entitled the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1999. Specifically, this legislation prevents Federal agencies, and the Federal courts, from interpreting Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to allow an employer to grant preferential treatment in employment to any group or individual on account of race. 
   This proposal prohibits the use of racial quotas once and for all. During the past several years, almost every member of the Senate--and the President of the United States--have proclaimed that they are opposed to quotas. This bill will give Senators an opportunity to reinforce their statements by voting in a roll call vote against quotas. 
   Mr. President, this legislation emphasizes that from here on out, employers must hire on a race neutral basis. They can reach out into the community to the disadvantaged and they can even have businesses with 80 percent or 90 percent minority workforces as long as the motivating factor in employment is not race. 
   This bill clarifies section 703(j) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to make it consistent with the intent of its authors, Hubert Humphrey and Everett Dirksen. Let me state it for the RECORD:  
   It shall be an unlawful employment practice for any entity that is an employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee subject to this title to grant preferential treatment to any individual or group with respect to selection for, discharge from, compensation for, or the terms, conditions, or privileges of, employment or union membership, on the basis of the race, color, religion, sex, or national origin of such individual or group, for any person, except as provided in subsection (e) or paragraph (2). 
   It shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an entity described in paragraph (1) to recruit individuals of an under-represented race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, to expand the applicant pool of the individuals seeking employment or union membership with the entity.  
   Specifically, this bill proposes to make part (j) of Section 703 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act consistent with subsections (a) and (d) of that section. It contains the identical language used in those section to make preferential treatment on the basis of race (that is, quotas) an unlawful employment practice. 
   Mr. President, I want to be clear that this legislation does not make outreach programs an unlawful employment practice. Under language suggested years ago by the distinguished Senator from Kansas, Bob Dole, a company can recruit and hire in the inner city, prefer people who are disadvantaged, create literacy programs, recruit in the schools, establish day care programs, and expand its labor pool in the poorest sections of the community. In other words, expansion of the employee pool is specifically provided for under this act. 
   Mr. President, this legislation is necessary because in the 33 years since the passage of the Civil Rights Act, the Federal Government and the courts have combined to corrupt the spirit of the Act as enumerated by both Hubert Humphrey and Everett Dirksen, who made clear that they were unalterably opposed to racial quotas. Yet in spite of the clear intent of Congress, businesses large and small must adhere to hiring quotas in order to keep the all-powerful federal government off their backs. This bill puts an end to that sort of nonsense once and for all.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I do not pretend that enaction of this legislation will solve all of the pathologies of modern society. But taken as a whole, they seek to turn the tide of the increasing apathy--and in some cases, outright hostility--toward moral and spiritual principles that have marked late twentieth-century social policy. 
   The Founding Fathers knew what would become of a society that ignores traditional morality. I have often quoted the parting words of advice our first President, George Washington, left his beloved new Nation. He reminded his fellow citizens:  
   Of all the dispensations and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute to patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness.  
   Mr. President, that distinguished world leader, Margaret Thatcher, highlighted for us the words of Washington's successor, John Adams, who said ``our Constitution was designed only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate for the government of any other.'' 
   Our Founding Fathers understood well the intricate relationship between freedom of responsibility. They knew that the blessings of liberty engendered certain obligations on the part of a free people--namely, that citizens conduct their actions in such a way that society can remain cohesive without excessive government intrusion. The American experiment would never have succeeded without the traditional moral and spiritual values of the American people--values that allow people to govern themselves, rather than be governed.

   Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, although the late Honorable Harold A. Shaub was not a citizen of my State, I regarded his friendship, and his interest in North Carolina, sufficient to qualify him to be declared an honorary Tar Heel. 
   He was a remarkable gentleman whom I met casually one morning when he was trying to find the office of then Senator Curtis of Nebraska. From that day on, he was a friend for whom I had great admiration. He visited occasionally when he was in Washington, and I enjoyed his company fairly often in the Senate Dining Room. Occasionally, Mrs. Shaub and one or more of his and Mrs. Shaub's children joined us. 
   Mr. President, there was not one iota of pretense in Harold Shaub's personality. Yet he was one of America's leading business men, perhaps most notably as president and chief executive officer of the Campbell Soup Co. 
   I never asked Harold for a special favor, nor did he of me. There was one occasion, a number of years ago, when North Carolina was one of the States seeking to acquire a Campbell Soup Co. plant. I had studied the data on each of the States competing against mine for the Campbell plant. I was convinced that North Carolina met Campbell Soup's needs better than did our competitors. So I called Harold, told him of my interest in the proposed plant, and asked if he would object to my sending to him the details of why I sincerely believed North Carolina should be chosen. 
   His response was that I should send the information as quickly as possible because the first decision deadline was near. I did--that very day. Within a week, he was on the telephone. He said, simply: ``I suspect you would be wise to make arrangements for some news about a new corporate citizen coming to North Carolina.''
